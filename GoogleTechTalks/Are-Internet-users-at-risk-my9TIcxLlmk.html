internet users at risk my name is Thomas
Stephen Dorff ER and I work as a
software engineer in Google Zurich so
today I will give a close look at vendor
patching performance and web browsers in
daily use because by judging who is
using which web browser version and how
fast the vendors are patching we can
give some estimate about the risk first
of all we will look at web porn threads
so what threats are there when you
browse to internet and why are there are
millions of web pages which attack their
visitors I will do so in two studies
first study now where was the co-author
is about understanding the web browser
threat so here we try to measure how
many Internet users surf the web without
the latest fully patched version and in
a second study I will talk about a
seared a patch metric which will help to
church on how good a job benders are
doing for patching and known
vulnerability and specifically i will
look at Microsoft and Apple so let's
start with web porn threats why are
there millions of web pages that attack
your visitors let's look at some
webpages like the web page of the
Department of Homeland Security the one
of United Nations the one of UK civil
service or phone chat vacations or even
a blind dating service such as how about
lunch let's eh or finally support
knowledgebase by Trent net what do all
those web pages have in common what they
have in common is very said i would say
because they all got hacked in april
2008 and they were not the only pages
that got hacked in april two thousand
eight there were another five hundred
and ten thousand web pages that also
tact with the very same attack vector
there was an ASP script that allowed to
inject data into a three cool database
by using a sequel injection attack and
if you look at those screenshots you can
see that alone on United Nations stood
auric if you search with google for the
exploit script that was inserted through
the attack you find 384 webpages
distinct web page is your United Nations
to torque that had apparently been
hacked or you can go do DHS gov as the
screen job screenshot at the right top
side here shows and in the address
directory there apparently somebody was
able to insert a script tag which would
subsequently download some malicious
code from some third-party website and
the same happened to the other pages I
mentioned so let's look at one specific
malicious web page that also go text
through a different exploit vector it
looks like a normal web page i blanked
some information that would lead to the
actual address because I don't want
people to go there just because of the
attack but when you look at this web
page it looks very normal to you there's
a navigation bar some information some
images nothing very suspicious however
at the end of this website website there
is an iframe injected which is invisible
what does this mean to the user it means
you cannot see it however the browser is
specifically if you use IE in version 6
for this page the browser will still
read the information from this iframe
even so it is hidden to the user and if
you look at the source of the iframe it
just apparently downloads something from
a third party website which most
probably the webmaster of the website
that you see on the left has no clue
about that this is actually happening
and from this third party website there
is some malicious code being downloaded
that will then subsequently attack the
user's browser so I went on this web
page with I 6 in
anh Tuen 11th 2008 and guess what
happened my babe browser got attacked by
this third party website and about a
dozen molar components about a dozen
malware components were actually
downloaded and installed on the computer
first of all a trojan which is actually
a dial-up program that reconfigured the
internet access good to go through a
dial-up phone line so if you happen to
have a modem then you would now have a
new number that would be much more
expensive than your other provider and
in addition the attacker actually can
log all your traffic furthermore it was
reported that this Trojan actually will
also sometimes redirect you to porn
sites bones you're surfing because they
can do some mangling with the DNS system
if you are dialed up through their own
systems however this wasn't enough so if
you don't have a modem this wouldn't be
of much concern however there were more
components installed like the Guru and
piqué piqué dash VP a component which
is a keylogger so a each and any
character you will type after having
visited this website and having been
infected would be locked and finally be
sent to some attacker somewhere in the
internet and there's even more Trojans
that were downloaded like the malware
downloader dash oh and the Guru dash
tips p k dash X X as they are called by
sofas and their Trojans for Windows and
they can download any arbitrary code on
your computer and run it so basically
this is an open door the attacker can
now control your computer by running an
arbitrary executable that he lets your
Trojan download and there are even more
situations another one the Trojan dash
agent hgw w which would call itself task
Monod XE and start with each start of
windows so you would actually never get
rid of it because each time you reboot
you will have it launched automatically
however this wasn't everything in total
was more than a dozen such malware
components that very
old and there's just a list of some more
that I found so just by going to this
single web page with I six and not
having all the security patches in place
will in fact your computer it more than
a dozen different components of Mulder
that's pretty much very soon but how of
why are people doing that why would
somebody want to infect a company
computer or a private computer and the
reason is very simple they can make
money with that because they can steal
information that they can sell in the
internet on the ground this is a list of
prices found in the internet on the
ground by symantec I was published in
april 2008 so for example if you get
hold on a bank account you can get
between ten dollars and a thousand
dollars for this information by selling
it to somebody on the internet on the
ground market or if you get hold on
credit card information including expiry
dates and CVC code you can sell it for
up to twenty dollars or even if you
steal a full identity like mothers
maiden names address phone number social
security number you can sell it between
one and fifteen dollars or if you just
steal an email password and somebody can
misuse an email account afterwards you
can get between four and thirty dollars
on the black market that's quite
surprising so stating a single password
can give the attacker up to thirty bucks
and apparently this is why it's
worthwhile for them to pursue those
attacks and download trojans on other
people's computers however there's a
second thing that many web browsers are
not really aware of so looking at this
website here which is an interesting
forum about cats people can post their
comments what they have concerns about
with their kids for example and post
their images of the cute little cats
that they have it's very much
user-driven this this website however
looking at how much control the
webmaster actually has it has to be said
that he is very little control over
what's actually showing up on his
website because he uses third-party
content that's illustrate this a little
bit so here we have an advertisement
which normally means that
this advertisement comes from some
third-party web server now if nobody
does screening of the security of
possible security breaches in the ad
then this could lead to an exploit of
the users browser so you better choose a
trusted partner for example Google
Adsense will screen each and any content
upload it to us which will be which will
then later on be shown to a user through
the advertisement system so anything
that an edit Iser wants to show will
first be pre-screened however there are
other systems where some advertisement
companies or agencies can directly put
in their content and serve it directly
to the user without it being screened
through some third party system or
through the ad system and this can be
very dangerous if the security is not
guaranteed and one only one of them
might not be trustworthy of the partners
furthermore there's user contributed
content like 40 messages in text or
images and in any of those a malicious
user which is not really interested in
cats but more about exploiting the users
of this forum could potentially inject
some malware code which would then
execute on the user side so it's very
important for the webmaster of the site
to actually Senate eyes all the user
input and make also sure it's properly
encoded before it's actually put into
the website and distribute to other
users and finally there's many widgets
like a visitor counter where websites
pulling Straubel scripts dynamically
from third-party websites they then get
executed in the user context inside of
the browser and then we'll show some
nice imagery for example as here the
number of user visitors that came to
this page before now at any one day it
could be because you pull the script
from some third-party server that may be
the script is modified and just a little
more than just page counting or visitor
counter and it could happen that for
example it also in addition to show you
this nice image it will carry some
exploit code and attack the user this
has happened with some strip that we've
traced
so in this case you better make sure
that you actually get a license for this
code to check to run it from your own
server and make sure you check it for
security breaches before you put it on
your server because if you always pull
it in dynamically which basically means
the user downloads it from the third
party website you have no control as a
webmaster over whether the content of
the widget will be the same as you have
seen before so these are just three
examples of third-party content in
website if any of those turn malicious
then the user of the website will be
attacked and it's very specially in a
sense that the webmaster doesn't really
notice because these companies
downloaded only to the user and not
actually the web server of the webmaster
so he must really have a trust
relationship with all those sources very
pulsing additional strips and
information into his website or rather
channel it through his own server so
Google is tracking malicious urls by
crawling the web and once we find
malicious URL we will put it in our in
our database and later on barn the user
that we know of some websites that they
are actually carrying malicious code and
we've been doing this for more than a
year and we have about three million web
URLs that we know that if you go there
with an old version specifically like I
six and it all the patches installed
that you can easily be awake time of a
drive-by download what is it drive-by
download basically when you go and visit
the website it's something that happens
in the background without any noticeable
warning to the user and it installs some
software while you're visiting the page
you don't need to click anything you
just need to type the URL or visit the
website and then in the background you
will get some malware installed and once
we know that the URL is malicious or
even know if all the main ish malicious
because there's many such URLs on it we
will put up a warning in the search
results page so if you search for some
specific keywords or even for URLs you
might find the warning
this URL may harm your computer or in
terminus in the screens out this a
website they can be on computer Bashar
digan which means the same and of course
if you click on that it will get another
page of warnings from google telling you
you better don't go there because we do
know you can get infected we don't lock
it we don't take it out from our index
because you don't want to censor however
we still want to warn the user that
there might be something really bad
happening on this page it's quite very
some even though you say it's remailing
URLs might not be too much if you have
billions of web pages out there it's
quite very some to see the exposure of
such malicious urls for the users of the
google search engine if you look at the
google search queries in january 2008 we
find that for one to three percent of
all search queries that we're done in
january 2008 there was at least one
malicious URL in the search results so
this means there is quite a large
exposure even though it is a small
amount and small amount of websites that
are malicious they apparently seem to
get indexed they seem to be on web pages
where people find relevant information
so that's why they are in the search
results and if it's one two three
percent of all search queries that
results to have at least one malicious
URL there is quite a high chance of
people actually navigating to those
pages that's why we need those warnings
some people say I will never get exposed
to such malicious websites because I'm a
safe server I will never go to for
example websites that contain adult
content so this was may be true five
years ago there may be adult content
websites were more exposed to malicious
activity than others however it is no
longer true today so what you see here
is some histogram that tells of all
those three million malicious urls that
Google knows about which content
category today belong into as a basic
lost a fraction of suspicious or Mulder
URLs within each content category out
there
and while you see on the very left that
ll content is maybe twice as exposed so
they're twice as many pages that are
either suspicious or have malware on
them he also find such malicious
websites in the content category of
Finance of games industries online
communities business entertainment
computers telecommunication even real
estate society shopping automotive or
animals webpages do actually be
malicious and it is pretty bad if they
are malicious because you wouldn't
expect that basically any website copy
malaysia's because months you have this
feeling that the web page looks like
trust versi nowadays does no longer mean
that it is for sure not infected so just
claiming it you're safe surfer by not
going to adult content websites this is
a really bad strategy today so you
better actually make sure you have the
latest version of the browser and all
security measures in place so let's look
at a study understanding the web browser
threat so we need to study over 18
months and we looked at anonymized
google data to find out how many
internet users surf the web without the
latest fully patched browser version so
this is joint work with stefan frei from
eth zurich and cool the allman from IBM
security systems in USA and also martin
made from e th and the paper can be
found that TechSoup met / insecurity
dash iceberg so first of all we wanted
to know which web browsers or in daily
use so if you look at all the one dot
408 billion Internet users worldwide
according to internet world statistics
there's founded four billion Internet
users what's the fraction of them using
which browser and there were about 40
wounded one percent using internet
explorer 7 another 37 dot two percent
use also internet explorer but not in
the latest version I seven I say the
latest version I
seven because I it is not yet publicly
out there only in beta and then there is
sixty not one percent Firefox users and
three to four percent safari users
another 0.8% opera users and finally one
load for press and others which can for
example be user agents of mobile phones
or other not so well-known browsers so
basically the take home message from
this slide is that most people use
Internet Explorer either is I seven or
another version of I then there is sixty
percent of Firefox users so we need to
be aware of those users in the first
place and find out are they having have
they updated the latest version or not
so we will specifically locate built in
browsers code basically a vulnerability
is built into the main browser code
which means we don't really look at
plugins plugins these additional code
that is brought into execution through
the through the browser however we don't
really regard them in the study we just
looked at the main core browser without
any plugins and wanted to know is the
browser code vulnerable because there
are known vulnerability leaks in it that
might not be fixing the version that
users are using as I said there are more
possibilities for vulnerabilities like
in the plugins like flesh travel or
QuickTime and several demigods reported
but this would be the topic of a
different story so if the vendor learns
about the vulnerability of course he's
interested in fixing it and this is also
the case for the main browser version of
course now you ask yourself moster
anything interesting that was found as a
security vulnerability in the browsers
and of course there was so we look at 18
months of data from january first 2007
to tune second 2008 and secunia has a
long list of ulnar abilities that got
reported for specific browser versions
so it just look at the latest major
version here
and for I 70 decks in this 18 months the
very several vulnerabilities reported
two of which they are extremely critical
in the rating by secunia another eight
of them were highly critical and this
was about thirty six percent of all
reported vulnerabilities for I 72 X so
this basically means that if any of
those either extremely critical or
highly critical vulnerabilities are
still in your browser while you go to
website it's pretty easy for the website
if it's modified to attack you because
most of those vulnerabilities actually
are exploitable from remote furthermore
for Firefox to dot 0 dot X the word 9
extremely critical at orrick 9 highly
critical vulnerabilities reported there
were no extremely critical about wheels
reported for firefox 2 dot 0 dot x
however if you have nine high critical
vulnerabilities it still means that you
can get exploited from remote in most
cases because as I said virtually a very
large fraction normally more than eighty
percent of them were actually remotely
exploitable for Safari Street of X there
were just two highly critical
vulnerabilities reported because
apparently there's not so much that it
gets reported for Safari doesn't mean
that as a forest more secure it just
means that less vulnerabilities were
discovered and reported and there is 0 /
09 decks and there in the last 18 months
of our study there were seven highly
critical vulnerabilities reported now
this is just how much God reported so
how much could fix up that and you see
these statistics in the table at the
bottom of this slide for Indians 47 @ x
the very still like six vulnerabilities
open which were in a category three of
them not critical and other three of
them less critical for firefox 2 dot 0
dot x the birds were two vulnerabilities
still open not patched in the category
not critical and for safaris real
attacks on soon second there was still
one last critical
to open there is for Oprah nine at exit
seems to really fix everything there was
no single vulnerability still open on
jun 2nd 2008 so how do we do this study
to find out about who is using which
browser version and the way we did that
was by looking at the HTTP user agent
header field and so this is a text
string that gets sent by a web browser
to any website that the web browser is
about to visit so when web browser goes
to google com it will send us the string
identifying himself to be a specific
browser type and also getting the
version of the browser including also
the operating system and other
information so this is send each time to
any side note just to Google so any
webmaster can basically collect this
information in the web logs so we did so
over 18 months from january first 2007
to tune second 2008 and if you can see
for user agent firefox for example you
get the full version string so here you
see it's 2 dot 0 dot 0 dot 14 so this
includes also the minor version this is
very helpful because this gives us the
full patch level of firefox for internet
explorer here is he this is in microsoft
in explorer 7 dot 0 that was requesting
the page however you don't really see
any minor version number or any patch
level so this is because Microsoft
decided not to report this in the user
agent string so with Microsoft ie we
just know which which of the browsers
are in which major version so we need
some additional information to find out
about who is the latest patch level okay
so what you have to do furthermore to
make our study give these results to
count who is using not the latest
version so we looked at each day so we
always took one day of data and we
needed to make sure that we don't double
count if the same browser comes again
and again on the same website that
belongs to google where we got the data
from
so we looked at the Preferences cookie
and if the same preference is cookie
would come again we just say oh we've
seen this before so we only count the
very first visit so this is necessary
because otherwise heavily active users
with which would come again and again
would have a much heavier rate in
statistics I mean just wanted to know
the number of unique installations and
how the fractions of different browser
versions within the unique installations
would look like furthermore we only
looked at weekdays because we found that
on the week ends the statistics differ
apparently business user have some
different preferences over browser types
and browser versions then home users
have on the weekends so we just restrict
ourselves to weekdays and our focus
again was on on the dynamics of major
and minor version numbers of the actual
browser so we didn't look at plugins
here and finally we say the latest
browser is also the most secure browser
because first of all the more recent
browsers have most known vulnerabilities
fixed so this is certainly true that if
the vendor learns that he will actually
fix it and issue a new version which
normally increases the version number on
the other side later major versions of
the browser typically have additional
security features which older major
versions like so this gives increased
security for the user as well even
though it was not the security hole it's
more like an extended security feature
that is now present so if you have the
latest version you actually can use that
there is some controversy whether ie7
index 47 is the most secure internet
explorer or whether older versions like
I five and I six or at least as the QRS
I seven because they are still supported
by microsoft which means that they will
still bug fix them let's maybe speaks ND
heart Meyer a Microsoft professional who
said in 2008 there are dangers that
simply didn't exist back in 2001 when
internet explorer 6 was released the
world internet explorer 7 make surfing
the web fundamentally saver
by offering greater protection against
viruses spyware and other online risks
so he's asked because there are
additional features and protection
against viruses and spyware and online
risk it's more in hearing to savor so
what are those new features ie7 has new
security features like the phishing
filter which will make the dress or red
if IE knows that this website is used
for fishing so this immediately alerts
the user montego's this website so he
will be less incentive to actually click
on it because the browser tells him or
maybe enter personal information because
the browser tells them that there might
be some danger with this website and
then in addition they have extended
certificate validation which will also
be visible to the user such that if
their certificate of the website is not
like of a high security standard then
the user will be informed and finally
they have an opt-in for atoms which
means that active X plugins will not
just be enabled but the user has
specifically choose so which makes it
inherently more secure so if you are
still a user of i-5 or i6 you will be
lacking those features which means you
don't have the full security that you
could have if you use the latest version
of ie which is I seven at the time of
the study so now looking at our
measurement data are what do we find
about the use of major versions
specifically about the fraction of users
within each browser family that we're
using the latest major version so
looking at five walks to which was too
late this two major version at the time
of the study firefox three came out just
two weeks after their study ended so
firefox to you can see of all the
firefox users more than forty percent
we're using firefox major version two at
the beginning of the study in january
2005 and seven and this was increasing
rapidly so people are migrating for
firefox one or 115 up to five bucks to
rather rapidly as you can see
specifically at the end of the support
for 505 you see some chump of people
that were just now actually finally
going up to Firefox too because the new
they would no longer get the security
updates and then when the first security
vulnerability was found in Firefox to
and actually also fixed the patch
happened on July Seventeen's there was
no pet offer for firefox four not five
because it was end of life and of
support and there are many people
actually jump to just actually choose to
use Firefox version 2 and abandon their
old installations of 505 as you can see
and it reached a quite high level of
users migrated the latest version for
the mature version then for i7 you used
to see there's a data migration to i7 so
users update or upgrade I'm out saying
from older versions to ie7 however it's
a priest slow process there's like no
big jumps it's just very steadily
increasing and users migrated to i7 and
for Oprah 9 because it was already out
there for some longer time you see a
pretty high fraction of users also that
actually have migrated to Oprah 9 now
it's more than as you see more than
eighty percent that had Oprah 9 or the
observation period and then finally air
safari 3 almost nobody used forestry the
beginning of the study and then when Mac
I was Tiger 10 those four to 10 came out
on jun 20 s 2007 there was a big jump of
users that we're now using far as safari
in version 3 because it came out
basically bundled with your brain system
and there's another rather big jump when
Mac OS leopar 10 with 5 20 came out in
October 16 so in 2007 because then the
forestry got out of bed oh and it was
also included with mega was tiger ah
November 14 days I have seen another big
big increase of users of Safari 3 so
apparently bundling the browser
with the new release of an operating
system makes many people jump to the
newer major versions as you see here now
we can look at each of these browsers
and look find out like what was the
maximum share at we have seen of users
using the latest major version so why do
we look at the maximum because you want
to know like buddhist exposure of users
and this is like a very careful estimate
so if you look at the maximum of users
that were secure we can give some some
balance to our problem so here for in
explorer we found that only 52 the five
percent of all internet explorer users
we're actually ever using ie7 over those
18 months well they were never more than
52 the five percent that were using I
seven on any single day of our study
which was a birthday and for Firefox
there were surprising ninety two dot two
percent or Firefox users which were
using Firefox too so it seems like
almost everybody has updated to the
latest major version in this 18 months
and for the 43 that we're about seventy
two percent that I've upgraded to Safari
three from other versions this is still
again the maximum but as you've seen
from the curve it's towards the end of
our observation period for all of the
the browser's where we have seen the
maximum so the end of our observation
period was as you can see in the end of
tune 2008 began so it became of two in
2008 and for opera a 90 that one percent
have actually upgraded to opera 9 which
is a pretty nice result so if you get
nine out of 10 users to use the latest
major version I think people that use
the browser really are aware that the
latest major version is the best version
that they can get now we want to get the
go one step further and find out who is
using actually the latest major version
including all the minor version patches
or all the security patches as we can
say so this means that
fraction of users you see here will of
course decrease because some of them
don't have all the security patches
installed and this is what we found so
it jumps down a little for internet
explorer from the 52 that five percent
ie seven major version user this comes
down over to 47 at six percent of all I
users that actually not only use the
latest version i7 but also have all the
security updates installed now as I said
before from the user agent string we
didn't see the minor versions so how can
we be confident that this percentage is
now accurate that we give for those that
have all the latest security patches
installed so the way we did that was we
looked at numbers from secunia PSI their
personal software inspector which is a
tool for windows which is used by
several hundred thousand users that
report which of the users that use this
tool actually has which version and
whether the version is secure or not
secure means the latest version with all
the patches and so we look at this data
and they also have the same data for
Firefox and Safari and opera where we
had the full version information so we
could compare the security numbers
against ours and we found that because
secure users they have to actively
install this program and activists can
for vulnerabilities there might be more
security aware there's some bias in the
population of those using it we found
that comparing to our numbers which of
course looks at the average user we have
about twice as as high a fraction of
users that were not patched compared to
the secunia numbers and so we could
watch a story we could just a scale this
up for IE to make sure that we have the
same as scaling or security for users
that don't have all the security patches
installed so this brought us from 52
that five percent of all I I users that
use I seven down to 47 dot six percent
of all I users that I have not just I
seven but also all security patches now
for Firefox easy jumps down from 92 to
2% that have five
to 283 to three percent that have
firefox too and all the security patches
installed and then for Safari it jumps
down from 70 to 2% the types of 43 to 65
to three percent which have safari three
including all the security patches and
very interestingly for opera users we
have seen 91% Oprah 9 users so the most
most upper users actually use the latest
version in pas de maître version of
opera however it jumps down to 56 to the
one percent of opera users that have not
just the latest version number in the
major version Oprah night but also all
the security patches installed which you
can see from the minor versions so
apparently people just update once the
next major version 10 stick with the
version they downloaded and they don't
do any more updates of the minor
versions and that's quite very some so
apparently people believe they are
secure because they have updated the
late latest major version of opera which
some people say is a very secure browser
that's why they may think that they only
have to update the major versions
however looking at the statistics oh and
the report for the releases we see that
Oprah was mostly fixing vulnerabilities
regarding security in a minor versions
which is very unfortunate if you don't
update them to the next minor version
and it's also depends of course on how
the updates are applied so for internet
explorer the updates are applied through
the operating system through the update
mechanism of the operating system so
this happens once a month so if there is
anything found regarding a security
vulnerability the attacker will have
about 30 days at least until there's a
next patch coming out and being
distributed through the microsoft
updates however this also makes sure
because the update stone through the
operating system if somebody gets
operating system updates he also gets
updated that in this for a browser for
Firefox each time you start a browser or
also in regular intervals the browser
will check whether there is a new
version on the servers and then show
your message and with a single click you
can install
all the update that's a very simple
process and because it's checked so
often basically several times a day you
will actually be sure that as soon as
there's a new bug fix out there that
fixes a security vulnerability you will
get notified and you can get the latest
version so this seems to be very very
effective for Safari it's done to the
Apple operating system updater also
there you can basically pick and choose
your own schedule and then alongside
with updating the operating system also
the browser will get updated apparently
not everybody has enabled that and
finally for opera it also checks when
you are start the browser whether
there's a new version and then you will
get the pop-up dialog basically asking
you to visit the website download the
browser install it yourself and
everything so there's more than about
the five clicks that you need at least
maybe even eight I haven't counted them
well it's a much more tedious process
because you need to go to the website
yourself downloaded yourself launched
downloaded executable yourself and then
finally replace the old version with the
new one where is your Firefox it's just
one click and everything is done
automatically there's no like
downloading find a file again and
launching it it's much more simple so
maybe opera should switch over to using
the Firefox optic mechanism which is
just a single click to get more people
to update the latest minor version so
summarizing the results of the study we
found that basically we can measure the
tip of the iceberg where we have
internet users that use insecure
versions or I would call them rather
than not the latest most secure version
of the browsers and we found about five
million opera users that don't use the
latest major version and all the
security patch is applied and we find
another 17 millions of our users which
don't use the latest most secure browser
and another 38 million Firefox users
which don't use the latest most secure
browser and we also found a big chunk of
internet if poorer users there were
about five hundred and seventy seven
million Internet users which don't use
the latest most secure browser however
it is just the tip of the iceberg of in
turn
users that are at risk due to not
updating to the most secure web browser
hidden below the surface which we don't
see if this iceberg are those that use
plugins that are having a security
vulnerability because didn't measure
that we can't give an estimate here so
summing up all those numbers we found
that 630 7 million Internet users or
about forty five to two percent of all
internet users worldwide they surf the
web without the latest most secure
browser version that's a very large
number six hundred thirty-seven million
users or forty five to two percent of
Internet users I don't use the latest
version and they are potentially at risk
of getting attacked by malicious
websites so if you happen to use a
browser which is not the latest version
you might want to consider updating so
just again our study what do we do so
basically looked at the global share of
browsers in percent so how many people
are using high seven how many were using
Firefox Safari and opera and then we
found out the total usage number
worldwide by looking at how many uses
there are so we just first had the
relative shares of which fraction of
user is using using which browser and by
knowing that there's this one load 408
billion Internet users worldwide we
could scale this up to the whole
internet and given that our data source
which were google web sites like google
search in other state google has we have
a very interesting abroad user base we
can easily scale this up because we have
seen a very large fraction of internet
users already in our data and then we
found out by looking at the user agent
string what's the fraction of those
browser users said don't use the most
secure version so you see the numbers
here so looking at those numbers we
found that in total 45 to two percent of
all internet users were not using the
latest most secure version or as i said
before six hundred and thirty-seven
million internet users were not
using the most secure and latest browser
version we polish this report and we got
a lot of media coverage in Europe this
is most in German those references here
so we were in all major newspapers i
would say we're even the radio and we
also got covered in u.s. like in the
register on slashdot pcworld about that
calm setting at sea cnet news USA Today
to take her all security forum a
security focus Washington Post and
technical or also on on Shania blog
about security where he referenced our
paper as an excellent paper because it
actually measures the insecurity in the
population of the users of the internet
in a very passive way so it's not
intrusive and it gives some interest
numbers because it is looking at a very
large fraction of users so after we have
released the study we got of course many
many excuses are for those six hundred
and thirty-seven million users that
don't use the latest no sticker version
so what did they say why they don't
update the latest most secure version
some home users wrote like I have
nothing on my system that one could
possibly steal who would ever attack me
so apparently were not aware that them
might be using credit cards or even just
email passwords that other users would
like to steal and sell on the internet
on the ground so you don't need to be a
bank to be attractive to get attacked
nowadays other said I only serve to save
websites never too XXX sides and as
you've seen before malicious websites
that is tribute over a large range of
content categories not just to idle
content and another one said I use
Windows 98 and i-5 no hacker cares about
such old systems while maybe nobody
really cares about updating old systems
I wouldn't say that hackers don't really
care about those systems because they're
much better known a lot easier to
exploit than your systems
and the other one said I don't want to
upgrade the next major version of the
browser as I don't want to learn a new
user interface that's a very good point
so especially with i7 or I ate some
people hated it to update because the
user user interfaces so different from
older versions which means the user has
to learn again how to use the browser
and it's very unfortunate that here the
user interface update is coupled with
the security update from corporate users
we heard like statements her statements
like this we can't upgrade because of
our internet applications because they
are incompatible with internet explorer
7 so they need to stick with I six right
five just because their intranet as an
old application that's extremely
unfortunate looking at the risk that you
get infected if you use the same old
browsers on the actual internet so maybe
in this place would be very good thing
to either use two different browsers one
for internet and one for the internet or
instead maybe upgrade to Internet
application such that it can also work
with the newer browsers another one said
I can't upgrade to the latest in
whisperer seven because I use Windows
2000 and it's not supported by x IE 7
that's pretty unfortunate so for
actually having IE 7 installed you need
Windows XP with service packs and if you
don't have that you will actually never
be able to install it so this kind of
forces you to also upgrade the operating
system to get the latest most secure
browser and that's that's pretty bad for
the user because unless he purchases the
next version of the operating system he
will never get the full security so what
could we do of making users more aware
that the browser is actually not up to
date and actually there might be at risk
that they're using an old version so one
idea became up with is we could have a
best use before date for browsers
similar to what they're using the food
industry so it's as on the food package
that you better eat it before the expiry
date because otherwise you don't
no I let the quality of the food will
still be okay or whether you get sick if
you eat it so by just having such a date
basically it will mean for browsers they
come out we don't know the date yet but
as soon as the first security
vulnerability comes out the browser then
could start to show this expiry date in
the form that oh actually this browser
is expired for so many days and you have
missed sone so many security patches so
the content is similar however we don't
know in advance we just know it once the
security update comes out but if the
browser would check for security updates
anyway it could just show this visual
warning to the user and then let him
update with a single click and of course
if you still want to surf the web you
can do so so we wouldn't block users of
course but you should be aware that you
might be at risk if you do still use the
old version and so if it easier have
this in the browser or you could also
put this on websites for example as in
the screenshot here it could be put on
Wikipedia because if you send the
version number of the user agent to the
website as you do each time you will
request the website you could just go to
a lock-up by there is the latest browser
and then show you this morning however
there is some trouble here with Internet
Explorer because it only sends you the
major version and it doesn't send you a
minor version information or information
about the patch levels so for a very
large fraction of Internet users this
wouldn't actually work so that's very
unfortunate and I personally think it
would be better if the browser sends the
full version string because then you
could show such warnings and make users
more aware and in addition I don't think
that this will give attackers an
advantage because nowadays to just try a
series of exploit such that they can
cover your version burst in the future
day of course we'll just use a single
exploit that is targeted exactly to your
IE version because they have the full
version string but overall whether you
get like a couple of exploit which then
will actually hate you or you just get a
single exploit that doesn't really
matter if you anyway have a false top
link because finally we'll get it anyway
okay let's now look at the different
side let's look at the vendors how well
are they doing in terms of patching the
systems once that they learn about
security vulnerabilities and
specifically I want to look at the
metric called the zero date patch metric
which will tell on how fast vendors like
Microsoft or Apple actually are fixing
their systems so this is based on the
research paper published at the black
hat conference in Europe and this is
work by my research colleague is stefan
frei from eth zurich together with
burnout till mock and bernard plotner
and you can also find paper online at
Exim dog net / risk so traditional
statistics about patching they look just
at the number of unpatched
vulnerabilities on a given day and then
over some time period and then the more
unpatched vulnerabilities a vendor has
the worse it will be now of course we
can do so for Microsoft here so starting
2002 there's this time series graph up
to 2008 where you see the number of
unpatched vulnerabilities that are known
and which are medium or highly critical
of our Microsoft products and you see
how to tistic see both over time and
they rarely ever hit 20 vulnerabilities
as you can see so most of the time it's
below 20 vulnerabilities on any day that
we're null and we were unpatched however
you see some interesting patterns here
so we see that the number of unpatched
vulnerabilities increases over more than
a year in some cases if Microsoft is
working on a service pack like if you
see for example in 2002 there was so
respect one for windows XP released in
September 9th 2002 and just before it
was released the number of own abilities
climbed form from a few to to more than
10 and the same happened again when
Microsoft was working on windows XP XP
service pack 2 which was released in
august six 2004
so the number of on batch wannabes was
just climbing up and up before they
finally could released a service pack so
apparently the engineering resources
were bound to work on the service pack
and they couldn't actually release bug
fixes while they were working on the
service pack and you see this for other
versions as well so we can do the same
for Apple how many unpatched
vulnerabilities to the head one I need a
from 2002 to 2008 and you see here is
some slightly different pattern so they
had quite often more than 20 unpatched
vulnerabilities on any day that we
looked at and if you look at the trend
you would say that actually the number
of unpatched vulnerabilities is still
increasing people will go over the whole
time window and that's kind of very song
so where is Microsoft can keep it more
or less below the threshold of 20 on
page vulnerabilities a day Apple seems
not to be able to cope with the new
vulnerabilities reported because they
might work on different products or they
did she just don't have enough
engineering resources to actually deal
with them and so he also sees I'm
interesting artifacts here that for
example Valley were working on OSX
standard for tiger release which was in
April on April 29 2005 it seems also
that engineering resources were kind of
focused on that such that they couldn't
fix reported vulnerabilities and so they
climbed up from a little less than 10 to
almost two more than 30 over the time
while you be working on Mac OS extended
for tiger and you can also see with the
iphone release which was in tune 29 2007
before that there was also a large
increase of vulnerabilities reported
which didn't get fixed immediately so
however those that theses are not
extremely interesting because it means
if no owner ability gets reported then
the vendors look fine so maybe look at
the different statistics so here just in
comparison again the number of unpatched
vulnerabilities for apple vs microsoft
so you see Microsoft was all was almost
always below 20 unpatched
vulnerabilities a day over the the time
interval from two thousand to two
thousand eight and Apple had this
increasing trend of having more and more
vulnerabilities not patched which were
more than 20 in the last years okay okay
now let's look on this different metric
because we really want to see on how
well they're dealing with that so we
want to know like once they learn about
vulnerability how long does it take them
to fix it because how the faster
turnaround is the better they do a job
of making sure that users are not at
risk so the study looks at empirical
data from Microsoft and Apple and just
at high and medium risk owner abilities
that were discovered in the years 2002
up to 2007 and that we're also patched
in this period doesn't look at unpatched
vulnerabilities so a security patch base
is just a piece of software that will
eliminate a vulnerability once this
installed and the high in the medium
risk this was chosen as a criteria
because actually the vulnerability
should be for a real security problem
that poses to user at risk and not just
to like a non-critical should not be a
non critical vulnerability and so what
is a zero-day patch zero-day page
basically means that on the same date as
the vulnerability was disclosed the
patch was also released so the gap
between release date of the patch and
vulnerabilities floater date is 0 days
so how can this be how can a vendor fix
the vulnerability on the very same day
gets reported it can only be normally
only be if actually the vendor gets
advance notice there was no public
disclosure react about the band already
knows and once yes the patch he actually
releases the patch together with this
closing the vulnerability so and here we
can look at Microsoft from again 2002 to
2008 how fast are they patching
and so what is done in this graph is the
following it talks it all the patches
that were available looking at this for
each day of the interval of the
observation and it looks at what's the
fraction of patches that were available
on the same day up to 30 days after the
disclosure up to 90 days of the textbook
after that is closure of the
vulnerability or up to 180 days after
the vulnerability disclosure and so now
we can basically say something about the
speed of how fast at the vendor in this
case Microsoft is fixing reported
vulnerabilities and quite surprising in
2003 about sixty percent of all packages
that got the weibull birth year they
patches so they basically disclosed a
vulnerability in the same date as the
patch and it is quite good if sixty
percent of them get patched because if
nobody else than just a vendor and the
security research that found the book
knew about it the no one could actually
exploit it because you mitigate the
patch and if you also install it on the
same day then you're pretty well
protected against the text for those
vulnerabilities however there's forty
percent other vulnerabilities which were
apparently not fixed on the very same
day as tickled known and so you can look
at the 30 day performance the 90 day
performance in the holiday today
performance and so you see for like 30
day performance it's a little more than
seventy percent of all the patches that
got fixed within 30 days for looking
looking at the time interval of up to 90
days after disclosure of the
vulnerability it's around ninety percent
so how r has changed over time for
example when Microsoft was working on
windows XP service pack 2 which came out
on 6th of august 2004 you see how the
serial a patch rate drops significantly
up to forty percent down to forty
percent and so it seems that engineering
resources were so focused
bringing out this service pack that they
didn't actually fix vulnerabilities that
they got reported and manages to go to
close down when of course and then it
still I didn't have a patch out there so
that's quite said that users have to
wait much longer for patches while
Microsoft is working for a big service
pack because in that time there's this
vulnerability window which attackers can
actually use to do attacks using those
vulnerabilities and then later on it
came up again apparently they had
finished working on those service packs
and then the zero-day patch fraction
came up to sixty percent and more again
and those instead more recent in 2007 it
did a better and better job such that
the zero-day patch fraction actually did
climb up again to more than seventy
percent so overall it seems that
Microsoft is doing a better and better
job by fixing vulnerabilities fast now
let's look at apple also for a time
interval of 2002 to the up to the year
2000 and including 2007 what's the
serotype a trait that they have so I'd
surprisingly in 2003 they had no patch
that they fixed on the very first day
until later in 2003 where they started
to apparently fig stuff on the very same
day as it got is closed so this means
the God advance notice of it and
actually we're also fixing it and in
2004 this was climbing up loads up to
forty percent of what ability is called
fixed on the same day as they as the
vulnerability got this closed so they
were doing a better embedded job
apparently however when they got busy
with working on mac OS x tiger which was
released in april two thousand and five
on the late it seems to be very very
busy with this operating system update
so they couldn't really fix everything
immediately anymore and then the
zero-day pet rate came down more
recently 2006 in 2007 the zero-day patch
fractions or all older purchased occult
away Berlin same day as the
vulnerability climbed up to more than
sixty percent
however more recently again late two
thousand seven it came down to about
forty to fifty percent again apparently
were so busy with working on the iphone
so it seems in major innovations done by
a company like Apple they bind so much
engineering resources such that security
gets more more neglected while people
are working on the new innovation so
that puts user certainly at risk because
the the interval order the time in which
an attacker actually can exploit the
vulnerability which is already known in
the public gets larger and larger
towards the release of a new innovative
product so hopefully they increase again
to more than sixty percent with the
zero-day but from the train it's not
really clear because it seems to come in
waves and each time there's a new
innovation coming up resources get bound
so much for working on the innovation
and they get no longer used for Vic
similar abilities so comparing Apple and
Microsoft we can see that it receives
the Microsoft was a pretty good job in
fixing stuff very early and also respond
very fast to security researchers the
report that the report security
vulnerabilities where is Apple as these
interesting waves where they might know
about vulnerabilities but they don't
actually work on fixing it and hopefully
it gets better in the future so thanks a
lot for your attention if you want to
read the full story about understanding
the web browser threat you can find the
paper at taksim net / insecurity dash
iceberg and you can reach me at thomas
at stephen dorff results eh okay thanks
a lot for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
