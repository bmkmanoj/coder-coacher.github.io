comparative approach of software testing
using your network and automation tool
in real world simulation me with my
karate Lalit Singh has both research on
this topic software testing forms an
integral part of the software
development lifecycle since the
objective of testing is to ensure the
conformity of an application to its
specification a test we have used a test
Oracle which is needed to determine
whether a given test case exposes a
fault or not using an automated Oracle
to support the activities of human
testers we can reduce the actual cost of
the testing process on the related
maintenance costs in this study we
present a new concept of using an
artificial neural network as an
automated Oracle for a tested software
system a neural network is trained by
the back propagation algorithm on a set
of test cases which is applied to the
original version of the system the
network training is based on the black
box approach which sends only an input
and output of the system which are
presented to the algorithm the train
network can be used as an artificial
Oracle which is used for evaluating the
correctness of the output produced by
new and possibly faulty version of the
software we present experimental results
of using a two layer neural network to
detect faults with a mutated code of a
small credit approval application
artificial neural network have been used
in the past to handle several aspect of
software testing in this study we have
shown the experiments which have been
conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
of generating test cases which is
capable of exposing false to use
principle components
which is used to find false in a system
to compare the capabilities of new
relative to other fault exposing
techniques and to find faults in failure
data in this study we have presented a
new application of neural network as an
automated test Oracle for a tested
system a multi-layer neural network is
trained on the additional software
application by using randomly generated
is data that conforms to the
specification the neural network can be
trained within a reasonable accuracy of
the additional program though it may be
unable to classify the test data hundred
percent correctly in effect the trained
neural network becomes simulated model
of the software application when new
version of the additional applications
are created and regression testing is
required the tested code is executed on
the test data to kill outputs the data
compared with those of the new leu
network we assume here that the new
version do not change the existing
functions which means that the
application is supposed to produce the
same output for the same input a
comparison tool then means the season
whether the output of the distant
application is incorrect or correct
based on the network activation function
the sample program that is being tested
in this experiment is a small credit
approval application the application is
considered representative of wide range
of business applications
the application can be considered
representative of a wide range of
business applications where a few
critical outputs depend on a large
number of inputs the training data that
I use throughout this paper is randomly
generated using the specification of the
application and the description of the
attributes using an N in base model of
the software rather than running the
original version of the program which
may be the advantages for a variety of
the reasons
but that was already much worse 25
seconds so I don't really want to think
about this talk as a talk per se but as
a discussion starter to encourage some
cross-pollination between developers
working on different testing tools
testing frameworks for different
programming stacks that are out there
I've well I've had not haven't said
anything about myself so hi I'm
Sebastian for over 10 years I've now
contributing to the PHP project and for
about nine years i'm working on PHP unit
which is now the de facto standard for
unit testing in the PHP world and what
happened to me quite often in the last
eight nine years is that I thought that
I had a brilliant idea I implemented it
it solved problems that my users had
before using PHP unit and then one or
two years later I figured out that about
the same time someone else that is just
not using PHP but Python Perl Java Sea
job whatever Ruby had similar problems
found a similar solution and the
solution also worked so what I want to
talk about here today just one highlight
what I spent quite some time recently on
is making code coverage analysis
reporting more accurate and use this to
make lying tests confess so line tests
as we all know from the extended test
patterns book by Cheryl Meszaros lists
one of the tests smells as being a lying
test and a lying test is a test that
doesn't assert anything it doesn't test
anything it just produces code coverage
information in the worst in air in an
ideal case not by bad or malicious
intent just because the developer was
not able to express what he or she
wanted to test and just want to call
some code and basically the testers
ensures that nothing breaks but in my
consulting practice I've also found in
some teams at these that there's a
developer that deals with the
requirement of getting to an 80% code
coverage in such a way that he or she
writes tested
test anything just call a lot of code
and this is why I built some features
into phpunit to prevent that or at least
expose that so it's the latest version
of PHP unit is now a strict mode that
counts how many assertions or
expectations if you're using mock object
or stubs are being made by a test and if
a test does not assert anything as far
as peach per unit is concerned then the
test will be marked as incomplete you
will the test will not automatically
fail but you'll see in your report hey
Jesus incomplete and furthermore such a
test does not yield any code coverage
information at all so you don't get a
false sense of security that yes these
lines are green in my code coverage
report it's tested it may be executed
but test coverage or code coverage is
not equal to being tested and well two
other notions I have two minutes left I
guess one and a half one other thing is
that phpunit allows you to use
annotations to make it explicit which
part of the code a test once to test so
if you test a method that called some
other codes you'd only want to show the
methods code that you write directly
testing show up in the code coverage
report that is possible just need to
give PHP with more detailed information
and another thing that we recently
implemented is to deal with the fact
that it's really really hard to
introduce unit testing and code coverage
goals in a legacy project that has grown
over time has millions of lines of code
and no code coverage at the beginning
and it is really really frustrating for
developers so we are manual pizza to be
more exact wrote a small wrapper around
phpunit that interacts with the version
control system and you can say I only
want to have a code coverage report it
is limited to the last couple of days
weeks months when ever since you started
to write unit tests and that's it if you
want to talk about this feel free to
grab me in the next two days are we
happy to talk about these and other
ideas thank you
Thank You the timing was perfect next
person is Ramesh Romani from tavant
Oh medicine sorry this version doesn't
have it so is it possible for me to take
you can do it tomorrow when you do it
too man it's actually yeah no turns of
psychology no tomorrow that doesn't
matter tomorrow he's decided he's
decided to do it tomorrow Rahul Verma
from mcafee I grow afternoon so five
minutes have to really rush through the
concepts so as my previous friend said
prior to me that it's just to build the
ground for further discussions during a
lunch sessions or otherwise so this
topic is test encapsulation today's
first half was dedicated to test
automation so this topic is related to
design of test automation frameworks so
why are automated tests usually dumb now
we listen up listen to a lot of talks on
on good automation frameworks but the
thing is when we talk of test design
frameworks test automation frameworks
what happens is we talk of surrounding
noise features it should have a
reporting interface it should integrate
with bugzilla it should send an email
notification we keep discussing of this
test as a design aspect of automation
framework comes at the end that's the
irony because the primary purpose of a
test automation framework is to run one
or more tests ironically this is how our
test automation frameworks look if you
have multiple platforms on which tests
are to be run and all tests are not
meant for all platforms if you have
multiple API versions there are tests
which belong to prior ABI versions there
is criteria there if they have assigned
priorities you might group them they
might use marks some of them are meant
to run only with actual components but
all these decisions all of these
decisions where do we place them we
usually place them outside of tests
always outside of pissed
in the test automation framework so in
the distribution methodology whether a
test should be run or not whether group
of tests should be run or not it is
always outside the test thereby making a
test dump now if it has to be truly a
test automation framework this is how
our test automation framework should be
designed that discussion of the design
of automation of a framework should this
should start from test what all things
it should have the power of
introspection should be built into the
test so when when you have that in place
your test automation framework as such
becomes very simple what it has to
simply take is user configuration it has
to just say run now at runtime the tests
decide for themselves which platforms I
meant for which API version I meant for
do i use mocks am I multi-threaded these
decisions the test makes for itself they
by making it an intelligent test so
that's what i call as test encapsulation
test encapsulation as a concept is used
when you have a meta automation
framework and automation of automation
frameworks it's very useful when you
have the same framework to test multiple
products with multiple tools and you can
support tests in any language with this
test and encapsulation concept I have
built a framework which could do this
job and as of now we have Python tests
pearl test c c++ tests we have unit
tests system tests non functional test
performance tests fuzzing tests using
the same framework so that's about the
concept this is just the y part there is
no time to discuss of what and how part
for that we have the discussion platform
in the form of GTA conference thank you
so much
try deep sender it I can't pronounce it
syndra virgin so for a talkative guy
like me the test and we look I told you
guys on board for me for the one RV we
got through the finance from you okay so
what am I going to be doing going to be
talking about
spread something about this do I really
need a mic okay yeah okay so okay this
should be fine so I want you to stop
thinking about that and I want you to
start focusing on why I'm actually
talking about this now I just put my
status message saying that I'm going to
google test automation conference and
some of the manual testers bring me
asking then I can you give me the link
and I said Google and they came back and
asked me you can you please give me the
link now I want to think I want to help
these people we are you know some of
most of you here are actually smart but
what we need to focus on obvious people
out it for this place who really need
our help and okay with that focus what I
want to do is I want to call okay manual
testing as brain your testing because
what's happened or here in India where
most of you guys are outsourcing your
test you think its hands at work while
it's actually brain at work and every
one of us acknowledge that and why not
we focus on using the term which relates
to what we are actually doing okay so
what we're actually doing is brain ewell
testing and the skills that you're
building is not the biceps this kills
we're building is about related to the
brain and we would want okay testers to
focus on those kind of thinking skills
which would really help them the best
part of this lightning talk is it's over
now ok so after Simon just to make it
flow better Allen Walker yeah it's me
again sorry guys
so about a year ago Jason Huggins and I
announced that we were merging the
selenium and webdriver projects in GTA
2009 we announced we were merging the
projects and we sort of gave you a road
map of what we're doing it's been a year
I should probably let you know what
we've done so we have moved the two
projects into the same place that's
pretty cool we have released six alphas
over the course of a year so that's you
know about one every two months that's
not bad and we're slowly heading towards
beta now what do we mean by dita well
probably best to describe what we mean
by alpha alpha means we're still adding
api's we're still playing with it we're
still sort of letting everything gel
well hit the beaches when we have two
more sets of AP ice one for doing
advanced user interactions so being able
to say click here hold down the shift
key click here click here click here
drag the mouse along a sinusoidal path
and let go here and that would be the
advanced user interactions API that's
landing scene it's already there in a
branch if you want to have a play and
the other API that we need is handling
alerts and prompts when that's in we're
going to release the beta we hope to
have that well before Christmas that's
this quarter that's quite exciting so
that's coming as quickly as we can next
question is it safe to start moving a
code from selenium to webdriver to
selenium to the answer is yes yes it is
the api's were adding to them we're very
seldom removing them and we tend to be
quite nice about putting deprecation
tags and warning you guys that we're
about to rip something out before we
actually go ahead and do it so yes it is
safe to move next question how do you
make them move you don't go to the
selenium web site selenium googlecode
com and you download the latest version
in that there's a class called webdriver
back selenium that's an implementation
of the selenium interfaces he replaced
new default HTTP fault selenium with new
web driver back selenium and you just
run your tests and hopefully nothing
breaks and then over time you can do a
piecemeal upgrade to as you go and touch
various bits of your codebase you can
move to the new api's and take advantage
of some of the sort of capabilities that
are exposing and that is where selenium
to is thank you
so Allen's talk name changed from when I
first saw it now it's sometimes mocks
our faith after Alan will be Mustafa
battery well oh actually the way I ended
up here is I thought I was signing up
for a talk with Simon and then I
realized I didn't sign up for a talk I
was signing up to do a talk so I changed
the topic but anyway I'm just going to
tell a story I was working at a company
with a fellow named Paul Grbac he was a
developer for a product that took to
backup products and combined them into a
dashboard where you could see the status
of the events and what was going on the
two different products that were
completely unrelated now the project
management team wanted me to develop a
test that would take 300 systems and see
how the dashboard would handle the
events coming in from these three
hundred systems and I immediately
realized that they didn't really care
what was going on in the 300 systems and
they didn't really care on what the
backup product was doing all they cared
about was how this dashboard was
presenting this information and if it
was efficient and how long it took for
the page to load and the functionality
of that so Paul had actually presented
to me a tool that allowed me to actually
should explain this there's a proxy
between the dashboard and the two
products so one proxy for product a and
one proxy for product B so Paul had
actually written a tool that allowed me
to dump the contents of what was going
on in proxy a so I got to thinking well
if he could actually dump that to an XML
file and then somehow I could reinsert
that XML file into the object then I
would be able to simulate the entire
environment of the three hundred
computers so instead of spending you
know an entire week building 300
computers with a variety of
configurations and then trying to cause
a whole bunch of scripting to make
different events happen on those 300
computers that would go into the backup
software which would then go into the
proxy and then be rendered on the
dashboard we could simply make a mock
proxy is what i thought it was called
but I've come to learn that it's
actually called a fake and so what we
did was he wrote me this ability to
change a config file so I could get
the file that I had dumped from the
proxy to get injected into the proxy so
what that does for us is it gives us
some control ability over what's going
on in the dashboard and so not only can
you initially load it with a specific
data set but then you can simulate what
happens when an event comes in so you
can figure out all the different event
types that were coming to the proxy and
then you can modify the xml file to
simulate this all going into the
dashboard so not only does it allow you
to use selenium to test the layout of
the dashboard and the loading times and
whatnot of it accessing the actual proxy
but it also allows you to see what
happens when different events happen so
that's the sum total of my talk and it's
basically a story about how a developer
and a software tester work together to
make something simple hi good afternoon
and I hope you all had a great lunch and
these small talks are keeping you awake
so I would like to talk about the
performance testing of client-side for
mobile applications now mobile
applications are growing at an
unprecedented rate almost most of us who
are setting here are using one of the
other kind of mobile devices and it
would have loss of applications and the
way these applications are growing do we
have any idea that how we test those
applications so testing the server side
is pretty simple probably it would
similar to what we do for normal web
testing all the techniques and
technologies for server side but what
about device how would we test an
application how it is performing the
battery consumption is the memory
consumption on a device so now before
talking about the solutions let me talk
about some problems so what are the
problems with these mobile applications
there are multiple devices different
devices different vendors and a same
application behaves differently on each
of the handsets that's one of the
concern the other concern is unlike
laptops and desktops the computing power
on mobile devices limited it has limited
battery power CPU and the memory so it's
very important that the application that
is delivered on those devices
optimized and performs expectedly let's
say an example if I am transferring some
accounts from my bank to a different
account then I won't use that
application if it takes too long to
respond now after talking about the
problem what should be the solution so
one of the solution would be say I take
a stopwatch try accessing the
application and see ok how much time the
screen takes to refresh but is it a good
way is it an ingenious way so probably
it's again a vague way other solution
would be say we ask our development team
to put lots of lock statements into our
code and lots lots of start time and
time and then print all those things in
a log and analyze it but is this again a
maintainable approach what I would
suggest of what we have been trying to
do is using aspects to measure the
performance on the client side there are
lots of aspect oriented frameworks
available for normal applications Java C
C++ but the same frameworks are now also
available for the mobile languages for
j2me Blackberry Android now using these
aspects we can create a framework of
reusable aspects that can be integrated
with any application and once they are
integrated these aspects would start
transmitting the same information the
best part is that all the configurations
are external so you create an xml file
specify what all important methods you
want to measure and you start getting
all this constant so that helps you in
keeping a track of how your application
is performing on the actual device
whenever there are multiple applications
being used by a user say I am listening
some songs on my mood device and also i
am trying to read a book or i am trying
to access some application so this would
be the release scenario where i would
like to know that high of my application
is performing so that's why i want you
to talk to you about and thanks this is
my first do take appearance and nice to
stand in front of all of you and talk
thank you
the next speaker is rituparna from
Microsoft but this speaker decided to do
it tomorrow after Rita pana will be soo
deep and jagadeesan from mine tree right
so first of all this is the first time I
am coming to geotag it's been nice
experience till now and met some of the
very interesting and intelligent folks
out there doing great works in the test
community so my topic is how we can use
code coverage techniques to optimize
your test fit so I don't know how you
folks use code coverage but as far as I
know most of the folks are using code
coverage to get an idea of what is their
test coverage right so if some companies
has a matrix that probably we should
have code coverage of eighty percent
ninety percent and there's how most of
the folks use code coverage data I don't
know whether people take the code
coverage data and use it differently so
I would point it out point out to you
that how you can use code coverage in a
different way so for example what we
used to do in our team was over a period
of say one year or two years we used to
have a proliferation of automation
suites as well as manners which people
when they start automating the test
really don't think whether there is
another test which is doing the similar
kind of stuff and sometimes it's very
difficult to find out whether there is
an exact test which does a similar kind
of stuff so code coverage can help here
so what code coverage can help you do is
you can run you can get a code coverage
done by each of your particular test and
compare it when you are running a new
test compare it with the existing code
coverage metrics and see if this test is
doing anything small getting any more
code coverage and what the other tests
have done then you can probably take the
particular test that you are trying to
write and see is there an exact similar
test or is it comprising of some
other tests which have added to this
code coverage that way you can make a
choice between adding a new test or
rewriting the old test to touch the
particular scenarios that way you can
help reduce your automation suites and
also improve the coverage that
automation suits you also the manual
test that you have read sometimes what
happens is manual test sometimes you do
manual testing and it finds new bulbs on
top of your automation why does that
happen that happens probably because the
manual tests are taking a different code
pub or probably because of the data so
one thing to find out using your manual
test is whether they are actually adding
any extra code coverage on top of your
automation suits in that way what you
can do is identify the manual tests that
are probably candidates for your
automation that way what you can do is
the manual tests which are adding extra
code coverage are probably the set of
tests you would probably want to run on
different configs as well different os's
and different browsers and those should
be probably probably automated but from
your manual suits you don't have an idea
to find out which are the Canada's
automation so probably using code
coverage and identifying the test that
give an extra code coverage on top of
your automated switz would be a good
idea so this is just a thought that I
probably want to share with you try it
out in your team and probably we can
talk afterwards and what you think about
it that's it
the next will have so deep and jagged
aside from mine tree after this we'll
have some talks that we had not
originally planned for today because our
speakers are moving right along so Manoj
photog had written his name are you here
you ready to give it today right you're
next and then I can take one or two more
after that depending how fast to go good
afternoon all since this is a lightning
talk I will directly bolt onto the topic
some time ago we did a search using
google on what type of tools are
available for cross browser UI test
automation and we did not come across
any tool which met our requirements so
people convinced us that you may be
wrong but Google cannot be so what we
decided was why don't we try out
building a framework for cross browser
UI automation not cross browser
functional testing see for example we
came across tools it's not that there
are no tools available for cross browser
UI test automation but those tools they
typically take screenshots across all
browsers and in this way what is the
difficulties you cannot pinpoint the
exact error so it will be just telling
you that ok this page has a problem but
what problem can you pinpoint the error
that ok there is a problem in this font
size or font style or there is a problem
in the horizontal alignment of all the
widgets or there is a problem that the
video streaming is breaking out so this
type of operations or this type of
requirements when you have there are no
available tools so what we did was we
actually integrated a lot of computer
vision libraries or image processing
libraries tools like your securely
libraries like OCR libraries to do this
type of automation and my colleague
Jagdish will give you an example of how
we used optical character recognition or
porn style recognition or this type of
image processing libraries to do this
type of test automation and no
only cross browser UI automation it can
also extend the functionality or
testability of the current functional
test automation tools as such because as
we all know that more and more new
technologies are coming up and all the
tools whether it is qtp or it is
selenium they have problems in
identifying objects in a particular
technology but when you use this type of
libraries to do your automation it
doesn't matter what is the technology
that is rendering the UI so over to
Jagdish hi everyone good afternoon hi
everyone could have to lose hi it's
basically why we have to come up with
the class poser using the computer
visions library when we go for some
automation frameworks or the GUI testing
we are depend on a lot of languages and
the object errors or we could enable to
detect some of the objects or some of
the images so we come up with a computer
vision libraries are one of the one the
best way to take a snapshot of any of
entire screen of the corresponding
application we can process on that so
theta is for example if you take like
zooming and next click ability and the
time I a dynamic hyperlinks I'm flashes
so what we do is basically we'll take a
snap to the particular region like
rectangular regions offered and process
on the OCR suppose if you take the phone
sighs you want added actor like optical
character recognition they like the font
size or pain sighs next thing us the
style saucer can be detected by using
multi libraries like Maury and I
stingers like a flash objects the moving
objects we can detect whether it's
moving properly alignment like pixel
calibrations bricks will drool
measurements is possible to do it next
Adam and whether there any distractions
in the calibrations easily we can able
to compare it across the different poses
it is independent of any process not
only the process we can as we can test
any applications so thanks a lot so it
just to give you a insight into how we
can integrate different life based tools
image processing functions to do this
type of automation so request you to try
it out and we can actually form a forum
or community where we can discuss how to
use and solve problems whether it is in
functional test automation or cross
browser UI a test automation thanks a
lot
thanks a lot manoj photo is from
geometric limited he'll talk about
building testability into legacy code I
don't have a slide for that so if one of
you wants to give a spontaneous talk
after that think about it and come over
here thing I would not prefer I am
honest photic I work with Joe metric
limited we develop softwares for
engineering space in the area of care
cam and PLM I am going to talk about
testability into legal sequel I work
with legacy would I do not know how many
of you work with legacy good ok so there
are some typical challenges that we face
working with legacy code imagine you are
stretching a wire of aluminum or rather
any metal I just reach the wire it
becomes more and more difficult to stage
it further it developed some internal
stress again stretching and we stretch
it at one time it breaks interestingly
same thing happens with legacy code I
just start building it developers come
and go there is a turnover we start
putting patches and the cool becomes
more and more rigid and it becomes very
difficult to spread it further to put
further enhancements and definitely at
some point it becomes brittle so how do
we deal with that always vendor and this
is taken as unsolved problem
unfortunately because as a system grows
it becomes it is assumed that it is
going to be unmanageable and it is true
with even the real system when I look at
let's say airport or a hospital or even
our body all these systems are extremely
complex but still they work if this
system work why can't you believe in C
code word interestingly i came across a
book from dr bowl
he is a father of theory of constraints
and he has made a very beautiful
statement what is this is every complex
system is based on inherent simplicity
and the way to exploit or improve the
system is by exploiting that inner and
simplicity and I take this statement and
I went back to legacy code and start
seeing the simplicity and at the same
time I came across a beautiful book by
Michael feathers called working
effectively with ragazzi code where he
has described a concept of seemed so
this is unfortunately this is only a
five-minute talk like so I cannot
explain what is seen but I went back I
took this concept and went back to my
code and I could really exploit the
simplicity in the legacy code and it is
to make it more stretchable and we can
we can fulfill our market demands if you
are interested if you are say facing the
same problems we can discuss it offline
you can reach me on my email as well
thank you for giving me this opportunity
