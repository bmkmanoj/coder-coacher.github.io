NASA Ames today I'm going to talk about
the instant to method in quantum
annealing thermostated tunneling versus
quantum Monte Carlo simulation so this
is a collaboration with a special of
atoms molesky at Google who is an expert
in quantum tendon and transport in Saudi
boys show at Mouton even and duermo
Mottola material to alia at ETH Zurich
and also a circuit is a Corvette Google
Zurich so it has been found that there
exists an analogy between quantum
tunneling and the classical escape over
barrier problem so essential question
for us to ask is can thermal activation
in quantum Monte Carlo or simulated
quantum tunneling in quantum annealing
so here is a brief introduction to what
is quantum Monte Carlo especially we use
the pathing to go romantic color in the
left side and it is the quantum system
the red dots are quantum cubits and
arrows are the other local field acting
on the other quantum oh that's weird but
yeah this works okay okay
so this is the thermal activation versus
quantum tunneling okay on the left side
this is the quantum system term or we
are where we are considered so it's
being are coupled to every other spins
and the red red dots represent quantum
space these yellow arrows are local
fields that acting on these quantum
spinks as transverse field so a one way
to map this quantum system to classical
system is to do totalization here I
brought three of the replicas but you
can have many replicas so in the
classical system we have these blue dots
representing classical spins and the
classical beings are linked to each
other with the same potential energy as
the quantum space however there is no
transverse field acting on the classical
spin mr. we have this permanent magnetic
coupling between these classical spanish
for the corresponding spins in each
replicas so or why we have this kind of
map so the reason we consider that is
because we can always map the partition
function of a quantum system to a
classical system so to do that we need
to do trotter ization and suppose this k
is the kinetic energy of the quantum
system and this you as a potential term
and after we do the totalization we got
another potential term for the classical
spins where the adjacent replicas are
coupled to each other by this by this
template beta and we call this i'm at
the classical Hamiltonian our HQ MC this
classical Hamiltonian the
and the inverse temperature beta so
mapping from the quantum to classical
system is easy we have this k nu and we
map this quantum Hamiltonian to the
classical Hamiltonian so our question
becomes to ask whether our quantum
tunneling I described by the quantum
Hamiltonian whether it can be simulated
by the crime escape event within this
classical Hamiltonian H qmc beta X where
X denotes all the configurations of
these replicas so this is a plot of
crime escape event originally you your
your state sits in this local minimum
and because of thermal activation it go
to the transition point which also
called the saddle point and then adjust
go to the global minimum with high
probability so here I state the main
result we have found in this research
first we find that the saddle point of
the quantum Monte Carlo Hamiltonian
which is the classical Hamiltonian I
just described is an instant on in the
other primate space so an instant own is
just a solitary imaginary time and also
we find that the exponential scaling of
the escape rate in the quantum Monte
Carlo at a given temperature 1 over beta
equals to that of the quantum tunneling
rate in the quantum and in quantum
annealing so here are the archived
versions of our work
so to describe this correspondence we
need to describe the verse the system of
an under consideration so here Sigma
represents the configurations of the
classical spins of many replicas so we
have eggs beans coupled to each other
and the coupling is a homogeneous
coupling so it only depends on the
Hamming weight of the classical spin and
this indices tau represents the replicas
so if you have the trains condition then
we have the periodic boundary condition
the configuration at time 0 equal to the
configuration at time beta so beta just
the imaginary time corresponding to the
temperature 1 over T so the probability
of a state vector of this certain
configuration is given by the Boltzmann
distribution where E is the where is the
energy of that configuration and this e
equals to this expression so in the
first integral that GM tau is our
potential energy G so G is any function
cat you choose and and tall as the sum
of the the spin Sigma J so this
potential energy is symmetric plus some
term from the kinetic energy the
transverse field of the quantum
Hamiltonian a Kappa just accounts the
number of kinks in this Sigma Zeta so
the number that the Sigma J how changes
its sign and to tackle with this problem
or we introduce the order parameter and
tau which is the sum of the
classical space Sigma J so the the free
energy in the in the other parameter
space have been given by Bam Bam stir in
this image in and it has this kind of
nice form where this need to grow is
travel to evaluate the second determines
kind of tricky so this this V is the
trace of nonlinear propagated and
nonlinear two-dimensional propagator
because this lambda tau equals to G Pro
language E is the potential energy prime
is the first derivative of that
potential so this is Ali nonlinear
propagator of this Hamiltonian so this
is quite quite tricky to solve the way
we tackle that is we map this nonlinear
propagator to a map magnetic field and
the and the evolution of the expectation
value of Sigma X Sigma Y Sigma Z can be
mapped to to us being one half particle
evolving on that magnetic field so in
that way we can solve the saddle point
of the free energy ok
so in the numerix the path example by
using the monte carlo methods for
example metropolis or hit Beth and the
exponential scaling is given by this
difference in the free energy Delta F
and the Delta F is the free energy end
at the transition point or minus the
free energy at the local minimum and the
transition point at which you is given
by the instant of solution soon that
Ebel you would think that because all
the replicas are symmetric so the
transition point would also be symmetric
so it would be a static point but we
found that it is really counterintuitive
with this is kind of like replica
symmetry breaking so you have this an
interview shape of the other parameter
in the space of the the replicas and the
transition state is given by this
equation where you where the derivative
of the free energy with respect to the
other primates em thao vanishes and and
using the method I just just talked
about making this making the nonlinear
equation into a spin one half particle
evolving in the valley magnetic field we
have been able to derive the instant
equation of the this transition point
which is this equation and here there is
a free parameter l and this L can be
determined by the self-consistent
condition which I'm not going to talk
about it here and interestingly we we
also derive this equation with the wkd
method where the way
the rate of quantum tunneling can be
evaluated and this parameter error has a
physical meaning there this error is
this air as the this parameter error is
just the total the total spin quantum
number in the wkb approach where your
quantum tunneling happens so here our
result we calculated the scaling of the
tunneling coefficient we compared with
the numerix and they can form pretty
well for the curious model and using the
formalism we delight developed that we
can analyze some some simple model like
this bike Hamiltonian and we also
derived similar results as as talked
before bye bye Elise the bus and in the
lucas and when okay so here i want to
talk about some new research with being
done recently it's about the open
condition quantum monte carlo so that
the voltages you have high efficiency
you got a potential orchid drug to speed
up over the periodic boundary conditions
we can have extra control by adding
painting field on edge space and we also
have a nice formalism to evaluate the
free energy for finite number of
replicas not necessary large a limit but
it also has some disadvantages like test
edge effect it has extra entropic
factors and tell some physical
correlation functions which nest which
not necessarily affect our quantum
optimization result
so what we find is instead of have a for
instant own we have a half instant own
in sort of in the open boundary
condition and what's interesting is in
the open boundary condition the quantum
tunneling always happens in a total
angular momentum space equal to equal to
the maximum value so this could brought
some some speed up with with with the
same interesting effect and also it
could be a quadric tea leaf faster than
quantum annealing let me just skip this
so this is the result we find for the
initial conditions for this open
boundary instantons because now you have
this uncertainty of the initial position
and initial velocity so these ten tones
are much harder to evaluate then the
close the boundary condition but we can
we find it it can be derived using these
boundary conditions and also we've used
the wkb approach to compare with the
quantum Monte Carlo calculations so here
is the partition function in for the
open boundary condition case instead of
having a trace we have this expectation
value over the state s whereas at the
even super position in the computational
basis so because of this estimate we we
can insert two of the basis m1 and m2
and that world gave us an extra entropy
term for the for the open boundary
condition we we calculate the free
energy at for the instant of solution
for the using the wkb approach which
equals to the free energy at the instant
of solution using the quantum Monte
Carlo approach or mean field approach
and here this a is the action of the the
instant oh and this e is the energy of
the instant oh and this added to an
tropic factor because of using the open
boundary condition and the same endpoint
condition we derived can be can also be
derived using this equation so here
comes to the conclusion so we have
should for a class of problems with
homogeneous coupling or having symmetric
cost function the saddle point of the
quantum Monte Carlo corresponds exactly
to the instant solution and we find that
the free energy difference at the center
point and the local minimum gives the
exponential scaling of the quantum Monte
Carlo so the conclusion is continuity
color can simulate quantum tomaten all
four or set or coming symmetric cost
functions so some future work we will
definitely i want to calculate the pre
factor of the quantum Monte Carlo and
the quantum annealing to compare it with
the recent google result where you have
this ten today's speed up and also we we
are interested to generalize this
instant of calculus to modern more
general problems like the spin class
problem by introducing more order
parameter like the replica symmetry
breaking parameter and we also want to
extend this without to knowing
stochastic hamiltonian okay here's my
talk thanks for your attention
any questions do you have some ideas in
mind for how you might extend to the
nonce tequesta case yes i have so
actually it's it's it's quite it's quite
easy to do no stochastic evolution
because you're you're yo Hamiltonian is
is honey symmetric so you can add some
like X terms in your your potential tell
if it is how many symmetric you can see
things other questions okay let's start
all these speakers of this session
