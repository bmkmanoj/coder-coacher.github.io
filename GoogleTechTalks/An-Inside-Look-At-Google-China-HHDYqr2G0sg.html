president no greater China Italy was
over talk about China thank you okay
thank you very much phone I know after
the talk there may be a lot of questions
still Fong is so one of the early
employees at Google right number a few
hundred and he's also working very
closely with a China team so if you have
any questions about the talk and some
and we don't get to talk feel free to
connect with him as well it's really
great to see so many familiar faces old
friends back in Seattle again today I'm
gonna tell you about what I've been up
to for the for the last year and a half
actually I know I think you know what
I've been up to the first two months of
this here and a half but the remaining
the remaining 16 months there are a lot
of exciting things have happened so I'm
gonna just tell you about about it I'm
gonna tell you about the opportunity for
it for any internet company in China and
then tell you a little bit about a very
high level what we're trying to
accomplish in China how we're hiring
great people targeting great plans and
then telling you a bit about how we're
working with them worldwide Rd to really
build great products for China and for
worldwide and that we have a special
relationship with our sister office in
Kirkland and we'll want to do a lot of
projects together so first opportunities
and challenges well China is huge
everybody knows that I think everyone
here knows that the internet population
is rapidly catching up with the US and
about 140 million as of today and it's
it's getting close to the American
internet population but more excitingly
is growing at 25 percent rather than 3%
so at this rate in a few years China
will be the largest internet country in
the whole world even more excitingly
broadband in the last year Chinese
broadband users overtook
marek and broadband users many people
might assume China as a poorer country
would have less broadband coverage but
that's wrong broadband is huge in China
because the metropolitan distribution
matches very well build up of great
broadband networks inside metropolitan
areas mobile phones is even no
comparison there are 440 million paid
subscribers in China and you as you can
see here the there are many more mobile
users than Internet users so many people
may be experiencing internet the first
time on their phone not on their PC and
the last one even a bigger
disproportionate comparison is that
engineering graduates in China outnumber
at the u.s. eight to one so these are
all reasons we want to be in China right
we want to reach the internet population
take advantage of broadband and
demonstrate our great products such as
Google Video and others that do require
broadband reach the mobile users and of
course higher than engineering graduates
but at the same time China's full of
challenges some of the challenges are
that the internet is a combination is
much younger audience in China compared
to the United States there are many more
younger users and the users are much
more interested in fun and somewhat less
interested in pursuit of knowledge so if
you go to an internet cafe who's been -
who's been to the internet cafe in China
very very few you you might notice that
the browser is not even installed or
used in many other many machines right
people are there to do what games music
video movies and occasionally a browser
window pops up usually a pop up ahead of
some sort so browsing is not common and
certainly so so much farther out for
search there is a very grassroots usage
a lot of the grassroots users love
entertainment mp3 and games and and also
there's a strong sense of community so
if you go to one of the portals in China
look at one of the popular controversial
news and you'll see 10,000 responses
with
people arguing with each other the sense
of community is very strong BBS you know
concept that nobody uses in the US
anymore bulletin boards and I remember
that from my college days but but in
China how many page views a day 1
billion so that's how alive and well the
BBS is and the sense of community that
it brings there's a unfortunately
there's lack of credit card or credit
card credit system you know eBay tried
to establish that it didn't really quite
fly seems like people are not completely
ready to build up trust over the
internet people are willing to meet each
other talk to each other play games with
each other learn new concepts over the
internet but when they want to hand over
money they want to see the merchandise
and the person that that's selling to
you okay so that that's different and of
course not having credit cards causes a
bunch of issues advertisers aren't able
to track returns as well ecommerce is
slower to take off so that's a bit on
the downside and then the high-growth
market will have very rapid changes new
users coming on board leaders late last
year might not be leaders anymore so
that's quite a quite a dynamic market
and of course government regulatory
policies are different u.s. is about as
open as you get now many countries do
have restrictions on the internet and
China is among them aggress fast-moving
competitors those of you have seen
Chinese dinner and the companies realize
that companies move fast and then they
are also very aggressive in in in trying
to get market share or perhaps are
ridiculing their competitors and things
like that it's um rather like a wild
wild west in terms of internet
competition there's a perception that
non-local internet companies fall every
talk I ever give this question always
comes up you know company XYZ have all
failed in China why do you think you'll
succeed some might even include us as
companies that have failed and we
haven't even started
so that mystery and legend needs to be
disproved
and Google is sir
out and committed to disprove that
multinational Internet companies can in
fact succeed in China so that's the
landscape and I want to tell you a
little bit our about our plan as you
might expect um you're not gonna hear
anything about our product sort of
strategy overall but I'll give you an
idea of what we hope to accomplish in
the coming years and how we're going
about building a team so back to this
some belief or mystery that internet
molten multinational companies shall
fail in China so why should Google be
different I think our primary my primary
answer for that is something Eric
Schmidt said to me last week we will
take a long-term view to win in China
Chinese have a 5,000 years of history
Google has 5,000 years of patience which
we sure hope it happens a lot sooner
than that
but we're making a long-term bet you
know we're not in China to make a profit
today we're not in China to grab market
share at all costs we're committed to
China and the Chinese users and winning
them over by building better products
and before you build better products you
got to have a good team so market shares
will fluctuate but we're deeply
committed to building the right thing in
the long term so with that in mind our
plan is relief in the past year that I
have been in China we were there to
build foundation it's a year of
buildings you're planting and hopefully
this year this year will become a year
of harvesting so in a no six we've
established presence we've built a
website that complies with local laws we
come up with a Chinese name some people
might ask about our Chinese name whether
they like it or not some people love it
some people don't love it but the
important thing to realize is half of
the Internet users do not know how to
spell Google so we want a Chinese name
so that they can type GU GE dot C N and
get to our website we've started
marketing to universities because that's
where the next gen users will come out
of and where there's natural inclination
to liking Google we've established some
partnerships you might have heard about
the China Mobile partnership as well as
the shin lay investment
that we've made and we have many more
that will be coming down the pike of
course you know those deals to take
months to negotiate and discuss and oh
six was when we did it and lastly in
bold is the biggest thing we did we
really build a great foundation by
building a world-class engineering team
and I'll say more about that later so if
oh six was a year of planting then those
seven shall be a year of harvesting and
that this is the year when you will
indisputably see that Google Chinese
search is the best search that exists in
quality in speed in completeness in
coverage in freshness in features in
every possible imaginable way now if you
don't quite see that today go home and
try Google that's Iain again see if it's
already improved over a few months ago
but if you still are not satisfied you
can fully expect that the best is yet to
come and it's not just web search as you
know Google has a large portfolio of
products and we're building many
products localizing many products
modifying them a lot of products
combining a lot of products and they
will all be coming out in no seven and
that will be a pleasant surprise to the
many fans that we have in China now some
of you work in companies that build
five-year plans so this is as far as
we've got yeah oh six last year and oh
seven this year's you know Google is an
Internet industry we don't build very
long term plans but if you insist on
seeing one more bullet I will satisfy
that request now some time before seven
thousand and six we shall become the
most popular successful useful service
in China hopefully a lot before and
that's the 5000-year comment that Eric
make you know so now the second point I
want to talk about is building a great
team so the long term approach you are
taking is really not going to China and
let's squeeze revenue get advertising
build channels and of course we have to
do all that but those aren't the top
priority the top priorities you gotta
have a team that's local that
understands Chinese users that builds a
product that they their parents their
friends all want to use and that starts
with a team if you don't
have a team we've got a bunch of
Americans and Chinese Americans if you
want they're not going to build the
right products because they're not in
market they're not talking to their
friends about what's new and exciting
and important to them okay so building a
great local team is in fact our
worldwide strategy and it's particularly
important in China where the market
dynamics as we talked earlier are quite
different so how did we build a great
team so I'm gonna tell you our six form
formula of six points of how we manage
to build great R&amp;amp;D of course first you
gotta have hire great people so great
people are all over the place
so we've announced Beijing and o-5
Taipei no.6 Shanghai no7 and possibly
more in the future
we want to go where the talents are
right we go to a lot of we went the
first year and made a lot of hires and
some of them we heard a bunch of people
didn't apply to us and we said well why
not this is why I want to live in the
south I hate Beijing so we opened up
Shanghai so that's why we have Kirkland
that's why we have New York Atlanta
London and so on and so forth but that's
the approach we're taking we go where
the people are we also hired a bunch of
senior people we've hired them who
brought a lot of Chinese Googlers from
Mountain View Kirkland and New York to
move to China to seed the culture
because that's really important right
and we want to double all of these in
no7 and probably double again in o8 and
in o6 we hire them about a hundred
people that some may not sound like a
huge number but if you have friends or
who have interviewed at Google you know
it sounds pretty high bar and finding a
hundred was really really tough to ask
we have become instantly the number one
employer if you don't believe it go on
straight muti moi BBS and check out
where the graduates want to go
we're not be involved in that website
and it's basically everybody really not
everybody but you know 70 80 90 percent
at the top people would choose Google as
the number one destination if they're
computer science graduates so over
months that's become possible nearly a
hundred percent in our first year
accepted offer
90% accepted offer this year we've hired
a champion programming champion of the
world ACM also hired the champion of
Coach M which is Google's own
programming competition hired number one
student from many universities and will
grow and double and on so on and so
forth so this is going really really
well now the great people are coming on
board
you know senior people typically from
abroad Chinese Americans or Chinese
people with Chinese answers ancestry
coming to back to China and then local
campus hires locally and they're working
well together but that's only the first
step
the other thing is we got lots of people
who who love us in China
so we're if you want to know why do
people want to work at Google Google
harami comm is an interesting website
paya by a student who wanted to be hired
by us there's some a bunch of people who
love us we call them frogs friends of
Google they add there's actually a
website called G fan org sorry I forgot
to put that up which is a bunch of
Chinese people who Chinese users
bloggers who love us and then we've come
up with our own china blog Google China
blog calm to tell people what we are so
this it's more a little bit of soft
marketing to tell people hey this is a
great place to work so tell your friends
about it so that's another thing we did
and of course another strength is I have
we have is that Google is pretty popular
on campuses and I was told I'm pretty
popular around Chinese campuses too so
this is a picture of one talk I gave
slightly larger than this crowd huh this
is another talk I gave and at this talk
the president of the university said hey
Caillou there's another three thousand
people waiting outside and I said that
can't be
and then he's oh I don't have the
picture sorry there's a picture
somewhere that shows that three thousand
people outside
so I guess everything in China is
large-scale but I think Google's
popularity also helps there are also a
number of opportunities that to get the
word out outside of the talks we gave
here is an example I wrote a book upon
joining Google and it sold 700 thousand
copies and we've hosted a Google Code
Jam which in which 13,000 people entered
and competed and up there is me giving
the award to the champion who shortly
after that join Google but it's
important also that we tell people this
is Google you're joining you're not
joining an outsourcing company you're
not joining a localization company
you're joining a company that has
special values that we we believe in
equal equality that we believe in
changing the world that we believe in
providing access to information
organizing the world's information that
we believe in that that it's really very
engineering centric organization and we
really want to make sure people
understand this is a special unique
different company so we have special
orientations set up I gave so many talks
I can't count to our new hires we have
old-timers who come and visit actually
Fung was one of them and but but
whenever they come we have round tables
and of course we have to lead by example
and remember that we represent Google
culture not culture of other companies
we may have worked for and we have to
localize the jobs ok we can't just say
hey one-size-fit-all everywhere is equal
well you know in China they employ the
height the people we hire aren't going
to be as good English speakers so as
long as they're willing to learn English
we're happy to take on the anyone who's
a good researcher and engineer we also
create mentorship so that people get
help and we have lots of training
including 6 to 12 months was training
training in Mountain View which is
rather exceptional because we're betting
everything in long term these employees
were very long-term we're willing to
train them even if they're not going to
be instantaneously squeezing them every
line of code out of them that is not our
goal is to prepare them for the long
haul
and of course make it fun this is what
you know Google - before you're among in
an office that's a lot of fun but we
think the China office is even more fun
we do a lot of office team-building
activities so here you see some of the
fun things we've done we've done office
decoration on the left side you see a
some people brought a tent
another group brought a bed and I
remember seeing the the the mover who
brought the bed in from the furniture
store just shaking his head and said I
can't believe this company letting
employee spring bed in the office we
have other and we also just move into
our new big building this we moved in
last September this is our building in
Beijing in John Wenshan near Ching Wan
University were there for an obvious
reason this is recruiting of course this
is our lobby and this shows you some of
the historic pictures of the people on
the lower right-hand side you'll see a
bunch of people crawling on the floor
and getting picture taken that is to
symbolize you know some people like to
call Google gogo dog dog so they're
trying to be cute dogs there and here is
a picture of people writing lots of fun
things on our billboard you can see
people really have a very outgoing fun
mentality you know somebody decided to
put a sponsored AdWords on the bottom of
that page for example here is at our
opening ceremony of our new building and
then you see pictures of lots of people
really working in a place that's highly
very colorfully decorated and there and
here is the very Chinese decoration in
one of the offices and more people
coding away our famous surround you with
monitors and this is our karaoke room
that's to show you we do localize you
know you don't see one of those in
Kirkland
if you come to our massage room guess
what is not just back massage it's also
foot massage of course some things are
universal so you got our exercise room
and foosball and lower is the pool table
and then left side another Chinese
tradition right dance dance revolution
and of course the most famous cafeteria
we were just interviewing in December
for our for our executive chef and we
advertised all over China
we in fact looked for a consultant who
is kind of the expert of knowing who's
the best chef in China said can you
recommend a couple of people to come an
interview and what he said was can I
interview and he's actually one of the
finalists here's the picture of the
other finalists
we'll be opening our cafeteria in March
okay we can't claim to have the most
engineers or the most senior engineers
but I'm certain it will have the best
food of all of our offices so that's how
we went about building a great team now
when the hot talk just a little bit
about market opportunities I know you're
all here curious what we're building in
China so needless to say I can't tell
you what we're building but I can tell
you what we've looked at the market you
can see a lot of this from analysts
studies to what are the interesting
market opportunities you know we may or
may not tackle all of them we talked a
little bit about the community concept
but here is a couple of others we'll
start with the search so when it comes
to just pure web search that's our core
business our bread-and-butter thing with
that matters to the most to us here we
know that quality matters that we know
that if we could improve our search
quality lead over our competitors by
some gap then users will notice then
word-of-mouth or spread then market
share will change will improve and
that's what we saw in 2001 when Google
pulled pulled ahead of its competitors
and you could argue that that gap hasn't
yet been realized again
in a lot of various markets but we think
we are actually making so much progress
in search quality and if you don't
believe it go home and search for
something really difficult in Chinese
and see if we do better now with search
quality you can't beat someone else all
the time you'll be lucky to you know win
two out of three that would be really
really good but I think we're gonna get
there and when you're 2 out of 3 users
will move over
now of course brand also matters now we
fully recognize that in the Google brand
advantage in the US isn't necessarily
carried over abroad and we certainly
don't claim that we have such an
advantage in China so we have to work
harder ok secondly that we also notice
that all search engines the Chinese
quality are lower than English ok our
Chinese is not as good as our English
Yahoo's Chinese is not as good as their
English to us that means there's an
opportunity it just means we haven't
worked hard at it with search quality
you can't come up with an innovation
overnight you just have to labor away
day after day night after night and
that's what we've been doing and were
rewarded by seeing significant relevance
improvements I believe we were ahead
last year I think we're significantly
ahead today and you'll have to judge for
yourself if you can't see that in our
Chinese search but of course relevance
which means still how good are the top
three or five results that's this one
metric it's a little bit academic and of
the day people have to look at the whole
page and see that hey you got this you
got that you got this feature and the
experience looks good the UI looks good
the font looks pretty the highlighting
looks nice all of that is what its gonna
take to really win in search experience
and we realize we still have things we
need to do and you need only compare us
with some of the other engines to see
that hey there are a few areas to Google
could do better so we know that we're
working on it so huh here is our product
roadmap
it has X's on all the things that
haven't shift but you can see we got
lots of them ok and then there's that
score search there's a lot of adjacent
search opportunities just like in the US
many of
you probably have got used to you know
new search image search other searches
we also think they're important for
China and we're going to need to once we
get we're not I think web search is now
under control making progress we need to
look at some of these this is not a
promise that all of these are being
worked on or are important but basically
looking at the market these seem
important to a search company so new
search is big because it's one of the
top three uses journalists use it and
they're very influential image search is
important somehow Chinese love to look
at pictures we think that this can be
ten or twenty percent of traffic book
search is quite important china is the
world's largest publisher of books so
making that available through for
example Google has a global book search
program which even makes offline books
searchable they'll not readable and
downloadable necessarily depending on
copyright restrictions and we think
that's important especially if we want
to also help move some of the gaming
internet masses to the knowledge seeking
internet masses a scholar search is
quite important actually China Google
already has launched that and Google
some scholar search Chinese is a number
two language after English and we're
already seeing in Chinese universities
some maybe not quite as much as in the
American universities professors are
arguing not so much about how who has
more cited as CI
index articles but arguing who ranks
higher on Google Scholar that's a good
sign of success and blog and BBS search
is is very important in China because
that's um a lot of news is actually done
a lot of reporters in China nowadays
don't look for phone calls to get news
they go to BBS and blogs and try to mine
news out of that it's an interesting
phenomenon that that's quite unique to
China so providing that kind of a search
also matches the emerging web 2.0
content which is really large as you
know the most popular blog in China I
think has about I believe 60 million in
pageviews in the past few months that's
that's how large it is it's just one
person even my blog has over a million
pageviews which is pretty good and I
hardly put anything in it and knowledge
search is an interesting concept it kind
of started in Korea where there's a lack
of solid web content so people created
questions and others answered them and
then they got linked together sort of to
create for the scarcity of data and the
web and that's taken off in a few places
I think it's pretty big in Korea taking
off in Japan and possibly that's an
Asian phenomenon hasn't seemed to have
really taken off in the in the US or
Europe and the last leaf client software
is an interesting opportunity and also a
challenge those of you who have
relatives in China would know that PCs
are infected with them malware and
spyware taken over by spyware redirects
your gum sometimes people tell us hey
when I type Google com how come I'm
redirected to this other website did you
guys do it no no some malware did
something bad
right then ads pop up and and also
hijacking the address bar is very very
popular and messing up your registry
settings and I'm hopeful that with those
fists that may solve some of the
problems but but it is a huge problem in
China but there's also a big opportunity
because people really are used to
downloading shareware and software
perhaps they're a bit too trusting and I
think you know we can at the same time
provide a lot of value add useful
software for people to download and use
but at the same time trying to increase
awareness that people need to be careful
and there are certain companies and
products one could trust and perhaps
others less so so these are various
opportunities that one could address in
China another one is local Chinese
Internet users needless to say are
concentrated in the metropolitan areas
and these people are starting to get
prosperous and wealthy they're making
more money they're able to get internet
access they're also able to you know buy
their girlfriend flowers on
time's day or look for a nice restaurant
and perhaps look for a nicer rental
maybe buy a house perhaps even buy a car
and look for driving directions and bus
routes and and public transit and and
all that is happening in the city see
that that that's an opportunity that I
think is interesting and for those of
you were Chinese this is about East
reducing or sugar why I love write
something that's so I think people
really will not really gravitate towards
for the 5,000 years of history and also
there are a number of opportunities
still open there's no yellow pages
there's no local search leadership
there's no classified ads there's no
Craigslist yet and there's very little
legal risks this is just about you know
buying nice cheap useful stuff this has
nothing to do with you know information
or sensitive sensitivities and and also
this happen entually could really
connect well with mobile so here I just
show a couple of examples of popular
websites that I use you know Gangji is a
good craigslist like site cushion is a
nice classified search so fun is a nice
real estate search and damping is a nice
restaurant search so it's a little bit
hard to use but one could imagine the
set of things we'll want to emerge and
be developed further one one potential
opportunity would be you can imagine if
you go to Google and let's say you go to
our web search or even local search in
your type gourmet food Beijing one Fuji
and you might get some result like that
with restaurant ratings and everything
and that's something you can actually
try out this is where it's in an
experimental phase if you want to try it
out it's called D 2 dot google.com D 2
is felt the ITU of course there's a big
mobile opportunities we talked about
this earlier with 440 million people
using the mobile phone and with 40% of
them on the web I think that's a little
bit exaggerated these are people who
paid for web capabilities perhaps only a
quarter of them actually use WAP on a
regular basis but with 1 billion SMS
there's even opportunities without WEP
to really address this wonderful market
so the opportunities I can see are you
know just searching on that on China
Mobile's net of all the possible
downloads and books to listen to and
read and bring tones and music and
pictures that that China Mobile and its
partners provide that's already very
rich millions of pieces of data
searching that is difficult
of course WAP search over in general
searching everything that's even bigger
and then connections to local I talked
about you can imagine you know I was
asking about a citron restaurant nearby
or ATM near my house or bus route to go
to work these are things you could
imagine sending a short SMS and getting
some responses on we've partnered with
that China Mobile in mainland China
Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan and we're
building a worldwide platform and we're
learning a lot from deployment
especially in Japan where we're really
quite advanced working with KDDI hoping
to really bring that to even a larger
number of users in China video and music
are both big but they're both difficult
video is big because of the high
broadband penetration the market is
growing big there's not a youtube yet
they're probably 30 YouTube copycats
there the licensing rules are unclear
currently you have to be a domestic
company to get a video license but
that's possibly going to change in the
next year music on the other hand is
huge already in China it's the number
one content being searched for and most
of the Chinese users have used it and
yet the court decisions and presidencies
are not really quite established there's
been a couple of lawsuits recently and
the the good music labels won some and
lost some the ones they lost seems to
create indicate it's going to be quite
difficult for music labels to assert
their copyright in China because the
laws are rather complex and still
evolving I'm certainly hopeful that over
time there will be greater respect for
IP and copyright but certainly right now
this looks like somewhat chaotic
market with the music labels not able to
make make a lot of money on their on the
on their creation so those are just some
possible market opportunities I forgot
to list community as another one
communities are big i talked already
about BBS and i mentioned it earlier but
that would be another area i think is
quite important so lastly let me talk a
little bit about okay so if if if you
should feel hey google china's get
ghada's act together i think number one
reason is we're taking the long-term
view or hiring great people
number two is we're and then analyzing
the market and we're gonna build stuff
that the market wants but I think
another third one is we want to have
strong connections to our headquarters
and worldwide Rd if you look at all the
companies that have failed in China it
often comes down to is the team in China
trusted and empowered to do the job and
needs to do ok if headquarters does not
trust its China team holds very tight
reins controls it tightly and forces
global platform doesn't allow it to
innovate and build products and control
the UI then those companies have tended
to fail so as I started to build up the
team and build a longer-term plan in
China I also realized it's important for
the China team to establish credibility
and also to educate the headquarters why
China is unique important growing and
critical to the company's future so here
are just some pictures that you can see
that sort of represent the work that we
have done this is Eric Schmidt visiting
China talking to the Chinese and the
American ambassador to China about how
to do business in China and why why it's
important to us and to to Google here's
a picture of our general counsel or a
head of engineering among other senior
people listening to to two VIPs such as
the Ambassador speaking about the
importance of China this is you know by
the way this isn't great being low a
very Chinese hotel that we took them to
here's a visit to University here is a
bunch of our senior people visiting
Beijing University interacting with the
students this is
Jeff Dean our Google fellow explaining
technology to a bunch of Batallion
professors this is Gotham one of our
senior engineers some on the web
prowling this is Marissa Meyer our VP of
Product Management and this is Mike
Dixon head of our Google News and then
just to make sure people have engraved
in their minds that this is a country
with 5,000 years of history and some of
the interesting challenges and
opportunities come from the years of
history we have Googlers reenact some of
the pasts of things in Google's history
this one is showing the glorious days to
the extent that the Chinese people feel
so proud and in some cases maybe even
superior of of its its history and
successes this is channel 1 the
accepting
barbarians of tokens of appreciation and
if people want to know you know how did
the current government form its
credibility and and and how it
disseminates information to the public
this shows the the basically a set of
people in the propaganda group in the
military trying to disseminate key
information this shows well why are
there Chinese people so suddenly
grasping on to prosperity this shows
sort of a rapid attempt to jump and
catch up with the 21st century in the
rural area of a weather wedding might
look like to understand how the Chinese
government works this is a mock debate
of two several cabinet members arguing
about a particular issue showing you how
the Chinese government bureaucracy works
and this is people being entertaining
the audience and this is uh Alan Eustace
my boss and a bunch of Engineers getting
little
read books and flipping through them
this is everybody in the Chinese uniform
this is our Chinese our name launched
it's the big Google style party this is
the Google dance this is more pictures
this is one of the Googlers getting
tricked on stage so lots of fun but
really connecting so that people
understand why it is the way it is and
how we can learn from the lessons of the
past understanding the Chinese culture
people expectations feelings so that we
have a chance to be successful lastly
I'm going to talk a little bit about
Hardy a little bit about how we do Rd
how we do a worldwide how we develop
products and how and lastly how we
connect with Kirkland so very
interesting fact is that we have 30 Rd
offices worldwide all built in three
years this is probably a unbelievable
feat by any imaginable any possible
imagination can see it all over the
world in Europe Russia Eastern Europe
Israel United States Canada Australia
Brazil in the Japan and of course China
so how do we do all this well these are
a couple of things that we try to do one
is we have a how do you avoid redundancy
with so many R&amp;amp;D centers well we
actually have we'd actually manage
everything by the internet right by the
internet in this case we keep all of our
projects milestones progress is all
included in what's called PDB our
product database and that this this will
ensure that we before you do something
while you better search for this this
thing you're building to make sure if
someone else isn't building in maybe you
can use theirs or they can use yours or
you can do it together and of course
sometimes you know a little bit
redundancy if it's alternate approaches
could make sense now let the internet
proof which is the best approach second
is that we want to be reasonable about
work distribution you know we're not
going to force each group to us to
assign you know China shall work on X
curricula more work on why we're also
not going to let them randomly pick so
really we try to get
chardee Center to have to drive certain
larger initiatives and you'll hear about
some of the projects driven in Kirkland
and in China for example and we
encourage collaboration you don't want
the collaboration and when you have
collaboration you want to divide up
components if you have a project X
that's got three components you know you
don't have three people in you don't
have people in three sites working on
all aspects of the three components and
that's a recipe for disaster
ideally you want just you know two sites
or so to work on the projects and you
want each one to clearly own certain
components and one of them to be the
primary delivery right so that comes out
fairly naturally but who the thought
leaders or critical mass is we
communicate a lot that's why I've spent
a lot of time traveling the second time
I'm in Kirkland I've been to a lot of
other offices peter wilson who's in the
back who manages our Kirkland office
won't be coming to China to visit us so
lots of travel but also we believe video
conferencing does work and we install it
in every conference room actually in
almost every conference room we have a
setup like this one with two projectors
when able to project PowerPoint or a
demo the other one showing people at the
other side and of course that's a camera
allowing for two-way communication and
we have lots of mailing lists meetings
and gatherings and lastly it's important
to give some top-down direction you know
not micromanagement but just high-level
direction that everything we do should
be about organizing the world's
information so that's how we give people
a lot of freedom but you know we also
don't have a lot of random projects and
we have a very simple rule of 70-20-10
of doing 70% search and ads 20% related
to search and 10% brand new things and
we try to manage that distribution
across the board just to give four
people we're not familiar with Google
here's here's how we innovate in
contrast with many models of innovation
I've worked in many companies and here
are some of the research R&amp;amp;D ideas
everyone run into so if you think about
R&amp;amp;D it's really research and development
research is the person who comes up with
a cool idea generally measured about how
cool and new it is development is the
process of turning into useful product
generally measured by user requests and
and and usage or or if you're selling a
product revenue or volume but this R&amp;amp;D
aren't really one entity they're really
two entities so how have other come the
companies manage them right there's been
a purely ivory tower approach just do
research and when you're done publish a
paper and you're done that's what
universities do and that's what Isaac
Newton did right of course it took many
hundred years before his ideas really
mattered but he was just a researcher
and still many professors do that and
there's a role in the place for that but
that's not our model another model is
building they will come let the research
to scientists come up with something and
then whatever they say go make it into a
product that's how Xerox PARC came up
with all those great innovations but as
the scientists started driving products
they tend to make mistakes and that's
why graphical user interface bitmap
displays Ethernet and so on all were
wonderful ideas but not privatized by
Xerox PARC another one is reversed DNR
basically hey it's about making money
satisfying customers just go ask
customers what they want find out what
makes money and we'll even have them
will have them drive all the priorities
of innovation if customers ask for
feature X you shall build X if you'd
build Y in customers don't think they
want it you shall not build y now that
model of course will satisfy the
customers but the downside of that
approach is that you'll miss the
disruptive innovations imagine 15 years
ago asking customers hey do you want a
browser you know they'll say what no
right if you take that model there would
never be a browser so that's good for
some things but not always great some
companies just have separate Rd you know
have a research lab and have a product
development organization and I think the
good thing about that is you can measure
each one by its own metrics by research
by how innovative and new it is
development by how useful profitable and
how large a volume and you sell and use
and then the to interact by research
coming up with innovations and selling
it by going to a product group saying
take this and then private group can in
requests please innovate in this area
and they're separately managed until
they generally are at the CEO or
president level those are some of the
advantages that this advantage of the
approach is that you know humans are
humans there's going to be emotions
mixed in in all this interaction right
researchers will want to home things
some researchers will feel hey I'm the
smart PhD I should get all the credit
and I should own and tell you what to do
and some private people are going to
feel hey I'm the one that's making money
for for the customer you're just you
know a random researcher and I certainly
have been in both shoot both sides of
the negotiation and I can tell you it's
quite frustrating to be in research
coming up with a brilliant innovation
going to a private group and they say oh
we don't have time for you customers
aren't asking for this go away and then
three years later they would say hey our
competitor just did that I want it
tomorrow
so that would be the downside of the
separate R&amp;amp;D so each of this has
strengths and weaknesses so Google's
approach is very simple is that R equals
D so we bought people who are innovative
and get stuff done and the reason we
want that is we firmly believe people
who come up with ideas love the ideas
who also have strong engineering
capabilities they're just more driven
more motivated to work harder and get
stuff done and there's no human emotion
politics or technology transfer it's
that same person who would get it done
and we also want people who are
innovative so that they don't have to be
managed closely so there you know
self-starters come up with ideas not
ready to just be told what to do and can
also be very open to admit failure when
ideas don't work so I think Google's
magic really is finding a set of people
who are innovative and also good
engineers and Jen and also the other
things care deeply about customers and
then really empowering and trusting them
and management merely becomes a matter
of recruiting and setting up processes
and supporting the teams and doing you
know prioritization when necessary but
largely the people are the one who drive
the organization and really the Google's
innovation is modeled by some of these
some adjectives I put here you know R
equals D want B
who are innovative and good engineers
now of course there's a downside some
really great researchers who could
writing papers they may not completely
fit in right some people who are amazing
engineers but who don't have good ideas
they may not be perfect fit for this
organization so we may not hire an every
great person but we hire people who fit
the mold freedom 20% time this famous
thing at Google two people have 20% the
time to do what they want and do what
they want within the constraint it ought
to fit in the corporate mission and for
the 80% time the project they're
assigned is fairly easy to change what
they work on and and with democratic in
the sense that if you want to work on
your 20% project if you want to vote
would people have vote on this idea list
that we have in the company some idea
that has a lot of support people will
jump on the band where I couldn't help
you make it happen and that's very
unique Google's very real-time so rather
than doing very in-depth expensive
market surveys on hypothetical questions
we just put it put both versions
available if you have two possible ways
of doing UI you could render 10 search
results or 30 search results you know
rather than asking people which do you
want
you just make both available and see
which user exhibit positive behavior
positive behavior means you know more
searches that they more click throughs
and so on and that example actually is
not hypothetical when we ask people do
you want 10 or 30 people say 30 right
the more the better but when we measured
it people preferred 10 because there's a
small increase in the amount of the time
it takes to render 30 so as to
negatively impact people's satisfaction
but it's impossible to predict that
upfront in a marketing survey so we just
implement both versions let half the
user try a half try B and then based on
how they respond we'll know which is
better it's faster and more accurate
there are user centric we really believe
in building great product getting users
to love it the rest will come the rest
meaning making money will come later and
sometimes certain properties we have
like news are not monetized but that's
ok
because news users like Google they do
web searches where we do make money and
then lastly everything we do is driven
by our mission people speculate could
Google be building product X product Y
product Z the answer is really very
simple if you think it fits our mission
mission there's reasonable likelihood we
might be doing it if it doesn't fit our
mission then it's a lot more unlikely
and this innovation model interestingly
matches the Internet so I'm not here to
say every company and I know there's
some Boeing engineers here
I'm not saying bullying should innovate
this way you know you can't just build
two airplanes and fly them and see which
one crashes that that wouldn't be very
good you'll get good feedback but you
might also have other problems so it
doesn't fit every industry it fits the
internet industry so because internet
industry has similar characteristics so
that's how we innovate so basically how
product is created as an engineer comes
up with a new idea sorry this is in
Chinese applause explain in English and
then people vote this is 20% time I came
up with a new idea people vote the ones
that get lots of votes you get to build
a prototype because people vote with
their feet they'll come and help you
three of you might pull your time
together build this 20% prototype and
try it out within the company people
like it great then we put in Google Apps
if you haven't visited Google Apps
please do and then we measure how people
you like it within Google Apps if they
like it then it goes into beta and then
if that goes well then it becomes a new
product and the innovator often goes on
to the next idea so that's how a lot of
our products from Google News to Google
Scholar to News Alerts mobile products
all came out of this 20% project in the
bubble chart with lots of excess I
showed you for China some of them came
out of 20% projects that our new campus
hires came up with and basically did on
their own initiative so lastly I just
want to say a few words about Google
Seattle these are a bunch of engineers
in this very same room Google Kirkland
office was established in oh four and
now there are two over 200 engineers
just like I mentioned for China it's
very productive lots of great people
ship lots of products many
brewing and has the same culture
projects massages free meals and ski
trips and intro and another interesting
thing is that where Kirkland and China
are partnering in building a number of
projects because there are a lot of
exciting projects in Kirkland and they
have interesting applicability in China
in many cases they have to be modified
and changed not just localized
in some cases their underlying core
technologies that might be applied
different ways in China
so Peter Siva and I talked about hey
shall we have a small group here or
maybe even a large group over time that
takes on hey can we take all the great
things being done in Kirkland all the
great opportunities in China
and hire a small number of people or
medium number of people to tackle those
opportunities basically the same culture
and and work on both sides and
excitement is that this team would get
to work with fast-growing China and the
employees on this team might stay in
Kirkland forever might go to China in
three months or they might go in the
year or two years and Google is very
flexible employee transfers are very
very easy because we know there are a
lot of talent in this area and that
people don't always want to move to
China tomorrow even though I did so
where we are growing this this this
effort some of the great projects some
Kirkland has developed that you're
probably a proud user of includes Google
Maps Google Video Google Talk Google
pact Google Master Central and many many
others on both client and server side so
clearly here we're looking for people
who you know like working on server
service have Linux expertise but we're
also interested in people who have
client-side expertise development but
Windows applications so it's fairly
broad set of skill sets and generally
speaking people who are innovative and
good engineers are just great at Google
there's we don't really have you know
you must know language X or operating
system why good smart people learn very
quickly and that's what we found in
China that's why the new hires new
campus hires we have are able to become
productive after just months and of
course we're still growing rapidly
chyna we actually have almost 400 people
in Google China I talked only about the
engineering part and we have about 120
future starts so counting all that it's
about 500 people that we've hired and
about to start and about 150 to 200 are
in engineering that's what what I mainly
talked about but of course we also have
you know marketing product management
sales business development finance many
many other areas we are looking for
senior people in technology engineering
product management business groups and
we have locations in a lot of places too
so if you know people who might be
interested please do let us know and
that's the end of my talk thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
