executive of the organization behind a
project called history pin that we've
been working on with your colleagues in
mainly in London but also over here and
in New York for about a year and a half
now and which we properly launched on
Monday so I'm going to tell you a little
bit about how the project got started
how we've been working with you guys and
what we launched on Monday and how we
launched it and how it how it interacts
with maps will do a quick demo and how
weather where we're planning on going
like I was just saying to some guys
beforehand we've only just scratched the
surface and the kind of response to the
project this week's made us realize that
this thing can go in so many different
directions in there so many different
ways so and we'd love to start some
conversations from this about what some
of those directions might be so I'm
going to wind back to the very beginning
we're a nonprofit social organization
based in London and our roots are in
communities in neighborhoods looking at
ways for people to come together and
interact in different ways we don't do
that by kind of raising awareness and
getting people to you know volunteer and
be good citizens to take a
responsibility we do that by putting
things into the world that nudge people
prompt people to interact in in
different ways to generate more social
capital in neighborhoods to get
conversations going across generations
to increase understanding across
different groups and if sheep it is an
example about it so kind of biggest and
best project so far that does that and
so just taking you back to the start of
the project this is my grandmother on
the right-hand side and my great auntie
in august 1943 working aslan girls in a
little village in the middle of in the
middle of England and before my gran
died a few years ago we spent a lot of
time around photographs and home videos
sharing stories getting a better
understanding of each other's lives and
it made me wish up she died I've done it
sooner and more often and talking to the
team and talking to our partners and in
our in the neighborhoods we work in this
is a pretty common human experience that
you spend time around an old photo in a
story and it does something a little bit
magic and it draws out conversations and
relationships and understanding the
other
of things can't and increases your
relationship with the places and the
people in your lives in a particularly
interesting way so from this photograph
and my grand love this photograph partly
because because it was it was a really
intense time it was a middle of the
Second World War and life was hard it
was Karma here than in you know
Stalingrad or on the on the front but it
was it was an intense time and also just
off this photograph was taken a young
man drove along the road behind this
field and was so taken by these pretty
land girls that he crashed into the
ditch and my grandma was pretty pretty
pleased to tell me about how she had
some devastating good looks in her day
so it was really lovely charming
memories for me and and it started a
little bit of a journey not just into my
family not about not just about what had
passed between kind of parents and
grandparents and but also the
relationship between between me and this
place which is a family farm this is
what that field looks like now so the
difference is between my experience and
her experiences fields of fields in the
40s and now but the road in her time
looked a bit like this and these people
are parked on the side of the road to go
for a Sunday walk now the road looks a
bit more like this a pretty big a pretty
big root down the middle of England and
lots of haulage trucks changed the whole
atmosphere and the tone of the village
and and it started a an interesting
process for me about you know making
comparisons between her time and my time
speaking to neighbors speaking to local
people speaking to people that have
moved in or moved away from the area for
a you know for a few generations and and
it led us to to he led me to start a
hold of the conversations with the team
and with our partners as I said into how
we could unlock the kind of untapped
social potential of this content so
everyone's got boxes under their beds
and in their attic Betamax tapes that
aren't digitized and beyond that
archives and institutions have got
millions and millions
millions of pieces of content all of
which can play a role both in in you
know the small conversations across
different generations across garden
fences between neighbors but the really
big conversations across societies and
cultures about where we've been and
where we're going understanding that to
move forward across some of the
challenges we face we have to look back
as often as possible so yeah the roots
of history pin was unlocking this
content that is often buried and
untapped and allowing people to interact
with it on mass as an organization we're
all about mass participation and mass
access and this seemed to do so much for
those two sides at the final piece of
content that I dug up was this little
home video of that same road kind of in
between our two live between now and
then and one in really nice thing about
this new phase of history pin which
we've just launched it at it it's not
just photographs it's also home videos
and audio files and so allowing a home
or at types of content to be shared so
um I want to give you a little walk
around obviously you know you can dip
into history pencom any time but I'm
going to give you a very walk quick walk
around it's based upon obviously the
Google Maps API and obviously allowing
you to search by location but also
adding this fourth dimension adding this
timeline so allowing you to pick
particular dates that date bar will get
more and more granular as more and more
layers of content get added at the
moment you know there's fifty thousand
pieces on content shared over the desk
test phase each image comes with
particular metadata date caption and and
location you can attach stories and then
images that are outdoors and street
level can be layered onto modern Street
View scenes creating this really nice
overlay effect which a few people have
been doing really nicely we're kind of
opening us up for anybody fail to do
with their home photos and people have
found it a really really kind of nice
creative experience in ways of bringing
their old memories to life these are
streets in in Greenwich Village in New
York and as you can see the journey
around three
viewers is really creative and engaging
so and another thing we've now able to
do is I'm not just about people to make
comparisons between old photographs and
Street View views but also go into
places where those three few views don't
exist which could be indoors or in other
public spaces and to via the app take
exact modern replicas of old pictures so
anything can now be match between now
and then and we can get a series of
windows a series of layers I'm in
particular locations so those
comparisons really engaging and are now
be able to be multiplied all over the
place and so another big thing that came
onto this new version of history pin
with video content which again if it's a
still camera point can be overlaid
creating this really great kind of
ghostly effect at the moment this takes
some particular work from our moderation
team it's not that easy for users to do
themselves but it will get easier and
easier but again as you're wandering
around the streets looking at particular
areas being able to open up these little
moving windows is a really a fantastic
way of opening up a relationship with
those with those times and those people
and so and then and then finally audio
which I'm not sure is going to play
through this might just be coming
through my slightly tinny laptop and but
yeah yeah yeah so that's a little
recording from yeah the the
announcements of the Second World War
and so audiophile speeches music live
performances
so as you can see being able to arrive
on any street corner in any building dip
into images moving images audio files
narratives collections features that
allows all this to be grouped together
around particular events or themes or
particular areas providing different
ways of bringing out elements of content
and this really exciting feature which
we which people are really loving where
it can be strung together in tours so a
particular narrative can be told across
the world or across a particular area so
as you can see there's some extra
narrative added to each step on the top
right hand corner you follow it on the
map you can add an audio clips little
little beetles tour around the world
made up of videos and and audio clips
and pictures and finishing up with this
great one on the shoulder Lizzie where
they closed it down and got mobbed by
fans and so yeah that and that could be
applied to anything personal cause
people people moving all over the world
and living in different parts particular
events related to civil war data there's
so many so many areas this could go and
this is just showing about how
institutions and users can have a
particular presence which is something
we're going to build on a lot over the
next year I'll on that and allowing
those organizations to not just have a
great presence on history pin in the
same way that you have a youtube channel
you could have a history pin channel
which has got your collections and tours
and features but then embed all of that
on your own sites so we'll launch the n
bed tool early January will also be
launching ways for organizations
institutions to be able to share tens of
thousands hundreds of thousands of
pieces of content in one go as well come
to I come to in a minute those
relationships with institutions we've
got some really important principles
will apply to those you know we were
using Creative Commons for them to be
able to be shared and more widely having
been shared on history pin and we've
just brought on John boss from
for disc opening about San Francisco
office who's his background is
particularly in linked open data so when
institutions share with history pin and
and standardize their data and open it
up then it can be accessed and used and
mashed by other organizations there are
other projects like this to pin this
isn't trying to call of the market in
mashing up all content is trying to open
up the market and so you know those
commitments are built into that and then
the history pin app which is currently
just on Android from Monday but comes
out on iphone in a couple of weeks and
this takes I mean you can see where it
goes pretty naturally onto the streets
and onto mobile tools it takes all of
this content and allows you to be
followed by it as you're wandering
around the streets so three main areas
of the app explore a location using a
map or using your camera view and
augmented reality posting a photo and
exploring some collections so the map
yeah again fairly straightforward
timeline and allowing your location to
be allow you to see what what content is
in your location pulling up images and
the stories attached to them and then
holding up your camera and being able to
see images that are close by you can see
at the bottom there's the distance data
from how far away you are from those
images holding that full screen and
walking towards Earth at one's 177
meters away and then you get right up to
the location and you can get this
comparison between old and you and I'm
again you know people have been been
doing these kind of things but this is
really we feel opening it up to allow
both greater access to and greater kind
of a participation and contributions of
all of these things one really nice
thing that the feature the app does is
encourage people as you saw when I did
the site demo to take exact modern
replicas of old pictures so indoors
outdoors public private spaces all of
those old pictures can be
layered onto modern comparisons which it
already has become a little bit of a
craze on the site because it really does
open up that old content to a new
audience part of the you know motivation
for this was that you showed some old
pictures to a 17 year old in a classroom
and it doesn't it's it's it's not got a
natural you know it's not part of their
world it's not got a natural the gravity
whereas when you start overlaying it
being odd to fade in and out being able
to add a whole series of maps the
content just comes completely alive my
background in teaching and youth work
and we've got some other members the
team have done that and the impact of
that in the classroom is extraordinary
and this these apt tools really expand
on the capacity to be able to do that on
a bigger scale so so yeah once once
you've taken a picture you then go
through a pretty simple upload process
to pin it you can also take a picture of
an old picture which is the way of
scaling up scanning and digitization or
add oil or other modern event so we're
excited about the next kind of you know
major historical events when people have
got this app they can all record it and
and you know place it in that moment in
that time capture that moment in history
share their stories so the next
presidential inauguration or or a royal
wedding or whatever it is and you've got
thousands of people sharing pictures
sharing memories and much smaller
occasions that we get lots of people
who've got pictures then coming out at
the grocery store you know equally its
moments in history we have these debates
about what is and what isn't a valuable
contribution to the site and we take a
pretty straightforward what I do it's an
ongoing debate but everything is a
contribution to this and the idea of the
system is that you find what you want to
find if you want to go on to a
particular street corner I find out what
I haven't yesterday you can do that we
filter out a little bit of the modern
stuff when you first arrive so that
you're finding the more interesting
comparisons and the more interesting
narrative but essentially you know I was
pointed near his chair and say that
chair was here at this particular place
this particular time and it is in some
sense a contribution to history if it's
recorded and it's not our it's not our
judgment on whether or not that's
valuable if it was a chair in 1840 with
a you know a queen sitting in it then it
will suddenly become valuable but that's
not a kind of value judgment that we
make as part of the project also on here
and the tools will come on soon being
able to flick through content when
you're not on location we recognize that
people don't spend a lot of time
wandering around the streets like that
and they just want something when
they're you know on the subway on the
bus being able to flick through
interesting content and I'm you know
within this one thing we can't do
collections or tours yet is for people
to be able to draw down the street view
comparisons via the app because of the
way the API works but we we are able for
for when people add their own modern
comparisons for those to become part of
those offline experiences as well so we
just taking a little step back to how
we've been working with with your
colleagues in different parts of the
world we took the idea to them when we
had some some some mock-ups and the kind
of social backdrop the aims and it
really resonated with with it with the
teams we spoke to in London OB Felton
who said of consumer marketing for
Europe was a particular lead figure on
this and I mean one route was resisted
to use the API and get stuck in and get
our great digital team led by Mike where
is he gone early that yeah sorry llo by
mike and our team of bugger developers
based in sofia but another route was to
have a more a kind of rich a
relationship with google and to explore
you know to get the most out of the
tools to collaborate more widely with
the community in education and marketing
teams and that that's been a fantastic
relationship fast and we hope and a kind
of enjoyable and creative relationship
for the people we work with I think you
know and two specific elements were
particularly interesting to the team in
London one was
the digital inclusion agenda in the UK
is particularly prominent at the moment
the numbers are fairly low compared to
the rest of Europe but we're still at 10
million people offline 10 million more
people who use the internet so
irregularly you know they don't really
count as being online and around
sixty-five percent of them are over 65
so it's not just about access and
broadband and community facilities it's
about content that is relevant and
engaging and providing a motivation for
getting online so that was one
particular area this opened up and the
other was was really around you know
after a wave of you know amazing
launches of Street View there were
little pockets of kind of discontent
about what you know about what street
view meant about whether was an invasion
of privacy these arguments were
particularly prevalent in you know in
Germany and there was some kind of we
have a paper called The Daily Mail in
the UK which kind of goes straight for
the populists angle and and they said it
was you know inviting robbers into
houses and all that kind of stuff you
guys read the media but essentially you
know this demonstrators help demonstrate
this was incredibly powerful tool this
is an incredibly powerful way of opening
up access to our streets into the world
and how projects like this could add
layers to that and that content to that
that that opened up even more to that so
we've collaborated with with tech teams
all over the place we've been here in
mono a few times and on Monday at the
launch we had we had Jesse Friedman from
the New York office talking about the
you know the way that this could be used
as an example for how people could could
creatively and socially use Google Maps
API and we'll come continue that
collaboration so finally before I great
to get some questions and suggestions
and comments and criticism anything is
at this point it's extremely valuable a
couple of points about what our role
within this is we've just used google
maps to open up a canvas for people to
add on at the moment photos and videos
and audio
miles and narratives soon will allow
other forms letters and diaries men were
just deciding exactly what the
relationship between those types of
content is but all types of content
belong as part of a historical narrative
of our streets our role within that is
really threefold one is around this idea
of mass participation and math access it
will be quite easy for a particular
organization or a particular group to
take ownership of history history the
battleground for politics so I mean even
more so here than in the UK where you
know who takes ownership of historical
events in historical content often wins
a political battle and the same thing
could happen to history pin particular
issues particular events particular
streets particular areas could have
their version of history imposed upon
them and the battle could be one but we
want it to be one momentarily until the
other side piles in the other side piles
in and the crowd eventually cuts all its
sharp jagged edges off and it becomes a
nice rounded view so mass participation
is absolutely crucial this can't be this
can't be just history enthusiasts this
can't be just institutions the telling
of human history can only be billions of
pieces of participation billions of
contributors all over the world so mass
is vital the second part which relates
to that is it has to get more and more
useful and more and more accurate it
can't just be layer upon layer upon
layer of subjective narrative or opinion
or political will it has to be something
that both the study and research or for
just general credibility in use has an
increasing objective value the way we're
doing that is we see a pin as
particularly important which is why we
stuck it in the name a pin represents
something on his deep in that can get
more and more accurate at the moment the
way the crowd can impact the accuracy of
a pin is it is it's fairly simple it's
just a suggestion but will introduce
much more sophisticated crowdsourcing
tools that allows people to debate the
date and location
of the pin and so it gets better and
better and better and better and the de
pinna always represents something
objective and always something that is
open to popular debate then the
narrative attached to that pin is always
subjective so a particular photo which
has been improved by 100 people to get
one piece of metadata could be
surrounded by a hundred different
stories all of which you know complement
or or contradict each other but that
that type of contribution will always
remain subjective so that relations
between objective subjective primary
secondary it's another particularly
important part and then thirdly I think
we as a community organization taking
this back onto the streets and that
sounds a bit a bit ghetto but we're
taking back into localities and its
neighborhoods and and making sure that
this isn't about a web two point O
project this is about the conversations
and relationships that we aim to kick
off in the first place so we've been
piloting what we call local history pin
projects in the UK which see and we're
about to start one with working with
Stanford University in East Palo Alto
and start one on in Harlem as well with
the museum City New York which sees a
very intense local experience and
facilitates participation from as many
groups as possible give schools and
colleges museums archives civic groups
neighborhood groups a really important
role to play and create an intensely
local experience where people come
together so yeah with those three
commitments and a small team in London
soon to be a bigger team in San
Francisco we're setting forth to see how
this in fall and falls at our launch on
monday we were lucky enough to have dr.
a professor Larry Lessig speak and he he
talked about the unpredictable uses of
the web and I think with this also he
was quick to say you know how people use
this and where it goes which is pretty
unpredictable we've we've got our
principles we've got our commitments
and we hope that by applying those we
can carry on guiding it as a positive
force but we're just beginning so we
look forward to hearing what you have to
say and thanks very much for coming and
so for questions and my team just over
here Mike John Natasha and Rebecca all
might have particular areas that I'm on
the module to respond particular
technical stuff but if you've got any
questions about any of this or comments
or recommendations and feel very free to
to go for it yeah yeah well so active
and passive active is applying kind of
fairly straightforward you know if is
spam or if there's an appropriate
offensive content that just comes down
or if someone flags that and the passive
stuff is more when people recommend
changes to the pin location and dates
with our team then shifts those around
that's pretty analog at the moment but
it'll become more sophisticated but we
don't make judgments on quality we just
make judgments on whether or not it you
know the fairly obvious tick boxes of
marketing spam offensive inappropriate
so I bet that will get challenged with
that and just as wikipedia has equipped
thousands of kind of active users to
join that army of moderators will do
exactly the same thing
okay well then we're going to be
sticking around for a bit here so feel
free to we've got some stickers I didn't
realize until we so working States how
important stickers were to a project but
we've got them and yeah feel free to
take some so yeah thanks everyone for
your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
