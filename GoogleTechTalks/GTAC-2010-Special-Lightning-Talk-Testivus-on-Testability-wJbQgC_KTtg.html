Savoia from Google in Mountain View I'm
really sorry i cannot be there in person
but as you will see at a very very busy
schedule here at Google in Mountain View
and I could not be frankly be bothered
to make the trip fortunately understand
that the organizers found a b-list
speaker to fill in for me good luck
James and in instead of giving your lab
presentation to ask you to provide for a
little video and so I decided to throw
them a bone and give them this video
about disability so we're do engineers
go looking for testing wisdom let's go
see
dozens if not hundreds of books about
testing having written most of them are
obsolete by the time the ink dries
through products in here how to bring
software security by James Whittaker how
to break software by James Whittaker how
to break web software by James Whittaker
oh here you change at Apple exploratory
software testing most of these books are
really not useful in fact I weep for the
trees that were killed and the squids
that were slaughtered to make the ink
for them so let's put them in the
recycling bin and hopefully they're used
for put to some better use something
like adult diapers so dunya whoa where
do you look for when you want some
software wisdom yeah oh the way of
testicles good choice well let's see
what the way of testicles has to tell us
about Tessa be
so what does testicles teach us about
testability there are many answers in
here all you have to do is look for that
this open a page at random and here we
already find something that address
accessibility it's a maxim that is a
title think of code and test as one and
it goes something like this when writing
the code think of the test when writing
the test think of the code when you
think of code and tests of one testing
is easy and the code is beautiful and I
believe this is the essence of
testability this does many people think
that test was just a bunch of mystic
poopoo easter egg Easter style stuff and
frankly I don't know what they think
that in fact if you actually go and look
at what is contained in Tesla's you will
find even more answers about testability
again let's pick a page at random the
best time to test is when the code is
fresh that's a tab of the maxim and it
reads your code is likely when it's
fresh it's soft and malleable as it ages
it becomes hard and brittle if you write
tests when the code is fresh and easy to
change testing will be easy and both the
code and the test will be strong
you
you
the fact that the organizer of G tag
give James Whitaker the optimum of
software test publishing a full hour to
peddle his books and his lame ideas and
meet the author of the much more
valuable testicles only five minutes to
record a video is completely
uncomfortable unacceptable unbelievable
and absolutely unfair if you know what I
think I think that you can take James
book roll it up
and by the way if you think you can cut
me off after five minutes you got
another thing coming there is no way
that I'm gonna stop
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
