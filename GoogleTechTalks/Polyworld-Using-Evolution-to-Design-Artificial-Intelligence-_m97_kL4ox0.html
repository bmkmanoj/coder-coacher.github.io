speaker is Virgil Griffith he's talking
about poly world using evolution to
design artificial intelligence and
having had to take artificial
intelligence classes in college I'd be
very happy to let evolution do it
instead of me debugging all those list
programs they gave me so Virgil as a
young lad read a little too much of
Douglas Hofstadter and he therefore
dedicated his life to cognitive science
and causing trouble after some
undergraduate at University of Alabama
he went to Indiana where he teamed up
with Larry Yeager some of the older
Googlers might know Larry Yeager from
Apple Computer he had a project called
poly world long time ago and it still
lives on and Virgil's been working on it
and adding features and things to it
Virgil has done internships at the Santa
Fe Institute and at the Keck Institute
and now as his first year as a grad
student at Cal Tech all right hi I'm
Virgil I'm first year guys into Caltech
um you can reach me that's my that's my
website for those of you wondering the
dot G R stands for Griffith people be
confused about that I'm not Greek that's
my email address so so joy yes I'll be
talking to you about basically trying to
use evolutionary algorithms as a
shortcut to creating artificial
intelligence simply because artificial
intelligence is well hard and an
evolution is fairly easy
well at least always easy to set up and
the the hope is that that us we can take
advantage of having loss of a CPU cycles
and we call evolution to do a lot of the
designing for us so that's that's kind
of the easy general gist and we'll well
let's move on with it so there we go
so um so when I put together the people
is asked well what is artificial life
anyway they just go you know this is
ill-defined well in short artificial
life is is or if you life is sort of a
superset of biology so all biology is
artificial life but to be more precise
artificial life is all eyes
today so as is in the circle and its
ultimate like potentially could be so
all these other possible evolutionary
paths that that evolution could have
taken would alternate artificial life
and we'll be exploring some of these
areas because we'll be hoping to explore
aii these outside ones so but so I
always so just begin let's know what
evolution real quick so this is a brief
intro evolution evolutions an algorithm
it's really straightforward actually
here's how it goes you have a population
and you have and some things let's stick
around more than others so and but some
yeah that must must be the case so and
that's your selection and then you have
these things there's something some
heredity and then you rinse repeat and
we're gods substrate you'll always get
evolution with this very straightforward
you have a population of things you only
have only one that you have
hill-climbing that's crap but yet I have
a bunch and some reproduce some more
than others straightforward and then
this heredity and would with occasional
errors done that's all you got to do so
no matter what system
yeah it's great so ok get that on the
table
so moving on i'm so i'm gonna show you a
nice nice good example of using easy
evolution to design body plants so this
is before we get to AI and this was a
not my words about by Karl Sims in 1994
it's really pretty so I'm showing it to
you so basically in this case so he's
doing he's the evolution to design
bodies design arm body body morphologies
to do a different task in the world in
this case the population is a laser
pointer or anything like that
I think this point well anyway ok so the
the the populations is is a whole bunch
of these nodes and and and connections
joining them and you can mix and match
nodes so they say hey I'm gonna put this
length and sum it over here and vice
versa and you can kind of see kind of
how the how they met how they make these
make these morphologies you know about
how you know how this makes a tree and
vice versa it's actually kind of cute
when you look at it so they're actually
worth understanding so alright sweet ok
so in this case the yeah actually their
joints between parts so yeah so this
population is a grass of nodes and edges
and the in this selection is the voting
for certain tasks so walking jumping
like that and the end the mutation is it
basically the grafting nodes here and
there and we're just gonna let it go and
see what happens and and here we go so
whoop
no okay this demonstration so nine
tailed creatures that were evolved to
perform specific tasks in simulated
physical now
and that one
all right again this demonstration shows
virtual creatures that were evolved to
perform specific tasks in simulated
physical environments swimming speed was
used to determine survival most of the
creatures are results from independent
evolutions some developed strategy their
evolved multiple these simulated
together friction some simple solutions
with just two parts were found some seem
like they could use some assistance
while others were fairly efficient such
as this rowing like behavior here is an
odd cousin of the previous a mutation
caused him to tumble some creatures
evolved to incorporate contact sensors
in their control systems here is another
inch worm like creature that tends to go
in circles this was actually a creature
first evolved for its ability to swim in
water then later put on land and evolved
further a successful sidewinding ability
resulted here is one with a hopping
style the protrusions on its arms seemed
to help prevent it from tipping over
this was the fastest with a successful
galloping like stride this group was
evolved for their jumping ability this
group was evolved for their ability to
adaptively follow a red light source the
resulting creatures are now being
interacted with a user is moving the
light source around as the creature
behaves this one seems to flail randomly
but somehow still manages to approach
the light perhaps it is mean to move the
goal away just as it arrives here is one
that has propeller like fins which are
tilted depending on the direction of the
light it can adaptively swim up or down
very well
just to pause this one's especially nice
because it looks like sight that's
something like human wood designs has
that some kind of motor thing and if it
weren't for this little part just
hanging off here you'd swear it was
designed in this case this is a case
where evolution has stumbled across a
very good design it's extremely
efficient and it looks you know very
much like saying we would build
ourselves
so like basically seeing designs like
this should you like should come first
say yes this this can do this can work
sure is there a question
um X this work was recently redone for
the artificial life ten conference I
know they used it to evolve catapult
designs so I don't I don't know if
they've actually recreated all of this
but but but I do know at least large
sections of this have been recreated I
know that for a fact because I worked in
the lab so so that's all I got okay all
right now let's see what's the next
thing we got here oh um so I've said
before where the weather and moving kind
of kind of kind of weirdly especially
the one where we're just had like the
big hanging mass the sole Fitness
function in this case was just it was
just to move your center of mass forward
or just just move it period so in this
case like like evolution is very like it
loves to cheat all the time to to to
find some way to do this so in this case
what it was doing is we just had this
big long tentacle thing and it was just
moving its tentacle thing around
thus its center of mass was moving so so
just another thing to keep in mind is
that is that if you ever have any sort
yet to it when you design your evolution
simulations you have to always smell all
the weird ways it could cheat and we'll
get back to that later so here's the
most final group of creatures was
evolved for their ability to compete for
control of a green cube the creature
closest to the cube at the end of a
simulation is the winner here a strategy
first arose for simply tumbling towards
the cube then one learn to block out his
opponent but then later one learned to
overcome the obstacle by climbing over
it some pinned down their opponents some
covered the cube with protective arms
others simply unfolded on to the cube
the success of a strategy is often
highly dependent on the opponent here is
a hockey-playing creature which takes
the cube away and wins by a large margin
here are two similar hockey strategies
battling it out with appropriate
gestures
this crab-like creature walks well but
often continues past the cube and
instead seems to prefer beating up on
his opponent against the arm the crab
seems to simply walk away a successful
strategy is this - arm technique that
swipes quickly in from the side and
moves the cube over to a second arm
these are the final rounds of
competition amongst the overall best
finally the seeker arm goes against the
side Swiper but the cube is just out of
reach ok so this is a fun movie I always
like to show number one it's pretty and
the second is because you know designing
body types well that's kind of hard like
doing some those solutions yeah I kind
of think about him for a little bit now
this is not designing AI but it does
show how like how evolution cancel
across very inventive solutions and so
this is meant to be like inspiring say
oh you know maybe we can do something
even better with this so that's what you
have next so next is using artificial
life to evolve artificial intelligence
so here's this idea so the first
question is probably do a population for
like like what what's what thing do we
mutate and tinker with - fortunately be
intelligent and there's been lots of
answers to this question so the Marriot
said the Greeks had marionettes and so
yeah the strings old they're all deeply
connected and this is clearly the way
you think about intelligence and then
Descartes state was hydraulic so the
mind is like there's like the sewer
system
the always little compartments here and
there and lots of pretty art from that
time of all about it and pulleys and
gears to dust revolution yeah we've done
this before tell us which board yeah
we've heard we've heard you may even
hurts these analogies but um and boolean
logic yeah they didn't go so well
but I'm pleased that we finally solved
it and the answer is not do computers
but neural networks praise the Lord
so so I guess I mean given the history
should project neural networks was kind
of a grain a grain of salt but you know
they're really some reason to think
think neural networks are a reasonable
way for representing intelligence I mean
after all we we really are like we're
modeling the brain much much closer than
say digital computers or boolean logic
so um so even though there have been
many attempts it's like what is the
proper framework to to capture
intelligence you know the history is not
really on our side but I still think
there's there's a good reason for it
so just just go with me on this one so
now novice systems now say it's very
nice is that if you look at the neuron
see a human neuron like an individual
one versus versus say say say some other
mammalian creature even reptiles you
often can't tell the difference between
them it takes things like a real expert
to do it so like this like an individual
neuron level we're all pretty much the
same it's all in it's mostly in the
connections and evolution and they from
us all they don't like sea slugs you see
you'll see nervous systems that are
roughly the same so this is very nice
because roughly this says says hey you
know if we could just get our basic
model right you know you know a sea slug
it could perhaps ride this model all the
way up to the top
I mean if evolution did it once what can
I do it again so yeah so now we talk
about sort of the wait so now we have a
nervous system the important parts about
it so is so in this case we do that do
it somebody here's our innate so the
most must be some things that are that
are inherited we also know many things
are learned so we so the so the nervous
systems must change within organs a
lifetime this just this is just sort of
basic principles seems reasonable we're
gonna go with that so not too hard and
with all this in mind I'm sure you stick
to you polyworld
tada this is the simulator not to be
confused with Poliwhirl
we've got a thread about this so just so
you know this is not us or the other one
that's with two L's well with one and we
do we do predate them but not that it
really matters okay
so what is polyworld powers that poet
isn't
- well so before send to evolve
artificial intelligence the same way
natural tell just came about which is
simply put the evolution of neuro
systems in a complex rich ecology and
they compete with one another so and
we're yeah so the hope is that we meet
again with the model swing very simple
and then through competition into making
the world world richer it can it can
gradually like get better and better and
better
sure on the eye let's see well how would
you do that I guess in short the the
answer would be number one we can play
sort of ideas to create or even
intelligent designer and we kind of help
it along and then the hope is that you
know we can say oh that's good we want
to like really help you and it's not
something not true evolution had the
benefit off and furthermore Moore's Law
is really nice and so so I agree with
you that it's a problem but but both of
those two two factors helpful but but
it's it's it's it's a legitimate concern
so yeah so an insurer but is it's a new
software it's open source I'll give you
the link at the end and and you know
there's a kind of the goals but most
recently people using it for for doing a
behavioral ecology experiments and like
like what experience was very simple
neural networks so if you're a scientist
you can use it for that too so no we
don't apply what is do a poly what is
not so PO it's not fully open-ended if
she's just into design to be a flat
world well I guess you yeah miss have
you flat well we're critters interact um
it's not an accurate model of really
anything but it could be done there's I
mean it's there's there's no real
problem with it don't don't reason we
haven't made an accurate model
especially anything is because it's
computationally expensive and we don't
believe it's especially important so if
so like right now we're just using a
simple of something and squashing
neurons if you wanted to you could like
you could render it all way down to the
actual biochemistry if you're into that
kind of thing I'm personally not but you
know you could and if you're intrigued
ecology you can do that too so so yeah
that's what I got
so moving on some more until whoa
more so here's basically what it balls
in poly world so organisms have evolving
genes he made sexually straightforward
they do have a body but the most
important thing about them is the neural
network brains now the connections in
the net and the brains are genetic but
at birth all the weights are random and
and and heavy and learning which is the
learning mechanism and in and the
primary mixes in the human brain we just
simply put well and that sets all the
weights and hey learning it's very
simple algorithm works like this if two
neurons that are connected together fire
at about the same time the connection
between them gets stronger and then so
that's step one and then step two is all
connections decrease and strength
slightly so and that's it it's kind of
surprising and it's not surprising that
this one learning mechanism accounts for
most of our intelligence but you know so
it goes and the and their vision of the
world is quite flat when at its flatland
so they see a little strip of pixels in
front of them and and so basically it's
evolving it is evolving a neural network
to take their one dimensional vision and
turn it into behaviors they help them
survive so and so it's just to let you
know there's no cheating any of this as
you often see in evolution simulations
there is no fitness function this is
like pure natural selection this is as
raw as it gets if something sort of like
like the only criterion is merely to
survive anyway you can and this includes
exploiting bugs in the code and we'll
show you an example of that so okay yeah
so yeah that a second so to do okay Oh
black okay so here's a nice pretty
picture Polly well here's how it goes so
where is my thing here we go so these
brown things here are barriers they
can't cross those these moving things
here are the critters and these green
things here are food so you see when a
critter dies they become food now this
is Kevin early stage stage of the
simulator and so they aren't very smart
they like going along the edge a lot
what they get smarter I promise
so so it's so basically merely existing
in this world cause you to lose energy
and if you and if you and if your energy
goes to zero well you you cease to exist
so so thus like for anything to stick
around
must go out and find food or go out and
kill something or in a must like mate
without with other organisms as well if
it doesn't it's just not gonna stick
around very long it's it's it's it's
it's pure Darwinian so and you can kind
of see if how it looks here so here's
the here's a top-down view and each mean
these little well each of these little
squares here you saw this was the world
rendered from one critters perception
but it's us stretched out slightly for
our convenience but to know exactly what
they see they see the middle strip of
pixels in that so okay so that's
probably world so now I'm just saying to
you these are the genetic model cuz I
always get asked about that you have to
pay a lot of attention there's mostly
for reference for those of you who are
into this kind of thing so these are the
Saudi so I said before there are body
genes their brain genes and these are
the body once so and here tell me how it
works up here can be big about but but
when it's big it move very fast but it
can hold more energy in it so yeah it's
kind of a trade-off and if I cream us
you're a predator it can be really
strong so we can do that and I can also
determine its maximum lifespan this come
this actually this actually formed from
the evolutionary literature it basically
said that that it's good that that we
have like a hard limit that we can't
that say it's good we have a hard limit
that if you just eventually die of age
because even though it's extremely
unlikely for something unfit to live a
long time it's so utterly bad if
something unfit lives a long time and
mates a lot that you want a really hard
limit on the on on on how long you can
live so and this is also kind of
motivated it's kind of my step-offs we
thought about like for example you might
want to have one pop out tons of kids
but give them almost no energy so I so
the parent can decide how much anything
I want to give them what you want to
have only a few kids and give them lots
of your energy so this is a you know
we're Chad you want to use so we'll go
out to the colors in a little bit but um
yeah so the green how green a particular
critter is is determined at birth so you
could have like a light green critters
and dark green critters stuff like that
and also their mutation rate it's also
specified genetically so ya know culture
points ok genetic rate okay so there's
the exciting part so this is the brain
genes this is like 95 percent of the
genome so here's how it works so the
genetic models it specifies which colors
want to pay attention to in your
environment so if you think Reds really
important in your environment you can
spend a lot of neurons to go see it
yeah it also has a number of internal
groups and these internal neural groups
will look like this and this mess of how
they're connected so the genetic model
only specifies roughly how many
connections are between each neural
group it does not specify at the pure
neuron level and this is motivated from
biology so if you see yeah like like
well it just is and stephanie was
getting into so for those of you who are
neural network buffs you can read about
all that but the main thing to take home
from this is that the the genes loosely
specify Lucy specify the brain and it
does it it's sort of the neural groups
level and that's really anything to pick
from this so so to make this more clear
so here is how a typical brain looks so
you have one neural group here you have
excitatory neurons and inhibitory
neurons we we distinct mini neural
networks have the inhibitory neurons
excitatory neurons they can like like a
single neuron have both excitatory and
inhibitory connections but when you do
that some biologists puts up their hand
they're going to say but brains don't
work like that
you say well fine so so so there for you
biologists in the room they're different
be happy alright so you have multiple
these things and they have different
numbers of excite to inhibit and
inhibitory nodes and they come to each
other so straight forward and they
connect back it's nice and then you can
have multiple neural groups and they can
all connect to each other how or else
they want now these internal neural
groups connect to some some output
neurons or behavior neurons and here
they are now
these are these these are the the seven
behavior neurons and they're defined in
the simulation and in short there are
things like move forward turn left turn
right eat mate fight
blink I'll show that one a second and
focus so basically every critter has a
little light in front of it that it can
sort of like an that it can blink with
the ideas that could do some sort of
primitive synced signaling mechanism as
far as I know they haven't fully have it
taken advantage of this for signaling
but you know you give them room to grow
they obviously can't evolve to do it if
you don't give it to in the first place
so it's in there and we also weren't
sure what what kind of eye they wanted
so this so the people you got to give
this Neron they can have sort of a
fisheye lens or they can have like you
know really really really straight so
and that's just something because we
weren't we sure with what what kind of
eye they might want
so you know evolution can decide sure
comes next
oh sorry I need connection one other
okay so here so here are the inputs
okay so genetically so he won't pay
attention so this critter wants to pay
attention a lot to green a little bit to
red and not so much to blue and so these
rates the inputs and these inputs can
connect to to any of these internal
groups that they want and it also has an
energy level so it so this tells you
like roughly how healthy the critter
knows really how healthy it is it also
has has just sort of a random firing
just because you know might wanted this
is this is the free will of the critter
you can think of it like that and I
surprised enough they actually use the
random you wouldn't really think so but
um they like random I'm not exactly sure
why they like random but you know
regardless we put it in there to see
them they might they might like it and
behold they do so so like these internal
groups can connect to each other however
however they want yes
oh okay um the LD with this later so
there's things for me input units of
processing units that's important sure
yes the reason we do it huh oh I'm sorry
I was asked whether or not there's
there's an energy penalty for for having
a large number of neurons or four
numbers or four neurons being activated
the answer is yes to both the the
problem was that if you didn't do this
they grew huge brains that like 99
percent did nothing so you know just
like well like computation she's just
silly so if you have a big brain it
better we'll do something so so yes they
get a cost for having four for just
having a size certain sized brain or for
neons being activated so like doing
anything cost you something yeah so good
good question because we didn't do that
initially and we feel what happened so
um this is well this is this roughly the
same picture I showed you before and
this is made using made using dot it's
really nice or we started graph this so
and this just shows you probably a brain
map saying no really I'm not joshing you
this is well how that's how they work
and so these are these are the inputs
here they connect to excitatory they're
going to excitatory neurons and
inhibitory neurons and these are sort of
the the behavior you're on it's up here
so you know there's five turn light
blink etc so it just kind of shows you
what one of their brains typically look
like in a non when they're not idealized
so that's all to get from that so okay
so um as far as a critter is concerned
everything's about about getting energy
so the energy will they die and that's
bad
so here's they get energy they can eat
food pellets or they need other other
critters stay forward and they lose the
lose energy by doing anything like
merely existing loses energy so if they
don't do one of these things they're
gone so you know and these these these
especially like mating cost energy and
being big and strong cost energy and and
just for you know just having a brain
cost energy so mention that okay so now
I'm going to show you some some some
behavioral samples of how the of how the
the output neurons well this is what it
looks like when they turn these things
on
so here's eating it's gonna eat this
neuron right here and it's see it slurps
it up tada
so I'm gonna show you some more
these.they before you to the emergence
stuff so what's gonna happen here is
that is that a one critter so hey I'm
sorry I should mention this the color of
every critter is it's an RGB triplet so
the rhetoric Ritter is at this at is is
how aggressive it is at this moment the
blue or a critter is is how it wants to
mate with mate with just mate at this
moment and the green is is genetic as
specified before the the reason we just
decided this is because well you know
you want doesn't want to kill you you
want just wants to mate with you very
straightforward and for green the idea
is that you might want to do kin
selection so I for example say hey I'm a
light green I want to be nice to you
because you're a light green sure so as
we've seen a few cases where they have
were that where they have done some
tribalism based on the green but usually
have to kind of like trick it into doing
it but it does happen so basically the
important thing is here that these are
both kind of red so they're gonna do
battle so let's watch this one so here
we go it runs into it
and it gets eaten any and a turn to a
food pellet and this once assisted slurp
up the body
that's how eating works Oh in this case
um so so the thought the the bigness of
a critter is proportional to its
strength so they see even though this
critter was stronger it just had like a
lower amount of energy and it got eaten
by the weaker one okay so here's how
mating works
so this Kherson to come in here and mate
with this one and a little travel pop
out okay so now we see what happened
here okay so so so they made the child
but but they were so exist there so they
expended so much energy given the child
the this one energy into the child that
they immediately died afterward and then
the child ate their carcasses so here we
can begin to see that again for those of
you with kids let's do it nope
okay meeting let's see it again okay so
I'm coming on make the child and they
they both die and the child isn't only
care slurp okay next here so like so
this is the blinky let's just show you
this I think this person coming here and
it's gonna plank at you so yeah it comes
in I'm sorry no it turns it's blinky off
it's right now the blinky is on because
you see at this normal color and that's
blinky now it's turned it off so so they
can they can shine lights at each other
okay so now I show you some unless you
seen the emergent behaviors so this is
where the so we call icing species just
because it's kind of natural technically
they can still mate with each other but
behaviorally they're so different that
that it seems to recently call on that
so these are joggers and all they do
they just go forward all the time in
this case the world is is is is the
toroidal world so you can't go off the
edge we have all the worlds we you can't
go off the edge and they move in circles
a lot so but in this case usually the
first thing you see in the simulation
just always go straight it's very easy
to code and if food is randomly
distributed why not I mean you know
you're it's it's it's quick and simple
so that works okay so this is really
nice when I talked to you before what
how evolution will take advantage of
absolutely anything like including your
bugs so this is a very nice bug now when
this was initially done it had not
occurred to me that that having a child
cost energy you know because you know
you did you just do it it's pretty easy
so you know it's my male bias but uh
well I'll show what happens when we
initially the initially there was no
cost for having children and here's what
happened so you'll see them fit over
there and we'll zoom in a little bit so
you see their own little cluster over
there and we're gonna zoom there we go
okay so you see that they have this
whole orgy going on here and they are
and they are popping out kids like like
really quick and then immediately eating
them and with this this is because
because eating eating the children
becomes a free source of energy so you
have to so as far as careers are
concerned you have two choices
you go out and get food or you can mate
and have a piece of food appear right
next to you
the solution is clear and this was this
was like really boggling it's like why
are they doing that because like this
would be immensely successful would take
over everything and I could took a lot
of figure that out but yeah so we now it
cost so now like it costs energy to have
kids so they don't eat them
it's not it's not it's not not not as
prevalently so okay so just just to let
you know that evolution will take
advantage of your bugs that you're
really way to test so okay so moving on
from the indolent cannibals okay so now
I'm going to show you some scenarios
show you some actually intelligent
behavior weasel primitive intelligent
behavior that has emerged from this so
this is just showing you that yes this
is actually doing something all right
okay so we're going to see them actually
they actually use their vision so Peters
gonna come by is and the crater lurched
forward and see that okay here wolves
okay there's some more of them
yeah so you see it jumped forward so
really all this is saying is that hey
they actually are using their eyes for
something and they are using their eyes
to control their behavior so simple
enough not a very big claim but it shows
you that we're after getting something
right like keep in mind when these
critters start they have completely
random brains and I assure you they're
crap they don't do that so I'll show you
some examples if you'd like okay so now
I'm show you some more ones here's
fleeing attack or in short running away
from red things
so usually like the first thing you the
first things the critters learn is
number one move that helps to find food
number two move towards green things
because it's green because food is the
only green things will solely green
things and though it's turn to get a
what turn towards blue things because
they want to mate with you and get away
from red things because they want to
kill you so here's the one you get away
from red things so we see a red thing
coming up here and it's gonna run away
from it and run away so just is very
nice so like they that and this came out
completely naturally no no no no
supervision at all just just just
playing deistic creator and letting it
go so here's some more so here's some
forging patterns so usually they they
like to kind of act out on their own
become a lone forger but some of
sometimes they swarm so you finally got
a whole bunch of very weak critters and
they mostly just go and go in circles
all the time and they and so like they
say hey I like say let's say there'll be
dark green say okay I want to turn I
want to follow dark green things and
when I turn in circles a lot and if you
do that
the swarm to sort of gradually moves
because the ones that are near food they
they live and so the swarm just kind of
gradually moves towards the directions
where food is and that's and that works
slowly but it does work
okay let's see I don't think there's any
more on this one oh I see it's kind of
fun you can see actually you can't can't
see them engaging in a purposeful
behavior like you saw the very beginning
the simulation they boast he just kind
of sat there we got to see him that you
know they were actually moving around
actually turning towards turning towards
green things actually displaying kind of
you know pseudo purposeful behavior so
yeah so that's a steps in right
direction all right so here just thought
we've seen so far
first of all did they make they make a
lot different kinds of brains they're
actually they are using their eyes for
something that's good and they're
actually doing useful things with them
also good so all right so now I should
show you some some more sciency things
we've tried to look at trying to analyze
the behavior to determine for actually
getting anywhere and trying to like
quantify it so this is a nice one from
the from the animal forging literature
so this is actually pretty
straightforward here's what you do you
have a give a world you have a food
patch on one end and a food patch on the
other and you see okay well how the
critter is going to allocate themselves
it's at the very beginning they're kind
of uniformly dispersed middle say oh
well you know some hang out here some
hang out there some in no-man's land and
then late they go oh being a no any
lands bad I don't want to I want to go
there so they hang out in the two food
patches so so the so this well they'd
they are they're foraging that's good
and they're doing it correctly and even
better if you actually look at they
actually following the optimal foraging
pattern so there's this distribution you
commonly see in the forging literature
called the ideal free distribution and
lo and behold they hit it perfectly so
alright good for the critters doing
optimal foraging so now I'm chasing
predator-prey cycles these are kind of
neat so um the colors don't come out
that great but it'll be okay so in this
case we're looking at predator-prey
cycles between the critters and the food
so in this case the red is the critters
and a this is for a particular food
patch the ones you saw before so the red
is number of critters in that food is
the percent of critters that food patch
and the green is the percent of food in
that food patch so ensure what you see
let's pick say this one here okay so it
so didn't you see that the the critters
lag the food so first the food will go
up high and then shortly afterward the
careers that a long ago in this food
patch and then they over Harv
and the food goes down then the critters
leave and go to the other food patch and
then the Quebec goes up again they move
up and go back to the food patch and
this oscillates forever yes this case
this was two food patches close to each
other and they would just go back and
forth between the two food patches is
what they would do and depending on
where the food were more food was at
that time and and they would oscillate
for always following the food so yeah
and this is nice because this is this is
French this is a very similar pattern to
what we see in light and predator-prey
cycles you know the standard
lotka-volterra thing so also nice and is
again like we didn't program any of this
like we simply just designed a simple
world with food and their own nets and
said go and we get all this just it just
comes right out so okay so not so now
look at the brains because what we're
really concerned about so now the main
thing to keep in mind here is really
kind of the connection matrix this other
stuff here is scientists like that so
anyway so this is this is a this is a
random brain at the start the very
beginning at the very beginning of
evolution all the things are randomly
wired together and so there's one
connection matrix and this is one from
the visual cortex of a cat now and it's
just random slice of it and now actually
one from a poly world critter after
evolution tada now amazing take away
from this it's not a cat but it's
certainly not random and somebody can
see that the evolution has gone from
this to this with doing nothing but just
sitting there and letting CPU cycles
turn on it so again I'm not claimed
apply organs or cats but I am saying
that evolution is doing something very
useful and it's putting tons of
structure in there that you do not put
in so all right and in a sort of
inspiring and you go WOW maybe if she
could get a cat with this so there we go
so so but I'll show you some more
quantitative plot more than just looking
at pictures oh sorry so I always get
this question a lot from philosophers in
the room they always say oh it's not
well okay if fortunately uh there's a
professor mind that did a really good a
definition of life it's it's it's the
farmer bale in the artificial revolution
um publish from the same thing Institute
and basically it says it has these
little criteria for turning something's
alive and and not so coincidentally
Poliwhirl was explicitly designed to
satisfy all these Criterion's so in
short the epic space time it does
reproduce it does have a feature storage
it does eat and it has interacts the
environment and it does evolve so in
short to that we said to say well it
fits the definition of life that most
people use so so in your face ok so then
you'll say but it but I'm not sure if
it's intelligent well that's it sure
just laughs yeah I'm saying it point
will satisfies all these monition
information storage it doesn't have that
I suspect I mean I don't really care
fires alive or not fire probably can
satisfy three or four of these I mean
I'm not really attached
i I don't I'm indifferent to fire but
but but I suspect if you if you'd if you
looked it's kind of the structure of
coal or something you probably wouldn't
find it you'd probably probably probably
don't have much information there I'm
not sure exactly how you look at it I'm
sure something you do but even if I was
alive okay sure
why not okay hey all right say well is
it really intelligent because we just
see them just moving around well there's
no real way to quantify intelligence
unfortunately and not even biologists
can do this um but however because are
those all simulation means we have
access to a lot more things that
biologists don't and sure we can use
that information theory and complexity
theory to try and analyze the critters
behaviors and their brains and this is
most of our research right now so
so yeah so we analyzed their brains over
time so so here's a nice one so there
are like three or four measures of
neural complexity out there and so far
I've implemented two of them and I'm and
they approach all can follow this
pattern
oh sorry for this kind of complexity
this is the this is the - no nice porns
complexity I'll get you the paper on it
but but in short the sort this metric of
neural complexity in short says if all
neurons fire independently that's not
complex and so if the yeah and if they
all fire in unison that's not complex
either so so in short you want this kind
of middle ground between everything
behaving randomly and everything
behaving uniformly and that's what
that's what completo complexity is but
and Shorey if you look at look at any of
these they put all they go up for a
little bit and then they can a plateau
and so you're like mmm um and and both
metrics do that so well that's what I
got and we and we right now we're trying
to figure out how to make that go up
more and try to explain why it why it
plateaus so I'll show you some other
stuff now um here - that for a second so
so now that we know that now we know
that neural complexity does indeed go up
we want to know if evolution is actually
helping this helping the complexity go
up or if it just kind of going up
accidentally so there are two kind of
views of the evolution of complexity the
first one is this one this is more
natural one and it says that hey you
know evolution actively favors more
complexity to it from bacteria you know
just do big bacteria and then davinci to
us and evolution really wants that and
the other one Cass says you know what
evolution way doesn't give a crap about
complexity something just kind of
increased crease by accident on
complexity and Evans doesn't really care
and the idea this one is that that that
if this is just mirrored like this if
things kind of diffuses outwards you
know on the spectrum of complexity you
know those who doesn't care about it at
all
you know it'll you'll eventually get
complex things and this better you'd
start with doesn't get to that and so
this is evolution actively favoring
complexity versus evolution not giving a
rip and this is this is actually a
debate a question and we can use potable
to answer this sure
during such a very simple environment
yes I do
oh sorry the question is whether or not
the the complexity of organisms is
predominantly a product of their
environment and the reason that we're
not seeing a big increase in complexity
is because the environments so simple
and I think that's exactly yet so and
and I am so where and what you're
looking on that looking at that now for
a ways of ways we can make the
environment more complicated to
encourage more interactions and things
like that but that but that's about
that's about four or five slides from
now so we'll get to it but yes these are
the two ones this kind of experiment and
short usually here's like what you see
so this um okay so basically jury-rigged
Poliwhirl to make all matings random so
in short even if you mate with someone
you actually get their genes you have
some random person's genes it's sneaky
so and this is the dashed line so this
with evolution turned off and go sorry
this is complexity here and this is time
and the dark line here's with evolution
on now energies is very depressing
because you're like oh well with
evolution turned off you get higher
complexity you're like well you're doing
nothing and this and I was very sad when
I first saw this graph but I always
think it this thing here this always
appears like I've run this thing I don't
know like least ten times now um and so
there's always this hump here and I'm
sorry and this is also a a t-test not
here we'll get at in a second but in
short like the idea came up with is that
there's always this hump here and this
in the solution I came was well
evolution does favor an increasing
complexity but only up to a point after
you solve the world we don't care if
you're complicated anymore in fact it
actually costs you something to be
complicated and so as a result we're
gonna kind of keep you roughly right
there
Wow the diffuse of one just kind of goes
up on its own it's completely it doesn't
care about complexity at all and it
continues to go on up sure
just where the fitness function is how
long you survive instead of how much you
made because if you randomly select a
creature creatures who live a long time
are going to be around more to get
selected at random so if you just
survive a long time and you're alive
when other people are made in then your
genes will get passed on more let me
think about this select this selection
the selection of the random genes from
all the creatures who are alive at that
time yeah I'm thinking how was it done I
think it was I think it was from all the
critters who were alive at that time so
the idea was oh no I'm sorry no actually
no sorry this is actually good that's a
very good that's a very good question
but that was controlled for
so in short I'll get in more detail
basically this was that we ran this this
this black line first and then we said
okay you know and then we then we and
then we said okay like critter critter
one lived exactly as many time steps
occur to live exactly this number of
time steps so we did random so we did
random mating combined with enforcing
that that each critter lived exactly the
amount of time so but but but good good
question clever goes down because some
of it is discovered to be unnecessary
yes I think yes correct
and that and that basically fits fits
with my with my current belief I mean
I'm not exactly sure sure a why apply it
plateaus and why it gets when why it
gets what kind of stays there well the
passive goes up but I think I think it's
I think it's pretty reasonable so the
idea is that I mean it could you always
see that like I mean complexity is
useful at the beginning but you'll want
to be more complex than your environment
makes you be so so the idea is that we
were making it more complicated and
we'll see if that goes up more but yeah
that's i agree exactly if you want to
see this here so this is this is a
t-test basically seeing to what extent
basically the degree of confidence to
which the dashed line and the solid line
I thought come from the same population
and basically if it's above this
critical here which basically says yes
we're pretty sure they came from
different populations so we see that
okay right here we're sure they came
from different populations now but
actually right
kind of cross it's about right here it
just it just kind of emotion kind of
sits there so um so the so so there's
some mass to make us think that as well
okay which what I got so now we now
looked at neural complex and shoe
another one for genetic complexity and
this came from my professor at Caltech
professor odami
and it's really nice then she correlate
map over quite well so he looked at the
complexity of the genes actually was it
it was seven thousand when they crossed
before yeah about seven thousand okay
that's good to this one okay
seven thousand we see is roughly similar
so okay so way this one works the dashed
lines again are the other passive runs
and the solid lines are the or the or
the with evolution turned on and so so
and we basically see that on the passive
runs the genetic complexity based went
down to crap while on the on the active
runs the jack plucks and he did not go
to crap in fact it stays quite high so
roughly what this says run with this met
what this measure looks for it looks at
the amount not of disorder in the genome
so so basically if every gene was
equally probable or sorry if every gene
is equally present in the population
then then this goes down then then this
goes to here but if there are some genes
that are more favored than others then
uh then I could in this measure gets
higher um I can see the equation for it
but that's nothing how it goes we
roughly measures the amount of disorder
in the population of genes and roughly
this says okay with evolution turned on
there is less disorder in the genes so
that's good and nice it's also
conveniently see the genetic complexity
in the neural complexity being being
roughly correlated yes
yeah
okay well that's the evolution is off I
say that the matings are random and yeah
I assume the meetings are random and
critters are forced to live the same
amount of time so the idea is so so
there's controls and then the meetings
are random and when evolution is on when
- when two creatures mate their genes
get get get meshed together and they
make a child so completely normal
when evolution is off when to coordinate
when to when two creatures made it picks
up completely it picks two random genes
from from things currently alive so so
like it so it so it probably so and then
it pops out that child
if it's completely rare that's random I
mean III think I don't know uh to the
you you made you to do this if you just
make make a copy of one of the of one of
the parents you may be able to I'll have
to think about it that's when that would
work too but but uh but I know that if
if that if every if every creature is
equally favored no matter what its genes
are evolution doesn't move like that
that's the rule like like like that that
has that has selection with everything
being equal equally selected for so
that's what motivated sure yes there
will be there won't be this perfect
mixing of all the possibilities but it
will slowly go well you certainly
alright to be like I mean uh because of
finite population you you will you you
will see you'll see variations in the
pot in the population and I think this
is what you're seeing here in this case
like this is still it's completely
random mating and it's moving up and
down a little bit and I and this is just
due to drift but as you increase the
population size this gets less and less
and less as exactly as you'd expect so
so so yes you're right and and in this
and we're seeing it so it's so that's
good okay oh okay we have to be quick
then all right so it's nice something to
do real quickly press through this so
there's a real question of so for this
passive complexity it could just be this
passive complete like why is this
leveling out at all so it could be that
that this is sort of a sort of an upper
bound in the simulation the simulation
can't support something something of
higher neural complexity wells
well we jury-rigged Poliwhirl to say
okay we will so we put through a fitness
function mode this is no longer natural
selection we will reward you solely for
having a complex brain and that's the
red one here so enjoy this says hey you
know the summation can support much
higher complexity if you if you like
really force it to do it so um so in
short this basically says hey there's
room for
bro prep for evolution so alright so
basically we have so the next parent
will be making a more complex
environment and trying to move move
these curves closer up to the red it's
okay it's making a drug from there so
these are the future directions were
take probably wheeled into butBut
Donnelly making the world a more cut
more complex and then commit with more
measures of complexity for studying it
so in short more measures the complexity
there's there still like there's still a
four or five more that we haven't looked
into yet a more complex environment it's
like the first thing out right now I
want to add are like day and night
cycles so I so and this is this would be
really easy to do because it's all in
OpenGL and you could just tweak the
antia the ambient lighting up and down
and the ideas that this would force them
to to have sort of an internal clock
saying hey it's dark now I can't see
anything
probably probably shouldn't go foraging
and the idea is having different ends of
food types so you can have different
colors of food and it and one will give
you more energy than the other suits are
having specialization any other is
giving them more more senses right now
they only see and if you give like smell
or touch the ideas that they could have
more interaction of the environment and
that would be good yeah so we were done
the optimal foraging we did that very
recently yeah and we call to use this to
answer questions about evolutionary
theory as we did answer more questions
evolutionary theory like we did before
and then eventually we got to get up to
classical classical conditioning
experiments so this is kind of like like
the direction we want to go for the next
few years and I think you have ideas
especially for here let me know Oh Mike
want to get your good code so um so this
is mostly yet the source codes available
you can get it now
it runs on Linux and Mac on vacu T it
just works and there you can download it
yeah
and they at the very end I always get
the question as though you're making
Frankenstein this is a terrible idea and
I always like this slide to respond to
them so and yeah I've no probably not
responsibility if the if they kill if
the if if the polygons kill us all well
oh well it happens okay and I'm done
oh wait stick-up
so just an idea about directions for to
test theories in evolution have you
thought of sex selection receive their
specialization between giving very
little or a lot of contribution to the
offspring and see if they're to Nicias
to genders developed well currently
there is no gender um the you could
certainly do it my right now the
mandersohn agenda right now it's curvy
didn't wanna cut to cut the population
like the mating pool in half so like
right now these critters currently run
with there's about 300 agents in a
simulation well actually well sorry I'll
back up the answer is yes you could do
that that'd be really that'd be really
cool but right now we don't do it
because we were concerned about it might
be hard to find a mate Oh what I mean
under some I mean I'm very ignorant of
it but and there are some theories which
say that the origin of the division of
genders is that there was a
specialization two niches white males
contribute very little they tried to met
a lot the females contributed a lot more
and so maybe you could look for you see
these two nations develop even in the
absence of explicit gender you could
certainly well it's certainly possible
like if you had two different kinds of
behaviors and one was capable one time
so most able to other times you you you
could get that to come out naturally but
um but but when they can always mate
sort of all the time it's it's it's
gonna be tricky for for that for that to
that to be enforced over the long term
but but yeah it's certainly possible and
if you want to do if you want to do
gender differences it actually really
need I mean if you just started
enforcing it see what see if they were
if they were started sort of like
they're started using each other things
like that so that'd be that'd be cool
sure networks is these networks at least
as I took it to mean don't have any
state in our recursive networks no they
are recurrent networks so they then
connect back if they want we have to
have a new new kind of these recruit is
something and squashing neurons we have
a brand new model that has spiking
neurons and it's pretty item I don't
know much about it yet I haven't used it
much yet but we do have more fancier
models and they do did you save state in
between cycles and
let's see well the no we do not save
state between between cycles but but we
do update their vision right right okay
that seems to me to be necessary in
order to maintain a mental model of
where you are in the world as opposed to
just a single state Here I am what's
what am I going to do it seems like
that's a that's a fundamental part right
yeah um let's see I don't think we're
saving we're saving the state of the
network from one time to the next like
of the internal nodes
I will I'd have to think of well I can
answer the question empirically and like
and like 10 minutes ago on through the
code so here's all I'll answer it a
little bit I think this is a really good
an interesting presentation but I guess
I have a little difficulty because I'm
not that familiar with the area to have
some context for it could you say just a
few words words about sugar world and
tiara and neural Darwinism so I have
some senses oh yeah I've heard of sugar
world but I haven't don't think I I've
never I've heard of sugar world I know
that in Tommy I should back up so so
there's some Priya simulations Tom raced
here I was basically uh was the first
thing of of evolving code and and it was
it was like and it was it was really
awesome but there were a few problems
with it is that basically things always
always got smaller and smaller and
smaller so so that was kind of a problem
and in Tom raised Tara so like it like
it always became better if your if your
if your genome got smaller X that what
you could reproduce faster because they
were because they were penalized for
like they're only gonna sort numbers
cycles reproduce themselves and if
you're very small you because we reboot
yourself a lot I don't actually know if
as far as I know Tara has not been
extended to to account for these
original defects but but but certainly
tear is like really great it's why sugar
escaped I've heard of it I don't know
much about it so but you can get paper
on I'll certainly read it and I can you
have to come and tell you then I'm sorry
what was the other one you know
Darwinism okay so no Darwinism is is a
theory of neuroscience and it's probably
even true and short it says that the way
connections are formed in the brain is
kind of like evolution it's not exactly
but roughly it says that neurons
initially connected
whole bunch of things and most of them
suck and and the ones that suck get
pruned and they go away so so so roughly
no dollar isms like like like expand
prune expand prune and and it says that
this is how connecting me in the brain
comes about and it's probably true sure
just well whoever hurts close to the
microphone in here so only your final
slide I think was the final slide he
said that one of your goals is to make
the environment more complex yes and
experiment with more features I guess
and so on so I think it's little it may
be a little bit of problem because your
current system is already very complex
and there are thousand things that
affect the way evolution goes in your
current system and you know how you
construct their production procedures
and so on and so on so you know the
afraid that if you make the environment
more complex you will be possibly you'll
be able to see very fancy you know
simulations but you may it may be even
more difficult to understand why
actually evolution went this path in the
other way physics by any chance I'm
sorry your bachelor's isn't in physics
by any chance just what I mean like the
physicist always say that so I'm wanting
what your background does know my
background is actually I studied
evolution competition for me okay all
right well yes okay well so the the
concern is roughly well if you make it
more complex you'll just have parameter
he'll you already have parameter he'll
but it could be even worse like ninth
layer parameter he'll and the answer is
yes that that that can happen and I
guess I guess the response is well it
seems like a lot of these things these
don't depend on the parameters we very
very sensitively so if we like very a
bunch of planners we have right now you
roughly see a lot of the same stuff and
then the hope is if you choose it's even
remotely reasonable values the good
stuff will come out and so so the the
point is valid and but but we don't
think but we think like the benefit of
having a more complex world far exceeds
the concerns of parameter help
hi hi hey crusher how you doing
um I've been thinking about this for a
while I mean you showed it to me earlier
today but I've also been thing about
this general problem and I think that we
could state without being too
contentious that there are better
strategies in the world that you're
presenting like if we were really
careful in designed one we could
probably clean the clock of a number of
these evolved systems and I think part
of that's going to be not a product of
the structure of the brains but the kind
of inputs that they have available to
them when they drive their behavior
put another way I don't think you should
be adding complexity to your simulated
world in terms of adding lighting
effects or fog or the things like that I
think there need to be more signals that
have to do with kin selection and not
not just green right like I in the
natural world even at the the very
cellular level you just as a natural
byproduct of the way evolutions going to
affect what kind of presentation you
throw up on your cell walls like you can
do skin selection in the environment
pretty easily like that's that's assumed
and so you can a lot of the complexity
that we see in natural systems and how
social system direct and how predation
systems interact seem to be driven by
really complicated gradients that end up
working out down the the kin similarity
like I don't want to mate with someone
who's exactly like me and I don't want
to mate with someone who's really really
different from me either because if I
mate with someone who's exactly like me
it's not worth the energy because
there's not gonna be very much variation
if I made with someone who's too
different the child's not going to be
viable and like the complexity in your
environment should flow out of the
behavior of the features that you're
competing with and you should see
speciation resulting from preferences
and alternate patterns and
like that it doesn't seem like there's
enough input available for the neural
networks that you're evolving which seem
to be really cool to exploit that
gradient so I think maybe finding some
way to allow them to sense the presence
of and go ahead and cheat you know like
look look aside do similarity scores and
provide like a sense that similarity
sense you know it not based on light at
all I mean you're looking directly at
the genes because in any natural
evolving system you'd end up having
pheromones and various other markers
that you would learn to exploit but they
don't really have that all they have is
what they present directly and he would
take a very very long time for that to
evolve I think I get your so your your
point seems to be roughly that the
critter should have more complex
interactions with each other rather than
more complex interactions with the
environment well not even necessarily
more mean the the actions that they can
take or fine I just don't think that
they can observe the other critters well
enough okay so I guess the answer is I
agree and and and if someone's to ride
it if you wanna ride it I would gladly
put the patch in so now as to whether
that would be that as to whether or not
more complexity between what more
complexity between critters would be
more valuable than interact with the
environment I guess I guess you could
try it and find out I mean I think both
would be great so so so yeah so there's
there's no contention okay all right
let's take one more question in Mountain
View and then we'll let the video tapirs
go unless there's a remote office that
had a question that I wasn't fair to yes
so as a biological creature myself I
kind of hoped that death is not
inevitable and I was curious what you
were noticing in your simulations if you
turned off the the limited lifespan of a
creature um let's see
I guess you could just clamp it you
could do that I know the reason I did
that is just because like I saw I saw a
paper at a conference that just had
these mating populations and it
said said that that having a fixed
lifespan or Lisa Mack slicing was a good
thing said oh well just put in a gene
done so so I have no I've never actually
clamped it and compare the differences
but you can certainly do it I mean I
mean there's just a parameter so if you
didn't have a limited lifespan
what would you the results of your of
your simulations be that's what I'm
curious well most critters don't get to
their max lifespan most of them die of
energy so um so so in this case like I
think like the average critter lifespan
is some like 300 400 time steps and the
maximum lifespan is something like 700
800 something like that so so so most so
very very few get killed by that so I so
I guess I don't think the maximum
lifespan has much impact on it and I
just put it in there because I saw a
paper that said this was good so and it
was I was writing that piece of code at
the time so okay we'll still be around
after after the talk is over if anyone
wants to chat more thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
