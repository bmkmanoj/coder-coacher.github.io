sheet of Pamela Olson graduated from
Stanford in 2002 and the militant
ramallah West Bank working beginning in
2004 working as a journalist for the
Palestine monitor their she interviewed
the first female she witnessed the 2005
disengagement from inside the Gaza Strip
and she served as foreign press
secretary for dr. Mustapha bar groupies
presidential campaign against Mahmoud
Abbas in january of 2005 or june two
thousand five sorry she later worked at
the Institute for Defense analyses in
Washington DC which is currently writing
a book on some travels and times in the
West Bank titled pastimes in Palestine
please join me in welcoming camels um
hello thank you again for coming this is
as he said a talk on sort of the the
modern Palestinian perspective and
here's a little map to sort of orient
you to where we're talking about Israel
is right here this little strip right
here and this is the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip we've been occupied since
nineteen sixty seven what this talk is
not it's not balanced if I had all the
time if I had enough time I'd be very
happy to go into the Israeli perspective
but for now this is sort of the
underrepresented perspective in this
country so I'm going to spend the time I
have on this it's not complete I can't I
could talk all day about you know fat
day versus Hamas and la·cu versus labor
versus Kadima and all this but uh and of
course the recent violence in the Gaza
Strip but um but again we don't have
enough time it's more just sort of in my
opinion the bottleneck in a major
bottleneck in the conflict is that a lot
of Israelis and Americans don't
understand the Palestinian context very
well but people who do support Israel's
security it's very important information
to have I think and I definitely
encourage everyone to to seek out the
other side of the equation you have the
time and inclination so
the first half of the talk is about just
kind of scenes from the West Bank this
is where I lived llamala which is got
ten miles north of Jerusalem right there
this is the central traffic circle in
Ramallah called al manara and as you can
see they have a Snickers poster over
there and there's another billboard for
coca-cola that's been there for as many
years as I've known the place on the
other end another view of Ramallah sort
of at sunset and this is a the main high
school in the Palestinian territories is
called the friend school and it was
founded by Quakers and the late 1800s
and this is a view from one of the
balconies of the friend school in umalas
main street at night this is the
Protestant church in an mamala it's next
door to the offices where I worked at
the palace I monitor this is actually a
friend of mine who's half Palestinian
grew up in Kentucky actually speaks
Arabic with a thick southern accent and
he married a woman from Bethlehem and I
was there last summer for the wedding
and this is a band that's playing at the
french cultural palace and I'm sorry
french cultural center in Ramallah and
it's all Palestinians except for katie
over here she's an American woman who
works for the one of the Palestinian
Authority ministry they don't remember
which one I think education maybe and
this is a ramada cultural palace venue
financed by the UNDP and the Japanese
government and here's like a improv
theater group of kind of on the grounds
more the grounds when I took this
picture I didn't realize there was a
public display of affection going on but
uh apparently there was so this is the
theater inside the venue about 700
capacity and i was there in 2005 when
daniel barenboim conducted a mixed Arab
and Israeli orchestra did a Mozart piece
and Beethoven's fifth major event in
in Palestine and a nice bridging the
divide moment the Israeli musicians were
interviewed for Haaretz which is Israel
main newspaper and talking about their
experiences really really neat one
there's a magazine in the west bank
called this week in Palestine and which
is actually monthly so I don't know what
it's called this week in Palestine but
uh and they talk about the cultural
events and museums and tourism and all
kinds of things political things as well
and they always have a picture in the
back panel that's called beautiful
Palestine and these are some of my
favorites one thing that I didn't
realize before i went to Ramallah was
that the West Bank has its own beer
called tybee and here's one of the
billboards for its drink Palestinian
taste the revolution and this is a
village called tae BAE which is a
Christian village sort of over a few
hills from amalah where they have a
brewery and here's a close-up of Taipei
it's a very very good beer and this over
here is a kind of an outdoor cafe in
public pool called snow boat which
nobody means pine a nice place to spend
a Sunday afternoon also they had a film
shoot there when I was there last time
in 2007 called pomegranates and murder
is the movie and this guy right here is
actually a paid actor and this guy who
played the best man runs a restaurant on
Ramona's Main Street and he he's a
character he really was just running all
over the place you know trying to give
autographs and stuff it was as a fun day
this is a main entertainment district of
Ramallah sort of a street going down
toward sangrias which is there the beer
garden in Ramallah a lovely place I
spent entirely too much time there and
now we're back to main street Ramallah
we're right in the central traffic
circle there's kind of a juice stand
rivalry so this is a salotti juice which
it's just sort of a regular juicing
machine and you sir want to care it and
a you know an apple and a pear or
whatever and make your juice and this is
fruity cocktail which they have you know
peanuts and ice cream and maraschino
cherries so that's kind of the the main
street rivalry this is ziddi abbr
coffeehouse where I also spend way too
much time they all the artwork on the
walls is done by the owner and there's a
fireplace and the back there and that
was so in the winter it's a nice place
to drink some wine and hot cocoa this is
not affiliated with starbucks in any way
but my guess is the starbucks lawyers
going to get to the checkpoints so it it
stands as is this is another bar called
zan kind of the new one where i hung out
the major nightspots kind of my great in
ramallah so one time at sangria is and
it's in and it's this so it was an in
2007 I went here for lunch a lot of
sam's pizza some is actually a Christian
guy and they have really nice Italian
chicken sandwiches and the other Italian
restaurant in Ramona is called pronto
and me and John the half palestinian guy
who speaks Arabic with a southern accent
we'd sit here for hours with cheese cake
and wine and cappuccino and talk about
politics in our live life Palestinian
circus school is a new new venture in
the West Bank it's a the new
performances called circus behind the
wall and sometimes I do sort of their
own performances this is ins an actually
there's kind of an arboretum or a anyway
an extension on the sandbar and they did
this performance with sheets she's a
visiting Italian circus artists and
these two brothers were in the circus
school he's the main the manager and
he's the main trainer and they also go
around the west bank to this isn't a
Janine refugee camp teaching kids circus
skills and I tagged along with him once
this guy sells his sort of one string
guitars on Main Street he's kind of a
fixture this is one of the murals along
Main Street which the symbology is that
you know these are the refugees from
1948 this is a new generation sort of
still trying to struggling for the
rights another mural which is curious i
think i'm pretty sure it's trying to
express solidarity with here's the iraqi
flag and symbol of you know resistance
and the palestinian flag and then the
santa claus for some reason both a
Christian and a Western icon so i'm not
sure but interesting nonetheless these
the ones in the corner of the this is
sort of the prom at the friends school
with Quaker school where my friend John
the guy from Kentucky work to the
counselor and some more pictures of
Palestinian kids um the main rest of the
sheet Moshe she restaurant in in the
West Bank where like if Kofi Anan comes
for visit they'll take him to Donna and
this is the entrance is their main
dining room palestinian excuse me north
of Ramallah is the mikata which is where
Yasser Arafat used to live now Mahmoud
Abbas are used to rule he's the grounds
and mikasa which most of the time I was
there they were just completely covered
with rubble and destroyed cars and that
kind of thing but it was all finally
cleared out for yessiree or fats funeral
in 2005 and now it's a nice open area
again a little north of that there's the
plaza mall in the bill in the town of
LBJ and they have behind it as a nice
mosque I live close to this so I always
heard the call to prayer five times a
day and a sign on the on this door make
sure that you know nothing funny happens
this is the major supermarket on the
bottom floor and on the top floor
there's a lot of boutique stores super
expensive united colors of benetton and
something calls your wall and just kind
of a children's play area
as you all is Palestines main a cell
phone company and this is their brand
new headquarters in all beauty they're
building that when i was there you know
there had to be one again not affiliated
with the western chain but a nice hotel
this is beers 8 university the top
university in the west bank it's in a
village a little bit north of Ramallah
and north of that is I'm kind of going
north and the West Bank is a part called
acquaviva which has a pool and sort of
four wheelers for kids to ride around
the hills in a little bit this as he
mentioned the first elected female mayor
in the West Bank in Palestine actually
fat CL about Ruthie which but we see you
hear that name a lot in Palestine is a
very common Palestinian surname so it
was really it was lovely to see men
making coffee for women for once and I
enjoyed that of bbqs in the Hills a
favorite pastime in a West Bank this is
a New Year's party at the Jericho
intercontinental I've clearly had too
much to drink but it was a right in the
middle of the election season when when
Mustafa Barghouti and Mahmoud Abbas were
running for president and we were all
working on the campaign so we needed a
weekend pretty badly my 25th birthday in
my apartment in Ramallah and oh all
these guys are lawyers who work for the
PLO negotiations affairs department
during a sort of early attempts to
negotiate it was found that Yasser
Arafat had you know not even any Maps no
sort of clear policy so I think some
European Organization sponsored some you
know high-powered Yale and Harvard
lawyers of Arab background to square
that away for the next time of
negotiations can hopefully take place
and they have travel documents to travel
freely so this is us hanging out in West
Jerusalem obviously as an American I can
travel much more freely than a lot of
Palestinians they have color-coded IDs
so they haven't they have no citizenship
anywhere but they have IDs
and they try to some of them can't leave
their home towns at all or unless they
get a permit and permits can be very
hard to find so this is kind of an
exception when a friend an American
friend of mine came and visited me in
the West Bank he wanted to see Hebburn
so this guy right here name is hisham he
had a applied to work for the Palestine
monitor and the positions already been
filled but I came to call anyway and he
said oh yeah come on down so he he took
us to the tour to surround the old city
and took us to this is kind of this is a
den above a refrigerator repair shop
it's kind of frowned on to to drink
alcohol in an herb brenda's kind of a
conservative city so they have their
little upstairs den where they have you
know wine and there you know communist
posters and of course they made us lunch
it's kind of a standing joke and
Palestine if you have somebody for
directions they'll invite you to dinner
and this was a no exception as farmers
markets all over Palestine these are so
this is Nablus which is in the middle of
the northern West Bank right up here a
beautiful area really rich agricultural
and there's ruins from the Crusader era
and this so this actually is a Samaritan
village that's overlooking Nablus and
the people there identify as Arabs but
they pray in Hebrew so they kind of a
bridge between they get along with the
Israelis in with the Arabs so it's kind
of a nice nice uh existence theorem I
guess the coexistence could happen and
this this building right here is a a
fancy mansion built by the wealthiest
Palestinian in the world of Italian
marble and the first time I saw it I was
like what on earth is going on up there
but it's it's a mansion in Nablus
there's also the church of Jacob's Well
and sort of because Nablus like most
like all Palestinians did
is surrounded by checkpoints it's very
difficult for Christian pilgrims to get
to this area so when you go you kind of
have it to yourself which is nice and
also kind of sad but a beautiful church
and the well is really cool in a village
north of Nablus there's a restaurant
there's a village called by then and
they have a restaurant built into the
side of a hill where where there's a big
spring so there's about five waterfalls
in this restaurant and grapevines
overhead and sort of tree canopies down
below it's a beautiful place to just
spend time as well this is a él es mean
hotel in Nablus typical arabic food and
this is they have a little stained glass
medallion with a gun shot a hole right
in the middle of the mosque it's a
village near Nablus called Salim and
just pretty free landscapes up there jus
village is right north of Kalki Lea so
it's right in this area and it's a time
of about 3,000 which my hometown of
Stigler Oklahoma is also about 3,000 and
so it's kind of my home away from home
in and the West Bank is the first place
I went when I traveled there and I spent
a lot of time there these these guys are
two brothers that are really good
friends of mine and their father some of
their nephews and I always look forward
to olive harvest time when I was there
some of their lands Oh cut of a jus
house party this little guys named Osama
he's pretty adorable so yeah olive
harvest every year is a big kind of a
big party everyone gets together harvest
together makes jokes chats for hours and
a big payoff is the picnic usually some
women will bring down you know big
buckets a really really lovely homemade
food so it's a good um good time but
unfortunately more often than not at
some point Israeli soldiers will you
know come and ask us what we're doing
and what's our business and all this and
it you know on Palestinian land so it's
a it's kind of a mixed mixed feeling
these days and so now the second half of
the talk is more about the actual
occupation it just sort of scenes of
destruction around Nablus this was the
administrative headquarters of the you
know the police and the sort of town
hall was destroyed by the Israeli army
in 2002 another scene from a checkpoint
and tank rolling in more sort of typical
the kind of things you see on the news
about what's happening in Palestine so
one thing that a lot of people don't
understand is the extent of settlements
checkpoints and you know what the wall
does to people in the West Bank so I'll
explain that a little bit this was a
Qalandia checkpoint the main crossing
point between the West Bank and
Jerusalem a really long wait and that's
if it's open it was not open you just
you can't exit the West Bank at all um
in the West Bank there are more than 600
checkpoints and roadblocks and most of
them are actually within the West Bank
not not on the borders with Israel as
most people assume they're all you know
scattered throughout mostly to protect
the settlements which I'll get to that
in a minute and for example you know
Nablus is surrounded by 16 checkpoints
and if you can't get through you have to
hike over these mountains which takes
about two hours and you run the risk of
being arrested or shot if if um you know
and its really soldier sees you trying
to bypass the checkpoint it's actually a
very lovely walk if you're not worried
about sniper fire but it's a it's a
problem for that reason especially if
you have a somebody's get the hospital
or a teacher trying to get to his job it
can be a big you no hassle ER or simply
impossible and the settlements there's
about 130 sort of
authorized Israeli settlements in the
West Bank they're all illegal under
international law because it's a
transfer of civilian population and
occupied territory but there's 130 of
those and then a hundred unauthorized
outposts which means that even under
Israeli law there they're not legal but
they sort of get tacit approval and
tacit sometimes ex post facto approval
and a lot of them get you know roads and
electricity built by the Israeli
government so and this is one of the
settlements called see goats which is so
as you can see like all this down here
is Ramallah and this is echoed
settlements sort of overlooking the
whole thing this is Nablus down here and
Elon Moreh settlements up here this is a
one of the settlements around Jerusalem
I forget what it's called but they took
a forested hilltop and turn it into this
and it's for its for Israelis only like
Palestinians can't can't even you know
access it much less live there um a
friend and i visited the Elan more like
Elon where I settlements and I asked
this guy who's a settler leader like you
know what do you think about when you
when you look down and you see all the
Palestinians living there and he said
and I said you know what what do you
think should be done and he said well I
think they can they can stay here as
long as they keep to their areas and you
know leave us alone and I said he mean
like an Indian Reservation and he said
exactly like an Indian Reservation
that's that's what we should do so
that's kind of a and that's one of the
milder things I've heard a settler say
so here's a map of the West Bank these
are all the Palestinian built-up areas
this is um this is Israeli West
Jerusalem and this is east jerusalem
which israel annexed all of this in
nineteen eighty in contravention of
international law even the United States
doesn't build its embassy in Jerusalem
because it's not it's still kind of not
quite legal status and then here are all
the settlements all these blue things so
it's like this
is a they really SAT they really sort of
Swiss cheese through the West Bank and
it also roads that connect all the
settlements and the Palestinians can't
use so it's a big it really splits the
West makeup and a lot of the checkpoints
the point is to you know keep
Palestinian separate from the settlers
and these are just various phases of the
wall the Israel's building they say to
stop suicide bombers which it's it's
it's hard to say whether the building of
the wall is actually resulted in the
lessening of terrorism since 2005 the
walls still not completed and illegal
workers from the Palestinian territory
is still going to Israel regularly so if
if people really want a suicide bomb
basically they can but um but
Palestinian I mean pehle scenes would
prefer not to have a wall but if there
is a wall they say you know fine but
build it on Israeli land not Palestinian
land but as you can see it it winds all
the way all around Palestinian areas and
this is what the wall looks like in
urban areas it's a you know 20 to 30
foot tall concrete structure this is my
friend Anna a Dutch anthropologist
standing on the wall in the Jerusalem
area here's kind of a before and after
shot of what the wall looks like in
Jerusalem and a lot of them go right
down the middle of Palestinian
neighborhoods sort of you know on this
side of stuff Israel in San acts and on
this side is is what they're thinking to
leave for the Palestinians so here's
here's this again is a Jerusalem of
Israeli West Jerusalem here and east
jerusalem is here and all these gray
areas are Palestinian built-up areas and
here's the settlements that are trying
to encircle a you know East Jerusalem so
that Israel can annex as much as
possible and there's another settlement
here that's not shown for some reason
but there's a big one there as well
and here's where the wall is being built
just sort of the different different
sections of it here all the checkpoints
and so this basically all of this is
what Israel is trying to these really
government is trying to annex with the
wall and it really kind of cuts
palisades off from the capital of east
jerusalem and also from it cuts the east
and west bank kind of a nose because the
West Bank in North or northern and
southern part so there's 70 kilometers
of wall in the East Jerusalem area and
it cuts about a quarter of a million
Palestinians away from the West Bank
which means either they have to sort of
renounce some of their West make
identity and their ties to family and
friends and universities or they have to
sort of take themselves away from East
Jerusalem and live in the West Bank so
it's it's a terrible choice for a lot of
people Bethlehem has something similar
being done to it this is Bethlehem just
south of Jerusalem this is a church a
nativity the the modern wing of the
church and this is my manger square in
Bethlehem during Christmas a few years
ago so here's what's going on in
Bethlehem this is the gray areas again
are Palestinian built-up areas these are
villages and the blue areas are
settlements and here's all the
checkpoints that surround Bethlem make
it difficult to for people to get around
and again the sections of the wall being
built and all of this area first of all
Bethlehem is being separated from
Jerusalem which is you know for
centuries has been for millennia
actually has been a sister holy city to
Jerusalem with a lot of you know
Christian and Muslim and Jewish holy
sites that you know people went through
freely but now for example if you want
to do the Palm Sunday procession from
you know from Jerusalem to Bethlehem
it's impossible you can't get past the
wall so it's a bigger and bethel hems
almost a ghost town now in a lot of
areas because tourists can't get in and
people can't get out another shot
of the wall around Jerusalem there's
it's become a major canvas for graffiti
which is kind of a silver lining here's
a Gandhi portrait and ctrl alt delete
and the friends school again they
crafted a holiday message on the wall so
now there's a special case in a town
called Kalki lea which is right here as
you can see the wall surrounds it almost
totally and there's one entrance point
which is controlled by an Israeli
checkpoint basically rendering it ghetto
because it's isolated from its land is
isolated from the rest of the West Bank
it's isolated from the world forty
thousand palestinians sort of trapped in
this open-air prison and for example you
know somebody from hobli or Roth whataya
if they want to go to calculate ago to
the hospital used to it was you know
very short very short hike now they have
to go all the way around here through so
many checkpoints and then take this road
and then pass the last checkpoint to get
the hospital and it's same with Jay use
people who go to university and kalki
Leah have to go all the way around and
it's a big hassle and as you can see
like you know these settlements are only
this big and they're taking this much
land so it's you can see why the
residents were pretty upset this is
central cal kelia just a picture from
inside the American friend of mine who
came to visit outskirts of Kalki Leah
and this is sort of what it looks like
next to the wall there's a thin strip of
farmland it's left to the to the to the
residents and then just totally
surrounded by the wall and sniper towers
and you can't even won't really watch
the sunset anymore and it's a big it's
kind of a nightmare and then here's a
Israeli highway going along where the
border the fence the wall around calcula
is kind of out of sight out of mind kind
of thing and in the Janine tolk a
diamond calculate kind of the northern
West make areas about 3,000 kids as a
direct result of the wall couldn't
their education and of course more have
been enabled because of checkpoints and
other problems and so in urban areas
it's a concrete wall in rural areas it's
an electrified fence with army access
roads on both sides of it and trenches
sort of bordering it and then piles a
razor wire so it's a huge huge scar on
the landscape if you approach the fence
without authorization you can be shot on
sight and it's happened before and the
Israeli army that they've isolated a lot
of farm land from Palestinians but they
try to say oh but we we made gates and
we let them access to the farmland it's
fine but as you can see here it's kind
of a joke it's really difficult for
farmers to to get exactly where they
need to be exactly the right time and
even if they do they still have to
happen is really permanent which can be
very difficult or impossible to get and
even if they have a permit and they're
out there on time the soldiers might not
show up this has happened while i been
there i mean people with permits have
been turned back or the soldiers haven't
showed up so it's a another big hassle
I'm here's some kids trying to get
through a gate to get to school the like
I said the permit system is pretty hard
to get around and Jay use for example
about I think fewer than a third of the
farmers are allowed access to the land
and even if they're allowed access you
know they can't hire a worker to help
them and so it's it's it's you can see
the city deteriorating as you go every
year because fewer and fewer people can
access their their source of livelihood
here's another picture of Jay use and as
you can see you know just right below it
there's there's defense even though the
the green line is that the border with
Israel is four kilometers away and all
of this land and there's more you know
this is just some of the land but all
this land is jus land that's been
isolated by by this wall greenhouses
citrus trees almond trees olive trees
and a also importantly seven of you know
all seven of Jay uses water wells and
their main above-ground reservoir
here's pictures of farmers trying to get
through the wall to their land being
being checked this is a another case of
this is the mayor of Jay use via zona
son Mohammed and they you know sometimes
they get harassed or driven off their
land while they're trying to work this
is a view of you know these really
government likes to say oh it's just a
fence it can be torn down easily it's no
big deal but this is an example of what
fence construction can look like this
whole mountainside has been totally
destroyed you know just right next to
Jay whose land and this is kind of a
close-up where 13 of this family's 20
olive trees were destroyed in this area
other families you know they've lost
hundreds of trees and in December of
2004 the Israeli army bulldozes 650 more
olive trees to build a new settlement on
jus land called zoo phim north at that
time there was a there was a rally that
developed with Israeli and Palestinian
peace activists and this guy yuriai
Maneri he's by 85 years old he was a
former member of Israel's Knesset or
Parliament and he was actually a member
of a pre Israeli state militia called
the ER goon sensing he's become a peace
activist and he said two years ago we
had when the fence was built here we had
a hard time convincing people in Israel
the defense was erected for political
and settlement purposes first they
separated the people of Jews from their
land preventing them from working on it
now everything is clearly visible they
are passing the land of settler
possession so this kind of caper is
happening all over the West Bank and
just this week I mean right now
information has come to light that a new
settlement in the Bethlehem air that a
settlement in the bethlehem area has new
growth approved so even while you know
people are talking about hopes for peace
the settlements are still expanding all
over the West Bank more pictures of the
wall and I think the wall is an example
of collective punishment which is not
legal under international law
there's a lot of cases of that now
here's tebron huh burn is in the
southern West Bank and it has a whole
story of its own here are some
photographs of Hebron around the old
city in 1997 the the Israeli government
sort of took over the h2 area of heparin
we're 30,000 Palestinians lived and 500
Israeli settlers lived and you can see
there's and though this includes the
entire Old City and the Ebrahimi mosque
/ cave of the patriarchs which is a very
important holy site for both Muslims and
Jews and now only a few thousand
palestinians are left because of settler
harassment because of difficulty in
moving because difficulty in getting
goods and services in and out and here's
the settlements where the where the the
settlers live it's 500 sellers protected
by 2,000 Israeli soldiers and in parts
of the old city the settlers live right
above the Palestinians and they have to
have chicken wire over over the thing
because the settlers tend to throw
garbage and rocks and stuff at the
Palestinians as I going past a Jewish
friend and I visited this area and we
almost he almost had settler slop water
poured on his head well he was while he
was walking this is a typical Hebburn
street in Palestinian area in h1 and
this is what it looks like in h2 similar
Street you know totally shut down
totally cleanse of Palestinians and
patrolled by Israeli soldiers to make
sure that none of the Palestinians can
find a way to resist this very very
eerie vibe replace this is some of the
examples of graffiti and heparin done by
the settlers this this one is just
because I don't think there's anything
sadder than unfunctional earth but
that's that's the case
jdl the Jewish Defense League this is
some of their work and I mean not only
did here's a picture of settlers
harassing Palestinians while soldiers
basically watch the soldiers themselves
sometimes cause problems for
Palestinians and this is my boss Mustafa
Barghouti when he was running for
president in 2005 he was a you know he
had to campaign for president so he
wanted to travel as much as possible but
he was barred from entering the hebburn
old city he was arrested twice he was
beaten once at a checkpoint along with
his entourage and he was he was allowed
into the Gaza Strip we're about a third
of Palestinian voters reside but his
driver his campaign manager and the rest
of his retinue were denied so he was
just kind of on his own there and this
is this is the kind of restrictions that
a presidential candidate you know faces
and you can imagine what it's like for
ordinary Palestinians Gaza Strip is a
different story it's a cut off you know
it's isolated from the West Bank already
surrounded by a wall and the checkpoint
to get in is about a kilometre long
tunnel once you pass the checkpoint and
there's electric gates inside and you
can get sort of trapped between gates
and it's a big hassle but I was actually
surprised when I visited Gaza that there
are still some pretty areas left I mean
this is northern Gaza Strip so turning
the harbor in Gaza City although the
fishing boats can't go very far out into
the water because it's really ships
patrol it and if they go past a certain
limit they can get shot at and it's
happened a lot as well it's a school in
a central Gaza Strip and sort of the
town square in a central Gaza Strip but
there are also large areas that are
totally devastated by these really
governments and I visited and these I'm
standing on a rooftop here in Rafah
which is in the southern gaza strip just
across there's a border with Israel with
Egypt nearby and these are just all
pictures taken from this one rooftop
and here so the Israeli government has
destroyed about 18,000 Palestinian homes
since nineteen sixty-seven and the
majority for administrative reasons
which means they're built without a
permit but it's very difficult for
Palestinians get permits especially in
that sort of areas that Israel would
prefer to annex for the settlements the
second is admit of clearing operations
which means you know the areas are too
close to a border or too close to a
settlement or something so that this is
an example of the second kind a clearing
operation as you can see you know all
these neighborhoods along the border
with Egypt have been totally wiped out
and I was kind of on the border there
when I was taking these pictures of
where this is happening and by the way
the third type is punitive which means
if a suicide bomber of blow himself up
in Israel then his family's home often
gets demolished so this is again I'm on
the roof again of the house and rafa and
these are some of the homes that are
partially destroyed and families are
still living there because they have
nowhere else to go it's a very crowded
area you see the water tank in the
laundry which means people are still
trying to live here and um kids playing
on sort of a 45 degree angle house on
this kid this is again my friend John
half the half Palestinian from Kentucky
and this is one of his students at the
Friends School and uh he his family
lives in this house in the Gaza Strip
which the Israeli army occupied because
it overlooks a settlement this is a
settlement area used to be it was
destroyed in 2005 but because it
overlooked it it was occupied by Israeli
soldiers for five years and Israeli
soldiers lived on or took over the top
three floors and the family was forced
to live on sort of half of the bottom
floor and they the reason they didn't
leave is because they knew if they did
that has to be demolished so they sort
of bore up under the situation for five
years and one time the UN convoy came to
check up on the situation and as they
were leaving and Yusuf walked out and
was waving goodbye to them
uh one of the soldiers shot him in the
back and he he survived luckily but the
the bullet is stolen is lodging the
spine so if he you know if he doesn't to
vigorous activities he's afraid
everyone's afraid it might damage his
nerves so he's kind of fragile after
that his sister crafted this message out
of spent Israeli shells in their yard
and this is Palestinians uh in this
engagement 2005 the when the settlements
were gone finally people can visit the
beaches because the beaches have been
taken over by the settlers so a lot of
these kids you know if they're under
five years old and never seen the sea at
all so this is for many of them the
first their first time to swim in the
ocean um since the Second Intifada began
in September 2000 about 1100 Israelis
including 123 children have been killed
and it's difficult to find reliable
statistics for the Palestinians because
some Palestinian organizations count
suicide bombers among the casualties
which isn't really fair and some Israeli
you know numbers don't count for example
Palestinians even who died due to denial
of medical treatments from the
checkpoint to the wall so it's you know
it's kind of hard so these numbers are
basically a floor I went with the
Israeli numbers and these are basically
a floor like the the men among the
number of Palestinians killed um it's
actually probably maybe ten fifteen
percent higher i would i would guess but
um these are these are just three
stories of children have been shot by
israeli snipers um this one iman Oh Homs
was a on her way to school when she
wandered into a closed military area in
the Gaza Strip which these areas aren't
really marked it's just kind of I mean
he it's easy to stumble on them and not
realize it and uh one of the soldiers
shot her and then walked up to her and
shot her twice on the head to confirm
the kill and then um put his his gun and
automatic
shot her about 12 more times and this
was a what happened was his his fellow
soldiers were so horrified that they
told Israeli television about the the
incident and leaked the transcript of
you know what the watchtower was saying
and what um what captain are he was the
person who who shot him who shot her so
this was the transcript that was leaked
um and you know captain are makes it
clear I another soldier glowing a little
closer look forward to confirm the kill
received situation report we fired and
killed her I was confirm the kill over
anything moving in the zone even a
three-year-old needs to be killed and I
hasten to add that this is not an
indictment of the Israeli people by any
means well yeah I should mention first
that captain our was cleared of all
charges a year later he was charged with
mostly Israeli soldiers who killed
Palestinians aren't charged with
anything but in this case he was charged
with illegal use of weapons conduct
unbecoming an officer and obstruction of
justice and a year later he was cleared
of these but you know I'm sure all of
you are familiar with the case of Abu
Ghraib and probably most are familiar
with the Stanford Prison Experiment and
pretty much anytime you have one group
of people having almost complete power
over another and very slippery legal
leeway these kind of horrific situations
are often not far behind and this one
rag de was she was sitting in a UN
classroom just in the middle class and a
bullet came in and entered under her eye
and exited the back of her head and she
she was she died pretty quickly after
that idea was killed by a shot to the
stomach in a similar incident about a
month later and the the UN issued a
press release saying you know that this
this can't go on the place where
a fire so indiscriminate that it makes
schooled you know dangerous for children
is a unacceptable but that's that's um
the independent I believe in Britain
quoted Israeli soldiers is admitting
like yeah Gaza strokes free hunch a
free-fire zone it's a think a playground
for sharpshooters wuzzy the word they
used Israel engages and targeted
assassinations and these are the numbers
I'm least sure of because i couldn't
find like a rock solid source but i know
these are clothes like within certainly
within you know a couple hundred about a
third innocent bystanders and I mean as
for the children kill Dick and I can
name a top of my head and just the
course of one assassination so I
wouldn't be surprised at all by these
numbers and these numbers I'm fairly
certain of as of mid two thousand and
five more by standards and targets have
been killed by israeli assassinations
which are by the way illegal under
international law because obviously
there's no chance of a fair trial it's
kind of judge jury and executioner and
there's not necessarily really good
oversight of who gets put on the list to
be assassinated women's health
statistics are pretty horrific about
fifty policy women have been forced to
give birth at checkpoints nearly half
the babies died it's it's much harder to
get you know prenatal care postnatal
care more stillbirths here's some
examples of people who've died due to
lack of medical treatment this guy's AP
palestinian AP journalists and his
daughter his daughter died because an
ambulance gonna get to her she was 21
years old and she's a dialysis patient
she gets the hospital for dialysis and
they wouldn't let her leave the gaza
strip so she died as a while since 67
about 650,000 Palestinians have been
through the israeli prison system which
amounts to
forty percent of the adult male
population so it so this is definitely
an issue that affects virtually everyone
right now there's about eight thousand
who are being held 550 are held in an
administrative detention which means
they're held without charge or trial for
threw up to three months and the
three-month sentences can be renewed
indefinitely so it's kind of an Abu
Ghraib type thing where and not have a
great want on ammo type thing where if
everybody knows you can disappear
indefinitely with no charger trial and
it's it's a threat hanging over
everybody um he's gonna example I think
this is in Hebron kid being harassed by
soldiers here's a another detainee and
uh sometimes they'll come into town and
just arrest all the young men between 16
and 40 and uh detain them for a while
their story to go with these pictures
but I think we're running low in time um
so everyone hears about the violent
resistance of Palestinians it's what
makes the news but a few people know how
much nonviolent resistance goes on all
the time it just gets ignored because of
you know the overarching you know if it
bleeds it leads and if somebody's just
marching down Main Street demanding
something it's pretty easy to ignore
that these are just a few of the
nonviolent organizations that work
advanced repeated these are almost all
of these are joint israeli-palestinian
projects so there's there's a lot
there's really a lot of a lot of good
things going on but they just get so
hopelessly overshadowed by by the
violence in the political situation this
is a benign village it's west of
Ramallah right in this area and as you
can see the wall is taking a lot of this
land away and so every friday at noon
they uh palestinian international and
israeli peace activists gather and
protest and it's um I mean the protests
haven't done a lot of good but it's a
nice
time to sort of everyone you know get
together and a feeling of solidarity
that this uh you know this isn't right
it's not a way to peace and I went to
the protest once just to to take notes
and write an article about it because
since I lived there I wasn't just sort
of a coming in for a month so do
activism I really did want to get
arrested because there's a good chance
that be deported so I was hanging in the
back just taking notes and their people
in front of it kind of getting roughed
up and you know teargas flying
everywhere and all of a sudden
unprovoked soldiers started shooting
things and in my direction like that you
know there's the rearguard people so I
turned around and ran and something hit
me in the back of the leg and you know
you don't know what it is it could be
anything can be real grenade it could be
a flashbang grenade it could be a tear
gas canister I didn't know so it was a
moment of sort of like you know what's
what's gonna happen next and I didn't I
didn't even hear the explosion because I
guess the adrenaline was blocking that
neural pathway or something but um I
knew I anyone had exploded because I was
partially deaf for several hours but it
turned out luckily to be a flashbang
grenade which make a big noise and they
throw a little fireball but they don't
they don't throw a shrapnel so I was had
a nasty bruise but I was fine but that's
that's the kind of thing that that
happens when you try to engage in
nonviolent resistance another example is
in May of 2004 there was a big
demonstration in Rafah against an
earlier a sort of a lot of people from
offer were killed in an israeli
incursion there was a demonstration
against that a few days later and an
Israeli helicopter shot a missile into
the into the demonstration they claimed
later that they had been aiming at a an
empty building just to scare the
demonstrators but this seems like a
pretty hollow excuse to given that I
mean anyone who shoots a missile
anywhere near a group of civilians is uh
asking for trouble here's some of the
aftermath
and what what a lot of people find hard
to understand when they when they hear
about all this is you know what what
what's America doing about it and the
answer is a total backing of Israel and
here's a few examples of quotes from
congressman here's my you know my guy
from Oklahoma because god said so let's
just take on it Tom DeLay you know I
don't see occupied territory I see is
real but it's it goes on both side of
the aisle to Democrats or same as
Republicans basically on this issue
here's Barack Obama you know continue
our unique defense relationship with
Israel fully fund military assistance
Hillary Clinton the same thing Oh in
fact twenty twenty seven percent of all
of America's foreign aid goes to Israel
while he's really the only make up you
know one tenth of one percent of the
world's population which is you know
it's a strange thing of just on the face
of it I mean we're giving and this is
just for military grants five and a half
million dollars every day to Israel as
well as full political backing and and
and again this is probably a little more
than half of all though the aid that
goes to Israel but this is just a
military aid the the US has
single-handedly vetoed 41 resolutions
requesting the Israel obey international
laws and treaties as you can see you
know 13 and 130 no one reported this all
the one is always America be telling all
these resolutions why is America
supporting Israel it's very complex I
wish I could go into the whole long
relationship but the short answer is
that for now the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee a pact is the second
most powerful lobby in America and while
the they certainly don't make American
foreign policy they do make it very hard
for people to debate the the foreign
policy like when I was living in
Washington there's so many roadblocks
and so many so much censorship and
self-censorship about the
israeli-palestinian conflict it's like
it's almost it's a huge taboo very very
strange
situation but it makes it very difficult
to have civil discussion about this and
something I heard a lot of Palestinian
say is that you know we like to believe
that the West is a beacon of democracy
and freedom and all these things but
then when we see what happens to us and
we see the response to it it's very hard
for us to to have faith in the West and
to have faith and democracy so they say
the silence for the West is worse than
the boats of the Israelis the good news
is that i think and i think a an
increasing number of people are
beginning to realize that Israeli and
Palestinian security depend on each
other like you can't have one without
the other so as a ami ayalon who was
commander of these really named Navy a
former head of the Shin Bet which is
really Internal Security Service they
came out against the wall against the
fence and against the assassinations and
all these sort of really harsh measures
because he says the more Palestinian
territory that we are a Nexian by
building this fence the more violence we
shall see in the future I'm not saying
this Caleb Palestinians I don't I don't
care about Palestinians but I care about
Israel on the way I understand Israel
should be and if we're controlling two
million Palestinians in the West Bank he
says in all of his experience of
fighting terror there's less terrorism
when Palestinians have hope for a state
and unless that hope is created we're
not going to have security no matter how
high we build a wall or how deep we
build the trench so what's the solution
first of all there's sort of the initial
work towards peace talks first step
obviously should be a seats for
comprehensive ceasefire including
stopping all settled expansion hello I'd
quit humanitarian aid into the Gaza
Strip people are also increasingly
coming to realize we have to talk to
Hamas give them a genuine chance to
moderate or fail they've expressed
willingness to let her boss negotiate
and abide by a peace deal if it passes a
Palestinian referendum so we should
see if they're serious about that
instead of assuming they're not and
sanctioning them and totally making it
impossible for them to do anything and
maybe in the course of a year to hunt
the hundred unauthorized outposts it's a
no-brainer they need to be dismantled so
it can be a huge show of good faith for
Israel to dismantle these while the
Palestinians handles I mean make sure
there's no suicide bombings no Rockets
none of this that could be a workable
situation for peace for to LA talks most
important thing is peace the peace deal
has to be based on international law not
on the fact that Israel has more power
than the Palestinians because I mean the
Palestinians they know what their rights
are and they know that if they don't
they know they have a right to resist as
long as international law is not
followed and it's kind of a gray area
until I mean once they have their rights
under international law then if they
still resist and it's clear cut that
they they're the ones in the wrong but
until then there's big gray area and
what about a final peace deal in a 2002
the governments of the entire Arab world
came together and offered Israel peace
and recognition based if they will
withdraw 297 borders which means allow
the West Bank and Gaza for Palestinian
state have east west jerusalem for
Israel's capital East Jerusalem for
Palestinian capital with some possible
swaps here and there and the rights of
refugees to return are enshrined
international law they're not negotiable
they have to be acknowledged but the
implementation of the right will
probably be a negotiated mixture of a
limited number who are repatriated into
Israel a larger number repaid a troop a
traitor to the West Bank and Gaza and
the rest what's the word given
reparations for their lost property so
far the Israeli government isn't
satisfied they want security before they
negotiate but that's it's kind of a
chicken and egg problem because until
there's good faith negotiation on the
table that there's a good chance they
will not have security
if the two-state i mean if if the
two-state solution is not implemented in
a reasonable amount of time well I mean
Israel basically has to choose two
things either all the land between the
Jordan of the Mediterranean majority
Jewish rule and peace if they if they
keep all the land but don't allow a you
know a Palestinian state then what we
have is apartheid because you have a
minority soon-to-be minority Jewish
population between the Jordan in the
Mediterranean ruling over a majority
Airy Arab population second alternative
is Jewish democracy and peace which
means they you know the fair two-state
solution if they want all the land and
peace what's a lot of people right now
we're moving toward the idea that okay
the two-state solution is dead Israel
not allow it so it's next is a
anti-apartheid struggle between the
Jordan in the Mediterranean and an
eventual one-state solution most
Palestinians have nothing against a
one-state solution is really the
Israelis who still want to have a Jewish
democracy rather than a shared democracy
so they oppose the one-state solution
but it's like you got to pick one you
know you gotta you gotta be serious I
can't stress enough this is the tip of
the iceberg of what's going on over
there and all the issues surrounding it
and if you want to read more I'm writing
a book called fast times in Palestine
and you know for more information
already get in touch with me which
you're very welcome to my website is
Pamela Sun org so yeah that that will
tell you a lot more about it so that's
my talk and I'm over your questions
yep I reckon stated the last slide what
exactly are the demographics within
Israelis and the Palestinians so there's
in Israel proper there's about five
million Jews about 1 million Arab
Israelis or Palestinians who are left
over from 1948 and then the West Bank
and Gaza there are about 4 million
Palestinians so Jews are kind of roughly
a bare majority still but it's changed I
mean Arabs have a much higher birth rate
so it's rapidly moving in that direction
yeah as for Jordan Egypt Egypt they're
pretty angry I mean not at Egypt with it
Mubarak because he he also like Israel
gets a lot of foreign aid from America
and a lot of that foreign aid goes to
repressing his own population who aren't
so happy about some of his policies both
his internal policies and his foreign
policies in the recent violence in Gaza
he basically Tassili supported Israel
and you know this makes people in
Egypt's as well as in the Palestinian
territories furious it's just they just
think of him as a total sellout and a
dictator Jordan's a little more
complicated they also get a lot of
foreign aid and they also have a you
know close relationship with the West
they even with the Iraq war they kind of
were forced to tacitly support it even
though not out loud I've forced taking a
lot of Iraqi refugees so the king of
Jordan knows that you can't cross
America too strongly because he you know
the egg gets cut off and there's many
other ways America can make his life
difficult but he's trying really hard to
skate that line but it's it's it's a
nearly impossible situation um what was
your other question people think about
being occupied by
Oh between 40 and say okay i see so
that's right after the 48 war Jordan
occupied the West Bank and Egypt occupy
the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians at
this point at 48 it was not long after
36 which is the Palestinian Arab revolt
and they were largely stripped of their
arms and leaders that they were fighting
its British occupation at that point so
they were you know scattered they had no
leaders they had no arms and they
weren't thrilled to be occupied by Egypt
and Jordan but they didn't really fight
it they didn't really have the means
they just sort of but again you know
Jordanians and Egyptians are much closer
to Palestinian culture and they I'm sure
they cause problems but they certainly
weren't all the checkpoints there wasn't
the wall there wasn't people being
kicked off their land so it's a similar
but also different situation yeah well I
know you said at the outset that you
weren't presenting a balance you and
that this is the Palestinian perspective
which is important for us to know but
I'm a little concerned about the way
you've portrayed on the potential peace
issue because it sounds to me like
you're saying that Israel is the block
to peace and I I don't see it that way
Hamas has as one of its basic tenets the
destruction of Israel they don't
recognize Israel as a nation and don't
believe that they have a right to be
there right and they continue they reach
the sea spire and we both liked it but
they continue to rain rockets down
that's not a ceasefire so how do you
negotiate peace with an organization
okay several things up first of all as
far as for the ceasefire that's a pretty
simple one Israel's part of the
ceasefire was to allow humanitarian aid
into got into the Gaza Strip in exchange
for ceasing the rocket fire the rocket
fire ceased the humanitarian aid wasn't
at about twenty percent but it wasn't
nearly enough so the Hamas is argue like
ok they're already kinda breaking the
ceasefire and then on of ember forth
while America I mean myself I pay
attention to this and I didn't notice
because I was thinking about the
elections these really are me killed six
Hamas members in the Gaza Strip so Hamas
is okay all bets are off I mean he
wasn't good faith in the first place and
now this is a clear violation so that's
when the rocket started first and then
after the after the ceasefire expired
then again the Hamas was like okay hmm
you never allowed enough humanitarian
aid in you violated the terms of
ceasefire so they they violated them as
well as for Hamas believing Israel has
no right to exist the PLO didn't change
its charter until about nineteen
eighty-eight and you know that this
charter also didn't agree that Israel
should exist so basically the point here
is you don't talk to your friends you
talk to your enemies so one thing that
Hamas has as as some of us leverage
which has very little leverage we must
be honest the Rockets are kind of I mean
they have a point one percent kill rate
which is so terrible I me need it one
death is too many but it's really not
that much leverage if you think about it
but one thing they do have leverage is
look if you you know negotiate a fair
deal then we can you know think about
you go recognizing Israel's right to
exist another another of their arguments
is like you know who says who has a
right to route to exist I mean you know
did the Native Americans have to sign a
paper saying America has a right to
exist in America did Aborigines in
Australia say the Australians how to
write to to make a country on our land
and you know move us off and all this
kind of thing no they didn't because the
right almost doesn't matter that what
matters is that it does exist and
there's Hamas understands that there's
very little they can do
to save face what they one thing they
could do is have a ceasefire for 50
years which they've expressed
willingness to do and in the end by the
time 50 years have passed it's going to
be irrelevant what they think honestly
they they'll probably be disarmed by
then they might not exist by then but
for them to say yes Israel had a right
to come to our land in nineteen nineteen
forty eight and you know kick 750,000
Palestinians off their land that's a
tough pill for Palestinians to swallow I
mean I think I think recognition of
Israel's existence should I think should
be enough recognizing its right to exist
might be you know that's that's
difficult especially and is especially
difficult to do before negotiations even
begin so this is one thing Hamas says is
like you know we're not going to give up
all our leverage before we even start
talking so yeah comment and the question
I guess the last question that was made
the assumption that Hamas controls
everybody there I think it's probably a
pretty fractured especially
communication and how segmented all the
different peoples are over there so
that's also an issue for Hamas to be
able to control well then we'll pass the
Palestinians me let me address that for
sure Hamas doesn't control everybody
even in the 2016 Oh landslide elections
they actually won forty four percent of
the popular vote compared to fat days
forty percent and only looked like a
landslide because fat day was was
foolish and they split their own votes
and a lot of provinces so you ended up
with Hamas taking way more seats than
they should have based on voting
percentage but I'm also Hamas doesn't
control everybody by any means but Hamas
and pat tate together if they could form
a unity government which they've tried
several times and been thwarted by
various international shannon's but um
if they did then you know fat day has
basically you know aligned to the west
and Hamas has pretty good security
control in its areas so taken together
this could be promising the promising
mix
oh I see by the major problem actually
isn't Israel against peace it's it seems
like it's the u.s. especially in you
know with it's a UN Security Council
vetoing what I do see like
internationally you see just huge outcry
of support for for the Palestinians
that's not same here in the US all right
so what I have seen lately though in the
past couple years is more and more
awareness of what's going on over there
do you think that educating more within
the u.s. trying to sway cook it public
opinion towards a more balanced approach
in Israel and Gaza Strip is the way to
go and how else can we help right get
that out well I certainly think
educating people as an excellent Avenue
as I'm trying to do here and with my
book I certainly contacting
representative when there's some kind of
bill on the table about it it's good
writing a letter to the editor when you
see a bow a biased or silly article that
also helps one thing I've been noticing
lately in New York Times is that you'll
read an editorial that's sort of got the
usual American spin and bias and then
you read the comments section at the
other readers comments and the readers
comments are really savvy like they
really seem to understand much better
than the pundits what are going on and
you know to bridging this divide I'm not
sure you know how to do it exactly but
but right now what you have is a lot of
people who just sort of vaguely think
that this should change but they're not
really organized whereas the you know a
pack is extremely organized very
streamlined very you know to the point
so see education helps all this all
these kind of things help it's right I
think it's kind of a step by step thing
so my perception is that both sides in
this conflict seem to be racing for the
morale low ground and given that
the Israelis have military upper hand
why are the Palestinians not trying to
fight for them I ground the high ground
yeah it seems like if they follow the
approach of Gandhi they have been much
more successful yeah you know it's easy
to say that and I agree with you I think
they really should i think the violence
is is not helpful to say the very very
least but um when you have you know when
you have this situation and when you
have it over decades and when you have
like for example to oslo accords in 1993
you know between the Palestinian
Authority and Israel who said that in
the course of five years will give a
little bit more autonomy the
Palestinians and a little more and then
we'll have negotiations in the W
Palestinian state Palestinians were
thrilled you know they were like okay
this may be this is really happening but
what happened at the end of five years
is that settlement expected that the
settlement population in West Bank
doubled and so the Palestinians were
thinking okay you're not really being
serious about this this is not using not
really good faith and then the the Camp
David talks between Yasser Arafat and a
hoot Barack the the common American
understanding of what happened was a who
Barack gave Arafat an amazingly generous
offer Arafat walked away and started a
terror war oh it's much more complicated
than this Arafat wasn't very well
prepared oh that's for sure but Barak's
offer was such that you know he demanded
a total end of the conflict without
really dealing with the main issues like
for example Jerusalem wasn't going to be
divided or was you know there was like a
small suburb called a Buddhist of
Jerusalem that was going to be the
capital and refugees rights completely
off the table not even mentioned and you
know Barack said you know accept this or
you know or I mean this is this is it
and if our effort had accepted that not
only would I mean he would have been
killed he woulda been assassinated by
his own people because it was totally
unacceptable for them
there any leadership that is pushing for
that strategical the kite monotron
looking back your comments for India
took 90 or suffer the Honorable from
1857 to 1947 you're talking about five
years not a small amount of time 40
years in 67 major Blakely is there any
leadership of yourself for pushing
towards that strategic goal of higher
moral ground increased number of
population yeah right well like I say
there's some I mean my boss Mustafa
burgoo see he's always been totally for
nonviolent resistance totally against
any motorized ation of the conflict but
he's kind of a kind of a dennis kucinich
ralph nader kind of figure in Palestine
because the moderate forces come out and
say that hummus is violent leadership
sorry the one yeah it's difficult as
difficult I mean it they've tried very
hard over the years but you know it the
population I get squeezed and squeezed
and then you just you can't stop every
anger young man from from doing what he
feels I mean I mean I think that's the
point is that leadership the guy with
the same problem was okay yeah so there
actually is a guy named Marwan but
goosey who distant cousin to my boss
Mustafa who he's the most popular leader
in Palestine actually but he's currently
in jail in Israel and he's somebody who
you know if and when series peace talks
began taking place he's often been
called the Palestinian Nelson Mandela
and it's possible I mean he's he's so
popular he's got a lot of street
credibility but he also pretty savvy
about the west and about international
law and all this so he could be he could
be a good leadership but he's in jail so
it's it's difficult for now yeah
um well I mean as you can see from the
snickers and coca-cola signs and Heidi
cannibal and I can't American but I mean
they it's certainly not a you know
hateful kind of thing I lived there for
two years I never had the fact that I
was an American and people seem not just
tolerant but grateful that in American
comes and sees for herself because they
they can read the New York Times as well
as we can and they can see that the
story we're getting is very very
one-sided so they you know and I even
brought Israeli and American Jewish
friends and tour guided them around the
west bank and they were warmly welcomed
treated very well my guests so yep
and I envision you mean since the Second
Intifada begin yeah yeah so I mean
settlements all during the Oslo years
we're expanding and then they've still
been expanding since then and now the
wall is expanding you know onto
Palestinian land and I mean Palestinians
are I mean not just angry but
heartbroken about this because they see
that what's left of their homeland like
the one place in the world where they
feel like they're at home is being eaten
away and being you know divided up into
Canton's and it's a not only that but
you know all the deaths and all the
destruction so it's it's a mean you know
feel pretty bad about it um like I said
they say that if Israel wants to build a
wall it's welcome to build a wall but
they should build it on Israeli land
those lunch options
90 over to profitable which is was
actually the result of negotiation
between oh yes true it was seen as huge
concession on into your spot and instead
it was his own taking over the city yeah
there's a lot of examples of of of
arafat sort of capitulating to israeli
demands that palestinians don't see his
fare and hebburn was was a prime example
of that I mean handing over a place
where 30,000 people lived and you know
for the sake of 500 people who under
international law shouldn't even be
there the Palestinians didn't see this
is any kind of concession they saw it as
a takeover and then they thought you
know Arafat was a fool for agreeing to
that anyway else
actually hostile is more to continue the
authority I my personal experience I
don't think it was just means two
customers I guess you're strong yeah I
haven't Einstein is true okay
nuttin okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
