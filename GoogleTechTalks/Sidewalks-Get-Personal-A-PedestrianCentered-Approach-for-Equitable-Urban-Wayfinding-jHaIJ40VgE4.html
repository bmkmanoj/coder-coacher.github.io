Pacific Northwest region with that I'm
excited to hear what she has to say
about making sidewalks more accessible
thank you - hi so as Tim said my name is
Anat Kathy I am the director of the
tasker Center for accessible technology
thank you so much for having me here
today
I wanted to talk about equitable access
to urban environments and in particular
how open data about pedestrian spaces
can really enhance and improve
engagement in urban communities and
environments for everyone specifically
sidewalk navigation is really essential
to viral vibrant and sustainable cities
and sidewalks really make up the fabric
of urban life every commuter whether
they're arriving at a healthcare
appointment or walking to our car
arriving home from a bus station or even
commuting from one mode of
transportation to another uses sidewalks
to connect different modes and different
ways of commuting and so a little bit
about the Tasker Center for accessible
technology is as Tim mentioned we are
working on developing translatable
technologies to improve independence and
quality of life for individuals with
disabilities but really our design
process is focused on
with communities of practice and as such
we believe that participatory design
really enables us to design for the
fullness of human experience so while
our focus is communities with
disabilities we open our participatory
design processes to inclusive to be
inclusive for everyone so we started out
by addressing the needs of one
population best this is the fifty four
point five million individuals in the
u.s. that require assistive ability
devices or have trouble walking more
than a quarter mile as they
self-proclaim in the census and digital
cartography and routing currently seems
to marginalize this population because
it does not take into account specific
pedestrian needs that they might have
while technology has really made a
transformative difference in our ability
to access data that allows us to tackle
daily needs in particular with
automobile use and certainly somewhat on
with public transportation as we have
more and more multimodal routing
capabilities the first and last mile
have really been somewhat marginalized
when it comes to pedestrian ways many of
us have come to really depend on our
smartphones for navigating the city but
unlike cars humans present a
heterogeneous informational gap when we
approach the environment whereas a car
might have a specific need for a road to
be paved and Abey of a specific width as
humans we have very different needs when
we are coming to the environment
depending on our personal needs and
abilities so in this example I mapped
there in google directions starting
point at the University Station of the
light rail and ending at the electrical
engineering building at the University
of Washington and I'm presented with
several routes and different and the way
of comparing among them have to do with
the time it might take me to arrive at
my destination however first my ability
may not actually conform to the hamaji
model that's applied here so maybe I
won't quite make it at those times the
other problem is that information that
might be really important to me is not
represented and I've put in the
annotation of stairs where those might
be met as well as gravel road where it
might be difficult to real about one of
the important facets of this is that the
actual most accessible route is not
represented here which would be the
along the sidewalks along Steven's way
and so one facet as I said is that
different informational attributes of
the environment are not sufficiently
represented to allow me to make informed
decisions about where which route to
choose the other aspect of this is that
sidewalks are not actually treated as
part of a transportation network and
while footpaths are represented where
there are sidewalks that are sidewalks
along an automobile route I have no way
of adjudicating among the sides of the
sidewalk out at the sides of the street
that might be better for me to use and
so what we really didn't realize before
we started on this project is that many
applications don't use our dog data at
all instead they operate using car
centric Road data and as a result
millions of people don't have the
information that they might need in
order to get around so we believe that
addressing the needs of the specific sub
population that we started with actually
stands to highlight the needs of a much
larger swath of the population and
stands to improve routing supports for
everyone and I'd also like to point out
that we all have potential situational
needs that may be fulfilled by these
objectives once in a while I'm wheeling
about a sidewalk or I might be pushing a
delivery cart we hear a lot from our
users that stroller people who push
strollers love to use our app because it
informs them about the environment in
ways that other applications do not
additionally there
in our lives where we might have these
circumstances that make us require more
information about the environment
however access to that kind of
information about sidewalks and as if
they relate to our personal ability
seems to be lacking and in 2015 the
National Council on disability noted
that they really could not find
comprehensive information on the degree
to which sidewalks are accessible across
the u.s. and this lack of information
can have obviously significant negative
impact on the independence and mobility
of all people so the problem we're
addressing is that street-level
accessibility fundamentally affects
where and how people travel in cities
and what opportunities they have access
to and while the infrastructure problems
are ones that we can't really attempt to
solve here were able to bridge some of
the informational gap which exists as
people cannot determine whether their
personal access to an area before they
arrive
would enable them to travel and Traverse
so today I'd like to talk to you about
our solution to personalize pedestrian
routing and that will launch us into
another project about mapping pedestrian
infrastructure and how we can remain
pedestrian centric in the way that we
mapped the environment and built
environment the open sidewalks project
is what we've named our project and I'll
talk a little bit about more the open
data and shared data structure that
we're promoting and then talk about
other downstream applications for this
pedestrian centric data and the non
motorized mobility models that we've
used to create the personalized
pedestrian routing application so for
personalized pedestrian routing we have
called our app access mapped out IO and
it's widely available right now it's a
focuses on Seattle specific data and T
that really focuses on participatory
design practices as I mentioned and as
such we create an engage an umber of
communities of practice who code design
with us and so one of our participants
had the follow
to say using a tool like the erections
on Google Maps doesn't really help me
get around actually sometimes this does
more harm than good I'm sent down
streets I cannot cross or inclines that
are impossible to climb it can be deeply
frustrating and in some cases it can
actually turn around travel plan and
we've seen this in a number of the
participants that we've talked to and
also now that we're able to track the
usage of our app in practice how people
are actually following the routes that
were suggesting to them we see a number
of turnarounds so the bottom line is
each of us experiences the environment
differently and while I'm highlighting
mobility limitations there are
multitudes of needs out there that can
have different informational
requirements for example I can be
severely allergic and so this different
seasons of the year might make me more
inclined to choose different paths that
don't have me crossing tree-lined
streets for example and so you can
imagine multitudes of uses where if we
have the underlying pedestrian
transportation network were able to
imbue it with different attributes that
relate to different informational needs
that our consumers might need and I do
want to highlight that even though we're
addressing personalized needs this
doesn't mean that personalized routing
will only benefit individual consumers
in the past three years that we've been
following this path we've found many
more stakeholders and some of them have
actually contacted us because they
require the ability to custom route to
individuals or to groups of individuals
that have particular personal profiles
of mobility around the environment and
some of these would be private
businesses and transportation agencies
that have a DEA compliance
responsibilities and they might be
asking whether accessible paths to
specific locations or specific transit
stops actually exists for a particular
mobility profile particular visual
impairment etc another use has to do
with City
urban planners and wet weather they are
actually taking into account specific
personal profiles or characteristics
when they prioritize accessibility
infrastructure investments and while a
lot of these investments are reactive
cities like to show that the investments
that they make will make a larger impact
in certain contexts and what we're able
to do once we have these personal
mobility profiles is look at
accessibility bottlenecks across a much
larger area or portions of the
environment so the requirement for
deploying this kind of personalized
routing algorithms seem to be rather
simple and there really are major two
requirements first is we have to be able
to fully Express the underlying
transportation graph as a connected
graph so whereas the panel on the Left
shows individual segments a and B of
sidewalks what we really would like to
see is sidewalks represented as edges
and the nodes that connect them
represent the fact that they can be
connected now when we go from node to
node or through edges and reality we're
going through sidewalks in space
additionally we need to add attributes
to the graph nodes and edges and those
attributes will label the different
attributes that are important to
individuals as they mobilize about the
environment so they might label slope
they might label construction other
features like attributes that either
improve access or might be deleterious
to it in either way those attributes
will affect the mobility along those
sidewalk paths once those requirements
are satisfied then we can optimally
identify the best personal path that
uses a multi variable cost function so
what we're doing is taking a particular
transportation network and then applying
a personalized non motorized mobility
profile of a specific individual and
being able to cost their traversal
through space using a multi variable
cost function and what's shown is an
example right here where as a is I
believe of building your next door at
Google and B is reaching somewhere
across across 45th Street and what we're
seeing is that the optimized path for
that particular mobility profile is not
necessarily the shortest path but looks
at elevation change as a primary aspect
of the environment that I'd like to
minimize my elevation in climbing that I
traverse so I did want to show a live
demo but before that I'll say that we
started out building access map as an
aggregated map let's just put all the
attributes for a mobility limited
individual in one place because the
people that we surveyed look at a number
of different resources in order to even
be able to assess whether they'd be able
to access a particular environment they
use Google Street View they use other
kinds of resources elevation maps in
order to kind of walk through the space
virtually and be able to assess whether
it's possible for them to access that
but this is a really long and arduous
process oftentimes it's done at home
through a desktop computer some have
even recorded that for our walk through
in order to assess whether they'd be
able to access from the bus station to
City Hall for example in order to
perform daily business and so what I'd
like to
okay so there's access map it's a little
bit difficult to see on this screen but
you can see that we use certain visual
metaphors to indicate the may be L so
each sidewalk is represented
differentially and has a color that
might indicate what it's inclined might
be and I'm able to then click on that in
order to tell me what the actual
steepness for that would be likewise we
are also indicating crossings and when
to cross if when both sides of the
crossings have a curb ramp we indicate
that in the darker gray now downtown
Seattle actually is fairly well endowed
with curbs but you can see some
instances where the crossings are a
light gray and that would indicate that
one or both of the curb ramps are not
present lastly we indicate construction
information on the basis of permit
information that's open data on in the
city of Seattle's open data
end points and so that's just the
information that's there one thing that
you can really see visually by just
inspecting the city is just the vertical
inclination and from the ocean side up
towards the freeway you can see the red
line markings in this direction and the
fairly light markings in this direction
another thing I'd like to highlight is
that I can specify my personal mobility
so while we have some canonical mobility
profiles for manual chair power chair
and other device users you can also in
indicate your own uphill inclined
maximum for example I will say about
minus five point six and so that will
change the coloring of the inclines
along the different sidewalks on the
basis is what the elevation change would
be there
now one thing that we're still
struggling with is how to gather this
kind of information from the UI
perspective for people because nobody
comes to you and says oh yeah my
personal mobility limitation is at 5.4
percent great and so we've found
alternative ways to gather that kind of
information from people but I won't
actually talk about that today and so
then we introduced routing for example
setting the origin that they're a near
Club and trying to get to this
destination will send me further out
than the shortest path but will allow me
to go downhill at a rate that might be
more comfortable for me if I'm wheeling
downhill it would certainly be
uncomfortable to go down Seneca Street
which is quite steep and I believe
University steep along here has stairs
as well so we're avoiding some of those
obstacles which our map is aware of
great so let's talk a little bit about
our user base and what happened when we
actually introduced routing because we
had just the aggregate map available for
about a year and a half before we
enabled route so looking at usage but it
actually kind of surprised us we
anticipated having fewer aging
individuals and somewhat of a more
equitable use between males and females
and this is product probably partly due
to our communities of practice and who
we engaged in this first release but
we're trying to improve upon this
greatly another aspect that was
important to us was what were the
platforms that were accessing this
information and the reason that's
important is as I mentioned our initial
usability studies really identified the
fact that people are planning at
a lot of this pre-planning takes home it
takes place at home on desktop computing
for a longer term and so the sessions
would be very long and one of the
questions that we're trying to address
is whether having these kinds of routing
algorithms available would allow people
to actually route on the fly doing
things in a more spontaneous way and
potentially from our perspective
engaging in community access more
readily because they feel confident with
the information that's available to them
so let's say I'm done with my business
downtown might I go find a friend and in
the coffee shop nearby and be able to
confidently independently route to that
location and so what we were looking to
see was whether there's any transition
between desktop use to mobile use after
we've introduced the routing algorithms
and indeed we actually found a rather
significant change in that realm
the initial aggregated map was available
between June of 2015 to the January of
2017 and really a predominant use across
desktop users and then afterwards once
automated routing was introduced we see
a dramatic shift into mobile computing
and that's not to say that that's an
absolute indicator of course people can
be using mobile tablets at home but we
did see this shift and we're going to
inquire further into the details here so
what contributed to the long really long
lag time for providing automated routing
like we were hoping to do this with an a
month or two of the aggregated map and
clearly that was not happening
this really had to do with the lack of
underlying pedestrian transportation
graphs that I talked about earlier so
taking data from the city of Seattle's
Department of Transportation we found
that there were egregious errors in the
location of sidewalks and really very
little information about their
connectivity so the city of Seattle's
data is actually not that bad by
comparison to other cities and yet we
see a lot of what was happening
they're in the leftmost panel where you
have these dangling ends and really
inaccurate location GPS locations of
where sidewalk ends might be and we were
really quite surprised that to find that
all of them major mappers didn't have
any individual representations of
sidewalk segments that were not just
attributes of the car specific roads so
looking across open street maps tom-toms
Google Maps as well we found this lack
of explicit representation for sidewalks
as entities finally when we're looking
at agencies and municipalities in
particular who either need or are
required by law to maintain this kind of
information these stakeholders might
have the sidewalk information but it's
all in these asset management systems so
you can think of these as like Excel
spreadsheets with line items for every
sidewalk segment it might detail to you
when it was last patched up or some
permit was awarded in 1934 but it
doesn't actually give you the accurate
GPS locations or how they're connected
to other sidewalk segments and so
they're not really held in any type of
standard format either because every
municipality chooses its own asset
management system and so being able to
launch access map again in another city
even Kirkland or Bellevue we would have
to go back to square one essentially and
be able to do all of our error
correction all over again because every
data collection had its own biases and
nuances that we had to learn for every
municipality and so none of this was
really translatable but we were able to
finally do it for one city over the span
of a year and a half
lastly there is that connectivity
problem where the underlying graph would
still need to be inferred and validated
in order to result in some kind of
transportation network that allows us to
do what happens here on the right which
is take the raw data be able to estimate
some kind of error correction redraw the
and annotate the entire transportation
network and then
you're finally able to allow people both
trip planning and sufficient analytics
so that they can understand what's the
environment on the ground looking like
and so our project actually really
quickly transformed into promoting this
standardized sidewalk collection of
pedestrian infrastructure in a
pedestrian centric manner and in order
to explicitly Express a personalized
cost function on the right we have to
take into account a really huge variety
of needs so whereas the workflow is
shown on the Left where the user
specifies their own preferences we are
then able to calculate the personal
costs for traveling along a sidewalk
given the sidewalk attributes right so
the costing function is actually
conditioned upon both the individual for
whom were routing as well as the
attributes of the environment and
finally the algorithm itself optimizes
for the best path given those
preferences not specifically time or
distance or some subjective accessible
information that other users might have
contributed what are some of these
heterogeneous needs that might be
represented in the personalised cost
function well we have to take a lot of
things into account people use white
canes manual wheelchairs power
wheelchairs crutches scooters walking
canes legs and add to that different
athletic ability right you have this
hugely heterogeneous underlying cost
function and what we really had to do is
start prioritizing what it is that we
collect in our standard data set in
order to be able to supply people with
personalised routing so initially we
really just prioritized on the
connectivity information where are the
street walk streets sidewalks where are
the street crossings where are the off
street paths and are there curb ramps to
connect the holidays and it is really
best to map for detailed accurate facts
was very little subjective
interpretation
and while there are some standards like
wheelchairs standard we with these
standards are not necessarily
international and what we find is that
the built environment standards do not
really exist for example as more and
more cities even Seattle are equipping
their streets with bicycle lanes two-way
bicycle lanes pedestrian eyelets all of
these make the process of mapping for
accessibility really difficult and
ambiguous so it is much better to
provide very accurate detailed
information about the physical
attributes of the environment and
measurements that could then be used to
determine the accessibility for a
particular individual and so while I'm
not trying to highlight faults in the
Google Scout program it's using the
subjective patterns of wheelchair
accessible is actually rather not useful
to me when I wheel my dog that are
around in a mobility stralla stroller
which happens to be two inches wider
than the standard wheelchair none of the
information that's collected by Scouts
for wheelchair accessibility which
specifies 36 inches wide matters to me
when I'm looking at whether it's
accessible to my 38 inch wide chair and
so it's going to be more and more
subjective as we go forward and the idea
is to really map for accurate physical
information so static data ought to be
precisely detailed there are also ways
in which transient information can
really impact cost functions for
different individuals and this
information might be temporarily
persistent or it might be pattern across
seasons like we mentioned before or
across daily patterns of crowdedness for
example or noise things of that nature
so many times the accessibility of a
location is conditioned on some kind of
transient property like noise or
crowdedness or when it's raining the
surface type that might be known to be
brick is more likely to be slick when
it's raining
and so being able to provide that kind
of conditional costing is also important
and that's why we tend to we want to
collect transient information um
hopefully as more and more cities are
collecting sensed environment data with
IOT etc were able to provide more and
more of these functions and so we're
advocating for specific metrics or
probability distributions of particular
occurrences of these transient
information so in summary we're
prioritizing pedestrian centric data
where connectivity is of high high high
value and the location of the attributes
are extremely important and then we can
add features that are representing
either potential barriers or assistive
infrastructure with very precise detail
and measurements and another reason to
do this in a very precise manner is
because sometimes what might be a
potential barrier to some subclass of
people may actually be enhancing as an
assistive infrastructure for others an
example of this is when we were mapping
the judkins park area which has an quite
a population of assistive pedestrian
signals we find that some of those are
located smack in the middle of the curb
ramp which might be prohibitive for
wheelchair users and so the exact
location and specific attributes of
where infrastructure might be is really
important for mobility and personalized
mobility so we call our project open
sidewalks and this was a joint venture
with the e Science Institute and the
idea is really to democratize pedestrian
way data so not only are we promoting
the standardization of sidewalk data and
sidewalks as entities we really would
hope for this to be an open data and
have shared resources that use open
source software and what we're promoting
across our developer communities is
developing different software for
agencies to enable vetting and
validation of the data that they're
willing to receive
from the open shared Commons right so
not everybody needs to accept all the
contributions that someone might make
into an open data Commons but there
ought to be ways to automate the vetting
process so that it's not an arduous
vetting of every single data data point
and this allows us to make a number of
innovations and pedestrian technology
and really promote some public/private
partnerships the model that were shown
here is quite complicated what we're
seeing on the bottom is really the
comments so you have the contribution of
different agencies whether they be
government agencies or private agencies
and then there are the processing
algorithms that allow different agencies
to critically vet the information that
they're willing to receive and that
pedestrian geo data can go into the the
the creation of a routing graph where
you have different costing functions
that are applied when an end-user which
is the box at the top the one shown at
the top might be access map but as I'll
talk about there are other derivative
applications that can make similar uses
of the data Commons on the bottom so the
biggest questions were clearly there are
multiple stakeholders but who houses
this type of data and who wants to
commonly make the developer community
access that kind of information and so
our wonderful partnership with the
OpenStreetMap community really allowed
us to in to introspectively look at the
data standard that we were promoting and
look to see whether we're going to
actually break some of the other
algorithms that are commonly used on top
of Open Street Map data which has been
very Auto centric till till now so the
Open Street Map community is kind of the
Wikipedia of maps I'm not gonna wade
through in the entire video here but
what we're looking at is the
contributions to open
which started in 2006 and the nice
attributes of OpenStreetMap to this is
that they have an extensible data model
and detailed statistic information
that's allowing us to look at how much
of the contribution and how much of the
auto centric data actually contains
sidewalk information most importantly it
is easily modifiable by both communities
as well as entire municipalities so
right now we're working with the city of
San Jose to import their entire sidewalk
data set for example trying to there we
go so the full contribution by 2016 is
pretty much the entire developed world
and people are working very hard on
incorporating less developer resources
countries as well so what it meant for
us is that we needed to find a way to
access these crowdsourcing communities
and be able to incorporate our data
model into their practices so we've
taken a lot of the infrastructure that's
already there and leveraged it in order
to promote pedestrian centric
information this meant looking at
mapathon infrastructure so we're using
the tasking manager that basically
parcels out entire communities and to
bite-sized chunks that people can
undertake in the span of one afternoon
looking at special so we've created
specialized sidewalk editors that really
promote the tags that we have gotten
accepted through the community we've
also made use of field papers which are
the very lowest tech kind of
contributions but allow people who are
in aging communities and are less
inclined to use the high-tech resources
to also help us in mapping were then
able to scan their contributions and
digitize that into the map and then
finally we've offered some gamified
quests and challenges which have had the
largest updates in communities like safe
routes to schools where kids really like
to challenge each other with
math quests and math but those are all
active data collection which means that
we all have to get together decide that
we'll spend the whole afternoon mapping
and that's still while there are
communities out there that's still
somewhat of a big ask and so what we're
seeing here is some of the mapathon that
we've run than some of the sidewalk
promoting editors that we've created but
there ought to also be some passive or
semi passive ways to collect this kind
of data after all people are walking on
sidewalks we ought to just be able to
sense that and so we've provided some
mobile applications that enable us to do
that when people consent to us gathering
that kind of information so we're
looking at GPS traces of where people
are walking we're able to infer the
sidewalk locations by being able to
infer what modality of transportation
they're using and we're using the
accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope
data to also infer where the crappy
sidewalks are where are they bumpy and
how long for what stretches of road is
it bumpy and we can deem these like
lower quality sidewalks likewise we can
record the inclines and confer that the
data that we have about elevation
changes are true and then there are also
some semi passive ways of collecting
that kind of data which means somebody
for example using imagery
so in this census I'm showing my pillory
which is a company based in Australia
that have that have partnered with us
they're essentially the crowd-sourced
Street View have you so individuals are
collecting this kind of sidewalk
information and they might be taking
imagery in a number of different devices
and so this is kind of my first
potential ask if I was to make one the
reason we do not promote the use of
Google Street View imagery in order to
validate some of the mapping information
is because of the licensing of
derivative products from Google Street
View and so the
the OpenStreetMap community has really
deprecated the use of Google Streetview
because of the licensing issue and some
of the potential legislative issues that
have to do with validating and vetting
information about the environment and it
would be really wonderful if we could
not do that because as you well know
Google has deployed a really
standardized way of devices of
collecting this kind of data so when we
use computer vision on the mapillary
imagery because of the lack of
standardization across the different
mobile devices that are used to collect
this data
we're not typically able to actually
attribute correct GPS locations to the
items that we identify in the imagery so
even if I know the GPS location of the
person taking the image which is also
fraught with a lot of error because
mobile devices don't typically have very
accurate GPS locations then the ability
to identify that there's saina over
there won't necessarily allow me to
detect where specifically it is and so
mapping it on the on OpenStreetMap is
fraught with a lot of potential error
and we'd like to avoid that whereas the
kinds of devices and standardization
that's been applied with the Google
Street View imagery is much more
conducive to accurate GPS localization
of the attributes that we find so as far
as other potential downstream uses for
pedestrian centric data as well as the
non motorized trend travel models that
we've deployed we look again at the
personal routing application so again
the costing function is really
conditioned upon the individual looking
at the environment and the environment
itself and having sufficient data that's
collected about the attributes of that
built environment and so the data isn't
necessarily there but should be and we
can actually put it there now because we
have a huge plethora of sense
yeah and everyone will benefit and then
you can necessarily determine the
accessibility of the environment without
mapping that kind of detailed accurate
information but what we've seen is that
a lot of the tools already exist and
that we can collect this data fairly
easily using a variety of means using
both contributions from crowds as well
as contributions from public and private
entities and so leveraging the crowd
means that we're able to then modify and
maintain the data on a much more ready
basis because typically the times that
municipalities are collecting sidewalk
data is in the reactive legislative
manner Seattle just redid its entire
sidewalk inventory because of the result
of a lawsuit that has an ad a complaint
really associated with it but typically
speaking there aren't the resources out
there to maintain the data on an ongoing
basis and so the crowd contributions
with appropriate community-developed
vetting algorithms can really allow us
to maintain this data set on an ongoing
basis and also contribute to civic
engagement and community engagement with
your place so the data Commons
contribution and consumption allows us
to really construct this infrastructure
that promotes open data repositories and
as we think they are ready for use in
production and can be used to coordinate
between and among stakeholders that
haven't really exchanged information in
the past and one of the reasons they
have not exchanged information in the
past is because different stakeholders
have different access to private
information and some of the attributes
that they have might be in aggregate
really contributing to this kind of data
repository but then they're unable to
respect the responsibility of the
privacy of the data that they gather and
what we're promoting is that community
developed resources can really
adjudicate and perform the aggregation
that's necessary in order to
remove some of the privacy issues while
still allowing the synchronization and
contribution of the data to this larger
collective and the synchronization and
propagation of changes can really be
used as they happen on the ground so
maintenance has been a really big push
for this so one of the applications that
I spoke about lose access map and that's
really about improved automated routing
like I said we've only used elevation
changes and construction information on
card cuts because those were the data
sets that were available to us with the
highest density for the City of Seattle
however what we're doing right now is
really collecting a lot more of the data
attributes so that we can incorporate a
lot more of the personalized mobility
challenges vision impairments other
impairments other preferences like I
said about pollution toxicity noise
levels things of that sort that allow us
to really challenge the environment in
various ways by looking at specific
mobility profiles of individuals and
understanding how that might impact
their access through the environment and
the challenges that still remain is the
requirement of specific users profiles
along with the complete dependency on
the underlying connected sidewalk graph
other tools that we've provided in our
collaboration with Washington State do T
their request was to define specif
specific criteria for access and display
bottlenecks due to specific features of
the built environment so what we're
seeing here unfortunately the map layer
is not really well shown starting at
Seattle Center as a starting point and
holding constant to a manual chair
mobility profile what are all the street
corners that are accessible via a curb
ramp so what we see is the swath of the
area with some accessibility islands
and then there are boundaries in every
direction so as an urban planner you
might choose to connect Seattle Center
with Queen em and so you might be
interested in providing curb ramps in a
particular direction or another we can
also and we have cross this information
with Orca information in terms of where
Orca cards trance transfers take the
most place and so we're able to see
where people to make their commute
transfers and transit agencies might be
willing and able to look at the walk
sheds around their transit agents and
their transit stops in order to promote
more accessibility features along the
most commonly used transfers and
transfer routes and lastly this has been
one of our most successful end uses of
this kind of data which was used for
pedestrian advocacy with the Seattle
Commission for people with disabilities
who came to us and will be partnering
with them along the way but they really
wanted to be able to see the change in
the environment for a manual chair user
when public accessible building
elevators are available in downtown
Seattle which directly translates to the
ability to enter on 3rd Avenue traverse
through an indoor building environment
take the elevator up to 4th Avenue level
and emerge out there so that means that
you didn't have to go across a really
high elevation change of I believe
something like 9.8 percent greater which
is difficult for me on certain days you
know and so what we're looking at here
are these accessibility isochrones
where the same color indicates that
there's approximately the same level of
difficulty of traversal so again this is
a composite multi variable cost function
that takes into account the elevation
change the travel distance the potential
travel time along with some of the curb
cut information and what we're seeing is
that once buildings open that
eight or nine a.m. in the morning
suddenly the terrine completely changes
for a potential manual wheelchair user
and so using this kind of infographic
the commission for people with
disabilities went to the city of
Seattle's eot and said we really need to
work on advocating for building owners
to open up their buildings in the off
hours and weekends so that we can offer
this kind of access of accessibility in
downtown Seattle to everybody across
different times of the day another
application that we're looking at and
have worked on recently have to do was
opening up digital cartography for
people with vision impairment we have
not yet try on the visual modality that
allows us to offer this on on a digital
interface but as far as being able to
personally independently manufacture
your own tactile maps based on the
context of your travel as well as the
most up-to-date information about the
pedestrian space one would be able to go
to the tactile map tile website and
request the maps surrounding a very
particular location and what you get is
a 3d model that you're then able to take
to a local library or send to a 3d
printing manufacturing agencies that
would be able to send it to you for a
couple of dollars as opposed to the
thousands of dollars that these maps
typically take and one of the nice
things attributes of this project is
that people really do get to personalize
the tactile metaphors that are used to
represent whatever it is that they're
interested in so if I'm traveling to a
new city I might request information
about cafes and restaurants whereas if
I'm traveling by bus I might want to
know the information about transit stops
and where they might they are located
and so a summary and a call to action
we've defined the data standards we are
really promoting sidewalks as entities
in a dedicated connected pedestrian
transportation layer and we'd love to
see this in an
and shared pedestrian path data which
enables other downstream applications
that might be very very specific to
specific subpopulations that could
benefit from this kind of information ah
the open licensing of imagery derivative
data would be fantastic and again we are
really interested in the accurate
detailed information about the physical
environment as well as the transient
data as opposed to somewhat more
nebulous or subjective terms like
accessible especially as we see more and
more individuals using DIY accessibility
devices of all kinds because prototyping
and manufacturing becomes so much easier
in nowadays I believe this to be a very
very important aspect of mapping for
accessibility the attribution of
wheelchair-accessible
does not really apply anymore and that's
what the open sidewalks project is
promoting and then finally the
participation in the data comments
confers both contributions and benefits
to all of the entities that are inclined
to contribute that kind of data so in
closing I'd like to thank you and if you
have any questions or would like to have
more information please do contact you
TT cat at Uwe D you or the Tasker Center
thank you anyone here has questions so I
got a few minutes you mentioned that you
had some other you is sort of tested or
you were playing with different UIs for
having users tell you what their needs
are and I was curious if you could talk
a little bit more about that yeah so we
really try to assess people's abilities
on the basis of infrastructure that
they're familiar with so again asking
somebody what's your personal best is
really a difficult question and nobody
can really answer that plus it's a very
temporary thing
today I'm feeling really great and
tomorrow not so much
however people are actually motor
conditions to know Oh today I can take
the Yesler Hill but yesterday I was
unable to and so we use communities that
people are familiar with and Traverse on
a regular basis to ask them specific
questions about their ability and both
personal maximal best and and and what's
neutral to them I was curious you talked
about a lot of different ways you can
get data what which one has or which
ones have been the most successful and
provided the most useful data for you is
so like mapathon versus online tools and
people can contribute or the kind of
automated system that's using GPS tracks
etc yeah so imports have been the most
especially imports from decent data
sources so certain municipalities have
have actually really decent data some of
them may or may not use center line data
which is how we represent sidewalks and
some of these ways are more easy for us
to conform to and our data standard than
others but doing entire City imports is
really subject to the community that's
willing to vet it but it's a fairly
quick process once it's once once it's
imported as opposed to being able to
then collect specifically let's say
signaling information on the ground
which requires people to actually walk
out and do this and so that's been the
slowest process how does the vetting
work serving the the cities or
municipalities do the vetting themselves
or it depends so in the city like San
Jose we have really really motivated
partners and so they're doing the
vetting pretty much on their own in the
city of Philadelphia we have communities
that are really interested in so then we
use the tasking manager in the sense of
like we import the data and we parcel it
out so everybody's got just like a one
or two block chunk that they're supposed
to
and so you're able to kind of get if I
some of this collection or make it a
community competition or something like
that
culture thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
