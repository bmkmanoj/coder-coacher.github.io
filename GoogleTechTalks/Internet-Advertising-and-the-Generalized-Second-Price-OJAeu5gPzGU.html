Google I just wanted to introduce my
friend Michael Schwartz and very excited
about introducing him he's a really sort
of multifaceted academic an economist
has done work in areas like decision
making under Ellison did uncertainty
economic reforms for Russia and what's
pretty close to our hearts
oxygen theory and the application of
auction theory to online auctions
Michael has been a professor at Harvard
in the Economics Department is currently
a fellow at the National Bureau of
Economic Research is also at currently
at a scholar at UC Berkeley and Michael
I he probably his biggest claim to fame
is that he got his PhD from what I
believe is the best doctoral program in
the world the Stanford Business School
doctoral program where he and I were
office mates and roommates as well and I
think apart his other became the fame
was that he hung out with the academics
like Nobel laureate Kenneth arrow and
folks like that while working on his PhD
I think without any further ado let me
introduce Michael and welcome him to
something that's very close to all our
interest so first of all a disclaimer
about the first slide the title of the
paper is really not selling billions of
dollars worth of keywords I simply cut
out the first part of the title that was
irrelevant generalized second price
auction selling billions of dollars of
keywords so that's actually a typo but
maybe a freudian see so I just kept the
important part this is joint work with
two of my students Bernard Oman and Mike
Ostrovsky Mike Ostrovsky just graduated
last year now here's a professor
Stanford Business School and then I
don't man is still at Harvard and let me
give you a road map of the talk so we
will start out with an story of the
evolution of the market for Internet
advertisement thank you so so we'll
start out with the story of evolution of
the market for Internet advertisement
and here I expect to be corrected many
times because I'm sure you know the
history of the
market much better than I do but we
tried our best then we will talk about
the model of generalized second price
auction the rules of the auction and
again probably most of you are very
familiar with the way that were ties
mint is salt so that would be quick and
then we'll talk about the equilibria in
this auction what should we expect how
would advertisers behave in that auction
so you'll I will describe couple of
solution concepts for this auction one
locally and we frequently Bria and that
is generalized English auction which is
essentially a more adults or isomorphic
to generate second price auctions two
different ways of thinking about so
equilibrium behavior of advertisers and
this options so we all see that this
kind of auction that Google uses to sell
advertisement has remarkable properties
such as it has for generalized English
auction version of that Meccans has
unique equilibrium it has ex post
equilibrium however it doesn't have
equilibria and dominant strategies and
has the same way of Vickrey auction and
again I'll talk later about what it all
means so I understand that most people
here have very little or no background
in economics and a lot of background in
other things so I will try to make a
talk accessible for everybody reserved
for people with various backgrounds so
let me start out with a few facts about
January second price auction so it's an
auction mechanism used by so different
variations of those mechanism I use by
Yahoo and google to sell billions of
dollars worth of advertisement that's of
course you all know there are also
companies around the globe that are much
much smaller that also use similar
mechanisms and here's a curious
comparison Google and Yahoo market cap
is over 125 billion dollars all US
airlines combined is under 20 billion
dollars and if you think that comparison
is striking well it's not a strike it's
actually more striking that it seems
because I wrote this slide almost six
months ago and by now the market cap of
Google and Yahoo combined is much much
more than hundred
25 billion and the market cap of all US
airlines combined is now significantly
less than 20 billion I think it dipped
under 15 our US airlines well most of
them have significant negative profits
but there are exceptions
Southwest being one and pretty much the
only one well I mean it may sound funny
but the airline industry is one of the
few industries where basically for about
80 years stretch there are pretty
consistent records of losses so let me
describe the roots of this so first off
let me ask you a question
how many of you know quite well the
rules of the auction that Google uses
for selling advertisement ok so there's
some people who know the rules some
people who don't so let me describe the
rules so basically it's our pay per
click pricing so you pay per click if
your ad is shown and nobody clicked on
it you don't pay high ad receive more
clicks and that's the reality one bid
everybody submit one bid and the ads I
arranged on the page in order of bids
and the payment of each advertiser per
click is not equal to his bid but equal
to the bit of an advertiser right below
him so that's a somewhat simplified
model of other auction that Google uses
Google adjust bids based on relevance
and based on click-through rates so you
can think of this model that I described
here as a model where we assume that
everybody has exactly the same relevance
and exactly the same click-through rate
given that the ads are in the same
position you can easily drop those
assumptions things would get slightly
trickier technically but really doesn't
make any fundamental difference so
that's why I would simply assume that
all advertisers if they're we're in the
first position would get the same number
of clicks so note that so the auction is
a real-time auction and
advertisers can adjust their bids more
or less and it at anytime and if you
have only one slot one advertisement
slot then this auction is equivalent to
standard second price auction so you
have one advertisement slot so there
would be only one advertisement whose ad
would be shown and hewed be paying the
bid per click of an advertiser with a
second highest value that's the second
price auction or also called Vickrey
auction if you have multiple advertisers
and multiple slots then it's no longer
equivalent to a second price option
that's why I called January second price
auction it was also no not equivalent to
Vickrey auction as we will see later and
by the way as a piece of sort of trivia
if you'd read the Google description of
the auction for advertisers it sort of
sounds like Google is using Vickrey
auction which in fact is not correct so
perhaps you should fix your the web page
description that you give for the
advertisers not that they really know
what week reaction is but nevertheless
so here are a few unique features of the
market for internet advertisement first
of all bidding take place continue in
continuous time and that's really an
unusual feature because for example of
course there are markets like eBay where
you can change your bid at any time well
it's not really bidding in continuous
time the object is going to be sold at
say certain bait at certain hour the
object will be solved and that would be
it so it's not like the object is sold
in continuous time you'd be this
continuous time but sales are not in
continuous time so here you're really
selling a flow of goods so it's really
happening in continuous time and whoever
was the highest bidder at this very
second his head would be on top of the
page so that's an unusual feature that's
not a unique feature for instance market
for electricity has a similar feature
you're delivering a flow of goods and
you could imagine the mechanism for
selling electricity where you sell
electricity in continuous time but
that's not how most
how electricity markets work most of the
electricity is sold with long-term
contracts so even though you could
imagine the market for electricity where
you're bidding for it in continuous time
and you know if you didn't beat high
enough you don't get your electricity
but most of the electricity is sold
through long-term contracts there are
some sports market that are sort of like
continuous-time markets so that a very
important and striking feature of the
market for internet advertisement is
that approximately marginal utility or
the profit of advertiser per click stays
roughly constant so for example if you
have a web store and if your store gets
you know approximately $2 worth of say o
of profit for every click that they get
if they get 50 clicks the profit on that
would be hundred dollars minus the cost
of those clicks if they get 500 clicks
the profit would be ten times more
because there's nearly not that much of
capacity capacity constraints for many
web stores so that's in sharp contrast
with other markets so for instance in
the market for electricity yes it's not
a good that you buy in continuous time
but certainly if someone were to tell
you hey you can buy twice as much for
your electricity and we will ship you
twice as much electricity as we use
though you would not be thrilled about
that you wouldn't know what to do with
twice as much is a tricity as you're
currently buying right Google wouldn't
be interested in buying twice as much
electricity for double the price as
they're buying now right you're just
using as much as you need with
advertisement most advertisement
advertisers would be delighted to buy
twice as much advertisement and buy
twice as much because no profit per
click stays roughly constant so that
what makes this market really really
unusual the other thing that I really I
can find fascinating about this market
is that there is no obvious definition
of a unit of advertisement and in fact
although talking about units of
advertisement is not a subject of this
paper it's the subject of another paper
it is an important and interesting
question how do you define a unit of
advertisement I think a lot of things
that would happen in this market in the
future
we will change the way we think about
the unit of advertisement but for the
purposes of this paper I will just
assume that a click of the unit of
advertisement but here I want to sort of
emphasize how differently we can think
about what a unit is so from advertisers
perspective transaction survey relative
unit is pay per transaction right
because an advertiser doesn't care about
how many times his ad was shown what's
important is how many trinkets you sold
so an advertiser would say well from my
perspective I'm really the end product
this transaction
so let's price advertisement based on
transactions and there are certainly
quite a few models of pricing of online
advertisement where that is exactly
what's going on advertisers pay for
transaction that happened to be not the
dominant model of advertisement but
certainly used Amazon for instance buys
a lot of advertisement based exactly on
that model and it's not uncommon from
search and virgin prospective the
exposure is a relevant unit of
advertisement and relevant pricing
models pay per exposure and to some
extent one can argue that in spite of
the fact that Google charges per click
implicitly Google really charges per
exposure because there's an adjustment
for per click this is an adjustment for
click-through rate so if your ad is
being clicked three times more often
than the end of your competitor that
means that you pay per click three times
less other things being equal so on some
level implicitly on Google you pay per
exposure although it looks like to
advertisers that they pay per click with
Yahoo you truly pay per click because
that's those are the rules of their game
they do not adjust the price based on
click-through rate so the middle ground
the sort of pricing model where you
pay-per-click and obviously all three
pricing models are widely used and
pay-per-click seem to be a dominant
although you can argue that Google's
model is sort of closer to paper
impression than to pay-per-click so this
slide we can skip because everybody in
this room knows what click-through rate
is and here I'd like to talk a little
bit about the history of this market
which I find very interesting so it's
sort of like evolution versus
intelligent design so economists say
that I believe in evolution but they
really like intelligent design much
better so if you look at the markets
that economists like they really like
markets that were designed by smart
people preferably economists and where
there's solid scientific foundation for
how to put the market together and if
you look at spectrum options now that's
that's how those markets were designed
the were people who are pretty much
experts in the area who sit down and try
to figure out how to run that auction in
an intelligent way their electricity
auctions again though this is the market
that was very much designed by experts
with a lot of debate with a lot of
thought put into it I'm not saying
necessarily those markets were designed
in the best possible way but they
certainly were designed intelligently so
to speak the other markets and the
second most markets that evolved that
didn't intelligently emerged but really
what with people randomly experimenting
or converging to a certain framework so
for example New York Stock Exchange is a
market that very much evolved it started
out with a bunch of people trading stock
in the street and slowly they sort of
experimented with different rules the
institutions emerged and it's not like
there was one person or a group of
people who thought systematically how to
best design it so for example if you
look at medical residency match and
that's a market where if any of you have
a partner or a wife or a sister who is
in medical school you probably know
about medical residents market in most
labor markets you
graduate from school and you look for a
job not so for medical doctors you
graduate from medical school you apply
for residency programs you submit a
ranking to the computer you say this
medical school this residency program is
my first choice second choice third
choice and so on and so forth
residency programs do the same thing
those preferences are entered in the
computer system and the computer spits
out the match and you get a letter in
the mail saying congratulations you've
got your fourth choice that's where you
will be a resident and that's pretty
much final so that's how the market for
medical residency match works today and
that market actually warmed over 50
years and at first the algorithm that
they used for matching had many flaws
and little by little they were changing
it at tweaking it and eventually
converged mechanism that we know that we
later learn is sort of scientifically
sound more or less uniquely reasonable
matching algorithm right so here
evolution discovered things that could
have been intelligently designed but
really weren't so internet advertisement
I think is the market that evolved and
probably most of you know the story of
the evolution of this market but perhaps
some of you don't and perhaps some of
you can correct my mistakes in the way I
describe that story so I think in 1994
history pretty much began and began with
pay impression pricing at that time
there was no option ads were sold on the
phone and even small contracts were
lodged thousands of dollars lots of
hugging on the phone keyword targeting
wasn't available and entry was slow and
was unused capacity so then the
generalized price auction sort of
stormed on the scene and that was
introduced by go-to later Yahoo in 1997
and there it was Pepe pay-per-click for
a particular keyword so in fact probably
all of you know that go-to originally
wasn't combined with a search engine the
idea was that just advertisers would pay
for placement and go to page
presumably those who are willing to pay
the most per click are the most valuable
for users it was sort of an attempt to
create advertising search engine that
was only later combined with a real
search engine what when go-to was
acquired by Yahoo so and that was really
revolutionary changed change
first of all allowed for much better
targeting and much smaller contracts
than you can do with juggling on the
phone second it was sort of allowed for
experimentation by advertisers because
you can bid very very small amount
experiment with one keyword moved to
another one and so on and so forth and
so forth and of course overture was
fantastically successful acquired by
Yahoo later became a platform for MSM
however as successful as generalized
first price auction was by the way let
me describe what January first price
option was on how it differs from second
price auction in the generalized second
price auction you don't pay your bid per
click you pay the second the bid below
you so if you are number five you pay
the bid of the person number six and you
get the fifth spot in the generic first
price auction if your bid is bid number
five you get a fifth slot on the page
but you pay a bit so that mechanism was
fundamentally flawed and it's very easy
to show that that mechanism has no pure
strategy equilibrium so let me
illustrate or what what are the kind of
problems that you can run into the
mechanism like that
so if you have to so this is the chart
of to top build of top beat over time
for a specific keyword for July 18 2002
and here we have data for every 15
minutes and there are two advertisers
that are alternating between having the
highest bid and this is what's happening
with the bid goes up and then suddenly
it drops and then it keeps going up so
you wonder what happens over time if you
take a long period of time well that's
what happens the top bid goes up down up
down slowly climbing up suddenly
dropping down and then once no well this
is Eagle so what's going on here
well first of all this is just an
example but there are a lot of keywords
so we got a little bit of data that was
kindly provided to us by Yahoo for the
year 2002 when they used January second
price auction Aegina a generous first
price auction and those are the kind of
bidding patterns you find there all the
time so it's really happening there is
the following you are paying your own
bid so suppose that you are the highest
bidder and you bid 50 cents the other
guy beats thirty cents you think oh my
god I'm so silly for being 50 side
bidding 50 cents I bet a bit 31 cent and
I could still be the number one bidder
so you reduce your bid to thirty one
cent so now the guy who was the second
highest bidder with a bit of 30 cents he
said why should I occupy the second spot
for 30 cents if 432 cent I could be
number one so he increases his bid to 32
cents and that's what you see here I
think wow why should I be the second
highest bidder for 31 cent if for 33
cents
I could be number one so every 15
minutes one of those guys increases the
bid by Pena or by the minimum increment
until one of them reaches the threshold
that he's not no longer willing to pay
that price he said why wouldn't I be it
very very little and just be number two
but by a very small amount and then the
other guy immediately realizes and the
price drops like a rock
and of course those are not human beings
thinking that they wrote simple robots
and those are the robots that they used
so clearly this was not a good outcome
it was not a good outcome for three
reasons
first of all if my value for being the
top advertiser higher than yours it's
much better if I'm always the first guy
as opposed to one we try to game each
other's systems
second it's not a good thing when people
start investing a lot on those robots
that try to game the system
so by the way how much time do I have 30
minutes okay so you can see that first
price generics first price auction had
this problem very unstable bids and that
one generalized second price auction was
invented I believe it was invented in
2002 by Google and I think it was
invented pretty much by accident I heard
different stories about how it happened
but it certainly wasn't a very complex
thoughtful process but was a success
bids once you start paying the bit of a
person below you this much less reason
to have you be jumping around so once it
was introduced bids became more stable
and it was an improvement and Yahoo very
quickly followed the suit after Google
introduced generalized second price
auction so let me here describe sort of
the comparison between generalized
second price auction in the VCG so from
Google's web page here's a quote google
unique auction model uses Nobel
prize-winning economic theory to
eliminate that feeling that you have
paid to match so it's Google web page
and I then suggest to search for the
word Vickery who is of course the person
who got the Nobel Prize for sort of
developing Vickrey auction so
interestingly and in fact it's true that
in a Vickrey auction it's the best
strategy for an advertiser to bid
history value not saw in the auction in
January second price auction so what may
give you a simple example that
illustrates that bidding your true value
so you have a certain value per click
the profit that you generate per click
so in January second price auction if
you bid your true value per click you
always pay less than that right you pay
the bid of a person below you so you get
some profit so is it always in
equilibrium is it always the best
strategy for an advertiser on Google to
build history value dances of course not
let me give you a simple example that
illustrate this point suppose there are
only three advertising slots and suppose
that the click-through rate for the
Friday at the first slot is 100 clicks
per day and the second slot suppose that
the click-through rate is 99 clicks per
day so of course in reality it's not
really true the second slot would
probably get you more like 80 clicks per
day if the first one gets a handle but
just for the sake of for the sake of
example imagine that those are very
similar so now suppose that there are
only three advertisers and one of them
has a while you of $100 per click the
other one has a value of $99 per click
and the third one has a value of five
cents a click so if everybody beats
truthfully the guy with the highest
value gets the first slot he gets
hundred clicks and he pays 99 dollars
for each click so he only makes one
dollar profit on each click the guy in
the second position
he only pays five cents per click and
you get 99 clicks so he makes over 98
dollars of profit on each click so the
guy in the first position could reduce
his build by a couple of dollars and get
the second position where he would lose
one click instead of 100 clicks he would
get 99 clicks when instead of paying $99
per click you'd buy five cents per click
so clearly this is not an equilibrium
for everybody to be bidding the true
values because if everybody we're the
person with the highest value would be
much much better of not beating history
while you write so it's a simple example
that illustrates that truth-telling is
just not going to be in equilibrium here
are not necessarily going to be in
equilibrium well the truth-telling is
not an equilibrium then what is and how
we can compute the equilibrium in this
auction so here I just formally
describes the rules of January second
price auction used by Google and sort of
economists like McCann action mechanism
called VCG named after Vickery Clarkson
growth and that auction could have been
used
by Google and Yahoo it's not but it
could have been so here's how that
auction works and I will not describe
the rules of the auction but in a
nutshell I will describe the idea there
so it is similar to its adopt adapted
for environment similar to the one used
by Google and Yahoo you have any you
have a number of objects that you want
to sell so in the case of Google you can
sell multiple links on the page and with
VCG mechanism you the each advertiser
specifies as his value for each of those
objects and then according to some
pretty complicated formula we can
compute how much each of them should pay
and what object each of them would get
so the remarkable property of this
formula of VCG auction and I wouldn't
tell you what that formula is but it has
a remarkable property that it is in the
best interest of every market
participant to truthfully state his
value for the object for each of the
objects and that's a remarkable property
right because most of the time when
someone asks you how much you are
willing to pay for this you don't want
to tell the truth right you're hoping to
get it for cheaper so there the formula
is adjusted just right so that if you
exaggerate your value you get penalized
because sometimes you get the object but
you pay too much and you regret it so
you don't want to exaggerate your value
and you if you understate your value you
also suffer because sometimes you don't
get the object when you really would
like to add the price that was available
for you so the best thing you can do and
the visages actually be truthful and we
already have seen that in the auction in
January second price auction being
truthful is not necessarily the best
strategy so so we can compute what would
be the revenues of Google under VCG
mechanism given the values of all
advertisers right given that we know the
probability distribution from those
which those values are drawn and
probably all
of you are thinking well what would be
the revenues revenue comparison from
using VCG versus from using the january
second price auction in google use which
one is going to be more profitable for
this company and this paper gives an
answer and the answer is it's the same
so let me describe two ways of thinking
about the equilibrium and January second
price auction so one way to think about
it is to think of January second price
auction is a static game where and by
static game imagine that we just played
this game once that we don't change our
bids every second but we serve play this
game once and we think about what what
what would be the reasonable strategies
for people to use and there may remain
equilibrium in this game it's easy to
see that there are multiple equilibria
especially if we know each other's
values so first I was it reasonable to
assume that each advertiser knows the
values of other advertisers anything it
is reasonable because in reality this is
a dynamic game where you play it every
day every second every minute and you
can observe bids of other advertisers on
Yahoo on Google you couldn't observe
bids of other advertisers but you can
experiment with your bid and you can see
what position on the screen you get by
changing a bit and that should tell you
what the bids of other advertisers are
there's some noise but you sort of get
the idea so as a result since you
essentially implicitly know you can
infer the values of other advertisers it
sort of makes sense that whatever you
are doing is the best response to what
everybody else is doing why well because
even though we are modeling a tas
aesthetic game we also know that really
it is a dynamic game where people could
experiment over time and change their
bids so their bid should be best
response to bid of other people and
that's because they had a lot of time to
experiment them to make sure that they
be the best response of other people so
in some sense what we are trying to do
here we are trying to figure out
would be the vector of bids which we
would eventually converge when
advertisers are done learning about each
other's values that's one restriction
they want to impose right all bids the
best response to other people bids in
other words no advertiser could change
his bid and as a result increase his
profit it certainly does assume that
they exist in equilibrium your product
and later on I will show that it does
exist so here you can say assuming that
there is an equilibrium where prices
stabilize and we saw that for example in
January's first price auction that does
not exist in equilibrium a prices
stabilize neither in theory no in
practice so here assuming that there is
an equilibrium exists where prices to
stabilize we want to figure out what are
the properties of this equilibria and
later on I will show that it does exist
so so everybody plays best response now
the requirement that I want to impose is
locally and be free equilibria and
that's what I mean by that no advertiser
envies the advertiser who is in the
position right above us so what do I
mean by that it means that if I am an
advertiser is a certain bid and I am
offered somehow to change places and
bids with an advertisers who has a bid
right above me then I will choose not to
do that I don't envy you so of course in
reality it's not necessarily an option
for me to go to the guy and say how
about you did what I was bidding I bid
what you are bidding that would be fair
right all right I don't have this option
so why do I think walk away and be free
o clock oh and the freeness is a
reasonable restriction so here's why
suppose that I end with a guy right
above me so I really would like to
change places with you so if I end with
him why not increase my bid by one peg
if I increase my bid by the one pana and
the other guy the guy above me didn't
react to that
then my path is exactly the same because
the payment that I make and the January
2nd price option doesn't change so if I
increase by my bid my bit by one
the guy above me doesn't respond
obviously nobody else even noticed
because they they're not affected by the
change then it's a wash for me it
doesn't matter now suppose that the guy
above me reacts to that how could he
react he dips below me right he reduces
his bit so here if he's right below so
then my payoff is a safe
I changed places with you because now I
am paying exactly the same or one penny
more than he what he will used to be
paying and I was envying you so then
it's almost like a dominant strategy I'm
using this term loosely it's not really
a dominant strategy but in spirit that
so dominant strategy for me to increase
my bid one penny by one penny by one
penny slowly over time up to a point
where the guy bought me where I no
longer envy the guy above me and since
it's almost a dominant strategy for me
you would expect that that's what would
a cure when the price vector stabilizes
so two restrictions so so here the guy
below you if I increase my bid a little
bit the guy below me his payment doesn't
change and his opportunities for
changing his position worsen because now
if he wants to get my position yet you
have to pay one way one way one penny
more than he used to pay in the past so
it's hard to imagine that a result as a
result of me increasing my bit by one
penny the guy below me would want to
increase his bid there is no reason
ester is out of the top none of the top
person ha
would never end versatility because you
can always decrease it I am worried
about the person who is a number 3 on
the page ending the person number 2 on
the page so the opposite sort see let me
show that the restriction that all
leaders my best response which other
strategy guarantees their nobody that
nobody end with the person below him so
suppose that you bid 50 cents and the
person below you is at 30 cents and you
end with that person so you enter the
person who is at 30 cents what does that
person pay for click well he pies per
click whatever is a bit below him say 10
cents so you and a person below you who
is currently bidding 20 cents and that's
what you're paying and she is paying per
click 10 cents because he's in the third
way in the second position so you can
always reduce your bit so you're a
little bit below that person and now you
are paying 10 cents per click right so
if you are envying that person you will
take actions you'd be right below him
immediately and that would increase your
payoff so you would not be envying him
because there's not always an action
available to you so that you essentially
switch places
that's correct but you still but you
still might end a person above you and
we serve argued a minute ago why that
shouldn't be the case so so let me show
that there is a special local EMV free
equilibrium where payments coincide with
payments on the VCG
and the Vickrey auction and this
equilibrium is the worst equilibrium for
the sour and this is the best
equilibrium for advertisers and revenues
on locally and we frequently broome of
GSP are at least as high as on the VCG
so you see that we serve the argue that
given the auction making that google
uses there is a set of equilibria that
satisfy locally and the freeness and the
worst of those equilibria for google is
the one that gives the same revenues as
BCG so that's that's pretty good and all
other ones are better so then the
question is okay which which of those
equilibria is plausible so unfortunately
for you the the plausible one is the one
that gives those exactly the same
revenues as the corruption and here's
why and by the way this is
characterization of strategies so here V
here B corresponds to beads of
advertisers and V P V is the payment of
Peter J under BCG and it turns out that
there is a very simple characterization
of bidding strategies where you get pure
strategy equilibria and sort of your
question of existence of equilibria
pretty much answers answered by this
formula and can play around with it and
make sure that nobody would have an
incentive to change the bids given that
this strategy is followed and here's the
so now let me talk of what about 15
minutes left 10:15 okay so now let me
move on to generalize second price
option and generalized English auction
and that's another way of sort of
thinking what they Quilly broom engineer
second price auction is so not that I
sort of described vaguely plausible
restrictions on what the equilibrium
engineer a second price auction should
be but I didn't describe how we can
converge to that equilibrium which is
very important and that I think sort of
if you could describe a rule sort of a
behavioural rule that leads to
convergence to that equilibrium that I
think would make it much more compelling
that in fact that equilibrium obtains of
course would make even more compelling
that that's equilibrium that people play
to look at Google's data but you know
I'm in no position to to do that and I
know that how did a lot of work on that
in fact we sort of independently get
very similar results here so I presume
that who knows the answer regarding if
this theory really works or not and he
wouldn't tell me thank you
so so here's a model another model of
January sack of big the auction January
second price auction that I think makes
it sort of pretty intuitive how people
would behave in this auction so here are
the sort of rules of generalized English
auction imagine if you have a clock and
on that clock you see the price and just
everybody sort of comes into the room so
this is a metaphor for January second
price auction everybody comes into the
room and they watch the price and that
the price on the clock is the price that
they are willing to pay per click or
more precisely the price on the clock
when you press your button everybody has
a button in front of them is the price
that they are willing to pay per click
and in a second I will explain why this
metaphor
I think relevant than why it works so if
you press your button at time zero the
price is zero and you're not
participating a bit is zero you are not
getting it if you press your button at
price once and then you are bidding one
cent per click if you play if you wait
and you press your button at 20 cents
per click then you be this medicine and
also imagine that everybody sees when
someone presses a button
so that's observable so first of all why
is it even a reasonable model so I think
it's reasonable in the following sense
what do you have a new keyword and a
bunch of people start bidding on that
keyword and currently nobody is bidding
on it so what do you pay by bid you pay
the minimum bid you know five cents so
then someone else comes in and bid six
cents so now suddenly you're number two
so I think well is it worthwhile for me
to be number one at five cents number
two at five cents or should I bid seven
cents and be number two some sense maybe
if my value sky enough and someone else
comes in say oh you know I want to be at
this price I want to be second so
everybody sort of incrementally
increases the bid one cent at a time and
we serve going around increasing our
bids one cent at a time until some of us
as well it's not worth it for me to keep
increasing the bid so it's a very
intuitive procedure so and the serf
makes sense to model this procedure with
this clock because us taking turns
increasing our bid one cent at a time
until we feel that clicks got too
expensive so it's not worth increasing
our bids it's sort of mathematically
equivalent to us pressing a button on a
clock when the price reaches the the
price point where we are no longer
willing to increase our bids so here's
what's interesting here engineer a
second price option in generalized
English auction the we can prove the
following theorem there is unique
perfect based on equilibrium so if you
don't know what perfect base and
equilibrium it doesn't matter just say
unique equilibrium the only thing that
could plausibly happen there's a unique
equilibrium in generalized English
auction and in that equilibrium it would
have to be the case that everybody drops
out at a price that is essentially that
is sort of a complicated slightly
complicated function of bidders values
and of click-through rates so alpha K
here is click-through rate si is bidders
while um B is the bid of BK plus 1 is
the bid bid of bidder and position k
plus 1 that's a pretty simple recursive
formula that characterizes the bids of
every player the the prices at which
people would drop out as a function of
values of players click-through rates
and bids of other players who dropped
out before a given player so so this
recursive formula allows us to compute
the revenue and we know this formula
kurz characterizes unique equilibrium of
generalized first price auction jr. of
generalized English auction so it's
remarkable here that in this equilibria
everybody receives the same payoff as
under vc g and vc g is that remarkable
auction that i described before the
auction that won Nobel Prize for V Korea
and when everybody has an incentive to
be truthful so here you got exactly the
same revenues and what's really
remarkable in my opinion is that in this
equilibrium and generalized English
auction bidding your true value dropping
out you at your true value is not an
equilibrium strategy you don't want to
drop out you at your true value drop out
earlier but what's remarkable that in
spite of the fact that there is no
dominant strategy your drop out time
depends on values of other people who
dropped out before you nevertheless this
unique equilibrium and that equilibrium
is exposed so what does mean that an
equilibrium is exposed it means that
even if you would have known in advance
the values of all other bidders you
would act exactly the same way so if for
instance before the auction I were to
ask you they want to tell the public
what your value is and say yeah it's no
she
they don't mind other people knowing it
because that wouldn't really change the
action the actions at the same time so
obviously in a mechanism that's dominant
strategy if lamentable if there is an
equilibrium and dominant strategy what
does it mean it means that I have a
strategy where whatever I do whatever
other people do I know what I should do
regardless of the actions so that
mechanism of course would be exposed
mechanism right because I don't even
care what other people actions are I
still want to you know go right
regardless of what they do
so that's dominant strategy here there
are no dominant strategies but there's
still an exposed equilibrium in the
sense that the outcome that obtains in
the game doesn't depend on my beliefs
about values of other people yes so let
me describe the intuition behind this
theorem and I think I have about five
minutes left and that's exactly the
right amount for describing the
intuition so a proof is quite
complicated and convoluted but the
intuition is I think crystal clear and
also simple enough that I think even
advertisers can figure it out so here's
how the intuition works suppose that
there are only say two slots and three
advertisers and suppose that advertisers
cos Y have values 10 cents 30 cents and
50 cents so now we started our clock so
the price reaches 5 cents does anybody
want to drop out well the guy with the
value of 10 cents think well if I will
drop out I will not get a slot so it's a
dominated strategy for me to drop out
because there's a chance that someone
would drop out between now and 10 cents
in which case maybe I can get a second
slot for 7 cents which better than
nothing so so the last guy keep going
until 10 cents at 10 cents he thinks
well gee nobody dropped out and it's
already 10 cents so if I will go to 11
cents that's really bad because if some
if I go to 11 cents and someone drops
out
eleven cents I will end up paying 11
cents per click for clicks that are
worth 10 cents for me so it's very
obvious what the last guy will do the
last guy will drop out at his true value
and if his value was 10 cents he will
drop out at 10 cents and that's what
this formula says so now they have two
guys left in the running one dropped out
at 10 cents and the other guy has a
value of they say 30 cents and 50 cents
so now there is a 30 cent guy and he
that's a well now I could drop out at 11
cents if I drop out at 11 cents I will
get the second slot and say I get 10
clicks and I'll pay 10 cents per click
which is pretty good on the other hand
if I increase my bid to 12 cents then
there is a chance that nothing would
happen between ten thousand twelve cents
in which case I still have an
opportunity to get the second slot and
still pay 10 cents per click but there's
something else that could happen maybe
the other guy will drop out at 11 cents
in which case I will be number one
person and I will be paying 11 cents per
click so then his decision problem is
well let's take it one cent at a time
what's better being number two and
paying 10 cents a click or going down up
to 12 cents and running a risk of being
number one and paying 11 cents a click
so depending on click-through rates and
the values you can write a formula to
say well regardless of what would happen
if the other guy drops out or if the
delegate doesn't drop out I am at least
as well of going to 12 cents right so he
would increase his bid so then he would
reach a point say 15 cents where he
would be exactly indifferent between
getting the second place for $0.10 cents
or getting the first place for 15 cents
I caught a magic point so why that point
is why is that point a magic point
because at that point that's also an end
with pre free point because at that
point he says if I go to 16 cents and
the other guy drops out then and I'm not
really a big winner because if I go to
16 cents the other guy drops out at 15
I get naps lot number one that's cool
but I'm also paying 15 cents well if I
will drop out now I will get SWAT number
two but I will pay only ten cents so I'm
indifferent between those two things
okay so if you go anywhere higher than
the magic point then in fact winning
become a becomes a curse you're worse
off meaning you don't want the other guy
to drop out so you couldn't win by
increasing your bid so it's sort of like
a dominated strategy here to keep
increasing your bid in fact it is
eliminated dominated straight dominant
strategy so as a result we know exactly
when the second person drops out
that's one basically kisses look the
current price for the second spot versus
getting the first spot that might be it
I'm indifferent so I will drop out here
because there's no sense for no economic
sense for me to increase my bid so this
argument that she tells you that is a
dominant strategy equilibrium where you
get so very clear what the outcome would
be right we know where the second guy
drops out he drops out before his value
but and we know where when it will be if
you haven't served three advertisers ten
advertisers then exactly the same
reasoning holds and strictly speaking
it's no longer technically a dominant
strategy equilibrium but it's exactly
the same logic you keep dropping out
when basically you no longer want to be
in at the going price and that's I think
a very compelling argument that sort of
nails what the equilibrium is and that's
exactly the same equilibrium that we
were getting s and B free equilibria so
I think that's a pretty compelling
prediction so instead of a conclusion
I'd like to say that it's particularly
interesting that this mechanism are the
mechanism that Google uses which is I
think sort of mechanism is beautiful
properties right you get this very nice
equilibria where your bid you bid
depends on bids of other people but at
the same time there's unique equilibrium
and doesn't matter what you think about
the distribution of values of other
people it has all those nice theoretical
properties uniqueness exposed
equilibrium the same revenues as BCG
mechanism and yet it really evolved it
somehow as a process of experimentation
that we're sort of you arrived so it's
an economist I find it fascinating
that's not to say that this mechanism
couldn't be improved of course in the
framework of this paper there are a lot
of issues like advertisers incentives
for truthfulness and ads like stability
that they sport with respect to
fraudulent clicks like giving sort of
value to people who click on ads of
course all of that is outside of the
framework of this paper and I think so
if you could imagine mechanisms that
would address those issues as well and I
think that's also fascinating and I'm
looking forward to seeing other
mechanism coming out from Google so
thank you very much for your attention
and for an opportunity to give a talk to
this wonderful audience
guess the question please
but yes so let me try to repeat the
question we'll see if I understand
correctly so we mentioned between the
paper I talked about this as a mechanism
where quite design every player makes a
payment that's equal to the externality
that he imposes on other advertisers and
here the question is does January second
price auction do the same thing and the
answers yes it turns out that for
instance when you look at the model of
generalized English auction which is
basically equivalent to January second
price auction there the payments are
exactly the same as its BCG and that
with Rashad and that's why it has to be
the case that those external ities were
also internalized in exactly the same
way because you know you paid the same
thing at the end of the day so the
reason why it happens maybe a little bit
less intuitive right because in BCG be
explicitly constructed the mechanism
where your payment was computed so that
you will pay exactly the amount of
externality you imposed on other people
here the mechanism is constructed ants
are very simple ad hoc way just pay the
price per click of the person below you
so why would that mechanism somehow
miraculously internalize all
externalities and the intuition is
simple what it turns out that you
essentially internalize the
externalities when you're exactly
indifferent between switching places
with the person above you below ever at
the at the going price and since we show
that so your equilibrium behavior here
is that you want to drop out and that's
in your interest to drop out right at
the point of indifference for you and
that's why you happen to be this
equivalence between
number
so if you want to think of this in the
language of victory option then you can
think about not sending clicks but
selling say ten minute intervals and you
know by experience that in ten minute
intervals there would be 20 clicks so
you serve could think of the first
position for for one hour as a bag of 20
clicks and the second position for one
hour as a bag of 15 clicks so something
like that and then you can sort of
simulate the use victory framework you
mentioned that Google stumbled upon this
by accident I think it'd be fair to say
that necessity is the mother of
invention and there were two dominant
principles at work when we designed
Edwards one of them was the ranking by
super revenue quality function and the
other one is with the advertiser who
gets the best value and those things
combined led to type of thing
so do all these results require that the
relative values of the slots be
identical for everybody I mean does
everybody evaluation function how to
disturbia constant multiple yes
so there is also huge on the assumption
that everybody has a certain value per
click and then the difference in
positions is coming in close to harvest
of cost in reality that's not entirely
true and in the 30 is there sort of a
nice lock before it before it becomes
unstable again or that's a good question
I kind of money
that's right that's right I thought the
question layer up was what Eva are you
why you up for Netflix as much is not
equal to is that is not twice the value
or if I mix at the level equation and if
that's true then sort of things yes okay
so you know you can have arbitrary
monotonically increasing values and
everybody to be completely subject on
them okay so then you never have a case
where you wanna see you want to stay in
because you really want first slop do
you don't want second slot you don't
I'm taking a piece for certain you know
for me there's a huge value to first
slide but second thought would be a loss
so you know really but that would be
negated that said you could model that
with this the arbitrary VI
value
it's Longet and all the theory works
fine except you know keep us warm
solution iteration all the program
we've had with everywhere
does the general I think this action was
all felony or some non
I'm curious about the Harvard
so if you are thinking about jr. in
English there are no age so if you are
thinking about generalized second price
auction then there are plenty of other
equilibria so let me sort of give you a
simple example much simpler example the
particular case when you have just one
object so then January second price
auction becomes second price auction and
generalized English auction becomes
English auction and the rules of the
English auction are pretty much the same
rate you have a clock or action year who
screams out prices and you sort of drop
out at a certain price and the other guy
wins right so Sods be could be thought
of English auction so there if you look
at second price auction there are
multiple equilibria that tons of a
deliveries for example suppose that my
value is 5 and your value Stan so is it
an equilibrium so it certainly there is
an equilibrium where I will get 5 you
beat an and I got the thing for and you
get the thing for 5 dollars but there
are the equilibria for example if I know
that your value is 10 I could beat 0 and
you'd get thing for 0 which would also
be in equilibrium and there's another
equilibrium where even though my value
is 5 I'd be the million and knowing that
I'd be the million you get 0 because
hopeless right so those are clearly
bruising is very plausible in some sense
because even though you know that my bid
will be million why not be ten dollars
which is your value so that I would pay
at least ten dollars for being it for
the privilege of being a jerk right
so in fact bidding ten dollars is your
dominant strategy in that case since
that's your value so you couldn't lose
by bidding that so there's one plausible
equilibria and many other equilibria
so here when you look at English auction
it essentially has unique equilibrium
the word essentially is important you
need a little bit of sort of refinement
about subject to a little technicality
English auction would have a unique
ability
why because you know I bid five dollars
on my values five-year value Stan
I bid four dollars you say five what am
I to do to beat six I couldn't because
then I would overpay so there basically
you get uniqueness so here it's exactly
the same relationship generalized second
price auction a large set of
equilibrists generalized English auction
a unique one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
