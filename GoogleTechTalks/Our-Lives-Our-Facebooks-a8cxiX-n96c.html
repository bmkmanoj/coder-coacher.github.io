coming we're about to do a tech talk
Harry in here from Fred stutzman about
Facebook and some of the work he's done
studying Facebook I just want to
introduce Fred my name is Glenn Frey
know a lot of you from the orchid team
because i'm the product counselor erika
team and a few other things I know Fred
from I biblio it's a online public
library one of the early online kind of
public libraries out of the University
of North Carolina Chapel Hill where
Fred's the director of Technology and
fred is also a co-founder of claim ID
which is a new company of startup that
helps consumers manage their online
identities identities their their search
identity specifically and we're going to
hear from Fred today about some research
is done around Facebook and some usage
data there just a quick reminder before
we get going that this will be on google
video so so that's great but if you have
any google confidential questions or
comments or anything like that it will
just wait till after the talk and we can
address those then but without further
ado let's hear from Fred about his study
of Facebook ok well it's uh it's very
exciting to be here obviously my name is
Fred Scotsman I'm currently a doctoral
student at the School of Information in
library science at unc-chapel Hill and
my research deals with social networks
identity and some of these emerging
questions that come when people share
their identities online I researched the
Facebook and usually I give this talk to
an academic crowd who doesn't know that
much about the facebook so forgive me if
you know all this and you probably do
but what is the Facebook the facebook is
a social networking service that
primarily exists on college campuses
this is changing as of today and as a
little while ago so some of this is in
flux but the Facebook claims they have
7.5 million users it's rolled out to
2,100 colleges 22,000 high schools and
as of this morning 1000 companies they
also claim to be the largest photo
sharing site on the internet and because
i usually give this talk to college
administrators that sort of thing i like
to say that the facebook owns their
campus and and i think we'll see why
they own it from some of the statistics
of the study and I'd be remiss without
showing a picture of the facebook as you
can see it looks like any other social
networking service and it behaves like
any other social networking service the
let's see can I do this okay yeah one of
the things that is different and unique
about the facebook is in 2004 when they
rolled it out students could organize
their friends into their classes so they
could look in the facebook and see all
the students in their classes this
proved to be a very very popular thing
as students like to explore the networks
that are around them and what will take
a little bit of a look at this how did I
get to study the facebook I started off
with a pilot study of how people share
their identity in in social networking
services so i did a broad overview of a
number of social networking services I
got the statistics back and I found
something really really amazing that
basically ninety percent of our
undergraduate camp our undergraduate
population was on the Facebook was
taking part and so this was in summer of
two thousand five things obviously move
very fast in this space but that really
shocked me it shocked a lot of people
around me so I said I'm going to
concentrate on this area I'm going to
look and see what I can find out my
first study was a whole network sample I
actually collected the college network
and I started to analyze this and and
there's a sort of a bad joke on there
because I last gave this talk at a
social networking conference and pie act
as a social networking analysis software
and I'm not so good at it so I did that
and I didn't get too far so I said well
I think I'd like to analyze
how a social network evolves and
particularly how a social network
evolves from your first day on a college
campus and so the freshman class was
about to arrive and I said what I'll do
is I will study the the use of the
Facebook of the freshman class of UNC
Chapel Hill so studying studying the
freshmen it's a longitudinal study I
sample the network once a week I caulk
to the profiles of friends of the of the
freshmen starting the first day of
school and the freshmen I there's not
really a notion of verification I
selected people who said that their
school year was 2009 they were
undergraduates so I admit that I was
basically looking for some things about
how it's adopted how the friend network
changes what people are sharing and what
are some interesting uses how is what's
going on what's the culture of the
Facebook like and so my study design
which I thought was pretty great turned
out to be sort of flawed because when I
sampled the network that first week I
found that eighty-five percent of the
college freshman we're already on the
facebook I guess I should have known
this but anyway it sort of surprised me
so of the 30 750 freshman at UNC that's
reported by the Registrar eighty-five
percent of those were on the Facebook
and over the course of the semester that
grew to ninety-four percent and as you
can see down there I also looked at how
many of these students are taking
advantage of the privacy features in the
Facebook my research revolves around
what facets of identity they're sharing
and I found that in Week one about three
percent of the network was using the
privacy settings and in that grew to
about almost five percent at the end of
the semester so as my sample began this
is sort of what
the tail end of the adoption curve
looked like for the freshman in the
first semester of 2005 and as you can
see we came on with something a little
bit around 3200 and grew that network
out so I think to put a little context
around this we have to look at when they
joined and so as you can see and I'm
sorry if that's really small lettering
but those four humps over there that are
the big humps are made June July and
August and that actually represents when
the freshman came online and I looked at
those dates and I tried to find out
where they clustered around and as I'm
sure you can imagine those dates
clustered around orientation so how are
students finding out about the facebook
in the summer of two thousand five they
were hearing about it from orientation
advisors and they were going home and
what were they doing they were looking
up their friends they had met all these
people they had got the lay of the land
and here's this tool that lets them sort
of virtually interact with all the
people that they've come into contact
with so very strong correlations around
the orientation dates for joined for
when the freshmen joined and as you can
see in september-october November and
December those late adopters or coming
on so one of the things the face book
talks about in its public statistics is
how often is the Facebook use they they
say something to the extent that
two-thirds of people who have facebook
accounts log on every single day and
they spend X amount of minutes they may
be like average of twenty minutes a
person online and if you talk to
freshmen it it seems like it's a little
bit longer than that but I couldn't
verify that but what I could do is I
could look and see when is the last time
their profiles were updated and so using
that as sort of a stand-in for how often
students are logging in I found that it
does sort of look like they're telling
the truth
the students are logging in they're
using their accounts very frequently and
I think there's there's also something
about this is they're changing their
identity very frequently and this is how
long a sorry in this time interval how
many students have updated their their
profiles and in December sixty-seven
percent of students had updated their
profiles and that was sampled on
December 13th so in those 13 days
sixty-seven percent of the network the
freshman network had changed something
about themselves online and because I
was trying to get some value out of the
social network side of things I thought
it would be interesting to see how the
social network grew and so on week one I
saw something like 144,000 friend
connections in the in the network and
over the course of the semester that
grew to something over 370,000 and these
are just the friend connections of the
freshman class this isn't the entire
network the entire network when I did my
whole network sample had something
around 1.4 million of these connections
so there's a lot of connections going on
and a lot of friends being made and so
this sort of brings me to what the
friend network of a freshman looks like
and this is interesting to me for a
number of reasons and particularly
because it doesn't it clashes with my
experience that being when I went to
college on my first day I didn't know 46
people but apparently the freshmen do so
there's there's something to be said
here over the course of the summer the
students had been making friends and had
been building this this front network
and so on the first day of class I saw
something like an average of forty six
friends / freshmen and over the course
of the semester that grew to a hundred
and eleven now this is very interesting
to me and it's interesting to me and it
forms my research because I can't
remember the last time I
65 new friends over 16 weeks it's just
not something that I i do and i think
many people i know do so this is a
unique thing for freshman in college and
it's a unique thing for four people in
an analogous situation to this yeah
number song because facebook
yeah I agree that the question was
because this is a regional school
University of North Carolina there may
be a larger number of friend connections
on day one because it's a state school
and not a national private school and I
agree but I think really what we're
seeing actually is what Danah Boyd says
when she says none of this is real that
really resonates with me what that means
is the behavior in here is not really
analogous to our offline behaviors so
people friend people who are going to be
living next door to them in the dorms
people that they've met once or twice
it's it's a different type of friendship
in this network and so one of the
questions that comes up in these
services is what are they doing I have
my opinions on it and I think everybody
sort of has an opinion on it and people
say well they're they're wasting time
they're hanging out there they're
they're dating that sort of thing so i
won't see Brett Bumgarner who is a
senior at UNC Chapel held the semester
for his honors thesis ran a study he
surveyed a thousand people and did a
took a uses and gratifications approach
to how they approach the facebook so
it's very interesting to me and really
what he found out is that in the
Facebook people are hanging out that's
what they do the most then they use it
as a directory they use it to look up
their friends see where they are how to
get in contact with them how to message
them that sort of thing they readily
state that they waste time and then what
they also do is they learn about each
other and that's I think a very
important thing I'll talk about that a
little bit and I sort of doubt you can
see this or read that so I apologize but
one of the things that interest me about
all of this when people are learning
about each other is this notion of
identity sharing as in i create a
profile i put things out there in the
world
and I say yeah this is me i want you to
see who i am and an interesting thing
about the facebook and an interesting
thing about social networking services
in general is how much information is
shared and what type of information is
shared and so in this graph with let's
see with political orientation being
reported at seventy-five percent and
everything to the left of that is
political orientation concentration or
major relationship status sexual
orientation hometown and birthday so
some really interesting things that are
being shared at it I wouldn't say
alarming rate but a very high rate the
students are very very comfortable and
putting their identity out there and I
think this has long-term ramifications
and down at the tail of that is photo
albums their website and their mobile
phone number and I think due to the
culture of the Facebook this is sort of
constantly in change and I think if I
sample now I'd find slightly different
things variations mobile might be up and
maybe people have pulled back on sexual
orientation that sort of thing but
really there's a lot of information
being shared so it gives students a good
incentive to go and learn about each
other and so I've added some slides to
my talk but one of the fun things I did
was I sampled the political orientation
of the freshman class and what I found
was that well I sort of came with this
and I wanted to say well I mean this
College really you know they say college
makes you liberal or something like that
does it really make you liberal this is
a really you know have a noticeable
change on is there a liberalisation or
is the college get more conservative
that sort of thing and really what I
found as you can see is there isn't a
lot of change so over the course of this
that first semester the freshman in
college I only change their political
orientation enough and I'm just sort of
throwing this in as a as a fun slide but
it was interesting to me and I also
looked at this photo hosting Facebook
claims to be the biggest photo hosting
site on the entire in
and this is the evolution of how
photographs were used in the first or
the last let's see what's that eight
weeks seven weeks of the fall semester
that's where they introduced it in week
nine and so as you can see then that
baseline number is about 10,000 and that
grew to almost 80,000 in the course of I
let's see seven weeks eight weeks I'm
sorry so as you can imagine that's just
the freshman and when Facebook claims to
be the number one photo hosting site on
the Internet I actually may believe them
because this is a lot of information
photographic information being shared
now this particular metric is persons
represented in photos in the Facebook
you can tag your photos with the name of
the person so here's five people in a
picture I circle people's names and it's
tied to their profile some interesting
implications with that but at the end of
week 16 nearly 80,000 people have been
represented just in the freshman's
pictures okay so here's where I diverge
from my normal talk and I'll talk a
little bit about why the facebook one
why in this crowded market did the
Facebook differentiate itself what did
it do different from other services that
ended up with 95% utilization rates that
sort of thing the first is a notion i
call situational relevance that being
does a social networking service answer
a particular need of the demographic
it's going after freshman in college are
a very unique demographic they've just
left a social network that they've been
building for 18 years of their lives or
17 or 19 they're comfortable in the
social network they've risen to the top
and they move to a new place where they
have to renegotiate their social network
now they have a need and that need is
to that need is to explore the social
network around them so the Facebook
situates itself in a very very very good
place and that place being here's all
the people you need to meet here's where
all the social capital is here is a
place for you to go and explore that so
the notion of situational relevance is I
have a need does the social networking
service answer it and the needs of these
freshmen are an ability to see the
network around them another thing is the
identity formulation that goes on and
there's identity formulation and
reformulations and riri formulation the
facebook allows these students to try on
identities every week or every day every
hour every week allows them to change
that identity and that identity is
really important and inside the facebook
that's a walled garden you can't see out
of it so and you can't see into it if
you're not a member so these students
can try on their identities and they can
try on their identities in front of the
people that matter to them but not to
the people they're worried about who
might see their identity their parents
their people from their hometown that
sort of thing so it gives them an
opportunity to to consistently
reformulate their identity I talked a
little bit about social network
renegotiation and situational relevance
social network renegotiation means i
need to go out and find new friends i
have lost a social network here's a new
one that I need to succeed in and I
think for a lot of college students you
know academics is important but you ask
a freshman what they want to do well
they want to meet friends they want to
feel like they belong in this new
network that they're taking part in and
so to take part in that Network you have
to survey it and make choices about who
you're going to be friends with so
there's limited time to know everyone
and because the Facebook really flattens
the call
network it gives people a way to make
better economic choices in their opinion
but who's going to be their friends and
when I say economic choices I mean where
do I want to spend my time do I want to
spend my time on someone who doesn't
share as many interests with me as
someone who does it's it's really an
interesting thing and really when
students are in the Facebook and they're
searching and looking at people's
profiles that what they're doing is
they're sort of internalizing a lot of
this they're they're basically saying if
I'm going to have to spend my time
making these new friends who are the
ones that are best for me to invest in
and that's sort of a jaded worldview i
think but the facebook allows it and i
think students take advantage of it and
so sort of getting towards the end so
how does facebook change college well it
does change the college experience some
ways and I would certainly say it
doesn't change the college experience
and others it flattens the campus is one
thing I can see everyone around me I can
interact with the Stars and the people
who are the friends of the friends of
the friends that I see at the bar all of
that is available to me and that's the
same in many other social networking
service but it it does do something on a
college campus it flattens it another
thing that it does is it makes the
social life a lot more manageable and I
think students spend a lot of time
micromanaging their social life and so
basically what that means is when I have
the ability to see everyone around me
and know what they're doing and and know
the parties they're going to and get
their messages and and and basically I
never have to worry about when I'm going
to be alone because I've always got
people and that I can get in touch with
and basically have a social life with so
there's micromanagement of the social
life is an interesting thing that's
happening and then finally I think it
does change how we learn about each
other how we basically approach how
people want to share their identity and
that's the thing because when I make a
profile on the facebook i'm making a
profile for me but I'm really making it
for you and and because of that I think
that really changes some dynamics of the
social network and so how will it change
the office and because we facebook is
coming to the office and it's here at
Google as of this morning I guess um how
is it going to change the office well
the facebook makes sense in the context
of the corporations they chose because a
lot of it mirrors a college experience
that is team teamwork and and let's see
teamwork and a need to know the people
around you and the the need to sort of
know where you are how you're situated
who is around you you know if you look
at the consulting services they've
chosen it makes a lot of sense the
students or the workers are incentivized
to know who's around them and to
participate until and to learn so this
is the economic thing and to that extent
I think it's sort of makes sense but of
course it's not as easy to bring the
facebook to the the corporation as it is
to the college campus why because people
are really really concerned about
information in the context of companies
and not so much in the context of
university I mean I really care if
employee a is employee mailing employee
be in the Facebook but if a student is
messaging another student the facebook
that's a different thing so issues of
how it changes and this is sort of how I
think it's going to be approached but
how it changes the social dynamics how
it changes these privacy dynamics and
obviously how corporations come in and
exert control those are going to be some
some big conversations that happen if
Facebook comes and you know really takes
a foothold in the corporation and so the
takeaway of all this is I think what
we're seeing and I think if we look at
the statistics and we look at facebook
and we look at myspace and we look at
all the social networking services and
we look at the blogs and we look at all
of this we're seeing a mass adoption of
a new social technical behavior what I
mean by that is
because students are incentivized to use
these technologies to communicate with
each other because they have this motive
they learn the technologies they learn
them like we learned email like we
learned i am that sort of thing and they
have these new skills and these new
skills are going to inform how we design
technology over the next 10 years 15
years 20 years it's going to be here for
a long time social networking is not
going away social networking is going to
be commodified to be a part of
everything we do and the numbers are
staggering as you've seen and they're
only going to get bigger and really the
question that I have is how to do it
well we really have to think about how
we're going to capitalize on this how
we're going to do social networking
right how it fits in how it's relevant
and how essentially businesses and
people like me can sort of understand
this phenomenon going forward and that
concludes my talk thank you for the
monitor it up and every mountain hold
out till afterwards also credit yeah
like the URLs of intercept you published
about that when i'm going to share my
finger in the email who sent out but
interesting case he talks a little bit
more about actual usage models of
Facebook for example our people
the wall postings are they poking or is
it primarily just browsing just
impossible to categorize it wrote these
scenarios there the answer to that is
there sort of they're doing everything
and they're doing everything a lot and
that's that's sort of the thing that
when i get my statistics back a night
and i try to analyze this i realize that
there's so much going on that almost i
don't know where to begin and i'm still
in this process of figuring out how do i
categorize how do i put certain
behaviors into certain bins and that's a
hard process but to answer your question
there are some behavioral models i think
i would categorize of that for how they
how people are using it now some people
use it just to browse look at their
friends i mean that that that I don't
sit around the sit around the computer
and gossip basically he said this she
said that and this this this undergrad
study Brett Bumgardner study is amazing
and if you're into this it's in this and
I'm I'll get it to go in because it
really categorizes how people use the
site and it breaks it down into these
bins the uses and gratifications
approaches usually for a marketing I
think marketers use it a lot but it
really makes sense in the context of
these questions but they do they use it
for dating they use it for sort of the
the identity formulation they and their
sort of using it for everything and it's
really a proxy for a social life but it
isn't a proxy for a social life because
the social lives are continuing it's
just part of it is online and most of is
offline
yeah that would ok on the Likert scale
how how useful are those responses the
responses being from the undergraduate
study the survey those were there were a
number of responses and those were the
ones that were that rose to the top so
in the uses and gratifications approach
the student posed a number of scenarios
and grouped those into bins and those
were the ones that rose to the top so
down at the bottom we saw responses more
in the in the 11.5 scale so that there
is significance
okay the question is if the students are
adding 65 new friends over the course of
the semester how much is Facebook
contributing to that effect and I think
this sort of goes back to how we sort of
have to situate ourselves when we try
and generalize behavior and social
networks outside of social networks how
do does the behavior in the Facebook
transfer out is a really human behavior
and I'm not going to take a standpoint
and say that it is and i didn't avoid
says none of this is real and i and i
think there's a lot to be said in that
so this this type of behavior this
friend making behavior it has a lot of
significance but it has a lot of
significance in context no they are not
making 65 new close friends over the
semester those friends range from people
they've never met to people they've
hooked up with to people they've lived
with two people they made really deep
friendships with because everything has
to fall under this sort of singular
notion of a friend in the service you
don't get to really pull that out and
see how granular that is they've
introduced they've introduced a way for
you to talk about how you met someone
that's not in my study because that's a
relatively new thing but they realize
that you know everyone being a friend is
actually not a good representation so
you can talk about how you know someone
yeah
yeah I have and there are a number of
people who have a lot of friends and
they are certainly a number of people
who have very few friends but I would
say that that is more or less quite
representative and if you look in the
facebook now in weird a sample you would
probably see that those students now has
somewhere on an average of two hundred
friends they they add a lot of friends
and it's actually quite normal it's
quite normal to have a friend network of
that size so certainly there are fake
stirs is the term you know that have
tons of friends why because students are
using these things to connect their
they're important in someones social
life the coach of the basketball team
that sort of thing he's not actually
used in the facebook it's somebody who
said of his profile and he's got a
thousand friends but there's not a lot
of those and people really are just
connecting like crazy is that
I I agree and then the question was it
would be interesting to look at how that
change over the course of the master
what the trends were and i think i think
if you if you looked at the behavior in
the beginning i think it will certainly
be different over the summer than it is
once people get to campus and start
connecting but still because you can
look up someone by their residents what
these students were doing were was they
looking at everybody who's going to be
on their on their haul and they were
friending them I mean that's just nice
behavior I'm going to live with you I'm
going to be your friend so when I came
on big jump and then now they weren't
meeting how many people over the course
of semester and then it took off again
once they actually started to
interacting and meeting people at
parties that sort of thing
that would be that would be a very
interesting study no I don't I don't
know anybody who has done that but i
think i would love to read it okay the
question was why aren't people posting
their mobile phone numbers that's a
really good question because I've
thought about this and I don't really
know why I think I've got maybe do one
or two guesses and one is the mobile
phone doesn't work in the context of the
Facebook and so what I mean by that is
because there's no channel for me to
communicate in the Facebook through a
mobile phone so there's no real
incentive for me to show that
information now this is changing because
facebook now has a mobile program and
they're rolling it out like crazy and
its really pretty interesting um and the
other thing is I think students are
actually kind of weird about the phone
is sort of the last thing that like you
know you always learn not to share and I
what I did is in my pilot study I
compared information sharing in these
services to the student directory and
even in the student directory a lot of
people pull their phone numbers out so I
think it's you know it's like not it's a
it's a gap that the students at the time
weren't really comfortable bridging
because I don't know there's there's
just something tied up in the phone that
that's that's a little bit different
than your email that's my guess though
an actual identity definitely
an area separate area distraction as
opposed to be an extension of
yeah that's that's that's fantastic
because it's a very interesting area the
question is is there a movement from
pseudonymity to using real names and
real identity information in a service
like the Facebook is this trend is this
sort of something that we're seeing more
often and I think to a certain extent if
you look at myspace if you look at
facebook if you look at the social
networking services yeah people are
sharing more real information in my
study I can't verify what information is
real or not all I know is there's a bit
and they've shared it I'm not going to
say if it's true or not but here's the
thing in the Facebook in the walled
garden there isn't an incentive for you
to be anonymous in fact you're
incentivized to not be anonymous you're
incentivized to take part and to play
the game like everybody else I think the
reason is college students are well they
like to think of themselves as
individuals but it's sort of you you
can't be an individual until you've been
part of the group and that's what's
happening everybody has to play by the
rules because everybody expects that
everybody's going to play by the rules
when someone meet somebody at a party
they ask their last name what this is
new this I it blows my mind why because
what happens is they go home and they
look that person up in the Facebook and
and and find their information so if I
had to guess I would say that there's a
very small culture of anonymity as in
i'm a lurker in the facebook but the
information that students put in is not
necessarily the real information there's
a lot of culture that is being sort of
accreted in the facebook and there are
codes and there are you know interesting
ways of signaling things and you know a
student says they're married to another
student I mean my my sister is married
to somebody you know I didn't know this
I looked up her Facebook she's married
to somebody hey it doesn't mean
something it's a signal it's a cultural
signal so it's the information is sort
of real in a sense but it's not
necessarily you know I'm not putting my
driver's license information online that
sort of thing it's there's nuance and
they get it
gerald
the question is do people take all the
sort of bits that they can share and
sculpt them to their own means and the
answer is absolutely I think you look at
a lot of profiles and every for a lot of
the students and almost everything is
filled out with something now I mean
obviously like the mobile phone you have
to put a number in but all of the sort
of free text fields that you can dump
stuff in people have dumps up in and
they filled it up till you know the
limit basically and they use it whatever
way they want and trends emerge the
marriage thing is a good example I mean
all of a sudden students are married to
each other it you know there it's sort
of it it's sort of a friendship on top
of friendships because my sister is
married to you know one of her like
suite mates or something like that so
and this is going on a lot and also it's
it's sort of about cultural signaling
it's you know if I understand that I put
this thing in my interest it means
something and that's going on constantly
that's going on absolutely constantly in
its evolving and changing and your cool
if you're on the you know the cusp of
that
