christensen and i'm working on climate
change for Google org and my good friend
mang asked me to do the introduction to
jon kabat-zinn and i'm honored to have
the opportunity to do so but i first
wanted to thank mang for organizing this
event it's such a special occasion and I
thought that mang's title was especially
appropriate given that he's known as
jolly good fellow here at Google best
captures John's teachings so just a
little bit of background on his bio jon
kabat-zinn is a scientist writer and
meditation teacher engaged in bringing
mindfulness into the mainstream of
medicine and society he's professor of
medicine emeritus at University of
Massachusetts Medical School where he
was founding executive director of the
center for mindfulness and medicine
healthcare and society as well as
founder and former director of its
world-renowned stress reduction clinic
which about you guys I could use a
little bit of that now in forward to
this he's the author of many books
including full catastrophe living using
the wisdom of your body and mind to face
stress pain and illness as well as
wherever you go there you are the book
that introduced me to him dr. Cabot
since work has contributed to a growing
movement of mindfulness into mainstream
institutions in our society including
medicine healthcare schools corporations
and perhaps even here at Google dr.
kabat-zinn received his PhD in molecular
biology from MIT in 1971 and his
research focused on mind-body
interactions with healing and various
clinical applications of mindfulness
meditation training for people with
chronic pain and stress-related
disorders we're hoping that his
teachings will help all of us to not
only optimize our mental output for
Google but also optimize our quality of
life wherever we are so welcome John
thank you
well thank you for that very sweet
introduction and it's uh it's wonderful
for me to be here I've never been here
before and and it does feel like an
interesting planet to be on I'm just
feeling feeling my way but I to one
express my gratitude to Tamang for for
inviting me and I understand that I'm
part of a much larger scheme in his mind
how many of you heard Alan Wallace talk
when he was here some time ago not that
many so we're covering a very broad
spectrum because I'm sure a lot of
people showed up for his talk and then
Paul Ekman is going to come in May I'm
told and Paul Ekman is also involved in
this kind of work in another way some of
which I'll explain to you when I get to
the slides
was that and matthieu ricard whose face
you'll see in some of the photographs
I'll be showing he's coming next week
and I highly recommend to you to see him
we have sort of a parallel background in
that I was a student of Salvador Luria
at MIT who won the Nobel Prize early on
in the history of molecular biology and
he was a graduate student at the same
time at the Pasteur Institute in Paris
France with Francois Jacob who was a
close friend of Luria's and then he
happened to go off to Nepal and was so
struck by what he felt from the Tibetan
meditation teachers that he met there
that he gave up molecular biology and
has been a monk for 40 years but now as
you'll see he's been engaged in a larger
enterprise to sort of do science on
meditative experience and like look at
the neuroscience of what happens in in
the brain when people have been
meditating for very long periods of time
and with tremendous motivation and
intensity so it sounds like there's
something of a kind of sequence of
speakers coming to Google that are in
some way all pointing to some hidden
dimension of reality that's like in some
way hidden to us in other ways
completely self-evident but when it
isn't so
evident it is really opaque and I like
to think of it as an orthogonal
dimension rotate that is rotated 90
degrees in relationship to conventional
reality but one that allows in in
quantum mechanics for instance as I
understand it an orthogonal relationship
allows actually two different entities
to occupy the same space at the same
time and in the mind that is a very very
useful feature to actually ring online
as opposed to kind of leave just as
potential so I'm going to be talking
from a number of different angles I
entitled the talk after talking with
Meng about a mindfulness stress
reduction in healing because that's what
a huge amount of our work in the past
twenty eight years that the UMass
Medical Center has been about
but there's another parallel element to
it and it partly depends on how you feel
about stress and stress reduction but
when we use the word stress reduction
we're not talking about some kind of
dime-store relaxation l attempts to sort
of calm people down and just make them
feel a little bit better so that they
can work a little bit harder we're
talking about actually a transformation
in the way in which we relate to our
lives to our bodies to our calling to
our loves to our ambition and so forth
so that we can live lives of of balance
and and fundamental profound
satisfaction and I believe that's true
for human beings that that is possible
and I think that a lot of time the
society entrains us if we don't do it
ourselves into severe imbalances that
can sometimes be unbelievably addictive
intoxicating and wonderful on one level
and on the other hand may be like
actually draining your life's blood on
another level or killing you and so in a
certain way metaphorically speaking I
would say that in this society we seem
to more and more be dying for some
authentic door into ourselves in a way
that's bigger than just what usually
defines us and that's not to deny the
beauty of what we often do how creative
we can be how important
is to I mean at a place like this where
you're basically redefining the world
and the universe and in ways that
potentially are tremendously healing for
the planet but to have this be in some
sense or other held in a kind of
awareness they wouldn't ordinarily we're
just not taught in school and that
requires a certain kind of intimacy and
cultivation in order to be able to have
it more at our disposal so if we're
gonna start with stress and stress
reduction I mean periodically life mega
Time magazine and Newsweek and so forth
put stress right up there on front
because I don't know I mean I started
the stress reduction clinic in 1979 and
when I think back to 1979 I said to
myself 1979 what stress I mean because
of you folks and people like you I can
get more work done in a day than I used
to be able to get done in a month and
it's far better work but it still has a
cost do you know what I'm saying I mean
because then the expectation is not just
from other people but from myself that I
will just lake B so the digital
revolution already has sort of
catapulted us into a condition where
increasingly there's no end to the work
day there's no end to the work week and
and so there's a way in which work can
encroach all of life and if you love
work more than anything else in the
world hey no problem with that and
they've always been people like that on
the planet scientists you know musicians
I mean where it's all that but there's
also potential costs to pay in terms of
burnout in terms of like addiction in
terms of overdosing so that you're not
actually tapping into the creativity
that maybe you once were and it requires
more and more effort to get the certain
kind of return as opposed to less effort
and more dance and so there are actually
but for 20 or 25 years they've been like
a lot of research being done
epidemiologically what are the effects
so
various kinds of risk factors on human
health mentally and physically everybody
knows smoking is a big thing in this
society to actually demonstrate that
cigarette smoking is not good for your
health and you know in 1964 the Surgeon
General's report actually came out and
said that it's so there's that and
there's high blood pressure and there is
high cholesterol and also two risk
factors for coronary disease for cancer
and so forth but stress was always
considered like not measuring up to a
bonafide a risk factor but a couple of
years ago at UCSF in the laboratory of
Liz Blackburn Elissa EPEL who act
actually happens to be a mindfulness
teacher but is a young assistant
professor at UCSF did a study looking at
the rate at which the repeat chromosome
the repeats subunits at the ends of all
of our chromosomes which are called
telomeres and which are required for
every cell division in every cell in our
body that divides that it turns out that
stress crew long-term chronic stress can
accelerate the rate of telomere
degradation enormous Lee and so if
you've ever had the sort of if you ever
heard the words coming out of your mouth
after a particularly horrific experience
god that one just took years off my life
it turns out it's true it's taking
because the telomeres once they degrade
the cells can't divide anymore so if you
if stress increases the rate of telomere
degradation I mean you can't get more
somatic and molecular than that in terms
of evidence that stress does have has
potentially if it's not mitigated the
the consequence of basically increasing
aging and I'm not going to go into this
study in any great detail it was it was
published in the PNAS and proceedings in
the National Academy of Science in 2004
but just to say that they they did this
study on parents of children with
chronic medical problems that are
basically not going to get better
so I mean it just doesn't get any more
stressful than that kind of thing it's
not like well at a certain point I'll
get to go on vacation or it was this
will evolve in some way no that's just
gonna be the way it is for life but they
they actually took parents who didn't
have chronically ill children which are
the blue points and what they found was
that they were also showing telomere
degradation and what really mattered was
how they how much stress they thought
they were under they were under a lot
less stress than the other parents
objectively speaking but if you think
you're under like absolutely intolerable
levels of stress you create that reality
so it's but that's a very that's a very
positive finding because it says if you
change your relationship to the stress
that in your perception of the stress
then you could actually potentially
reduce the rate of telomere degradation
and now every study on meditation has
thrown in the telomerase assay and so
forth now and we don't know any results
yet but looking to see whether training
in the course of meditation over a
period of time might actually slow or
restore to normal say the rate of
telomere degradation so I just want to
throw that out to you because there's so
many exciting things going on in in the
field nowadays about that kind of thing
but I want to make some pretty
fundamental points here if you stare at
that word for too long it doesn't mean
anything
as you know but I want to make a
distinction between how much doing we do
and what's that doing doing yes if
you're Swedish it's doing how much doing
we wind up doing over the course of the
day as opposed to what you could call
and the Chinese might call non doing
okay or what I like to call being okay
we're called human beings but it might
be more appropriate the cliche goes for
us to rename ourselves human doings
because we seem to be very much you know
doing all the time and often the doing
is coming out of the head but not
necessarily coming out of the
right or coming out of the body and so
it's kind of in some sense disembodied
doing and overtime even the greatest
doing disembodied can get you into real
trouble at the level of the body and its
health but also at the level of our
human relationships have I lost the
audience already where are we
am I making some sense here okay because
a lot of this is going to be
impressionistic in the amount of time I
have not going to be able to go into
this in tremendous detail but what I'm
going to be doing is trying to point you
at some places where you'll be able to
sort of verify this or not for yourself
on the basis of your own experience just
by paying attention in a certain kind of
way that ordinarily we don't and if you
want a brief definition of meditation
it's about paying attention it's got
nothing to do with Buddhism mysticism
the East the West it's about paying
attention so that by by virtue of the
fact that's about paying attention it
Universal Isis it's about something
that's totally Universal and it's not
attention for its own sake it's an
attention in for the sake of a profound
capacity that we all have innately that
we ordinarily never pay any attention to
and that is awareness and I'm going to
argue that awareness has a way of
balancing out thought in ways that are
profoundly intuitive and also profoundly
creative and that we never taught that
in school we're only taught to think in
school and we get better and better at
being critical thinkers but we not so
good at holding our thoughts and
emotions and sensations and
relationships in ways that have
coherence groundedness the potential for
greater satisfaction balance and and if
you will happiness and matthieu ricard
is going to talk on happiness and he'll
come in his french in his tibetan robes
very colorful tibetan robes and and
matthew is the real thing so you're
gonna really enjoy him and i urge you
not to not to miss him so this you know
we call what we do mind-body medicine
we've been calling it that for a very
long time finally the medias picked up
on that because we're trying from the
very beginning we've been trying to
actually transform medicine medicine
itself
has is suffering from some serious
chronic diseases you may have realized
that in your own encounters with the
medical profession and and so we're in
some sense trying to breathe new life
into medicine and in some other ways
through science and through some other
ways we get it back to its Hippocratic
roots and not lose the art of medicine
while we're developing the science of
medicine I'll just point out in passing
the words meditation in the words
medicine sound a little bit of like in
English don't they and there's a very
very deep root meaning that they share
and that makes it not quite so weird
that we would be bringing medicine edit
ation into the mainstream of medicine
whereas you know it could have been
thought 30 years ago that's tantamount
to the Visigoths being at the Citadel
and about that tear down the gates of
the city and so forth
far from it meditation has now become
completely accepted within many I mean
mainstream medicine the past 30 years
and I'll show you some evidence of that
I mean this is basically a photograph of
150 doctors and other health
professionals being trained in
mindfulness at one of our professional
training retreats I just got back from
another one last week and what we call
mindfulness based stress reduction is
spread this this map is 10 years old and
by the way are just like a pitch this is
the perfect environment to do if any of
you folks can put me in touch with
software that I can put points on a map
at will I would love that and just give
I don't without the coordinates just
name the city and it shows up on my map
of the world and I'm looking for it so
this is uh and I'm serious I'd love that
so this is a great this is a poster of a
some of a day-long seminar that was held
at the National Institutes of Health at
their giant auditorium the natcher
conference center right on the grounds
of the NIH in 2004 called mindfulness
meditation and health and what I want to
say is from the perspective of 1979 when
I started the stress reduction clinic
the idea that the National Institutes of
Health would
hold the day-long symposium entitled
mindfulness meditation and health it
would is its more improbable in more
infinitesimally improbable than that the
universe would the Big Bang would stop
expanding and would would the universe
would begin to collapse I mean this is
like a huge a sieve change at the NIH
and they are now funding studies of
meditation in the range of between ten
and a hundred million dollars at the
moment and are really interested in this
in part because the more you can teach
people how to take care of themselves as
a complement to what the healthcare
system can do the cheaper it is and the
more effective because then what you're
doing is you're creating a participatory
medicine as opposed to an auto mechanics
model of Medicine and we mostly practice
auto mechanics in medicine and so this
is another stream of it that I just want
to point out I'm part of a group of
people met you is as well called the
mind and life Institute which has been
around since 1987 and which holds
periodic conversations between Western
scientists and the Dalai Lama and other
Eastern contemplatives on subjects of
mutual interest having to do with
basically two things the nature of mind
and the nature of reality and how these
different streams and epistemology Xand
way of knowing might actually inform
each other if they have conversations
together and these have all been private
meetings I'll show you some photographs
of them in a bit over the years
except that is holiness then at a
certain point said I want to have more
people be able to attend these meetings
so we held a public one at MIT in 2003
you probably read about it in the New
York Times Magazine about that time and
that was on neuroscience and meditation
and at that MIT meeting at least 90% of
the questions were about the clinical
applications of meditation so we decided
we had to have a second public meeting
clinical application science and
clinical applications of meditation and
that was held in
Chintan with twice as many people as the
MIT meeting so about 3,000 people in
November of 2005 and I also want you to
note from the point of view of the sea
change in medicine that it's
co-sponsored by Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine which is the oldest and most
venerated school of medicine in the
country and Georgetown so they no longer
are in foxholes not one thing to be
associated with either the subject of
meditation or with somebody wearing
Buddhist robes the NIH however
originally we're going to do it on the
NIH campus and they just couldn't handle
that because it would look like it would
look like the National Institutes of
Health was promoting Buddhism if the
Dalai Lama stepped on there and so we
took it out of the NIH so now I'm going
to give you a brief parenthesis and
speak about the mind and life Institute
just so you have a sense of this and a
kind of parallel universe of what's
going on here especially since Matthew
is coming in this is matthieu ricard and
this is the 17th Karmapa who is I think
in that picture 17 or 18 years old and
you know in Tibetan Buddhism everybody
is the incarnation of everybody else
they've been family for a long time and
so and this is one of the mind and life
meetings where lots of monks come and
here's his holiness and His Holiness is
translated to thin Jinpa and then Alan
Wallace who was speaking here a month or
two ago and then the Karmapa and his
holiness one of the reasons that karma
is part of it is that being 17 or 18
years old His Holiness is hoping that he
would get interested in science because
the dalai lama is very interested in
science i mean it's just really into
science and engineering and you can read
about his history in that regard but
it's just a natural scientific curiosity
and if you spend days in a room with him
talking about science
he's always interrupting the
presentations and saying but have you
thought about doing this and they said
well your holiness that's it the next
study that we decided to do so he's
right up there
even though he's only had like a high
school education formally in terms of
science he's like really well-read and
also extremely well
by some you know Nobel laureates and so
forth so he's he's got this love for
science that and this is let's see a
bunch of scientists this is Steve Steven
Chu who is a Nobel laureate in physics
who's now doing molecular biology Eric
Lander from MIT from the Broad Center
who may very well win the Nobel Prize
for some element of who was Oh Steve Chu
was here last week well what do you know
so it's a very tightly woven inter
embedded family that no doubt Google I
mean where is Google not so so but this
is a sort of framework about it that you
know in these private conversations and
we dialogue it's real dialogue and
inquiry and very beautiful and every one
of these has a book come out so you can
find them on Google and read them if you
have time and this is a picture of the
meeting in Washington where I'm
presenting to His Holiness about
mindfulness based stress reduction and
here's Mature
Archana Murrow from the Terre Vaadin
Buddhist tradition and Richard Davidson
who's the head of the Keck laboratory
for neuroimaging at the University of
Wisconsin and and a collaborator of mine
and to just say for those young
scientists here who are interested in
this interface for whatever reasons that
I couldn't even imagine but maybe you
could because mostly we're talking about
neuroscience and behavioral medicine and
things like that but there may be Google
people who could you know add a whole
other element to this thing we hold
periodic every summer summer research
institutes at the garrison Institute in
New York City and this is an example you
know just of us being in conversation
with a bunch of young faculty and
graduate students and even
undergraduates in neuroscience and
medicine and clinical psychology on
these deeply interesting questions of
what we can learn from each other
so that's the end of the parentheses the
number of if you track just the number
of scientific papers in the literature
on meditation it's beginning to look
like it's going exponential and this is
the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center where the work that I'm going to
describe comes from so we call what we
do mindfulness based stress reduction
what is mindfulness I had a friend of
mine make some calligraphies for me and
then when I went to China for the first
time to talk I thought well hey I'm
gonna have all these calligraphies I
better bring them so this is the
calligraphy for mindfulness and the
reason I show it to you is that as you
know and I'm sure that many of you here
speak Chinese but I don't know any
Chinese so I'm only saying what I've
been told and some people say it's good
calligraphy other people say not so good
calligraphy there are a lot of different
opinions about this but as I've been
told this is the word in Chinese leme
for mindfulness and it's made up of two
ideograms one for presence over the
integrand for heart okay and the reason
I'm showing it to you is not because of
the Chinese but because if you hear the
word mindfulness it's very easy to think
of it cerebrally and it's like a mind
okay and so it's like about some kind of
cognitive discursive thought process but
it's not that at all in Asian languages
I'm again I'm told the word from mind
and the word for heart is the same in
all these languages so we need to when
we hear the word mindfulness also here
heartfulness so we're not going to
understand what it is and my working
definition of it operationally speaking
is it's moment to moment non-judgmental
awareness that's cultivated by paying
attention okay so moment to moment
non-judgmental awareness Y moment to
moment well because it's the present
moment is the only moment we're ever
alive in it's the only moment we can
think it's the only moment in which we
can be creative it's the only moment
which we can relate perceive and do
anything and there are two interesting
things about meditation they're very
often really not well unpacked in our
society one is that just like anything
else it's a learning curve and so
there's a
certain way in which meditation is
instrumental just like like driving a
car learning to play a musical
instrument you just do it over and over
and over again you do it it's a minute
you follow the algorithm of the
instructions and so forth and you you
think that you're gonna get better at it
and you're going to have benefits that
come from it and it's so it's gold
sequined seeking and there's a certain
kind of acquisition and it's always
incomplete because it's on the way to
someplace else some better place so
there's an element of striving and an
element of thinking okay and it's like
with any skill that you learn that's the
instrumental element but unlike anything
else that I know and the reason that
meditation is so powerful it's just like
in quantum mechanics you know when you
take an elementary with let's say an
electron so I don't have to use the word
particle it's both a particle and a wave
okay or it's neither until you do the
experiment and depending on what kind of
apparatus you use it manifests as
particle it manifests this wave but we
can't really say what it is when we
don't do this experiment so it's it's
kind of just different mode of reality
and they speak of it as being
complementary that the particle and the
wave are complementary elements of the
the the non thing and the non
instrumental dimension of meditation is
that there's no place to go and there's
nothing to do that there's nothing to
attain that this is it and if you drop
into this moment that it's not about
ever it getting any better than this
because it can't get any better than
this this is it you'll just lose more
telomeres in the next minute if you're
pardon my putting it that way but it's
like we we tend to persist that like in
the future it's all gonna come together
better when Google's like much bigger or
when or you work out all the kinks or
whatever but you know that's a very
limited way of thinking about this thing
because the future that you're living in
now this present moment was the future
of when Google started so look how
successful you are do you know I'm
saying it's all sort of an element of
perspective on and if we're always
blasting through the present moment to
get to some better moment in a sense
we're not reading
the present moment we're not inhabiting
the present moment and as you'll see
some very famous people have made some
very interesting comments about the
downside of that so as it says in the
Heart Sutra the great Mahayana texts and
all the sort of Buddhist traditions in
Asia nowhere to go nothing to do nothing
to attain you already complete already
hole completely endowed and the thinking
is not attached to anything it's the
thought is incredibly powerful but when
it becomes like glomp Sanh - like we
insist that it has to be a certain way
then our thoughts become can blind us
and we're talking more about the quality
of awareness so the way I like to put it
in the kind of present participle form
is awareness sing so mindfulness is in a
sense it's awareness seeing we do it all
the time but we're not aware of it so we
need to actually cultivate Metta
awareness metacognition or metacognitive
awareness and I just want to say I don't
want to go into this in any great detail
that this is based on a kind of non dual
view of the universe that we do create
subject and object we separate things as
me the viewer and what is viewed and all
of that and from a conventional point of
view that's fine but there's some other
element that unifies what Wordsworth
called discordant elements and makes
them work in one society to some deeper
element of integration there very often
we are opaque to and so that's beyond
relative opposites like what what I like
and what I don't like that can rule my
life
I only react to things that are pleasant
and unpleasant things I tried to escape
from all the time so I'm always trying
to get where I don't work what I want
and push away what I don't want the very
unbalanced way to live getting stuck in
positive emotions and negative emotions
I believe I believe that there are no
pot there are no positive and negative
emotions all emotions have information
and if you know how to handle that
information then it can all be really
useful whereas if you say well anger is
a you know negative emotion sometimes
anger is a very appropriate emotion but
if it leads to mindless violence for
instance then it's not a very good use
of your anger and even you and me this
is a separation there that
is not necessarily fundamental awareness
itself if you start to become aware of
your awareness its boundless there's no
center there's no periphery it's non
dual but it is discerning without being
completely thought grounded and it's
something you can discern for yourself
so anyway mindfulness is universal as I
said but the most articulate expression
of mindfulness on the planet comes out
of the Buddhist tradition
okay and apocryphally speaking people
used to go up to the Buddha and say are
you a God and he was said to have
responded no I'm awake okay and if you
know anything about Buddhist iconography
all of these kinds of forms whether it's
the Buddha or various Bodhisattvas is
over they're not about deities they're
about their representations of states of
mind their representations of states of
mind and that's the representation of
the state of mind awake so the
implication is that you know we're some
somehow in a hypnotic dream state that
perpetuates itself and we're kind of
awake but kind of not awake and in some
sense a slave to that unawareness so we
can zone along on autopilot for years at
a time more or less unconscious even
while we're thinking we're conscious and
the implication of that and you can
check this out for yourself is that you
may never be where you actually are
because you're always somewhere else if
you start to see how much of the time
your mind is in the future for instance
how much of the time your mind is in the
past the present moment tends to get a
little squeezed this can have profound
implications for creativity for
well-being for happiness and for
physical and psychological health
excuse me so just this calligraphy is
the calligraphy for Dao or path so we're
suggesting in those traditions that
there is a kind of lawfulness of the
universe often mysterious but a way to
be in line with that that's what she
going in Taichi and all those martial
arts are about when you align yourself
with certain lawfulness of things then
then a certain kind of harmony results
from that when you don't then something
else so the notion of a way with a
capital W so part of meditation practice
is finding your way with a capital W
it's not like there's one right way you
have to find your own way you can't just
have some arbitrary Authority tell you
what you need to be doing to be more
awake it's like your job with a capital
J or your way with a capital W and if
you don't know what your way is great I
mean we always want our own way don't we
I love it that when you can see it
happening in supermarkets allowing the
kid has a meltdown and wants like three
different things that the checkout line
and and and the parent says you can't
always have your own way and child says
I know I'm on you I'm on and and and you
wind up saying you'll understand when
you grow up but isn't it true that when
we've grown up and don't we all want our
own way but if somebody would have
shaved head and robes comes in with a
far-out looking gnarled and carved stick
and asks you what is your true way you
might not be able to even open your
mouth and this is the calligraphy for
literally turning but but it means
breakthrough so what is a breakthrough
it's that orthogonal turning towards
something especially when you have feel
a very informed towards it the whole
martial art of Aikido blending moving in
turning towards and if you know Rumi's
poetry the guest house for instance it's
all about putting out the welcome mat
for all the stuff that arrives at our
door whether we like it or not this
being human is a guest house every
moment a new arrival
Lajoie a depression a meanness some
fundamental awareness comes as an
unexpected visitor welcome and entertain
them all even if there are a host of
sorrows who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture still treat each
guest honorably
he may be cleaning you out for some new
delight the dark thought the shame the
malice greet them at the door laughing
that's advanced practice and invite them
in be grateful for whoever comes because
each has been sent as a guide from
beyond at poem is 900 years old but what
it's suggesting is turned towards rather
than recoil away from and see open your
eyes take a look that's what this is
really all about and and it's suggesting
that when you do that kind of turning
there's the potential for breakthrough
breakthrough
insights breakthrough behaviors
breakthrough you know rearranging of
your cellular organism because the
body's listening to what the mind is
doing and when the mind learns had a
self-regulating particular ways through
self observation interesting things
happen so Thoreau said famously if you
go back and read Walden you'll see it's
all a Rhapsody for the about the present
moment I went to the woods because I
wished to live deliberately to front
only the essential facts of life and see
if I could not learn what it had to
teach and not when I came to die
discover that I hadn't lived Martha
Graham all that's important is this one
moment in movement make the moment vital
and worth living do not let it slip away
unnoticed and unused and William James
I'm not even going to go into that in
the interest of time but he's basically
saying that a method to voluntarily
bring the mind back when it wanders off
would be in the foundation of the best
possible education but he says it's
easier to conceive of that than to find
one that would really work but but he
didn't know anything it's evidence they
didn't know anything about Buddhism
because that's exactly what it is is
mind goes off you bring it back mind
goes off you bring it back mind goes off
you're bringing back mind goes off you
don't want to bring it back you bring it
back anyway against the resistance and
something starts to grow against the
very resistance that's a lot more
interesting
by sec and it's mindfulness so MBSR is a
compliment to medical treatment not a
substitute for it in the hospitals it's
fully integrated into medical clinics
and sub specialties it it does involve a
certain degree of discipline and work
although I like to think of it more as
play than work and with our medical
patients who suffer from severe chronic
medical conditions of all kinds
including anxiety and panic and so forth
it's a fairly intensive time commitment
45 minutes a day six days a week for
eight weeks and there are four formal
methods that we teach a body scan which
is a lying down meditation sitting
meditation mindful yoga and mindful
walking and so this is an action shot of
the body skin just goes on like this
another view sitting meditation it looks
like nothing's happening I want to tell
you this is the hardest work in the
world to be in the present moment
non-judgmentally for even than you know
a fraction of a second is hard work and
I'm basically challenging you to
consider that it might have some
enormous benefits we do it in Spanish as
well as in English in our inner-city
clinic so it's shown to be
cross-cultural mindful yoga I won't say
any more about yoga we're in the Bay
Area after all and I know that there's
yoga here and massage here and
meditation here so in a sense I'm
probably just wasting my breath talking
the real meditation practice however is
not these formal practices it's living
your life as if it really mattered so in
other words your whole life becomes the
meditation practice that's what this is
really about living in awareness living
with a certain degree of self compassion
and kindness and cultivating what you
know the Dalai Lama and other people
calls wisdom in and you know the body
has its own natural wisdom the mind also
has its own natural wisdom and sometimes
we get out of touch with it so I'll just
give you one example like the next time
you're in the shower just as homework
from this
check and see if you're in the shower
you may o be already at Google because
maybe you're always at Google and your
shower at Google but it but you will be
amazed how much like when you're in the
shower you're already at work you might
have your whole first meeting of the day
in the shower with you you might be in
the middle of an argument but you're not
feeling the water on your skin so you
can begin to just gently and remember
it's non-judgmental so you don't beat
yourself up for non-performance on the
meditative side but you just like let
the water be in touch with your skin and
know it that's like that sensorium of
feeling you can know it
and that becomes meditation practice so
this is a slide that I was showing his
holiness in that talk I was trying to
get through about MBSR so I said well if
if you consider life to be the bicycle
then MBSR kind of like or any training
in mindfulness would be like training
wheels you know you just kind of get the
feel of it but then you throw the
training wheels away it's all about you
know the somatic experiencing of it and
you can't I don't think even that Google
you can develop an algorithm from riding
a bike you read the algorithm and you
just ride never fall the body has to
learn from doing from the engagement of
it and so you know and then once you do
know how to ride you don't need the
training wheels in and there are a lot
of different things that ways that
people approach bike riding ok how many
of you ride bikes to work and I saw a
lot of bikes out there so there's biking
and biking and there's meditating and
meditating - ok but it's not about like
Einstein never needed to be like Lance
Armstrong ok it wasn't his thing
seven-time winner of the Tour de France
the amount of mental energy that it
takes to accomplish something like this
virtually unthinkable that's why the
issue of drugs will come up but the fact
of the matter is that you don't have to
be like anybody else you use your
bicycle your way so I'm going to just in
the last few minutes of this before we
have questions I want
just run by you some clinical studies
okay so that you have a sense of the
kind of work that's being done in this
area and just very briefly to say with a
whole bunch of medical patients going
through the stress reduction clinic who
we're medical patients they had chronic
pain conditions hard conditions and so
forth but they also qualified for
clinically a mental health diagnosis in
either anxiety or panic disorder okay so
they had that a psychiatric diagnosis on
top of the medical diagnosis and you can
see that like if these is an anxiety
scale you have a step function down over
the eight weeks of the stress reduction
clinic people come to the hospital once
a week to an hour class in the sixth
week there's also a day-long
silent meditation retreat and so it's
eight weeks two and a half hours once a
week forty-five minutes of practice
every day you see a step function and
anxiety you also see a step function in
depression and then I won't show you the
data but that goes out not just three
months but three years so something
people do in eight weeks can have an
effect on their lives three years down
the road now I'm going to just very
briefly talk about two randomized
clinical trials one the effect of
mindfulness based stress reduction on
emotional processing in the brain and
immune function in response to a flu
vaccine and then if there's time very
briefly the effect of the mind on the
healing process that you can actually
see in photograph because healing is a
sort of double-edged word in medicine
you have to be very careful how you use
it if people start to roll their
eyeballs and think you're weird
but wound healing nobody thinks that
about and so we tried to find a healing
process that would not create that kind
of resistance so this is a study that we
published in 2003 and with dr. Davidson
my collaborator pink and mindfulness
training in the form of MBSR be used to
modify the central circuitry of emotion
and I just want to say and maybe Paul
Ekman will talk some about this but
you've probably know that in the past
eight years the entire basis of
neuroscience has been transformed by the
discovery that the dogma that we were
taught for a generation that after
the age of two there's no new neurons
laid down in the central nervous system
and that it's all loss of neurons it's
like downhill from about the age of two
and you can kind of hear the neurons
going exponentially that turns out not
to be true it turns out that we're
making not just synthesizing new neurons
which is called neurogenesis but laying
them down in particular regions of the
brain and their functional up to the day
we die and it's driven more than
anything else by experience and more
than any kind of experience we
repetitive experience okay when you do
the same thing over and over and over
again like ride bikes up mountains or or
meditate or
forints or play the violin starting at a
very early age where what you do with
the right hand what you do with the left
hand are very different it turns out you
can morph what's going on in your motor
cortex and somatosensory cortex by just
fingering a lot okay and there's a very
famous study of the London taxi cab
drivers downloading the street map of
London into their heads and you see the
anterior hippocratic a shrink and the
posterior at the campus get bigger over
a period of two years losing a limb very
often different aspects of the brain are
recruited to different parts of the body
because the limb is no longer there so
neuroplasticity basically means that the
brain is not static but is continually
morphing itself in response to
experience negative traumatic experience
can actually atrophy brain function and
actually brain size and therapy and
moving in a positive direction can
restore it potentially and that's a
that's an area of very ongoing very
exciting research so I'm gonna talk
about a part of the brain called the
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex which
has a kind of division of labor left and
right there's an asymmetry in the
lateralization so left activation
associated shorthand happiness feelings
of well-being approach behaviors right
activation all of other things being
equal
behavior and difficult emotions there
are also of course many other complex
regions of blame so this is the left
prefrontal cortex associated with
positive effect in some studies so
here's the kind of summary slide left
happy right unhappy I won't belabor it
in the interest of time except that if
you take people and put them into
scanners or or use a quantitative EEG
electrode helmet which I'll show you
shortly and just get people and you
don't do anything with them you just
study whether they're more left or more
right activated people who are more left
activated describe themselves with words
like interested excited strong
enthusiastic alert and active and if
they're more right activated that
describe themselves this way
and it was thought that in adulthood you
pretty much like fixed it becomes a
trait and what a study that I will show
you now suggests that that what was
called the set point is actually
malleable that with training and
meditation in eight weeks in a work
setting it will change and we did this
in a biotech company and Madison
Wisconsin so this is mature who was
coming next week who has been a subject
in many of these studies along with a
lot of other monks and the qualification
is you have to have at least 10,000
hours of intensive meditation practice
which is the equivalent of say you know
the concert master violinist and one of
the great symphony orchestras I mean
lots and lots of practice and training
but more mostly these monks are over the
40,000 or 50,000 hour okay so and if dr.
Davidson comes he will show you a lot
more about this story and this is just
to give you a little background then it
this is a hundred and fifty
undergraduate psychology majors and
their profile in terms of left and right
so you see there's some outliers on the
left there's some outliers on the right
but it's basically a Poisson
distribution nice bell curve this is
mature when he's meditating cultivating
what it is who they call non referential
compassion non referential commitment no
subject no object and in case this
distance looks fairly close this is a
test
and deviations from the mean 8 standard
deviation neuroscience and had never
seen anything like this and we've seen
this time and time again it's
reproducible not just in one person but
in many people that the brain is capable
of like the same kind of thing Lance
Armstrong is capable of when you push
the envelope in that kind of a way ok
in the non doing kind of way in the
non-striving kind of way in the
non-instrumental kind of way and then
this is more evidence from a study in
PNAS with richie and ricotta who's an
author on the paper and Antoine watts
just showing undergraduates Buddhist
monks I won't say any more except to say
that like it's a global recruitment of
the cerebral cortex and the monk
meditators and the college students with
two weeks of instruction trying hard but
that recruitment is something that takes
time to achieve so in our study we went
to a high with a to a biotech company
high-stress beautiful work environment
biotech company the president agreed to
let us do the study there randomized
people between they take the eight-week
program or they don't the anxiety is
reduced in the people that take the
program not reduced in the waitlist
control they all go into the laboratory
and very briefly I mean this is just a
way to show left versus right activation
time one is before randomization time
three is that four-month follow-up and
the meditators are in the red and the
control group are in the purple and
there's no significant difference before
by to the time two which is at the end
of eight weeks but I don't have it on
this graph end time three the meditators
are shifting more from right activation
to left activation that was not supposed
to happen by the dogma that we were
supposed to be a fixed point but they're
in eight weeks on work during work hours
learning this stuff they are shifting in
the direction of the same direction as
the Buddhist monks okay meanwhile the
control group is actually getting worse
because we are interpreting that as that
by the time they're in the laboratory
for the third time it's very very
aversive and and so they're getting more
right activated and we gave everybody
the influenza vaccine at the end of the
eight weeks and they monitored the blood
titers for antibody the meditators mount
a stronger immune response than the non
meditators and then when we plot the
degree of shift brain shift right to
left over the degree antibody titer we
get a linear relationship with a fairly
significant correlation in the in the
meditators and no relationship
whatsoever in the control group okay so
that's just kind of like one little
thumbnail sketch of the kind of science
that's being done now and it's coming
out of the hospital into the work
setting and people who took the MBSR
program reported that they were much
more effective in managing their stress
and these this regulation of emotion you
could think of as like enhancing our the
effectiveness of our emotional
intelligence and then it has effects on
health at least in terms of the immune
system and you know we don't know enough
about it to say any more than that and
that's why all these other studies are
ongoing I'm just going to say very
briefly about the skin disease that you
can see in photograph and healing that
Bill Moyers was was filming in the
stress reduction clinic back in the
early 90s and we had done a pilot study
that showed the people with psoriasis
who were meditating while they were
receiving ultraviolet light treatments
for their psoriasis healed much faster
than the people who were just getting
the ultraviolet light treatments now
ultraviolet lights not a cure for
psoriasis but psoriasis is an
uncontrolled cell proliferation in the
epidermis but it's not cancerous but
it's got kissing cousin genes to cancer
so it's like a really interesting
question can the mind influence healing
right down to the level of gene
expression control of cell division and
so forth for its own sake and also
because of its potential applications
for cancer so when you was filming in
the clinic we had this very exciting
pilot result but we couldn't talk about
it because we were in the middle of
doing the replication study so this is
what psoriatic skin looks like and it
can cover the entire body and it's very
labile with emotional
stress so the more stress you are the
more you know if your body can be
covered this is what an elbow looks like
and then that's what the same elbow
looks like clear
so we randomized people between two
conditions they they get the meditation
while they're undergoing ultraviolet
light where they just get the
ultraviolet light by itself and this is
how you get exposed to ultraviolet light
you go into a light box like a telephone
booth it's on wheels so the door closes
and then it's like kind of you're
standing there naked with a pillowcase
over your head and goggles on to shield
you from your corneas from the UV and
it's it's it's not like going to the
beach it's more like going into your
toaster oven I'm serious and and so
you're really getting grilled you can
only be in for short periods of time and
we titrate people up in time as they
accommodate through the intensity of it
and we put speakers on the top and we
did a guided meditation while they were
if you were in the experimental group
while they were doing it and I'll just
jump to the chase and say this is the
probability of clearing graph for the
meditators listening to the guided
meditation think that's the only
meditation training they got no person
just a disembodied voice no classes no
group support anything like that the
meditators are obviously healing with
the different kinetics from the people
were just getting the UV and that's
whether it's what's called photo
chemotherapy I'm glossing over a lot of
details with these a published studies
or just the ultraviolet light by itself
which is a weaker treatment so
everything's translated more to the
right
but still at the midpoint of the
probability of clearing you've got a 35
to 40 day difference and they're in and
when you do the statistics it turns out
the meditators are healing at four times
the rate of the non meditators and I
won't walk you through the table but
there are implications of the study one
is that the mind can positively
influence a healing process and speed it
up by a pact factor of approximately
four that's pretty interesting if that's
true we've seen it twice so we tend to
believe it more than we would otherwise
and it's doing it down since got to do
it down to the level of gene expression
there were all sorts of other
implications of this study which I won't
go into right now
and just for the sake of having some
time for dialogue I'm gonna stop and
just quote William James again since or
for the first time since I didn't the
first time I have no doubt whatever that
most people live whether physically
intellectually or morally in a very
restricted level of their potential
being they make use of a small portion
of their possible consciousness much
like a man who out of his whole bodily
organism should get into a habit of
using and moving only his little finger
and then very famously we all have
reservoirs of life to draw upon of which
we do not dream so I just want to say in
closing there are plenty of
opportunities to do this kind of
training if you're interested the Bay
Area has more MBSR teachers higher
density of MBSR teachers than anyplace
else on the planet
and if you're interested in the work of
the Center for mindfulness that's this
website and if you're interested in the
work of the mind and life Institute and
Dalai Lama that's that website I want to
apologize for blasting through this so
quickly but I want that did you give
give you a kind of a broad enough range
of this and so that you understand that
there's an art to this there's a science
to it and the fun really comes in the
interface between the two and then there
are very very real 28 years worth of
data on clinical applications of this
kind of thing now more and more grounded
in molecular changes at the level of
cells and also neural neuroscience and
the level of the brain so that's a very
exciting time in both medicine and
science to start unpacking these kinds
of things but even beyond the science of
it there's the kind of excitement of
maybe it making accessible to us a
dimension of living that's been if you
don't mind my using this you know pun
like way right under our noses from the
very beginning and that that we we
easily miss because we blast through so
much through our moments and we're so
into thinking but not so much into being
aware of what we're thinking so I want
to thank you for your attention and now
open it up to any kinds of questions
observations if you cared
yes just mangas suggesting that I say
that at 3:15 there'll be a meditation
class for anybody who wants to dive into
the actual practice itself rather than
talk about the practice yeah
so please just a basic comment today you
showed many pictures of monks and just
did the studies on monks I just want to
say that yet the monks in may they may
have less stress but their lives seem to
be really boring you know for people who
are working at a Google own we have a
lot of work to do we have a lot of
things to create and would you we do
have a lot of stress I mean just the
sort of some kind of a balance between a
monk's life and an engineer's life I
mean you know how for people who have a
lot of stress generating work to do them
and how do you handle this okay well I I
want to make sure that you understand
that the reason I'm showing the pictures
of the monks is basically to show
outliers okay but the fact is seventeen
thousand people have been through our
stress reduction clinic over the past
twenty eight years and none of them know
anything about monks or Buddhism and
could care less and they were all
stressed up the kazoo so or was it or
whatever so so this is my point showing
about the monks was that the regular
people in the work setting when we did
that study their brains shifted in eight
weeks in the same direction as amongst
have been doing it for 40 years so
there's a tremendous amount of latitude
for dealing with the stress that you're
under as a person and very often what we
think is well the first thing we want is
someone to just make it better like
maybe drugs or whatever but there is no
real solution to the kind of stress that
we're living with from the outside it
has to be a kind of from the inside
learning to rebalance and balance is
always losing your balance and then
recovering your balance so swimming in
these seas becomes something of an art
form and it's got nothing to do with
monks it only has to do with
like regular human beings trying to put
one foot in front of the other and live
our lives as if it really mattered and
not get so stressed out in a particular
direction that we lose sight of some of
the beauty in our own lives on the other
hand not to get so low laid back that we
stopped contributing to the world or to
our work or whatever and that is an art
form and everybody sudden in a sense has
to do that interior work themselves I
would say because no one else is going
to be able to do it for you certainly so
that's the challenge but I think there's
a very very good track record which
maybe I didn't articulate well enough
that this is for real people it's got
nothing to do with Buddhist monks it's
just as since Matthew is coming next
week you might come and see him you know
just for fun see that he ain't that
different from us anyway and believe me
the monks have plenty of stress and they
don't think their lives are boring I
mean boring is as boring sees it so you
know could be different you defined
mindfulness as non-judgmental awareness
moment a moment why is the
non-judgmental so important that it
takes 20% of the definition
oh well without that I mean that's the
hardest part of it it's like because
we've got ideas and opinions about
everything so the the invitation is to
see if you can be with a percept without
getting caught in your liking or
disliking of the percept it turns out to
be very very challenging and non judging
doesn't mean it's not an invitation it
gets stupid it's not like well I'm not
gonna be judgmental anymore I'll just
walk out there and you know if a trucks
coming no problem I'll just walk them
from the truck it's not about that we
make a very fine distinction between non
judging which is like judging is kind of
in my vocabulary's like black and white
good and bad like dislike it's kind of
very binary and we tend to jump into
those binary plus/minus good bad very
rapidly discernment is seeing more the
shades of grey between zero and one you
know everything in between between black
and white
so this
be so it's it's very much as I'm saying
a way of being it's an art form where
it's not that you don't see clearly it's
that you do see clearly because your
mind isn't fogging it over with all your
preconceived 0/1 decisions from moment
to moment about what you like and
dislike which is a little bit like a
prison yeah so I thought the results
about the psoriasis were very
interesting but I didn't think the
control group was actually a control
group because in the the set who were
given the meditation they were given
something
versus if people are told to take time
out and problem-solve
whether there's a difference because it
could also be that if people were played
this tape in the middle of you know
their treatment which said now think
about all your problems and think how
you're gonna solve them right active and
so on take care of yourself take care of
your probably call those anti meditation
tapes
yeah anti meditation they might also
show this increased results yeah I might
also take time out to take care of
themselves now I'm going on long-term
memory here because I don't know of any
recent studies of that kind and you're
absolutely right in your criticism of
the psoriasis study it was a like pilot
study where we didn't give the control
group something comparable to either
fill their mind thing even music you
know but something comparable at least
but I think the anti meditation it's not
simply that that you were thinking
there's a big difference between the
meditators and the thinkers so to speak
but that is a very sort of interesting
question and you know no doubt it needs
an awful lot more investigating than has
been done so far I I was listening to a
tape recently that from a book the dalai
lama wrote and in it he said something
very funny about neurobiology said he
was listening to a lecture give a
lecture about the amygdala and i think
it was goldman and how the amygdala has
all these negative impacts on our
emotions he laughingly thought to
himself well then enlightenment is
simple we'll just cut out the amygdala
and then we'll all be well i'll be
enlightened beings and and of course it
doesn't work that way because when you
cut out the amygdala there's a whole
host of responses that you excite from
from the opportunities that humans can
can have in their interactions such as
being rightfully afraid and and or
anytime you're startled then you need
that however i was thinking about the
studies and how you were talking about
the right and left prefrontal cortex and
how there's a notice diminished activity
in the right prefrontal cortex and then
i thought about what the dalai lama was
saying well but and how do we know what
the effects of the right prefrontal
cortex could be and how they could
possibly contribute to a wholesome life
and do we really want to sort of shut
out those capabilities and being present
with like fear and being present with
sort of those those more negative sighs
isn't that casting
the exact same sort of binary positive
negative thing that you were talking
about before yes and that's why I'm just
showing you what's been done and giving
you that frame on it but the but the
larger non-dual perception is saying we
hardly understand anything about the
brain and one of the things I grew up
lost over was that left-right shift had
to do with very specific low sigh in on
the left and on the right right next
door are other light sides that are
doing totally different things the
prefrontal cortex is doing a million
things at once so to speak most of which
we don't understand but it has to do
with executive decision making all sorts
of things so it's not a matter of like
well excise the amygdala or find the
exact thing that will like get to you
know a little bit more on the left side
because that's also dualistic so we're
beginning to unpack some of what what
are called the neural correlates of
meditation but we're light-years away
from understanding the brain or what is
really involved when you drop liking and
disliking this and that and into an
awareness that can hold it all I mean
but those but we're doing those kinds of
studies with Matthew and other people
where they can rest for extended periods
of time paying attention to one thing or
to know thing and extend that out and
see what the brain does and you know
it's all kind of like incremental
learning curve but it's but it's nobody
that I know went into meditation because
they wanted to make pretty pictures on
fMRI scanners and they go into it for
totally different reasons but now
because of this interfacing between
science and meditation it's becoming
interesting and the risk is it'll become
materialistic you know the people glomp
onto the results and they'll lose the
heart of the whole thing and even his
holiness and mature aware of that okay
last question weird the microphone
migrated to so I think this is sort of a
related question with yeah you said a
few times that that mindfulness
meditation don't inherently have
anything to do with Buddhism as someone
who is a Buddhist McCullough bout
thinking about people coming to
meditation you know
their psoriasis and I just wonder deep
do you worry if that something might be
lost as if meditation does come to be
seen as essentially just a medical
treatment and not a spiritual practice
oh yeah but I don't see it that way at
all I don't think that the first of all
the people of this who are with the
psoriasis they just agreeing to be part
of a study on meditation they're not
coming to meditation the way somebody
would come to meditation do and even in
the stress reduction clinic there why do
people come to the stress reduction
clinic really one reason one reason only
suffering okay so you know this question
got posed to the dalai lama around
whether this kind of thing is kind of
like the death knell of buddhism because
we're taking what you might call the
heart of buddhist meditation people do
called the heart but if it's adi
contextualization of it it would be a
desecration or a denaturing of it and
then offering it to people who are
suffering that would be a disaster and I
hope we're not doing that what we're
doing in my view is it's a
recontextualization and I asked him
during that presentation when it came
time to ask him questions I said to him
do you see any difference between Buddha
Dharma and the universal Dharma and he
said no and so as long as this this
mindfulness is grounded in ethics and
morality and all of the kinds of things
and it is all of the kinds of things
that would go into a kind of a full
spectrum meditation practice it doesn't
need to be Buddhist in order to reduce
suffering and when his holiness was
posed this question about whether this
is a good thing for Buddhism or not that
this happened he said the following he
said there are four billion people on
the planet
1 billion Buddhists 3 billion
non-buddhists all four billion are
suffering so what are we going to do
just keep it for us Buddhist and so and
he actually is promoting this what he
calls secularized meditation that's like
beyond Buddhism's or any other isms and
MBSR is really just an example of that
you know 25 years earlier but but it's
it's not at all meant to
and and you use the word spiritual so I
just want to say that I have a lot of
sort of trouble with the word spiritual
because it's used in so many different
ways my working definition of the word
spiritual is what it means to be really
human we don't know what it means to be
really human so but I like that because
it doesn't get into oh she's so
spiritual and he's not very spiritual
because I mean what isn't spiritual you
know it's a chopping vegetables
spiritual making love spiritual well it
all depends how present are you so it's
and IIIi love that I'm even here and
that we're having these kinds of
dialogues and questions because I think
we're in a place of so much not knowing
and the awareness itself has an element
of not just knowing but not knowing and
the bound between not knowing and
knowing that's where the juice lies and
so there's just tremendous creative
opportunities and I think in terms of
medicine and I think in terms of our
society in a certain way you could say
that the human mind has reached a part
if you don't mind my sort of branching
out a little bit to a more global view
in thinking from the last ice age for
instance all of human history has
happened in the past say 13,000 years
everything and everything beautiful that
has come out of human culture that is in
the Louvre or any place else or Google
headquarters has come out of the human
mind and the human body in 13,000 years
which is nothing in terms of like the
the history of the planet and we've
managed to call ourselves Homo sapiens
sapiens what's this that mean in Latin
this sapere present participle of the
verb so peri is to taste or to know so
we're the species that knows and knows
that it knows I don't think so I think
we haven't like lived up to that one yet
we are still in our infancy not even
knee socks you know I mean we're just
beginning to mature enough to understand
the global nature of what we've been
able to produce with say the internet
and Google and what the implications are
going to this are going to be for a
society that's still so tribal for the
you know for a speech
it's also tribal that you know you can
be Muslims and kill each other over the
year she or Sunni nevermind Christian
and Muslim or whatever Azerbaijanis and
Armenians or Chechens and Russians I
mean it's just like there's a certain
way in which that's kind of like can't
hold that much longer or all of the
horrors that have come out of the past
thirteen thousand years they also come
out of human mind when it doesn't know
itself so the challenges could humanity
reach a point where we actually own that
Homo sapiens sapiens think take it
seriously and then do the work of
cultivating intimacy with the full range
of our human capacities and of the human
mind and then work out ways to deal with
the dark side okay the side where like
we're not going to deny that we can get
you know incredibly violent if we get
angry if we're ordered if we don't get
our way if we feel threatened it's not
just in other people
and so that we have a thousand different
ways to maintain some kind of mental
equilibrium in the face of our own
insanity that might actually have
political ramifications like you know
maybe we need a more mindful politics
you know where it's not all about self
interest in getting reelected you
already got elected do something but if
the doing isn't coming out of being it's
going to be the wrong doing so when the
doing comes out of being I think you
know then I'll just close this off by
saying I sometimes say that the human
species is kind of like in some way and
the autoimmune disease of the planet you
know that without this kind of awareness
we are the first victim of our own
precocity so we're both the agent of the
disease and also the first victim I
don't think we need to stay stuck in
that kind of thing and I think there are
all sorts of very very positive and I
think optimistic forces for us to
actually not only heal ourselves as
individuals but heal ourselves on a much
more global way I'm sure that Google
thinks about this day and night and and
is in some way because of like the power
that Google
and in some way are there maybe is you
know at least collaborating in the
shaping of the of the present in ways
that will profoundly affect the future
on the side of sanity rather than on the
side of insanity thank you John
okay thank you so just a reminder we are
going to have meditation in the
university theater and is scheduled to
start three minutes ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
