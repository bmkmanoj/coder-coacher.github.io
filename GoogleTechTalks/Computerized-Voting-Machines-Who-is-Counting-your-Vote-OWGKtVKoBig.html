speaker
for the last several years she has
worked on issues of voting integrity
specifically electronic voting machines
in the US this is after see here I don't
even remember all of the awards and
things eff pioneer former ACM president
co-founder of the ACM public policy
group so it really is our pleasure to
have this next week we're Barbara Simons
thanks so since it's a small group I
mean you guys can if you want to move
closer I mean it's up to you but I know
the feeling about wine to sit in the
back and do your work so that the
speaker can't tell you're doing it so
that's all right has any of you ever
worked as a poll worker these two guys I
did it in two thousand for the
presidential election I i worked at
stanford the polling place was one of
the Stanford dorms and the voting
machines were in the comment what
basically what happened was a week
before the election a five sequoia
touchscreen paperless touchscreen voting
machines were delivered to the Commons
room and dumped in the middle of Commons
room in Stanford and the woman who had
arranged for the machines to be brought
was shocked because she had told people
to deliver them so she could put them in
a secure place when she came into work
she had them lugged into her office
where they stayed for a week under lock
and key but of course she had access to
them and anyone with the key to her
office had access to them and then the
night before the election we came and we
daisy-chained the machines because they
had to have their batteries charged in
case there was a power outage and
because most polling places don't have a
lot of electrical outlets the systems
are the machines are designed to you
have to daisy chain them and and when we
did that we had to take off the first
set of what they call tamper-proof tape
which of course is in tamper-proof tape
at all as you can imagine it might it
must be tamper-resistant we had had no
idea what this tape should look like so
he wouldn't have known if someone to
come in and done something to the
machines in the first place because in
our training we never saw the actual
tape so we took off the first set and
then we set them up and overnight the
machines were left daisy chained in the
commons room at Stanford University
where I'm sure nobody
was enough about computers to go in and
monkey with the machines then we came
back in the morning and took off the
second set of tamper-proof tape and got
the machines ready to go so that's the
way security was handled in santa clara
county in 2004 so that just gives you an
idea of the kind of world we're talking
about here so these are things I'd like
to talk about it's really more than an
hour's talk so I can skip around if
there's something you're particularly
interested in but you should feel free
just to speak up and ask questions and
make comments because I'm sure all of
you have opinions on this subject of
some sort so especially because it's a
small group so what do we want for
voting systems clearly want them to be
accurate secure and reliable we want to
be easy to conduct audits and recounts
now this is a point which I might not
have made number two a few years ago but
the idea of doing an audit i think is
really critical we we run our elections
in this country in a very haphazard way
nobody would want to business the way
elections are run and we really have to
get people starting to think that you
must audit elections especially when
you've got computers involved in any way
because we all know that can be buggy
code there could be malicious code and
you simply can't trust the machines with
something so important as deciding who's
going to run the country you you will
have to audit them and it happen it has
to be easy to do so there are some
systems out there which claimed to be
auditable but which in fact are very
hard to audit they need to be easy to
use you have to make so elderly people
language minorities these people need to
be able to use them well if you've got
to the extent that you have machines or
whatever system you have has to be has
to have good usability not like the
butterfly ballot which was an example of
exactly what you don't want in 2000 they
have to be transparent now this is sort
of a tricky issue because there are
cryptographers working on voting and
there are a number of proposals for
coming up with voting schemes that will
be secure because they use cryptography
and I'm not opposed to cryptography my
only concern is that you want the voting
public to trust the machine
and so if you have something which is
you know great system but you need to
have a PhD in computer science or even
more so you need to be a photographer to
understand it that my work might be okay
but I think ideally what you want is you
want something which is transparent
where the voter can trust that the vote
is I his or her vote is accurately
recorded and they need to be accessible
by accessible that's just code word for
people with disabilities have to be able
to use them and that's actually by law
so what we have is complex software
large software programs are always buggy
I mean you guys all know that but it's
amazing how many people don't know that
and the idea that you can't verify that
code is correct again that's obvious to
anybody who's done a large amount of
programming or even not that much
programming but again the general public
doesn't know that and an awful lot of
election officials don't know that they
don't understand these very elementary
notions and they don't understand that
you can't just fix it easily I mean I
think one of the issues is that we refer
to languages computing languages and I
think people who haven't done
programming have don't know about
computers think in terms of well you may
be saying French or Spanish that's what
you mean by language that's of course
not what we mean I mean something
different and and if it's just a
language you should be able to fix any
problems the same way you can edit a
book and find typos and again we know
that's not the case with large complex
programs and as I say that's why
computer scientists became involved so
just to give you an idea when I say
large software I don't know do you guys
know about the top to bottom review that
was done in California a few months ago
by the Secretary of State so I'll get to
that later but the bottom line is that
one of the reports the one that looked
at the software on Sequoyah machines and
that's what's used in santa clara county
according to the report that the whole
system the whole voting system for
sequoia has over 800 thousand lines of
code yes
over 800,000 lines of code and it's
written in C C++ C sharp there's some
assembler I think Z is the ad assembler
it's it's it's all over the place eight
hundred thousand lines of code and of
course what the people said who reviewed
it is there's no way we can go over all
this software so I'm just going to give
a quick review of the kinds of voting
systems that are around and this is sort
of my way of looking at things it's not
necessarily the standard way people do
it but I think of screen based systems
and of course when I say screen-based
they're always going to be computers
there so there are earphones for people
with vision impairment and literacy
problems they have multiple language
capabilities they're easy to switch from
one language to another they avoid over
votes over votes as if you vote too many
times for an office like twice for
president and under votes is if you
don't vote as many times as you can of
course a lot of times people do
undervotes intentionally because they
don't want to vote for an office but
they will and so a lot of the times the
under vote warning is turned off because
people have found it confusing they
think they've made a mistake when they
actually intended not to vote for a
particular office but over votes are
clearly a problem because that will
invalidate your vote for that particular
office so you obviously want to warn
people about over votes or not allow
them to do it more to the point voters
can modify their votes prior to
finalizing their ballot and the current
system was supposed to be good for
voters with disabilities but that's not
necessarily the case so the machines
that have caused the most controversial
called the direct recording electronic
or dr.e machines and these machines are
screen-based the same machine is used to
present ballot images via a screen
record and record the vote and it may
also count the vote and many of us I
think have come to the conclusion that
this is a bad design fundamentally bad
engineering design I mean it's you can
imagine that you might have been able to
put one of these things together well if
it was done properly the machines that
are out there and none of them was done
properly but it's it's also difficult to
get it right you in some sense you don't
want the same machine doing everything
in my opinion
it's these these machines have been
pushed by some leaders of the disability
community even though they are not
necessarily good they some of them have
pretty bad usability features they've
been cheaply and insecurely implemented
and I think I can well maybe maybe
cheaply is the wrong word i don't know
how much money was spent on this but if
you look at the quality of the code if
you look at everything that we've
learned when people who know what
they're doing look at these machines
they've been appalled and they have
costly maintenance contracts and this is
something which should bother everybody
because basically once an area once the
locality buys one of these kinds of
machines they are stuck with that vendor
and that vendor has them over a barrel
because almost inevitably the people who
work in the Registrar of Elections
Office don't have the expertise to be
able to maintain these systems to put in
the up the put in the patches which is
another concern by the way to do all the
things that need to be done to maintain
these systems and so some of these
maintenance contracts are pretty damned
expensive as I say they're screen-based
usually touchscreen although they're not
all touchscreen most originally were
paperless so you would go to the polling
place and in fact this is what it was
like in 2004 when I was a poll worker
people would go and they would vote on
these sequoia machines they would push
the vet make their various choices and
at the end you know it would show you a
summary screen which was all your
choices is and that's considered a lot
of people thought that was verifying by
the vote in other words a voter was
verifying his or her vote because it was
all shown on the summary screen yes
that's what and in fact election
officials have made this argument it
this isn't I mean we've all heard it the
League of Women Voters was making this
argument that yes the law requires that
people have to be able to verify that
vote and they do they can see it on the
screen once you see that's all what you
want you push press enter you know vote
and that's it you walk away now we all
know that just because something is
showing on the screen that doesn't mean
that that's what's inside the memory
but that simple obvious fact has escaped
an awful lot of people and there are
people who still resist that I mean it's
you wouldn't believe how difficult it is
sometimes to get these concepts across
to people who don't want to believe them
and who haven't had the technical
experience to say well of course so
these machines are still being used
paperless machines are still being used
in the state of Georgia they vote on
diebold paperless touchscreen machines
and Maryland there's a struggle as to
whether or not they're going to force
them out that's still not completely
resolved there's been a law that was
passed but it needs to get funded so and
then there are various other places now
in California paperless voting is no
longer legal but that was a struggle too
fortunately it happened a little while
ago I mean California for example has a
law which it's had since the since
before these machines came in which
requires a one-percent random manual
recount for every election and that was
basically done when optical scans came
in which I'll talk about in a minute so
with these paperless dr emachines what
they would basically do it in order to
satisfy this law as they would print out
cop you know basically do a dump at the
end of the day and count that by hand
where there was no paper so people just
didn't understand as I say with with
with some recent exceptions and the
recent exceptions are work that's been
done in California in a few other places
and mainly by computer scientists or
states that have brought in computer
scientists of techies to do this work
the testing and security has been
grossly inadequate I mean embarrassingly
so there are small number of vendors
nationally the software secret and I
don't have any of you been involved with
the copyright wars the digital money and
copyright act well anyway a few you know
the reason that downloading music people
can are getting threatened when they
download music because they're violating
the dish malayan copyright on that same
law is being it has been used to prevent
people from opening up these machines
and looking at them because the software
is copyrighted and people have been
concerned if they do this without some
sort of formal okay
but they could be guilty of a federal
felony yeah
I mean if its copyright protected if
there's some sort of and if there's some
sort of effort made to protect I mean
all has to be copyrighted but has to
have some sort of protection mechanism
for it and if you if you try to bypass
that protection mechanism then you could
be guilty of violating the digital
iniyum Copyright Act so another people
in very worried about looking at the
code because they don't want to go to
jail so and even in place in cases where
the code was made available by it being
escrowed frequently experts were not
allowed to look at it I mean there were
bibin court cases where people tried
where they've been questions about what
happened in this particular election
where it looks strange people have been
tried to get access to the code to check
the code and it's been very frustrating
nobody has ever been able to get access
to the code under one of these court
cases even though sometimes you might
say this is really questionable election
as I say they were mostly paperless most
of these theories were paperless not all
but most and then when when computer
people started getting involved in
amazing a fuss the first call was for
voter verified paper audit trails and we
naively thought at the time that if he
Justin he'll get paper attached these
machines then you'll be able to do a
recount or an audit and certainly for
myself I never in my wildest dreams
imagined that they would do such a
horrible job as they've done with
engineering these machines so they've
been retrofitted with what's called a
voter if I paper audit trail in most
places I say in in Georgia there isn't
even that and what these most of these
are is reel-to-reel thermal printed
paper now that's what you get it again
at a gas station and if you think about
the quality of the paper you know these
receipts you get if you leave them in
the Sun they can fade in a week
sometimes they're hard to read so these
are what these are the way these are
made there are major privacy concerns
sometimes because sometimes people can
see what's on these roles and and there
was in the votes are stored
consecutively so if you know the order
in which people went to vote you can on
a particular machine you can find out
how they voted this is there's a
reliability issue there have been cases
where the paper has been put in
backwards and it would didn't print
right or with Jam there's legibility
storage it has to be stored under the
right conditions otherwise of conveyed
and it's very hard to audit if you think
about how are you going to audit one of
these continuous roles it's not the way
you would design a system if you were
designing it for ease of auditing
because what you really want to do for
example you would you'd like to be able
to do is to sort vote cert ballots and
applause according to the vote and then
count each pile I mean that's an easy
way to do things the wood same way
people would count money or you know
when you're dealing with decks of cards
you sort things into piles new account
each pile and that can be very
transparent and have multiple people
looking at the piles multiple people
counting and doing all kinds of double
checks so so when you get this
continuous roll paper it's really hard
to audit and as I say I think was
engineering on the cheap they already
had these thermal printers in there
because of the beginning of the election
they were supposed to print out a zero
tape which so that there were no votes
stored in the machine which again is if
you think about trusting that there were
no votes stored in the machine because
the tape said there were no votes stored
in the machine so the other kind of
machines are what's called optical scan
now actually I'm being a little bit
sloppy here basically the optical
scanners you have you have a you have a
ballot which you fill out sort of like
when you take sats or various tests you
could fill in an oval or you connect a
broken line and and then those are
counted by scanner those are red and
countered by a scanner if you've done
any absentee if you voted absentee
around here you've almost certainly
voted on where these ballots they're
cheaper than touchscreen machines
because what you really want is you want
to have a scanner at the polling place
so the voter fills out the ballot feeds
the ballot into the scanner the scanner
will reject the ballot if there's any
over votes or it thinks there are over
votes that could be straight pencil
marks it might read things properly but
it will reject the ballot and again it
could warrant if there were under votes
but they don't typically don't warn but
if you have an over vote or if the
scanner can't read your ballot you
should be able to get a new ballots so
that's a way to protect against people
screwing up when they vote it's not a
complete protection but it's it's it's a
certainly a good one and and there as I
say that easy to audit and recount um
there are also also our systems like
when you do accent
voting your ballots are counted in a
central location and so if you vote
absentee you don't get this sort of this
feedback to make sure that it was okay
and of course it's difficult for blind
voters and people with certain kinds of
disabilities like mobility impairment to
vote on these but there are ways around
that in a particular the ways around
that are what's called ballot marking or
generating machines and the way these
machines work is they basically produce
a ballot which can then be counted using
a scanner but they don't store the
results the way a dr e does they just
mark about or print out a ballot and
they have all of or they can have all of
the advantages that these dr ehab
diaries' have which is that basically
once you've got a computer you can hook
it to you know you can have the audio
for people who are blind you can have
handheld input devices all you need is a
computer really you don't even need a
screen but you just need a computer
there and you need to have the
accessibility technology excuse me which
allows somebody to vote who's blind or
who has vision impairment you also they
also have ways in which people who have
mobility problems can vote so in fact
the machine called the automark is it it
you put an optical scan ballot into it
and then it works like a touchscreen
machine except it also has input devices
for people with disabilities and at the
end when you're ready to vote it just
marks your ballot and spits it out so if
you have vision you can you can verify
the ballot by looking at it so you have
the paper ballot which is going to be
counted if you're blind you there are
ways it can be verified over the
headphones now as someone's played out
recently well then you have to trust the
verification and of course you do have
to trust it but I think there's no way
that a blind person can can engage in
this without having some level of trust
and of course this kind of machine is
easy to check because you can have
sighted people vote like they're blind
and then check to make sure that it
marked it properly
popul ex is another kind of ballot
generating machine which prints out a
scannable ballot at the automark has
pretty good accessibility it's being
tested right now actually they'll be
report out very shortly on the
accessibility of the automark done by
the state of California but relative to
the dr ease my view is that it's almost
certainly much more accessible nothing
is perfect and none of these
technologies is ideal there's really no
perfect voting system we just have bad
or fairly good I think that's what we
have a choice between tactile ballots in
another way the blind voters can vote
and that's actually low-tech and cheap
it's been used basically you get a you
put the ballot inside a folder or an
envelope type of thing and it's got
holes for where the you can mark the
ballot and it's got raised information
on on the cover and you may have a
headset that goes with it too and so
that's the way in which blind voters can
vote independently and it can also be
used by people with some mobility
problems it's used in Rhode Island
Canada port for Peru Sierra Leone and so
on and then the vote pad is a new sister
relatively new system that again has a
ballot sleeve that fits over the ballot
so these are low-tech inexpensive ways
for people to vote who have vision
problems so any questions I mean
comments
why are you bringing up the different
kinds of low-tech ways for people with
disabilities to vote oh well one of the
reasons I talk a lot about voters with
disabilities is that the help america
vote act 2 which was passed in 2002
requires that by two thousand six or
seven all polling places have to have it
has to be possible for people with
disabilities to vote independently and
privately and this law has been used as
a mechanism for pushing a lot of these
dr es there have been lawsuits they've
been threats there are members of
disability rights community who believe
that only paperless voting machines are
fair because if you have paper it
discriminates against people who are
blind and I think sometimes blind people
buy into this because if they've never
had vision they don't appreciate how
important paper is at least that's the
opinion of Noah Runyon who was a blind
computer scientist but he lost his
vision as a teenager it's been a very
powerful tool to prevent the passage of
laws that would require only systems
that can be audited in other words the
automark which can be used by people who
are blind better than the dr es that are
out there it's better than they are it
produces a paper ballot can be audited
and yet there are groups that are
fighting it so this is where you get
into some of the politics of the
situation I love do that is that a
reasonable answer
so I wouldn't expect poll workers to
know much about computers and operating
systems and so on but it seems like the
Secretary of State's office could hire a
few computer scientists or some
consultants why is that not typically
done well it has been done in California
this year and Secretary of State bow and
ran on this and when she came in she
basically brought in computer scientists
she signed a contract with University of
California and when I said with some
exceptions the testings been lousy
there's been good testing that's been
done in California recently by the
California Secretary of State although
even there it was they didn't have
adequate amount of time and that wasn't
her fault it was because under the law
if she was going to decertify any system
and by the way she desertification
recertified them but she did certified
everything that was tested based on
these reports she had to do that by six
months before the next election which
was going to be I think the primary she
she basically had very little time to
between when she came into office and
when this deadline occurred and then the
vendors dragged their feet and they took
forever to produce the machines and saw
all the things they were required to
produce so when these people in fact one
vendor didn't even produce it quickly
enough that was the the vendor for Los
Angeles County and as of that as of
right now this is a miss dusty certified
period although their tests going on on
that system now my guess is it will be
tipped it will be conditionally
recertified but as of now it's
decertified because they didn't produce
it in enough time to do the testing but
if you read these reports and they're
fascinating reading every one of them
says we didn't have enough time but
they're the best things we've got and
they're all very they're all really
negative why did it take five years to
figure this out it didn't her
predecessor Kevin Shelly was was
actually educated by computer scientists
I would say when he first came in he's
because I I'm actually writing a book on
this was with Doug Jones and I've talked
to Shelly about this and he said he
thought that people like David Dillon
Stanford who's who had a pass a petition
on his website calling for voter
verified
paper audit trails not that people like
they were kind of you know off the wall
till he met them and started talking to
them and then realized that they were
raising really legitimate concerns and
so over time he became educated and did
you know he was never hostile but he was
you know didn't buy it he did a complete
flip and he he became really concerned
about the voting machines to the point
where he also decertified machines in
2004 and then conditionally recertified
them at one point he he was very worried
about diebold and he tried to get ahold
of the test results from diebold done by
the independent testing authority i
haven't gotten to testing yet i'm just
about to do that but basically they're
these tests that have to be done in
order to get this the so-called federal
certification or qualification he tried
to get copy of these reports and they
wouldn't give them to him they said our
customer is diebold not you secretary of
state of california and if you want
these reports you've got to go to d bold
and ask him forth he couldn't get him to
do that some kind of
something they can communicate with each
other so why is it California this stuff
well I went to the California is the
only state which has a good secretary of
state but basically well how do I get
into this there's this whole political
structure guys you to help me with this
yeah I'm reversing it with me
sometimes the Secretary of State is
actually a worker on campaign for one of
the parties and may have a vested
interest in outcome of votes well that's
one good point well I I think more more
often more more commonly the situation
is that you know for four years the
election officials a lot of Secretary of
State's we're just kind of going along
and doing their business but then in two
thousand when Florida happened all of a
sudden there was this new spotlight on
elections in the US and how would they
were conducted and I mean a lot of
election officials came in for you know
a lot of heat you know there was a lot
of criticism of them you know some of it
justified some of it not and a lot of
them kind of went into this you know
defensive mode of look you know I'm not
doing anything wrong I've always been
talking to these computer scientists
machines have well they've been talking
to their computer scientists you know
the people at the ith the people who
they consider to be technical experts
and it was a case of and has been a case
of well you know things have been just
fine and now you want us to you know
we've gotten all these high-tech systems
that you know work well and I don't have
to lug several hundred pounds of ballots
around and print out all this stuff and
deal with all these problems you know it
appears to work well you know why why
are you raising the stink you know
you're going to make us do all this work
for questionable on the gains and yes
you have a technical degree but you
haven't really done anything with
elections in the past so you don't
understand that half of the equation so
you know how are you qualified to
comment on this and that kind of mindset
of you know look things are going along
just fine that kind of inertia I think
has been you know as large of an
obstacle to reform as almost anything
else out there I would add to I mean the
reason I sort of got tongue-tied is that
there's this huge structure that's in
place involving secretaries of state and
local county officials
registrar of voters and they've been
some of the biggest obstacles so what
we're trying to do and there's you know
trying to untangle this and figure out
why is quite a challenge there are
certain players like our Doug Lewis who
started the election center who used to
be some kind of salesman doesn't have a
technical background who basically
created some other organization of
secretaries of state and then they went
and they created these independent
testing authorities which then we which
then tested these machines and and it's
all very closely knit in ways that I
don't totally understand i mean i think
i mean do you feel you totally
understand that it's it's it's very do
you i mean it's it's very convoluted but
i think there are two other things that
are going on one is certainly with the
local election officials and maybe to
some extent with secretaries of state
they feel there's a symbiotic
relationship between them and the
vendors so once they have committed to a
vendor they are dependent on that vendor
for all kinds of things and so they're
not going to go out and attack the
vendor because they had vendor can screw
them and in fact there's an interesting
illustration of that something that
happened to a guy named I am Sancho in
Florida who does have some technical
expertise he's the local he's the
Registrar of Voters for Leon County in
Florida and in fact in two thousand when
large numbers of people were stricken
from the voting rolls in Florida using
bad processes and in some ways people
felt trying to rig the election I on
actually went over the list and made
sure that everybody who was who was on
that list was he checked all the names
and so there was no problem in Leon
County because he fixed it he's very
conscientious person and so there were
only three possible machines to buy in
Florida when he had to go and buy
machines they're all d ari's they have
the only ones that were certified in the
state of Florida so he basically brought
in a computer scientist a techie to
check one of these machines diepold this
guy found all kinds of problems with it
so so iron went the Diebold and said
well are you going to fix the problems
and d both said forget it we're not
going to sell you the machines
then he tried to buy machines from the
other two vendors and first one said yes
and then no and then the second one said
yes and then no and he found himself
passed at the deadline we were supposed
to get these machines unable to buy any
machines because he's been blackballed
by the vendors at which point the floor
the second Florida said give us back the
money and not only that you better get
yourself some machines pretty quickly so
it I mean it finally got resolved but it
was a mess and so this is the kind of
hardball it's being played so he D ha
rehearsed he did floor it did Leon
County right so you know then you also
have the person who's in charge of
voting for the state of Maryland who's a
Democrat so this is not a Republican
Democrat thing exclusively at all so her
name is Linda limone and there was
recently a bit of a stink when it was
learned that diebold was using her
picture on the cover of some advertising
material there's for their databases of
registrar of registered voters she was
saying how much how great diebold is how
much marilyn lives there diebold and
she's the person in charge of voting and
Marilyn under linda limone has said
paperless buddy machines on deep old
were diepold you know even you go to
I've just mentioned the name to somebody
in the supermarket casually who I've
never known and people everyone's heard
of diebold and yet she swears up and
down the d bowls just fine and paper and
you don't need paper and she's very
hostile to paper so that's we're up
again and she was the president of this
organization of secretaries of state at
one point
I got all that right off the top of my
head okay so I tier's work were created
indirectly what oh sorry so secure
voting protocols allow the individual
voter to verify that his vote was
counted isn't this something that should
be pushed for so every person voting can
be should be able to verify that his
vote was counted I actually think that's
not quite the way to put it I would put
it that I think what you want to be able
to do is to verify that the right person
one that the person who was who was
determined to be the winner really was
the winner in some sense I don't care so
much what if my vote was correctly
counted or not I mean yes I care but
that's less important than the right
person one I mean my boat could be
correctly counted in other people's not
few people counted
few people check the dev vote was
correctly counter doesn't that work as
an audit so here's the way you can
defeat that if I'm going to cheat and on
you know we have no evidence that this
has happened but this is a way to defeat
it if I'm going to cheat I'm going to
change certain number of votes right
that means I'm going to change what so
so first you get this thing printed out
before it gets finalized so I'm if I'm
going to move from candidate a to beat
when someone votes for M going to say
they've ever be print out that they
voted for be now if they look say that's
wrong then for the next several votes
I'll get it right I won't make any
changes i'll repeat it and say a so the
second time it's right and I and I'll be
then I won't mess around for a while if
they don't say anything then when the
vote is finalized I'll internally put in
B and so now the paper ballot and the
internal vote match but they're wrong
and the problem is people often don't
check yes some people will check and but
this is the way around that if they
check and catch it I mean I'm not going
to change all and I'm just going to make
random when I if I'm going to rig an
election I'm going to do things randomly
so that you can't repeat what I've done
right as we all know random bugs are
harder to find I have a really stupid
question are there any countries in the
world that use voting machines besides
the United States yes about an India and
most countries use pieces of paper and
number two pencils if I as far as I know
well what what is the big deal in this
country of doing this really bad
technology whether a couple of answers
to that first of all we have very
complicated ballots in their hard to
count people don't want you know it
takes a long time they the guy deal for
a they're hard to count be Florida two
thousand and two thousand and two where
people the reaction to that is we can't
count paper right and and then you get
these election officials ago and get and
get the newest and the you know you
should be great meeting should be happy
we've got 20 21st century technology now
we've got this computerized voting
machines they never make a mistake
they've been federally certified and
this in the you know what what do you
need and so you've got this belief where
there shouldn't be believe you've got
this motive motivation which is
complicated ballots plus real screw-ups
that we've seen in elections even where
there are where there is paper of course
it was you have to ask what kind of
paper they were used in what kind of
machines they were using but people
don't ask that question and then you and
then it's not the case that other
countries always use paper and pencil
for example Canada does paper and pencil
for the national elections because it's
for Parliament and everybody votes for
only one candidate that's easy to count
but some of the municipal elections they
have played with voting machines because
they have more complicated ballots and
some of the Baltic countries are now
using Internet voting the Netherlands
has used internet voting the prevalence
is also experimented with electronic
voting machines there's there's a group
there that has has been very good at
fighting that but there are other
countries that are doing this an
Internet voting is even scarier
especially the way it's implemented in
these places some of them did I answer
your question by the way oh I'm not
happy with an erection okay so anyway
you have these ITA switch which was a oh
my god 20 minutes aren't so the testing
and the test results are sacred paid for
by the vendors I think I've gone through
a lot of this when they do the testing
the testing has been done by a checklist
so there's a list of requirements and
they go check check check check check
there is not they do not look for Trojan
horses and there's not it as they do not
do a code review in the sense that you
would do code you or I would do a code
review so here's an example of one of
the problems cyber which was one of the
I TAS in 2007 the New York Times
revealed that they were temporarily
barred from testing by the election
assistance Commission which had been
created by this law to oversee testing
and also the dispersal of funds they
were banned in 2006 but nobody was told
and almost seventy percent of the votes
in the 2006 midterm elections were on
machines that had been certified by
cyber
the EAC would not reviewed the reveal
why they abandon ish alee and it took
basically a lot of pressure from the New
York State Board of Elections senator
Feinstein and others to force this
information to be made public so we
currently have is secret code secret
testing secret test results no recounts
possible for paper or audits paperless
Diaries no national man meda Tory random
annual audit and in what I would like to
add to that is statistically significant
because what you really want to see
statistically significant audit so you
could do a random audit but it but the
problem is you want it you want the
order to be a function of how close the
election is so if it's very close you
have to audit more if it's not very
close you can get away with auditing
less and and there are mathematical ways
of doing this obviously when you start
talking about statistically significant
audits to election officials who don't
understand that you can't necessarily
trust the illustration of the bell on
the screen you've got problems so one of
the issues we have is just the
communication barrier between the
technical community and the election
officials most of which do not have a
technical background most of whom okay
so here's California and I've talked
about some of this the Secretary of
State created these teams the red team
to break into the machines the source
code review team the document review
team and accessibility review all of
this all these reports are available on
her website and if you're at all
interested I urge you at least read the
overview the summary reports it's it's
fascinating so three vendors eventually
complied basically what happened was
because there weren't adequate resources
in time they just selected various
voting systems by law to test so they
didn't not everything yet has been
tested yet but they selected one from
each of the major vendors so the 3ds
three major vendors complied eventually
with a lot of foot-dragging es es Ness
was solely that ain't get tested here
are the results the red team could break
into every system the software review
team found major security holes the
accessibility team found machines
difficult or impossible to use for
people with certain disabilities and the
document review team
found that the testing reports were
inadequate and documentation frequently
also incomplete and documentation was
inadequate so the reports are just
really damning and they're all they're
all there for you to read so here's a
photo of some of the problems with these
dr es mrs. ms kuzmic is the mother of
somebody who's been was involved with
fighting these machines she has tried to
vote as you see she's in a wheelchair
she's weak from a stroke the screen was
unresponsive to her top touch and she
had to become an assistive voter when
she was trying to vote on a machine
which was supposed to make it possible
for someone like her to vote
independently that's the irony of it and
as you'll see the setup lacks privacy
it's possible to see what she's doing
from a dirt from quite a distance in the
room and there's a look can you see that
all right she she has trouble reaching
the screen she's not blocking the spring
because she's sitting in a wheelchair so
the screen is visible for many places in
the room so she doesn't have a secret
ballot and the screen is not responsive
so that's one example of ways in which
these machines are not doing what
they're supposed to do the accessibility
report from the California top to bottom
review is very long and I think a lot of
people haven't read it because it's very
long but it's it has lots of photos in
the beginning or early on which show
much better than words what the problems
are with these machines this photo isn't
from there but there are other photos
that are for example phone is just
showing that the legs on these machine
on the stands for these machines are too
narrow for people wheelchairs to be able
to get close enough to vote and then the
second half of the report is full of
details about how they did those studies
and you can skip that so the report is
really much less overwhelming than it
appears so this is what we're up against
getting back to your comment the vendors
and many election officials denounce the
results John Tudor the Napa County
Registrar voters said is a direct quote
there has never been any question about
the accuracy or security of touchscreen
results for the five statewide elections
we've had conducting using these
machines
and he accused the Secretary of State of
eroding the public's confidence in
California's fair and accurate elections
for crafts any threatened to sue so
basically and this is what she did at
midnight on the very last day she could
do this bow and decertified all the
tested systems and the untested es es
Neston and conditionally recertified all
but the esns system and here are some of
the conditions she she required for
recertification only one dr e / polling
place and that's because members the
disability rights community complain
that they needed to have a dr e to vote
it is more of a political decision than
anything else at least five votes must
be cast on a single dr e for privacy
protection all votes cast on a dr e must
be manually counted using the voter
verified paper audit trails and the
jurisdictions must reinstall all the
software and firmware i just basically
sync software on all the machines any
post-election auditing requirements
should be paid for by the vendors all
the vendors were required to produce
plans for hardening their equipment to
protect against the security
vulnerabilities that were uncovered and
there are a bunch of other requirements
as well now this requirement to harden
their equipment that's going to be very
challenging one because there have been
a number of studies for example of
diebold machines which have said the
fundamental design of basically the
hardware these machines is flawed and
you've got completely redesigned the
machine in order to get something which
is reasonably secure so i don't know how
they're going to do that so should i go
on so I maybe should have talked about
this earlier the help america vote act
is what basically got a lot of this
going it became law in 2002 after floor
the Florida midterm election it
authorized almost four billion dollars
over several years to replace punch card
and lever machines it had absolutely no
technical requirements although it did
have this requirement for people
disabilities to be able to vote
privately and independently and it also
required a statewide computerized
database of registered voters and I
haven't
about that database particularly that's
something which is sort of going under
the radar for a lot of people but that's
going to be another major problem I
think in the two thousand eight election
because the same folks who are buying
the DRS are buying the databases and
they don't understand again if you're
going to have a secure database the
kinds of conditions that you need to
satisfy such as you know limiting
limiting access maintaining decent audit
trails and so on and so forth not doing
major mergers or purges not doing not
merging various lists so I think they're
going to be some meltdowns with you
they've already been problems with these
databases and they're going to be more
because in the 2008 presidential
election i think is the first time we're
going to see them used why everywhere
under really stressed conditions you
know most most places don't test these
systems under election day types
conditions so rush Holt is a congressman
from New Jersey who ever since 2003 has
been trying to reform the help america
vote act to require the ability to have
a voter verified paper on a trail again
originally he and number of us thought
that would solve the problem I think at
this point most people think given how
bad these voter verified paper audit
trails are we need something stronger
than that but he's been pushing
legislation and there is still a bill
before the house called HR 8 11 which
which would have initially it's been
totally messed up but even in its messed
up version I think it's better than the
status quo but it would initially have
eliminated paperless voting machines
eliminated vendor payments for testing
that's still in there eliminated secret
testing that's still in there require
random annual audits for every election
and it would have eliminated secret code
now has any of you ever worked at
Microsoft can you imagine the setting up
a red flag from microsoft it did and
hold did he first talked about
eliminating secret code for voting
machines in 2003 and it wasn't until it
looked like this bill might actually
pass that Microsoft got involved a few
months ago and they basically trashed
this requirement
and in fact they not only were they
concerned about their own software so
for example just to give you something
to chew on the Diebold the place where
they store election results and so on
and depot their database they use the
gems database I'm the Jets database and
anyone who knows about Microsoft
databases which I didn't really know
much about but I've since learned Jets
database is it isn't really ancient
database that Microsoft urges people not
to use for anything that is important
it's on their website I mean Microsoft
I'm not trashing Microsoft when I say
this i mean you know this is an old
database they have better data bases but
the database that's used in deep old is
the Jets database do I have that right
about the Jets tent yeah well that's
another thing which the two thousand the
most recent incarnation of false Bills
had which was I thought very good it
required that all all voter ID paper
audit trails maintain privacy of the
voter and that they have our archival
paper so what this would have done would
have been to eliminate the reel-to-reel
vpats because the paper certainly was
not archival the thermal printed paper
and by storing the votes consecutively
there was a privacy concern so so this
was a roundabout way of trying to
eliminate these Diaries essentially and
some election some votes some some
activists were upset with the bill
because it doesn't cough the elimination
of dr ease whereas a number of election
officials and vendors are upset with the
bill because i think it does or did so
right now the current status of HR 8 11
is it's looks like it's not going
anywhere I mean that's my own personal
view even though it looked a few months
ago as if it was going to pass the house
because it had enough sponsors to pass
but basically the number two person in
the house Steny Hoyer has done a lot of
work he was one of the co-authors of the
what cope co-authors of Hava he's a big
advocate for disability rights and he
never particularly liked this and he had
a lot to do with undermining Microsoft
started because Microsoft stopped the
momentum by getting involved and then
there had to be all these negotiations
to make microsoft happy and what came
out of that wasn't too bad because at
the current version requires ndas it
limits who get it does not eliminate
secret code but it does say people have
to be allowed to look at it under
certain conditions and even though they
they can be forced to sign a
nondisclosure agreement the
non-disclosure agreement has limitations
if you find serious problems or if
there's legal issues and so on you can
reveal what you've uncovered so I
actually think it's not too bad I think
it's okay I'm surprised they did such a
good job yeah
people make sense right what does it
many require tables to the demonstrate
security
impression I don't know um when sorry
the question was deep old makes a TMS
what does a bank due to equipment to
make dble demonstrate that these
machines are secure I mean I know that
they're not secure I know that there
have been cases where they've been
messed with but I don't know what banks
require does anybody that's a really
good question i'll have to find that out
do you know no don't know but what
happened with deep old is deep old was I
mean people bought a company a voting
machine company that's how they got into
the business I mean they had their ATM
business and they decided to get into
the voting machine business so they it's
not as if depot wouldn't designed this
thing the way these theories from
scratch the way they are now they
basically took a design which this
company had had which wasn't very good
so this is one of the issue that's going
on right now well it's probably not
going on right now in florida sarasota
county florida in the 2006 election
Christine Jennings lost to Vern Buchanan
by 369 votes they were voting on
paperless touchscreen machines there was
an under vote of 18,000 412 in other
words 18,400 12 people went to vote and
did not vote for the House of
Representatives race now this looks a
little bit suspicious when you compare
it to the absentee ballot under vote
which was 2.5 / 7 2.57 and and some of
it as opposed to what happened on
Election Day in an early voting so what
most of us think is that there was a
software bug I mean some people were
saying it was a usability issue that the
way the screen was set up people some of
them just missed the race on the screen
and it's possible but this is such a
large under vote I just find it hard to
believe that that's all it was but
nobody's been able to really look at the
soft and I mentioned dan wallach because
he's going to be speaking here on Monday
and Dan was involved with this in the
sense that he was going to be Jennings
expert witness to look at the software
if they could get the software and they
tried to get the software they went to
court and they tried to get it
and the judge wouldn't let him look at
it so here's more reason to think to be
suspicious of what happened Jennings
received almost 7,000 more votes in
Buchanan in Sarasota County and if you
in this last point about the under vote
for balance voted Democratic and
Republican that was work done by David
Dillon somebody else where they actually
looked at under they felt that if you
look at a particular pattern of votes
election you'll see that under votes are
more likely to occur for ballots which
was straight Democratic ballots which
could suggest there was some rigging
involved but you know if you're going to
rig an election would you do it by
having undervotes that's kind of an
obvious thing there are more subtle ways
to rig an election although you might
say well hey no one's looking at in
anyway so why not doing two votes so I
don't know I mean I don't know what
happened now there was a study done of
floor of floor in Florida and there were
some good security people looking at the
software but they didn't look at all of
it and these are the conclusions they
made that software fault did not cause
the under vote but they don't know if it
was a bad design but again they didn't
look at all of it and there there are
people like Dan Wallach who think that
they didn't do that there's still good
reason to believe that there was a
software problem but what a lot of
people miss when this report came out
they said oh well you see they didn't
find any problems with the software they
found huge problems of the software huge
problems they couldn't prove that any
software problems caused the under vote
in sarasota but they found that these
machines have may have major security
flaws and that that you could inject a
malicious virus into the voting machine
software and in fact that seems to be
the case that's also the case for the
sequoia machines i mean that seems to be
typical that you can inject viruses into
these because they have removable
devices that you can use to transport a
virus you read that yeah five minutes
and of course there could have been a
virus inserted which wasn't uncovered we
although that's possible so other
security threats again this is something
which I think a lot of election
officials don't appreciate that the
greatest security threat to any computer
system is the insider threat but again
talking I'm still talking about the
machines in Sarasota they had poor
password protection and yet again yet
again we had this comment that fixing
the security vulnerabilities will be
very hard because a lot of security
vulnerabilities are fundamental to the
architecture of these systems so I'm
just get this carteret county in 2004
over 4,500 votes were lost and they were
lost because they had early voting on a
paperless dr e and the counter or maybe
the capacity of the dr e was such that
it could not record all the votes so
once the number got above 1,300 roughly
all the votes went into a black hole and
disappeared gone poof gone no paper
nothing so that was that would have been
bad enough but in fact there was a race
namely for the agricultural commissioner
of state where the difference between
the two leading candidates was less than
the number of missing of lost votes so
this is an example of how the law does
not respond to these problems so first
there was an effort made to have a
revote just for the agricultural
commissioner position in Carteret County
the courts threw that out then there was
an effort to hold the election statewide
for that one position and that was
thrown up by the courts two and one of
the arguments that was used by the
courts in both cases I believe was that
you don't know that the same people will
go to vote for the Reeve oates who voted
initially now whether or not that's a
legitimate argument you know I can't say
that the problem is that we have laws
that that assume that things work right
for voting and we know that they don't
necessarily work right yes so to be fair
to the the courts in that particular
case the
the state board of elections themselves
were trying to kind of game the system a
bit in that the initial countywide
recount they ordered was not just for
the the people you know where they knew
that person had lost their votes because
it was sequential it was they know oh
well anyone who voted from here all lost
it instead of just those people they
said well those people plus anyone who
just didn't happen to vote that day can
come on back and vote and the court said
no that's that's not going to fly and
then the statewide election had a
similar kind of twist to it and how the
State Board was trying to structure it
and the judge also shot that down so
that there might have existed some some
sort of solution that was palatable you
know according to law but not everyone
was trying to find that all right so
Justin was it your North Carolina at the
time right yeah so but but I that's and
thank you that's interesting point but
it still as a fact that there was no
that I think that the law doesn't match
the situation the law has not caught up
with these machines and and I and what I
would like to see happen is to make it
such a tall doesn't have to what we do
we do have to have audit and we have to
have audits because if you just produce
machine if you have voting systems that
can be audited if you have the best
voting systems in the world and they can
be audited and you don't do audits it
doesn't matter if the audits aren't
going to be done you could still read it
or it could still be changed by software
bugs I mean software bugs can change an
outcome very easily so we need to get
laws changed and this is an interesting
example Fairfax County Virginia is
another interesting case where this
would volved Republicans there was
malfunctioning machines they were taken
out and and fixed and then put back into
service in the middle of an election and
this caused some people to get a little
nervous because they didn't know what
was going on and so the Fairfax County
Republican sued alleging election
irregularities and the case was
dismissed after the county elections
board promised not to do it again
and I'm trying actually to find I'm shy
I've got to call in to someone one of
the Fairfax County Republicans to try to
get more details on what happened with
that case so I think I'd better stop
here so yes
so this is all incredibly depressing but
so what do you recommend that
individuals do besides you know
contacting our congresspeople well one
thing i'd recommend doing is getting i
mean it's it's interesting to work as a
poll worker I think you can learn a lot
that way but and they someone was saying
about the people who work as poll
workers it's important to have technical
people in there because these there are
these machines although given what's
happening right now in California I
don't know how many of you know there's
only going to be one dr e polling place
i would say push to get federal
legislation passed and and be on top of
your local election officials they need
they need to hear from people who are
technical and they need to understand
that they have to do things right I mean
Santa Clara County you know doesn't have
optical scan system yet as far as I know
didn't one so I think you know try to
change things here I'm curious if you
had jimmy carter or those people who go
out and and observe elections in foreign
countries would they basically say the
United States is not democratic as a
result of this kind of thing or are they
not sophisticated enough to they haven't
really gotten seriously involved with
this there were a couple of reports at
Carter did one with Ford and one with
Baker where they did call for whatever
if I paper audit trails but they also
called for Real ID which is a whole
nother issue voter ID rather I don't
know how much Carter really I don't know
so Jimmy Carter was here a few years ago
and somebody asked him this question and
he said there are many reasons why
elections in the US would not be
certified by the Carter organization one
of which is the party system which
constrains who can run who gets on the
ballot and so on so he didn't really
address the technical issues but as far
as he's concerned we don't have
free and fair elections in this country
well voter registration of course is a
way to disenfranchise people and just a
little interesting tidbit i got from
doing this from writing this book is
this is a bit off the wall irrelevant
but the whole felon disenfranchisement
laws that you know you florida had in
two thousand that was a big deal people
taken off list because they were
supposedly former felons those laws
really were introduced after the civil
war in the south as a way to
disenfranchise former slaves and there
are some really fascinating quotes like
the late 1800s from some of the state
legislatures Mississippi Georgia places
like that where they basically say we're
doing this to disenfranchise these
