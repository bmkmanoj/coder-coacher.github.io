middle of us from All India Institute of
Medical Sciences New Delhi India he's a
consultant psychiatrist in the
department of psychiatry and also
professor there and he's also an avid
adventure traveler so I guess it was a
perfect match when he got an opportunity
to do research
I mean int Arctica for three five five
months and today he's going to tell us
the story of those three point five
months and you know what living there
was like and how a little bit of history
of Indian presence you know in in in our
talk sorry in talked ago so without
further ado dr. Kanellis thank you Bruno
and thanks and welcome to all of you for
being here and I must also express my
thanks to Google for giving me this
opportunity to make my presentation here
it is said that Antarctica plays tricks
on the mind and I realized only five
minutes ago when I we were testing this
audio-visual presentation and I found
that the dates here are totally
erroneous this should have read 10th
November 2007 to 13th April 2008 that's
the period which I spent in Antarctica
last summer you all know that Antarctica
lies in the southern hemisphere so what
when you have your winters here
Antarctica goes through a summer period
and that's the period I spent there as
part of the summer team of the 27th
Indian Antarctic expedition and I would
like to share my experiences there which
I think some of you will like and get
motivated to visit this God forsaken
continent on this planet I am also
thankful to the Google for encouraging
me to put a blog there in fact I got
this dubious credit of maintaining a
live blog from Antarctica by an Indian
scientist this is the name of the blog
where I was making very act
increase and where my son cush was
helping me out putting those entries
into the blog somehow it got a bit
popular and a lot of people have made a
lot of hits there this is India as the
printer has said that I come from India
and it's not that I'm trying to upgrade
your geography but there is a point in
showing this slide and I'm also trying
to show you this slide where I want you
to highlight on South Africa South
America and Australia along with India
and Tibet and Himalayas many of you will
know that why I am trying to show this
slide any quick and intelligent answer
to this question yes yes yes there has
been a theory called the theory of super
Guangdong island continent it is said
that 200 million years ago there was a
huge continent in that part of the world
which was which has been named now as
the super Gondwanaland continent and it
is hypothesized that India South America
South Africa and Australia they got
separated from that super hormonal and
continent about 40 million years ago and
Indian plate moved to its present for
the position in 20 million years ago and
collided with the Eurasian Plate giving
rise to Himalayan and Himalayas and the
table so that is the idea that all these
countries and the continent of Australia
they owe its presence now to this great
supercontinent gondwana island continent
and now the remaining portion is is the
continent of Antarctica Antarctica is
unique for its various characteristics I
will be just highlighting in next slide
but it also has South Pole there this is
the area of South Pole and when I went
there then I found out that there are
not only one South Pole there were four
kind of South Poles
it's very difficult how the physicists
they they come out with various kind of
things some I got and understood some I
did not but it was interesting to know
there were four or south poles this is
the ceremonial South Pole where anybody
who is making an expedition to South
Pole reaches here once he reaches he or
she wishes there that it is considered
that he has or ship into South Pole USA
has it's a very famous station there by
name of Amundsen and Scott station this
is this has been named after the two
great explorers of early 19th century
early 20th century sorry now what are
the physical characteristics of
Antarctica this is the as I said the
southernmost continent which overlays
South Pole and there is a huge Antarctic
Circle which and which kind of encircles
Antarctica continent because during the
winter period there is a the entire area
of continent of Antarctica gets a frozen
and gets mingled with the frozen ocean
at that time it's a area almost doubles
up though even at fourteen point four
square million square kilometer this is
the fifth large fifth largest continent
but then when it gets attached with the
frozen ocean
frozen Antarctic Ocean then this mass
almost doubles up and then it is larger
than the US and Australia combined
together and tactical has also been
described in all kind of superlatives
coldest driest windiest highest
continent it's average height is 1.6
kilometer which is one mile and the
largest desert on the earth this is
totally uninhabited area no human had
lived there at least so far the
exhibition's has said they have not
found any kind of fossils of human
beings
but the life is stills is present there
in form of penguins seals lichens the
primitive organisms other than penguins
and seals though this Antarctica the
continent remained uninhabited but it's
not that the humans they lost interest
in Antarctica in fact Antarctica had
existed the name has existed even before
it was discovered it was described in
the writings of great philosophers like
Aristotle
who believed that and that as compared
to Arctic in the northern hemisphere
there has to be a comparable continent
in the southern hemisphere which they
gave as oppose opposed to Arctic as
Antarctic so even before it was
discovered Antarctica had mentioned
mentioned in the olden are texts in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries when
people discovered Antarctica various
countries thought that it was a great
continent for doing a number of their
military and the scientific discovery
studies and lot of countries at that
time when they did exploration they also
made claims on the Antarctic territories
and at that time countries like United
Kingdom New Zealand France Norway
Australia they made their planes and
then Chile and Argentina also joined
this claims in Factor these claims were
conflicting because there were a lot of
superimposition of territorial claims
and in fact in the early 20th century
they were not of heated the arguments
between the countries it had also led to
the burning of their stations and then
the need arose for having some kind of
treaty over the Antarctic claims the
treaty came into force in 1958 of 1959
at the initiative of United Nations but
before that also India under the
leadership of Giovanna narrow our first
Prime Minister had made raised its
concerned over the Antarctic conflicts
and during the formulation of the
Antarctic Treaty USA had played a very
important role in this treaty being
formed finally and though it did not
make any territorial claim in the
Antarctic Treaty but it always resulted
reserves its right to make any claim in
case there was some kind of exploitation
in the subsequent future India made its
entering to the Antarctic Club in 1981
when it sent its first expedition and in
1983 it was admitted into this Antarctic
Treaty consultative meeting and now
there are 45 countries the the main aim
of the treaties to support the
scientific research and protect the
environment it also prohibits military
activities mineral mining and any form
of commercial commercial exploitation
though a lot of people believe that fire
that the aim of a lot of research going
on there is also about the possible
commercial exploitation in subsequent
decades and with the oil prices now
hitting the roof lot of countries will
be again renewing their interest in
making some kind of oil and natural gas
exploitation it makes sense because lot
of countries which have separated from
Antarctica for example South Africa
which is rich in minerals
India's Godavari basin which is which
which was linked with Antarctica is also
rich in oil and gas so there is quite a
huge potential for Antarctica to have
huge reserves of oil and gas there
currently Antarctica has presence by 27
countries for scientific research and as
I said that though there there are no
permanent residents there but during
this summertime the population of
Antarctica reaches as much as 4000 so in
such a huge continent not more than
4,000 people live even during this
summer time the
largest station is the the USS station
McMurdo which during the summertime
almost looked like a mining town with as
much as thousand visitors including
scientists and the family's winter
population reduces to just 800 and the
scientific teams they are engaged in
research in comprising of biology
medicine geology oceanography and these
atmospheric sciences our ozone layer
incidentally was first of all discovered
over the Antarctic continent a very
important edge of research currently is
about the global warming as the major
preoccupation of all of us India got
involved as I said in the Antarctica in
1956 and 58 when it raised its concern
in the United Nations about the
conflicts going on there and our our
late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a
very vicious lady she did number of
firsts into the in the Indian history
and she initiated the Indian expedition
to Antarctic in 1979 which culminated
into the first expedition 1981 and since
then India has been sending
uninterruptedly its petition every year
the third expedition 1983 was the first
station first expedition which spent
night I mean the winter we had also
there so that get that gained us the
entry into the Antarctic Treaty
consultative meeting and any country
which maintains summer as well as winter
camps or stations is considered to have
I mean becomes eligible for entry into
the 80cm in 1981 India established its
first decision called the Chenango 3
it's after the name of a very famous and
huge glacier called mango 3 in the
Himalayas and in 1989 India established
its second station mathri when
that duction young goat they started
sinking into the frozen ice because it
was built on the continental shelf now
India is becoming more ambitious and we
are in the process of establishing our
third station at at another area of
Antarctica called artment last man Hills
which will be named as party and next
one or two years it will become
functional as we said that in the
Antarctica is the dry gas the coldest
the most isolated desert and to be earth
why people make polar explorations they
do for a number of reasons
as I said that the scientific research
is one criteria but people have made the
solo expeditions in solo means that not
by the country's initiative but by their
own initiative great explorers like the
Scout Shackleton Amundsen and they did
for a number of reasons heroism bravery
scientific discovery 1:4 and also fought
lot of their the ego and recognition and
for their own fame during earlier times
it did bring economic gains because it
was a area which was rich with the
whales and the seals and people came
there for their oil and for their meat
products
the current preoccupation as I learned
in the u.s. is about the space missions
there I think there already there is a
booking started about the space mission
things and people will get more and more
interested NASA is also doing a lot of
research on the health aspects of space
mission and if you try to see the
the consequences of such emissions on
the health you find lot of similarity
between the polar exploration polar
explorations with the space missions
these are that there are three important
problems whenever one makes this kind of
expeditions one is the stress of going
to such expeditions then isolation as I
said earlier that in spite of its a huge
size Antarctica just has 800 people
during the wintertime and maybe 4,000
during the summertime so it leads to lot
of problems of isolation and also of the
sensory deprivation during the winter
period when it's all dark everywhere
outside the station
it becomes you almost become visually
blind if you try to step outside into
the open area so all these three things
make a huge impact on somebody's
physical as well as mental health it
also creates doubts in anybody's mind
that whether he or she is competent or
capable enough to make this kind of
exploration or mission and that it leads
to fear this also leads to lot of denial
because when you are committed to make
certain mission complete you tend to
denied the day-to-day problems whether
they are related to your motivation or
to your health issues the mantra for
having it's successful transition is to
learn to say I am NOT okay when you are
not okay so what a lot of people get
into problems when they are not alright
they would tend to say I am okay and it
leads to lot of problems not in such
expeditions but also in expeditions to
places like Himalayas or Mount Everest's
Antarctica has been described as a
natural laboratory I'm because I'm a
health worker I'm focusing next couple
of slides on the health issues it is
considered as a natural reporter to
study effects on health
and it's not only the physical health
but also the mental health lot of
research has been going on on the mental
health aspects of fantatic living
because all this impacts the human
performances during isolation in extreme
conditions which I have already said
earlier and because Antarctica is a
natural laboratory that survival is
impossible for any unprotected
individual who is not well equipped its
environment is extremely dangerous
because of its climate the temperature
goes to minus 50 during the winter minus
50 Celsius which in Fahrenheit would be
more than or less than minus hundred and
not easily accessible now currently the
Antarctica is entered polar nights and
during this period no ship can reach
there no flights can reach or come out
from Antarctica so whosoever is now
living in Antarctica about 800 people
they are just living there waiting for
the next ship or the flight to arrive
there in the month of November and but
it's not that it's always so scary it's
not that the Antarctica leads to all the
negative effects and consequences there
are a lot of positive characteristics of
polar environment people who visit
Antarctica or who have been to
Antarctica on or on to such missions
they they experience a lot of positive
gains after they have completed they
completed their mission in form of
natural grandeur excitement
improvisations and they also feel that
during the Antarctic stay they they are
less they are in a less restricted
environment they have more free time and
of course they are away from all the
daily hassles of living in the within
the families or home life so this is all
very positive aspects in fact I talk to
lot of people while I was there and my
group was of the summer members as well
as the previous winter members and
almost every member felt that this kind
of expedition was the most wonderful
expedition or the most wonderful
experience of his or her lifetime
in fact I was fortunate to have lot of
army people with me because they were
there because of their technical
expertise and though they had done lot
of other kind of adventures into the
Himalayas but they found that the inte
Artic experience itself was the most
wonderful it's not that everybody who
visits Antarctica is suited for the
Antarctic mission or for any kind of
expedition or mission over the last
20-30 years
the research has shown that there are
certain characteristics which make a
person ideal for such kind of
expeditions for short expedition person
is any person having high motivation to
achieve with a high sense of adventure
and low susceptibility to anxiety will
be an ideal person for this kind of
expedition but it's not that whosoever
goes to Antarctica it lives there only
for three to five months as I did people
who go there now like people who are
already there they would be spending as
much as fifteen months there so I the
team I left in Antarctica at mat 3 had
reached there in the month of November
with me would be only able to come out
of Antarctica in the month of February
so by the time they reach home it will
be 15 months so people who can survive
these 15 months they are also positive I
mean there are some characteristics that
they should be mostly stable of course
they should not be easily easy really
prone to anxiety or depression and many
times it is said that people who are
extrovert and more friendly and having
all those kind of extroverted traits
would be better adapted but it's not
true people who are the people who are
suited for a long expedition are the
ones who are not greatly over
extroverted or over assertive because
they should be
members they should be willing they
should be ready for all kind of group
dynamics which many times over assertive
and extroverted people do not conform to
they should be sensitive to - to the to
the need of others and should not get
bored easily you have a question yeah
please
people the question is that the why age
above the age of 30 people have said
that by the time person is thirty
percent has gone through lot of
experiences which hones his skills for
better adaptation and we also believe as
the psychiatrist that by the age of 30
most of the personality characteristics
would have been well formed because the
personality is still evolving and by
that time one would know that what kind
of personality I I I have there are
number a number of coping and preventive
measures described one is very important
thing is that whosoever goes there the
one reassuring thing is that adaptation
to any expedition it's a natural
mechanism you don't have to do anything
you have to be just as natural as
possible and the definition comes very
automatically it's a physiological
process but at the same time you can't
go there or any expedition uninformed
you have to be well informed about the
conditions you have to you have to be
prepared for that and you should a very
important thing which i found for myself
also about maintaining a journal when i
wanted to update my blog I was making
lot of observations I was writing daily
my journal and that had increased my
sense of observation a number of things
which I normally would not have paid
attention to I was paying attention to
because I wanted to vote in my diary so
that also became a very important piece
of I mean part of my coping there lot of
people and when they are stressed
they take recourse in to tobacco as well
as alcohol these are best avoided in any
kind of expedition and a lot of bad
consequences or negative consequences
has been described in Antarctica or any
other expeditions because of these
things and as last but not the least is
avoiding denial when one is in any kind
of expedition people tend to deny their
problems they tend to deny their
sufferings because they feel that if
they admit to their suffering other
people will be stressed they don't want
to show their weakness they think that
if you are having a pain or some kind of
incapacity you will not be considered as
a fit person but once you finally become
a sick or incapacitated it's not only
that you become disabled you also make
for more people disabled because they
are then involved in looking after you
this was the project which sorry you
have a question I will be coming to that
during when I describe my life in
Matthew but any leisure activities which
are possible during those kind of during
that kind of environment and what you
are most familiar with which may be just
an indoor activity or if the outdoor
activity permits you some outdoor
activity also for example going for
daily walks observing the nature
environment photography writing journal
or some indoor games all those kind of
things my sorry my project was about the
longitudinal assessment of impact of
Antarctica in on the psychological
health adaptation and cognitive
functioning because so far the indian
research had had concentrated on the
short term studies but i had submitted
the project for doing the long term work
though i have come here but the medical
officer on duty there now he is
regularly making assessments and
observations we expect to find some
answers to the problems like weather the
day and long days and prom nights they
Makani make an impact because during the
summertime it's 24 hours and it doesn't
set for next 2 4 5 months or when it's
winter time you do you do not do not see
the Sun at all or whether what has been
described as the third-quarter phenomena
that when you have already been through
half of your expedition it's ok it's ok
that whether the third quarter is more
troublesome because it has been seen
that after the half of the period is
over a lot of people then they get
depressed that it's only half beard
which is over and they have still
another six months to spend so that
third quarter phenomena is described as
a period of great stress before I left
in November since it was my first visit
to Antarctica I am saying first because
lot of people go to Antarctica
repeatedly I had many members during my
teen who were going to the Antarctica
for 2nd or 3rd time the leader of our
team had already spent three winters in
Antarctica he was going for the 4th
winter and as I said that each winter
means spending 15 months there so we
were all given some kind of induction
and training in an area called Ollie
which is in the garwal district of
western Himalayas at about 10,000 feet
this training was conducted by the
mountaineering mountaineering and the
skiing Institute of indo-tibetan border
police a very dedicated team we were
very fortunate to have lot of trained
trainers and the emphasis was on group
living because all of us are from
different institutions different
background
and also about the snow and glacier
walking and a lot of rescue procedures
these are my team members and we are
here with the trainers and the lady whom
we see in this slide on the right-hand
upper corner she's twice Mount Everest a
very expert trainer these are some of
the equipments and implements we were
made familiar with a lot of kind of
ropes I did not know that so many kinds
of ropes existed and in fact my
nightmare of tying the various knots
there I do not know how many kind of
knots we were explained and I would get
my knots wrong every time I try to
replicate fortunately there was no
examination after the course other wood
has miserably fill there but it was it
was fun a lot of new things we learnt
during this this is the the
demonstration about the rope climbing
and how to climb up and coming down and
it was a lot of fun also this is a very
famous and sacred Nanda Devi peak at
22,000 feet that is the place where you
see the Magnificent Nanda Devi in it all
its splendor when we were there the the
climate was changing from summer to
winter and I saw Nanda Devi in various
its various forms and shoes we left in
November I was the fortunate that I was
included in the team which was flying
all the event to Antarctica
normally the expedition they they go by
ship which takes about four to six weeks
but I was in the team which was flying
all the way and we took our flight from
town called Bombay or Mumbai right into
Cape Town from where we took our flight
directly for Antarctica this is the
aeroplane the Aleutian 76 its saturation
cargo aeroplane comparable to see the
herculean you
Hercules s port c-130 huge aeroplane
which takes all kind of military
equipment tanks and armored vehicles and
huge cargos the scene at the airport was
very chaotic because there were 55
people from different nationalities and
everybody was very excited hyper
excitable nervous anxious and this was
the flight which was operated by a
organization called an Antarctic
logistic international and it was
operating this stuff right in - and it's
worthwhile to have a look at this flight
when it lands there
this was the short by which has occurred
which had come to receive us at the
airbase this airbase is bordered over
Air Base which is about 10 kilometres
away from the bantha station where we
were heading to starting on the
whenever you see salt is
here and I says it landed onto this uh
blue ice and my greatest fear while I
was in the aircraft was my stepping out
into the bruising frozen blue eyes
i I I did not want to slip and fall down
there and break my hip and weed and
establish a record of being transported
back into the same flight back to Cape
Town because I had never bought on the
frozen blue ice I had my walked onto the
glacier as part of my training and
otherwise also but frozen blue ice
walking was a different ball game
altogether but everything went fine
finally and this is the very harmless
looking like illusion 76 after it has
been parked this is the inside of
illusion 76 I was I had gone there with
lot of expectation but I was were
thoroughly disappointed there were wires
hanging from every side the seats were
very rudimentary a lot of chaos inside
there were boxes piled everywhere and I
was totally disappointed and the anxiety
nervousness was they were increasing to
my disappointment yes this one these are
the toilets for the foreign flight news
but behind those are the boxes and
cartons whichever for for these stations
math3 is the station the Indian station
where I had lived and I would next few
slides I will be talking to you about my
living there
the infected basically involved doing
galley duties I will explain a little
while from now going for outside
excursion falling ship and Duma that's
the story I will just highlight later
some then making a lot of celebrations
and establishing
the earth station that was the remit of
our expedition what galley duties the
word perhaps has come from the naval
ships but in the station galley duty
means that maintaining general
cleanliness and the station and since
nothing is available there except the
snow and the fresh air you have to make
everything available they are including
the drinking water because it's all snow
and frozen ice you have to maintain the
pump house the generators for the power
boiler room Selfridge and toilet firing
though the station all these stations
which are in Antarctica that very
well-equipped and like I say that in
Delhi with where we have a lot of
problems with water and powers at times
this station had 24 hour uninterrupted
water and power supply
unlike daily where I come from and
central centrally heated station this is
the station this is the station where
the winter members they stay very well
maintained and this is the area where
this summer team members surge they do
only some the summer team had consisted
of about 35 people and so these are the
facilities for there is difference
between the two but they were also quite
comfortable this is inside of the
mattress station the lounge with some of
my team members there this is the module
where I was stationed the blue kind of
module which had shown in the previous
slide these are the bunk our beds and a
work table with of course with heating
and the power supply equipped this is
our dining area the scientific 'its with
the experiments are conducted the
outdoor as well as indoor these are some
of the young scientists this expedition
had lot of young scientists around the
age of 30 and these are some of them
sir and many of the experiments they
continue during the winter period also
then of course they are inside indoors
gali duty means that we help the cook
for preparing food and all of us have to
do it turn by turn this is the scientist
and the Army colonel frying jalebis
there is a very popular Indian sweet
these round things they are trying for
the dinner this is the our toilet module
and it's a hot water supply and those
cleanliness is part of our daily routine
this is these are the toilets these are
the now old toilets now they have been
currently they are being replaced by the
new toilet ones but these are all iron
steel frame kind of pilots where because
in Antarctica you cannot leave behind
any solid human disposal
disposal so all the solid the human
waste is burnt into fine sterile ash to
be transported back to India where it is
finally immersed
so every morning people are assigned
duty to put these toilets on firing
under heavy temperatures and the all
solid waste human waste is converted
into ash initially the thought was quite
repulsive when we were being trained but
once we went there we found it was
totally sanitized and totally sterile
process so there was not no big issue
about this a lot of people somebody
asked me about the leisure time
activities there were lot of indoor
facilities available for example this is
a very popular Indian Bowl we call it
carom board playing cards a small gem
with treadmill lot of singing dancing
partying there are they say all
religious
temple did you know that India is a
country of multi religions and the multi
faith and our team had representation
from all the four major religions that
is Hindu Christians Muslim and Sikh all
the four religions were represented
there and we had a lot of religious
activities or celebrations also there
periodically I had said also about
tobacco and alcohol being a great or
favorite pastime lot of people consumed
alcohol very regularly some of them get
into periodic problems another part of
the daily living was going for daily a
lot of excursions outside there were lot
of to explore and many times we took the
help of this is no vehicle a German
vehicle by name of Pistenbully or many
times during the summer time we had the
facilities of helicopters we were there
or mostly we walked and the walk was
also most energizing and we went for
long walks and you could see the snow
and ice in its various forms I did not
know that snow and ice could have so
many kind of forms I was told that as
much as 10 15 20 kind of wish snow and
ice you could you could name there and
especially and from within the
Antarctica and once you are in the
entity quotient then it was the mind
boggling very beautiful and the yes
bicycles not in the station where I was
living but yes we did have the scooter
it's no scooter but I am sure that the
McMurdo Station of us must be having
bicycles also it's a huge station like a
mining town so I'm sure that bicycles
must be there and the anti rocks and the
all kind of rocks they were so
interesting in fact I was fortunate to
have few geologists with me
and they would tell the history and the
characteristics of each rock I mean to
me everything look the stone but once
they explained it looked like that the
the rocks can tell their own stories and
it was very interesting and of course
the glacier and the continental ice this
is the polar sheet or the polar is polar
sheet and if we walked on this polar
sheet all the way south for 2,000
kilometers we would have reached the
South Pole but it's not so easy walking
to South Pole is a very adventurous kind
of thing and leads purest Lakes you
could find on earth absolutely pristine
blue and and so or aspiring this is a
small peak which we had named as
shivling many of you who are slightly
familiar with the Hindu religion we have
a God by name of Shiva and the symbol of
which is the the different portion of
phallus so that is what the Lingam is we
had named this small rock as the ship
length which has also been accepted in
the Antarctic gadget these are some of
the slides of and this kind of caves you
come across gliding through those caves
is so magnificent - so good experience
and so good looking I mean it's a
photograph is delight if you go to
Antarctica at the photographer's delight
you see these icicles almost looks like
a he we are in a stage yes sorry sorry
oh yeah
camera is because during the summertime
most of the cameras would work very well
I was carrying I had to spend some money
on buying a good camera Canon digital
SLR and it gave me no problem and
because they were facility of the power
supply so I could charge the batteries
regularly so most of the cameras would
function at 0 and -5 minus 10
but yes whenever we took some shots we
immediately put it close to our body but
more than the camera it the fingers
which I bother you because once you have
to take off your gloves because they are
thick polar gloves so you are only left
with the inner layer but within five
minutes the the finger starts getting
frozen and that takes longer time to to
recover than the battery the rocks are
too they get so much of meeting by the
by the event that to all you see all
kind of such formations all over
Antarctica again very beautiful sight
and photographic sight it's a it's not
only a desert and those kind of things
which I had already said it's a huge
open land and I used to feel that it
would be nightmare for any person having
the fear of open spaces called Agra
phobia wherever you see the the horizon
all around you
is just the flat white surface nothing
else to disrupt or interrupt the your
vision we have lot of celebrations I
said birthdays and wedding anniversary
celebrations lot of national festival
celebrations and this is Krishna
Christmas celebration
I had said that I followed the story of
Shiv and Ouma
these are Shiv and Ouma whom I followed
their this is the pair of south polar
Skua I named them shell and Ouma and I
followed their their meeting meeting and
it was a very fascinating experience
which I have described in detail in the
blog laying their eggs and the I was
totally fascinated by the by their nest
and obviously it is very understandable
because in Antartica you don't have
trees so they don't have to eat twigs or
the leaves to build their nest they just
find some kind of shallow depression on
to the ground where they just built
their nest and since most of the
Antarctica is devoid of human presence
so they don't have any fear from the
humans also so it was just on one such
site that it they made their or built
their nest and laid eggs it's almost the
size of a duck egg and it's really they
are fiercely protective any time you try
to approach this is the shot which I
took while it was almost coming with a
great speed shouting screaming yelling
at me and almost about to attack me in
fact I had the presence of mind to
rotate my camera on top of my head
otherwise it would have certainly would
have hit me on my eyes or face but the
the etching of the egg and the scene
this small chick on the christmas day
was my biggest Christmas grift which I
could have had in Antartica
it was a Mane magnificent side I saw the
chick chick chicks growing up one chick
died for unfortunately which had made me
very sad I followed the growth of this
chick till I left the station in
mid-february
and later I followed from my friends
there that finally this chick grew up
and left Antarctica in the beginning of
April only which is also a very
interesting story that how they form
into a group and they and how the young
chick first of all practices flying
practices flying against the wind and
practices flying for long hours during
the daytime and finally when there is a
small group then they all leave a
station together I our expedition was
also had the limit of establishing the
Earth's the station though we had the
satellite connection but which is only
very brief but now Indian station is
equipped with the 24-hour satellite
connection internet connection is now
available to the station 24 hours this
is the final shape of the Estes station
as I said that penguins and seal they
make their appearance this is the and
one species of penguins in Antarctica
called Italy again a very interesting
story of Adly a story of hard work
devotion and sacrifice it's a really
hard trending story if you read if you
ever got the portion to read about this
word and this is the again the nest of
this earthly penguin this is the another
form of life the Lycans the primitive
plants which are they become active
during the summer time this is the seal
lot of there are three four kind of
seals which are found in Antarctica
elephant seal the tiger seal most common
being the Weddell seal this is the whale
I could only see this splash of a whale
because it was too far away so this was
the best shot to could I could have of
the whale this is a lot of you must have
read the poem of Coleridge where it he
describes about the the the draft
Mariner and how the albatross makes or
gets comes to him this is the
Albatross a kind of petrol and one of
the largest words in the world with a
wingspan of as much as two meters more
than six feet many of you are also
familiar with a phrase called booby trap
I knew about the phrase booby trap but I
did not know that the booby trap the
phrase comes from this bird called booby
and the different the phrase has become
because the the people on the ship in
the ancient I mean in the olden times
they would lay a very simple trap and
wear this simple and the bird which get
trapped which of course it became their
regular meal there but this this is the
bird which is responsible for this
phrase booby trap again a very
magnificent sight of penguins and they
are in the group and in a group where
they are they are so cute so lovely when
they are fighting or chasing each other
or they are they are so fearless they
would almost almost come close to you
almost an arm's length from you and this
is another species the bigger one the
emperor penguins if you recall the the
documentary march of penguins this these
are they are the heroes of that
documentary once they are in the colony
it's thousands of penguins emperor
penguins at one side they don't build
any nests but they come and huddled
together protecting each other from the
winter and also laying eggs and rearing
the chicken again a very interesting
story about the devotion to their family
life my return was there by the ship
called the called mV emerald sea it was
a Russian ship which is now owned by a
griever tycoon a huge ship of twenty-two
thousand tons and the most fascinating
part of my ship journey was the was
seeing the ocean in its various form
first and then refreezing once again
during the later part of March month of
March and again each stage of its
melting or free freezing is given a name
and the most beautiful sunset I have
seen in Antarctica never robbed before
and then you see all kind of glaciers or
the icebergs I did not know that
icebergs also have a kind of glossary
and so many icebergs we could identify
there this is the area where India is
going to build its third station last
man last man Hills lastly about the
global-warming before I left for
Antarctica I thought that I knew little
bit about global warming because I
thought that global warming only means
more carbon dioxide depletion of ozone
layer or more floods or unseasonal rains
but global warming is a very complex and
very controversial issue
I realize only reaching Antarctica and
reading more on global warming
in fact Antarctica also gave me a
percentage to update my knowledge on
number of these things people said that
perhaps many of these events are part of
the natural cycle because even in the
earlier times when you are not using so
much of gas and oil the earth climate
went through the Isis test twice but two
recent events in Antarctica that is the
sinking of a cruise ship exploring
Antarctic waters in the month of October
2007 and the breaking of huge ma ice
mass in the Peninsular Antarctica and it
was said that the rise in Antarctic
temperatures by 0.5 Celsius every decade
had led to the rise in sea levels by 3
centimeters every decade and these kind
of events were leading to lot of
problems in Antarctica that is breaking
of ice mass
and also icebergs posing a threat to the
ships there but it's not just this much
only global warm this is the sinking of
this ship Explorer and this the some
small photograph of the breakup of that
huge as ice mass but the climate change
also has a lot of ethics involved in it
it's not just the heat waves in storms
and floods tropical diseases or shortage
of food and safe drinking water but it
also leads to or will lead to
large-scale human migration where death
question of ethics come into being
because the future generation though
they would become richer because of our
efforts but they will also suffer the
most many people will die before their
death we are children
climate change will prevent birth of
children who otherwise would have been
born and leading to collapse of human
population so the ethics means that
there are some cost to be paid to get
benefits later and these cost could be
in very simple terms traveling less and
having better insulated homes living in
less lavish life eating less meat and
the benefits would be better lives for
future generations
they will not suffer from the spread of
deserts from the loss of their homes to
rising seas and floods for means and
general impoverishment of the nature
thank you very much for your patient
listening and I again thank Pranay and
Google for giving me this opportunity
for making this presentation if there is
time and you people are having some
questions I would be delighted to answer
some of your questions thank you very
much
please do they are huge ships like the
ship yeah that why the ship sank with a
when it was hit by a small high school
the though these ships are very huge
like this ship I was traveling was
18,000 tons but in the Antarctic Ocean
they are not as stable as we think that
they are whenever a small iceberg hits
the ship it leaves to some kind of
impact leading to either visible crack
or some inside crack which makes this
ship very unstable and once it gets
destabilized it's very difficult to to
shift it back to its normal position the
center of gravity shifts very rapidly
during such times yes that
yeah that's a good question weather trap
during wintering time people just stay
indoors or they also winter outside
though most of the time they would stay
indoors they would not go for long
excursions but many of the labs are not
always part of the main stations
so there's they are elsewhere or certain
experiments have to be done outside for
example metrological experimentations
that they do go out but then they are
fully covered they are having four or
five layers and not they are not allowed
to go singly they have to report to the
station that they are going out they are
expected back in so much of time and
they must carry the walkie talkie set
with them so they do god but only for
necessary experimentations or
photographing because that's the time
when you got you you tend to see a lot
of Aurora's which is a beautiful display
of all those positrons and electrons and
so you can't avoid that so you go do
duval for photography also just say you
had how to reach antarctica for not as a
tourist yes how to go for a four six to
twelve months I'm sure that the u.s.
Antarctic mission would be having some
kind of guidelines where the scientists
can submit a project and once it gets
the permission to carry out that project
in Antarctica I'm sure scientists can go
there for example when I wanted to when
I got motivated to go to Antarctica in
fact the part of the credit goes to my
wife Chitra who is sitting here I had
done an expedition to Tibet for Kailash
moon Kailash monster / expedition in
2006 and when I came back she asked me
that do you have done this expedition
what next visit Antarctica so I thought
she was
joking but I didn't know that her joke
would become a reality and so I had to
submit a project to to the National
Antarctic Research Center of Ministry of
Science in India
and once they approved the project then
everything became easy so I'm sure that
in the same kind of mechanism must be
existing here but you also ask me about
the tourism yes people can no no I am
just saying for the information that
just you can also visit Antarctica as a
tourist there was some hand for me yeah
sorry how do you wear the tourist now
there are many tourist agencies which
are operating flights as well as the
ship cruise which leaves from Argentina
Chile as well as from Cape Town where
you can go for up to two to three weeks
so it's very expensive but it is
possible to go there
yes he's stuck indoors and outdoors
if it's looking at Nilka Hall yes yeah
you your question is about a cigarette
and alcohol oh yes you can drink inside
but for smoking yes there are designated
areas where you can smoke which which
are mostly outside the station but
during the wintertime there is a
designated area within math tree also
where you could smoke yes thank you very
much thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
