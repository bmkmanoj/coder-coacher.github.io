for this next one a pair of Googlers
ibrahim el far and Jason our bond
actually both work for me that they knew
you there were no special privileges
getting them in this event they were all
still voted for but these are the two
people that if they do have a bad
presentation I can actually do something
about it so just saying no no pressure
we're continuing our theme of a browser
automation and I think this is going to
be completely different from from a lot
of the other discussions but I heard
sauce the sauce guy Adam say something
about bite that's part of what we're
going to demo here and maybe sauce will
pick it up and do something with it
because we have we have open source this
so I think Abraham is going to start
Ibraheem actually kind of followed me we
were in Florida for a little while and
then we both went to Microsoft and then
I reload me into Microsoft I followed
you and that's true yeah you went to
Microsoft first and then I followed you
and then I went to Google and you
followed me and eventually we're gonna
have to stop this stuff people will talk
and and Jason our bond is also another
former Microsoft e become googler and I
don't know maybe we I should stop saying
that no I said former Microsoft is when
your when your badge the joke around
Google is you don't know you're fired
until you come to work and your badge
doesn't work that's when you know okay
let's welcome our new speakers
hello I'm gonna check after working
through some technical yeah let me do
this your boss connection oh yeah
he's good welcome to the cloud right
excellent fantastic told me to click so
hi my name is ibrahim I've been at
Google for about a year and a half I'm a
manager of a team of about until
recently of seven or eight people who
basically just do test tools we're going
to talk about two of these tools today
and I worked closely with Jason Jason is
the visionary and the man behind most of
these tools so basically if you dislike
any of the ideas just blame him in
implementation itself yes need so i
figured though i will want to start with
the silent presentation reflecting on
some of the things that we saw yesterday
so anyway just to give one just engage a
little bit what kind of audience we have
here so how many of you do UI testing by
aqua how many of you do javascript like
write JavaScript on a daily basis Oh
excellent interesting I always found it
interesting by the way that a lot of the
people who deal with web testing on a
daily basis just don't really deal
directly with the with the JavaScript
how many of you have deal with manual
testers like work with manual testers on
a daily basis well how many of you have
filed bugs how many of you have spent a
whole lot of time talking to developers
about convincing them that you need to
fix those bugs how many of you had the
opposite experience of just you know
developers just fixed it on a regular
basis Oh fantastic of course tony has it
right so so there's always a place for
testers can you happen with the clicking
please yes sir yeah so that's why I
brought in Jason he's basically my mic
like her well not funny I pretty much
so um crowdsourcing was mentioned
yesterday and as a powerful sort of way
that actually scales in terms of
bringing the crowd to test instead of
like hiring a dedicated set of testers
and that is especially true for consumer
applications so I'm not going to pretend
that this works for enterprise
applications I'm not going to pretend
that this works for operating systems or
even for backend stuff but what we found
is for consumer applications with user
with you a lot of UI stuff this works
pretty well so there's always a place
for highly skilled bug hunters who are
actually working for organizations whose
core business is testing actually even
if companies large companies like
Microsoft or Google or etc decide one
day that were redundant you know James
worker is right and we're you know test
is dead and we're not going to have any
more testers I think there's always
going to be a place for testers in
organizations which core business model
is about testing we'll get into that a
little bit later in the presentation so
you can argue keep argument who needs to
do it or you can argue about who where
we need to do it in the United States or
in India and China or in your in your
company versus outside of your company
but that's really not the point on we
didn't practice any of this by them so
oh yeah this is not very good here so
really the work is not going away if you
know basically what we need is we still
need to test your software we need to do
it in an exploratory way or a scripted
way it doesn't matter but it still needs
to be done bugs needs to be filed and
why are you not clicking because you
don't make the click noise we talked
about the click noise but I mean how are
we going to go through this
okay I mean you're just not doing your
job I'm doing it I'm just doing a review
level three point no I mean what are you
talking about what you know the work
that's not going away and okay thank you
so so um I'm already done with this
bullets so it's like wow I can quit um
so the work is not going away um and I'm
just gonna do with myself please
management but but we don't really um
here's the thing i don't know if you
ever hung out with a manual tester if
you've been one when i first joined
microsoft a long time ago and i was
hired as a test engineer which
technically meant that I you know click
buttons and life was a kind of miserable
actually I had to you know set up my
machine install a whole lot of software
and even in today's world with the you
know everything being well training to
become and go into the cloud you still
have to install a lot of tools and spend
a lot of time learning about these tools
so click you also tend to spend a lot of
time away from the application the thing
about exploratory testers and manual
testers is really they need to spend as
much time as possible just playing with
the app and they don't they keep
switching a context a lot bigger keep
switching and saying oh I need to
actually create a test case in the test
case manager really I mean seriously I
need to enter a data like who's the
author of this test what's the title of
this test and here are the steps of this
test and by the way here's how you
execute this test really I mean come on
we're in 2011 already something like
that yeah so that's the other job that
Jason is therefore click on my slides
and shake is that I'm the editor oh yeah
that's right thanks so also you know if
another another really terrible thing
another terrible experience about this
is you know we go ahead and we know that
some test cases are
you know going to fail or pass but we
give them two tests because we haven't
gotten chance especially in the UI
testing world we haven't got a chance to
automate it so what we do is we give
them a whole bunch of spreadsheets and
say go ahead and just run through a
rough time with them and that's really
unfortunate because what that means
instead of them exploring new
functionality they're stuck essentially
repeating the same thing over and over
again and then often we hire an army of
them just to can cover things like you
know all sorts of machine browser
combinations you know they manual
testers these days also still spend a
whole lot of time testing a whole lot of
stuff that can be found by a machine and
so really test case managers bug filing
systems and record playback software
which is really central to the life of a
manual tester I was going to say it just
needs to die but what I really mean is
just needs to be invisible it needs to
be invisible so that the user of of the
software who can be a tester or the
developer of the software or the manual
tester who is that dedicated manual
tester anyone can actually you know we
only have 30 minutes so so for us when
we talk about you know at least in our
team when we talk about the crowd we
actually don't really mean just people
we mean a crowd of people and a crowd of
machines and it's really just the best
of both worlds so this is the standard
Oh testing is labor intensive so let's
go on to the next slide actually so I'm
going to go through so i'm going to go
through just a bunch of the tools a tool
work that we've been owing by it stands
for browser integrated test environment
it's at the client portions are already
open source you can go and take a look
at them and got we're going to first
take a look at the record and playback
feature when I internal Google emails
popping up
oh yeah hopefully oh oh just try to
ignore that well let's show up on video
yeah oh crap alright but I quit all
notifiers then oh well it's only a job
that pays the bills so so keep in mind
so the first the first thing that we
wanted to do is to make sure that
testers just don't really especially
exploratory testers don't have to do a
lot of work to sort of enter metadata
about the test cases and enough
information to for these test cases to
be repeated so one of those core
components is really a traditional kind
of traditionally boring a piece of
testing called Rick Porter Air Corps
playback say except we do it in a pretty
cool way so what you do is all you need
is to install an extension but is really
just a Chrome extension at least day and
what you do is just you start you know
go ahead and play with your with your
application in this case just you know
open up the google page and then as you
go through this application essentially
what bite is doing is recording
everything that you're doing and without
necessarily writing any of the code
what's being recorded is both i don't
know if you can see this very well from
where you're sitting but you can see
both essentially JavaScript ish kind of
code that's being generated but also and
kind of an plain English representation
of the test case depending on who's
using this tool they might want to take
a look at something a little bit more
friendly than JavaScript as a
representation of your test case you can
do things like also add validation so as
for example your go ahead and play
playing with your app you can say for
example that these are you
expectations about what to find on a
certain page like some things are a must
some things are to be ignored some
things are optional and then also as you
are exploring your software we are
taking essentially a snapshot or a
screenshot of off the application step
by step so this way basically now you
have three ways of looking at your test
case later you can either look at the
JavaScript code and run that you can
look at the English plain English
representation of the off the test or
you can look at a sequence of
screenshots so um but here's the thing
so again how many of you on a daily
basis do UI testing and think that you
are testing is kind of easy to break or
brittle yeah it's like so I've never
really worked too much on UI testing
until recently but ever you know I
worked very closely with people who did
and it's amazing I mean a lot of the
time that people spend in UI testing is
about essentially while re-implementing
a whole lot of these test cases and what
we're finding is if you have the rights
to a set of tools it's actually far less
expensive far cheaper if you have the
right to a set of tools to simply
rerecord all the test cases than to
actually develop you know fix that fixed
fixed test cases or even develop them
from scratch just our experience we'll
talk about that some more so for example
in this particular tool what we do is if
your test case fails what we allow you
to do is buy a simple click this dialog
says this step failed finding element
blah and it actually sorry there's it
actually highlights that element and
what you do is once you click on that
element then you are the new element in
the page that's equivalent it kind of
fixes it automatically and it finds all
the other instances of that element in
the same test case
and sort of fixes fixes that as well so
what that means is if someone messes
with your divs or with elements on the
page it's not the end of the world you
can simply just say oh here's the search
here's the new search button as opposed
to and then it will find all the
instances of the old search button and
basically replace them with a new search
button as an example so that's basically
the record playback portion is basically
record playback plus the ability to fix
broken tests reasonably easy gladwin
thing real quick yes thank you the cool
thing that we also will get a little bit
later but is that we're generating
JavaScript right we're not generating
Java that needs to be like compiled
local and deployed to test machines and
stuff when you turn these test cases
right we just save them automatically in
the cloud right so which is saved to a
server so you never have to worry about
file management a local store or
anything and the core thing is this
stuff actually runs on Chrome OS so it
runs entirely in the browser right which
one of the main motivating factors for
this whole project so that's kind of a
cool how many of you when I was going
through the screenshots saw a test case
or the name of the test case or anything
like that actually in the cloud
basically as you have been as of using
this tool test cases have basically
being created so in other words you can
basically come back later and say go to
your test case manager that you plug
into this tool and review the test cases
that you've gone through and those kind
of a requirement because James wrote
these other octomom books write about
testing and exploratory testing and the
problem is like people go do this
exploratory testing there's no record of
what they did right there's no there's
no way to reproduce this stuff that's
not funny is James oh there's no way to
reproduce the stuff right there's no
artifacts of what you did there's no way
to share that information so and then
the cool another cool thing is now that
they have done the exploratory work
these have turned essentially into the
gresham tests and you can just keep
running them over and again and we'll
talk about it some more later but
basically we can also run them anywhere
and potentially on other browsers as
well not just on Chrome or on the
particular operating system that the
exploratory tester happens to be running
on
the relationship going to survive I'm
just saying you keep interacting me oh
you told me to okay so the other thing
these pictures here like the inspiration
was actually when James came to Google
originally he had this like a BS mock
slide the people thought was real of
like all these like bug overlay
information on top of visual studio and
all this kind of stuff and I saw it
realized it was a fake mock and I want
to build the same thing for the browser
right so dude the one time you have
control of the machine but just like you
know when testers is going through this
they don't have any context they don't
know what test cases are gonna be
running don't know what bug has been
filed before and all that kind of stuff
so the idea was just like pilots modern
pilot to do with a lot of information
information overload we wanted to do a
heads-up display kind of similarly like
in the browser right so we're trying to
take the bugs the test case data the
debug data the code coverage data and
put that an overlay it right on the
application while you're testing it to
avoid kind of this flipping between
applications and different webpages and
stuff like that that's one of the ways
actually we one of the ways that tester
spend a lot of time switching context is
going back and forth between their bug
tracking system as well and their
application so the other feature of bite
is bite but finding where again without
leaving your application and having
installed only an extension with
basically no nothing else on your
clients you're able to also file bugs so
for example this is an example from maps
so you just go to google maps for
example and look for seattle pizza um
you can get a bunch of results and then
you go ahead and click on one of those
results and let's say that you found a
problem with this particular results so
all you got to do is click on report a
bug and then this is very
application-specific so what often what
we do is we take a bite and essentially
with a little bit of customization
customized for a particular domain in
this instance it's maps so if you look
it's kind of hard to read but a pop-up
comes out says are you is this a problem
with the map tile
inaccurate or incorrect search results
is this longer missing directions what
is this it just starts asking questions
and then ask you please point me where
in the if its vision if it's a visual
problem where is the problem with the UI
please point me where in the UI is the
problem and then of course you can
choose it's kind of hard to see but it
says the problem i'm reporting is not
related to the UI if it's not a
necessarily you I problem so let's say
you click on the this element that's
highlighted and now in essence pretty
much everything that you've that you
need has already been kind of generated
for you these include things like the
screenshots that of everything that
you've done money you know everything
that you've done so far until you say
until you're about to follow the bug you
can you know including screenshots
including a sort of all sorts of useful
representations of the test case the
code that is required to actually run
the test case in a browser in JavaScript
and then of course the capability of
there's a bucketeer for capability of
actually playing this replaying what you
just did and then once your review this
information if you satisfy you to a
bucket and you're done you haven't left
your application you see your
application but you're still able to
also file bugs go ahead some short
before right yeah should I show you I
was going to fall dance again um so the
Stargate will worked up other stuff so
the cool thing is happening so this is
this is like the internal bug filing
tool now on maps for inter like if
you're on google corpnet and used to get
dog food bugs from everybody right
everybody's using maps these bugs were
horrible right there like repro steps
from like program managers and marketing
people and even from testers it's like
that aren't on the application right the
funny thing if you use maps the URL
never changes right so people say like
here's the repro URL it snaps taut
google com right they go thank you right
so what we're all sitting in the
background here is reflecting a bunch of
information from the Dom its application
specific again lights up on maps that
includes all the debug URLs and all that
kind of context that the developers in
the eat they'll be talking like what the
information you need and we just add it
and scrape it all the Dhamma it didn't
a little bit of JavaScript the third
thing that's going on here is that when
people have this extension installed
inside of Google it doesn't record
anything it's just sitting there
silently right but when you're on maps
google com this little thing starts
recording right as you're doing stuff so
when you go to like file the bug it
actually has the script of everything
you've done on maps google com right in
that domain so like so you know so the
actual the developers and they when they
get to repro it's not like hey i'm on
this page and there's this bug they can
actually click a link and then we pull
that javascript down to their version of
the extension right it actually like
goes to maps google com and then if they
were browser on for 15 minutes it will
just play the entire 15 minutes sequence
of what that user did they may not even
know what the interesting thing they did
to induce the error state one of the
Holy Grails I think that you know I've
been looking for as a developer actually
is being able to look at it you know go
to my issue tracking or bug tracking
system and just be able to look at the
bug and just click a play button and
just for that you know for the bug to be
replayed and this is actually a reality
for a lot of scenarios right now because
of things such as you were a lot a
button well yeah because it's a few
requests okay let's not deviate off
script dude again saw your password yeah
you know how many characters it is to
now oh yeah it's well it's the search
space so um the other thing that manual
testers also and by the way I say the
word I used the word manual testers like
loosely I mean could be a dedicated
tester again or could be like just a
user could be really anyone who is
essentially volunteered to test software
so one of the issues that they also deal
with is having to essentially file a
whole lot of duplicate bugs or not
knowing where where most of the bugs are
because as you know when there's an area
where there's a plenty of bugs there's
probably a whole lot more bugs in that
area so you want to go ahead and attack
that or vice versa have no one has filed
any bugs in that area you want to go and
figure that out so let's go back to the
map scenario and sometimes it's even
lonely right in your tester you're alone
with your application you don't know
what else has been going on going on
there yeah and that's what I feel like
Alta slowly I'm with you so again if you
want to know what you want to report a
bug before you report about you can also
see all the bugs that are related to the
application that you're seeing right now
and then if you activate overlay what
will happen is you actually will see on
a highlight of this is where other
people have filed bugs in this
application you can click on that and
find out all someone actually already
filed a bug in this particular on this
particular element and it's probably the
same issue so can in on the spot say
okay this is not a bug if you're a
developer for example or you can say
okay this is resolved now it's no longer
an issue you can add a comment if you're
for example a colleague and say oh yeah
I've seen this too but you've missed a
couple of points maybe I just want to
add a comment so it's a actually turns
really testing from the solitary
activity into a very arm so sorta
actually thinking about maybe people
just don't like me right yeah I don't
think this this list of bugs here right
isn't just all the bugs for maps google
com this is actually like we do relevant
stuff here right so as you're browsing
like the URL does change we'd like the
filter we do some smart venturing and
stuff
relevance and we also look at the the
the content of the Dom to the filtering
do the smart query so it's like there's
there's thousands of these things
although we pretend there aren't any
bugs and maps and but we pick the right
set that are probably going to be
relevant for the map tiles your viewing
right now click yeah now it's yellow
yeah that's exciting yes so um then just
just like James shirt all right so
that's basically there's sort of the
major features of bite and again
exciting to me that it's really exciting
stuff because really it eliminated sort
of like hides most of the tools away
from you especially test case management
and black filing systems and lets you
focus a lot more on testing and because
of that last feature it also helps sort
of you be a little bit more aware of
what's going on elsewhere without you
having to go back to the issue tracking
software and figuring out o has someone
else filed a bug or someone else tested
that area of the application so that's
but that takes care of and those tools
are really necessary if you want to go
for crowdsourcing where you really have
testers who are not necessarily
dedicated one hundred percent of the
time or don't have time to be trained
and to you know on specialized tools etc
but that's only half of the puzzle the
other piece of this puzzle is really
stuff that testers do that really
machine's ought to be doing the
particular example that we've started
working with is really just about layout
you know we had an army of testers
dedicated to figuring out whether layout
problems change over you know that there
are layers problems introduced over time
for given applications and really the
problem with that is most of the time
you really don't have layout problems
most of the time you know for ninety
percent of the cases ninety-five percent
of the cases you're just verifying that
there is no absolutely no problem but
it's a little bit more about
about just doing stuff that a machine
can do or should be doing are they by
dye testing people here no yes hello
Marhaba so that was hello in Arabic and
as you may have heard I spoke from right
to left but that's the bite I stuff
actually is a prime example of the kind
of thing we're talking about it's like
most of the time either you can resolve
these things automatically and then for
a small percent of the time you need you
sort of a human decision to figure out
what's going on so bots is about that
let's just jump into demo so in but what
you do is you say okay here's my
application I care about I say I care
about for example ww.com because I test
that stuff you also care about a whole
bunch of other applications and then you
give it to you give it to bots and then
bots takes care of things magically as
far as you're concerned you don't really
necessarily know what exactly bots does
all you know is it's trying to figure
out whether in this case it's testing
for layout problems but it could be
testing for by their problems it could
be testing for very basic accessibility
problems that are can be detected only
you know by without using the semantics
of the application and then over time
and you know what what happens is BOTS
comes up with results you probably can't
really see it here but what it's doing
here is comparing the stable dev and
canary versions of Chrome but you could
imagine also at comparing Internet
Explorer versus chrome versus Firefox
and what it's doing is telling us
whether there are layout problems that
were introduced in the stable version
versus the dev version versus the canary
version
and so when you drill down what you get
is sort of like a before and after sort
of picture and the tool allows you to
diff between sort of pages where the
layout changed in this case and it does
highlight of the diff and what you can
do then is click on the area that
changed and actually see the elements
that changed that says it may sound a
bit counterintuitive we say you know
most of the stuff is already taken care
of by automation but actually it's not
not really and so a lot of a lot of
folks this is that does not come for
free and that's sort of the hope of or
the underlying sort of theme of bot what
we found is if if if the stuff does not
require humans for the most part if the
stuff can be done by machines then ought
to be really free you ought to get this
for free and so layout problems are an
example of that and that's kind of what
BOTS does so far so this was just a very
quick overview of some of the tools work
but how does everything sort of fit
together in the grander scheme of things
Jason it does maybe I don't know oh you
gonna call me the Octomom of test tools
yeah I was gonna say yeah that was the
one thing we practiced actually and he
didn't do it yeah yeah can i still say
it no it's not cool alright he is the
optimum of testing tools by the way
because you know most of these tools are
just his range of just you know I do
tend to faint when I present so just
watch out retro
it's not pretty okay um yeah so let's go
to all right so and when we're coming on
these BOTS again the one of the premise
is that Google iterates very quickly
right like we push new builds and new
products like you know hourly sometimes
minute Lee that's like the new term the
hot term but we ship so often right the
reality though is that there's very few
cl's that's part of our whole quality
kind of attack right is small number of
changes in or eight very quickly deploy
test and flight all these things right
so the problem is test can't keep up but
the reality is these apps don't change
that much right google com comics the
same as does a few years ago don't quote
me but like the apps don't change a
whole lot build to build but you need
but what male tests are doing all the
time is they're scanning these web pages
doing these like sweets of regression
tasks and that yeah still looks the same
as it did yesterday or an hour ago or a
minute ago right and it's just a
complete waste of time and it we've
really talented bright people doing this
kind of ridiculous work all the time the
idea of bots the main value out of bots
is that it just scans it it's very
similar to what what kevin was talking
about right was actually kind of cool
right like a so we're not totally like
both crazy we're independently crazy
right and the cool thing is that if the
stuff doesn't change you don't have to
look at it that's the key premise of the
whole thing so you let the bots do this
crazy work and diffing all the time
right and you only route the stuff that
require a human brain to evaluate
because the stuff doesn't change so
let's get on to the interesting stuff
okay thanks um so this slide I created
like an hour ago I don't know how it'll
go we'll see what it so I want to see
like subjective what James and Alberto
were saying doomsday whatever yesterday
um teste hasn't evolved right like and i
started at microsoft i started working
on IE for which I guess states me now I
guess I'm an old man now but we're going
to IE for and guess what i found myself
working on Chrome doing this like a
Casillas the same damn thing oh and
actually people were doing you more
manual work at Google and they were a
Microsoft right and I was like I thought
this was the cloud in the future right
and I've landed in the middle of I don't
know where so mean-spirited I know and
Google's based on peer feedback so we'll
get to that action that's why I've been
a little quiet about some of these tools
by the way um so but really what
happened I just want to say this is kind
of way I visualize the stuff is that you
know back in the day yahoo was pretty
cool right when the web
pretty small and evolving pretty slowly
right they just had humans like index
interesting sites and put them into this
you know giant hierarchy hierarchy of
sites right they just categorize these
URLs and it worked pretty well for the
time right like when I was in school and
then Google came around this company
that pays my bills and I love them and I
given to give me coffee but I they
figured like this won't scale right you
know it's changing faster it's growing
its getting bigger so what do they do
they basically end up doing like just
the modern search stack right which is
this crawl and index and then i'm using
page rank to find surfaced irrelevant
stuff up and it's not a perfect system
either right it doesn't know every
single URL and they're not always in
perfect order right but but really what
happens is when i looked around test was
still doing the manual curation of test
cases they're very directed and they're
very like in these hierarchies and test
case managers and stuff but the world
had changed in the web had changed right
but testing hadn't changed yet i just
want to say that you know the web and
search has made this transition and
actually even God who has now because of
being but we want to see what would this
mean if we thought about this in the
context of testing right how could you
actually test the catch up to make the
same transition that we missed you know
probably a decade ago so this is
actually Ibrahim as girlfriends in the
picture but um that's right I was like
who is this person I don't start of the
net um so some early results so the
thing is uh google is based on peer
review like for feedback and your review
scores and your bonus so I've been kind
of quiet about the data but what I've
been doing under James's semi watch and
I just can demand doing all these
experiments and fund these large teams
is measuring humans and comparing the
human activity the manual testing and
automation right vs bots and versus the
crowd that's really kind of what we
fundamentally been doing we've had to
put a lot of infrastructure to do that
and by it has been printed with like how
do you make these testers even faster
I'm trying to help the manual testers to
but I wanted to find out what's the real
you know what's the answer to this stuff
because no one was experimenting they're
kind of nearly just checking the
features that work that came into the
build yesterday and the day before and
so I figured I'd experiment a little bit
while I got a crazy manager that would
fund it so the fundamental first point
is and I can go on for hours so I'm only
got a few minutes here bots are actually
faster and less expensive for basic
regression testing than humans who would
have thunk
i mean we actually kind of all know that
but we don't use machines for that and
it's been a kind of a theme of the the
conference i think and i think that the
bots are kind of the first stage of that
the simple layout BOTS got some examples
amount of time for those things also the
interesting thing is I've compared a sum
I won't protect the innocent right like
some of the chrome testing right we have
these dedicated teams of manual on-site
vendors and full timers doing these
manual tests and they used to be doing
it they don't weekly and they just kind
of recycle the test pass again and again
and again indefinitely right and doing
the same thing and then we passed one of
these builds i did for an experiment it
passed to him through off through a you
test for crowdsourcing guess what we got
a lot of bugs like same build like they
came out with like one or two bugs right
like the crowd testers came back with
like 18 bugs like literally it was just
that right and then i won't talk about
the money but like it was a lot cheaper
than our dedicated testing team and
they're also faster because you can
paralyze these people where you can't to
paralyze a team of five people so that's
actually very exciting and the quality
the book it's not just more bugs right
like they're actually like interesting
books and somebody actually I'll
probably blog or something I'll share a
lot of that data the next like month or
so the other is it's faster rerecord bug
so this is where Simon Stewart who we
left but I warned him i was going to
bad-mouth him before he left the reality
we worked with with the bite record
playback in the JavaScript generation we
worked with the Chrome Web Store team
right and we thought hey you could try
this out maybe it'll be working maybe
you know give us feedback maybe we're
stupid this is a dumb idea right job to
do the javascript stuff instead of the
the webdriver and what happened is we
came back a few days we left them alone
for a while the Wednesday is cool guy
came back we said you know what do you
how to use the tool what's your what's
your feedback right we thought we was
gonna spend all the time on these like
you know when the elements not there
because the web page changed we have the
UX to like fix your code up on the fly
kind of thing that's where we thought we
were really clever but the reality is he
says oh I don't use that crap right he
says I just regenerate the test case
it's like well duh so it's actually like
takes in like just five seconds to try
the feature out and then like we've
generated the test case we've stored it
for them it can replay it it will and
it's done once he records it it's
persisted in the cloud and with one
button you can run it you don't have to
worry about all these like you know
server farms and we have some sort of
arms to take care of this stuff but you
can execute all the stuff in the browser
itself
so anyway we'll get down to the anti
webdriver stuff how we doin time what
another five minutes okay do it okay all
right uh I will done okay so here's the
new cycle so I proposed this test isn't
dead it's just changing there are
dinosaurs in the room and some of them
will actually become Birds right some of
the brontosaurus just fossilized so
we've got this is the new workflow I
think it's going to be happening and
these things are converging right you've
seen what what Kevin's got and
crowdsourcing people talking about all
these components so this is kind of the
flow so a developer basically comes up
here in the number one slot right and
they just deploy the application you
notice I don't have any like listing of
specifications or test plans or any of
that kind of junk listed here they just
deploy the application right these bots
over here we've done a lot of work on
running these things on Sky tap actually
which rocks and they don't pay me for
saying that but we're going to stuff on
skycap VMs and the cool thing about it
is that so these bots run and ninety
ninety-five percent of all the pages
don't change we're going to look at them
so we don't have any human involvement
still right so the ones where we find
gifts on these pages were there
interesting and we haven't like said
ignore this stuff because this is like a
dumb the bots are stupid sometimes you
say ignore it and ever does it again but
we basically don't come up these like
list of diffs right so these bit then we
do is rather than pass it to on-site
dedicated testers again we pass it off
to the crowd right with this byte kind
of enhanced overlay fancy heads-up
display thing so what happens we're at
it to a crowd tester right the crowd
tester looks at these dips and says all
that looks like a new feature that looks
like a like a bug right you don't really
know all the time right we've talked
about contacts with crowdsource people
and stuff they don't always have the
full context the project or why but you
don't always need to what happens is
that so and we've done the study right
so really it's actually higher than
ninety-five percent but call it nine
ninety-five percent of all these divs of
all this stuff isn't is identical the
stuff that's different we filter out
about seventy percent of it with the
crowd and we've compared that with our
actual on site dedicated testers that
know the product all the developers and
go have lunch with them right they're as
good or better and they're actually
faster there are dedicated testers to
filter out these disks so then now we've
got of all the possible thing work we
could have done we're down to like three
percent of it or less
hey and when there is an issue like they
loaded up there already got the browser
open right to this week they click the
repro URL loads it up and then from the
diff and then they just basically click
on whatever is the problem right and
they go next next next and then the bug
is filed and that bug we've got a
feedback on from the early deployments
to the Google Maps team is better than
their best test or filing the bugs
because their best test or does include
all that debug information their best
tester still writes a lot of times you
know step one I mean it's embarrassing
right like like you spaces you a tab
right one go to this URL to click this
button you try to describe it there's
none of that crap so it's faster and
it's better data for the for the
developers so then we just route this
back right and also we'll talk about
this thing we brought this back into a
bug's dashboard back to the developer
and they just have a URL right and they
load the URL and they can see like hey
nothing changed or there's a couple
flagged bugs and then they can they
click on that and it takes it back it
does the repro and it takes them to the
possible bug right and you realize
what's going on at all this whole flow
is that there's none of us in this flow
that's that's the cool crazy thing
that's where I think some dinosaurs
think test is dead but it's just been
automated right and it's been outsourced
kind of to the crowd into machines and
this is this is this flow we've actually
tried this flow once it's early but it
actually works so we don't we don't
exist in this thing that's where we got
to think about what we're going to do I
argue we should actually participate
making this flow better and also like
worked instrument stuff of a do more
quality work on the product but um and
also also what's going on here we found
that we needed to do because it was like
all the bots are kind of stupid right
they just find these diffs right they
are stupid we have some interns working
on like making them smarter and doing
runtime and some intelligent stuff like
some pseudo AI stuff but I know I'm more
practical than that right let them do
the ninety percent job but what really
happens is we have a continuous set of
exploratory testers that are just
assigned to the project right and we
just use the crowd we have a pool of we
tried different things we tried pulls 25
and tools of 10 what we think works best
is having a dedicated set of like Fleck
francis than half of them are dedicate
so they're always on the same products
they have a context right and another
half you test was able to rotate through
for us so we got like people with
different different browsers like
different opinions on stuff different
they're looking for different bugs they
have to
context so if you have a continued
exploratory testing going on with bots
and then just simple like I looks like a
bug or doesn't look like a bug you've
basically solved about you know like
almost one hundred percent of this kind
of a testing problem because the
developer is a smart guy right we're
also a lot of us are also developers you
can just look at the bug the problems we
spend all this money and time and
latency right having people sitting from
the machines doing these repetitive
tasks over and over and over again I
think we can eliminate like the vast
majority of that work with this kind of
a workflow that's kind of the
fundamental thing I think we're all
these things when these tools come
together we make the the crowds us crowd
jesters better with a bite they're more
efficient and oh wow okay thank you this
is me from five years ago actually so
I'll skip most of that stuff actually
can you go back though we're today yeah
good to the bell bonus I'll wrap it up
done there's overhead in slide switching
no no listen double bottoms those are
bell bottoms do you not know what Bilbo
me do my--go and the nice girl 10
minutes left so there's a lot of stuff
that isn't in that slide you can look at
this slide later too it ain't there it's
actually streamlined process right the
reason I say bell bottoms is that back
to a James's a and stuff like testing
hasn't freaking changed we get a little
bit better we're still loading up
consoles no offense to the cool
javascript stuff was like we still like
test the browser from a freaking console
that's crazy to me we have a browser we
have a platform right in the cloud so we
can go and expedite what I do is I call
bell bottoms on stuff and that gets me
like unhappy it looks at work all the
time if people say that why say why are
you doing it that way what about if we
do it this way there's go well that's
why I'm doing it I declare bell bottoms
so I know you could use that or I don't
know so the last thing here is if you
want more context all this crap sorry I
said crap then I'm just too honest um
I just yeah my family raised me right
unfortunately um so there's a book
coming out the James this is the cover
is the working draft of the cover I
think and but there's all sorts of like
there's there's some talk about how we
do testing we do all the unit testing we
do also kind of stuff I was talks about
a lot of these experiments actually give
talks about like the origin and who was
doing bite and why they did it and how
we scam James into believing that we
could actually do some of these things
on how when he told us not to do BOTS we
did two interns do it anyway and right
in the same office he didn't know like
it's actually totally true James you
know that right and something that's all
in the book it's actually kind of cool I
the reason this pictures here I thought
about although the trees James is killed
with his books and his October
publishing career and I accidentally
obscured his name on the book so and
then no we're not doing questions I'm
talking I'm talking about they like that
random talk they like to have so so the
thing I want to say is that this is all
about the cloud this is actually really
about cloud testing right we talk about
cloud testing cloud testing doesn't
involve a console it doesn't call me a
nut bag and I am a little bit but it
doesn't involve a console it doesn't
involve Java binaries that like you know
and then distribute it like a pool
machines that we have to manage and
stuff like that there's the cloud we
just persist the crap out there the
browser is a powerful platform and we
can do it all in a browser and end right
and this this and so we're more or less
kind of defunded now we've actually
broken the team up people are going off
to other teams and projects and stuff
like that because things and Google
change fast um but uh but these things
will live on we've open sourced them
please participate and collaborate and
yeah maybe we can do some cool cool web
testing in the cloud actually finally
maybe someday do cloud testing done
questions
oh it's beautiful we created excellence
any questions I'm gonna get doubters you
know Ariel crazy doesn't work for my
application actually rules quick i'll do
all the quick questions I'll question to
answer them real quick it doesn't work
for my application application special
right I do a database right but I do
medical equipment this stuff is
applicable igenix about let people ask
the questions but I but I already
answered them hey go hi thank you for
your talk my name is Karen from Newsome
and basically you say that this tool is
for the cloud what happened with some
with the systems that has to interact
with desktop information and then will
be uploaded to the cloud so so so that
these tools are can work and together I
mean because sometimes would you need to
have a Java code to simulate that you
upload the information and then you need
to verify it in the globe yes oh I say
though generally it's about a little
myopic right we're focused on the
browser and kind of on on the web right
because it's google number one right but
like we saw earlier just like a couple
hours ago right like there's native
driver and stuff like that right these
same api's right so you can if you have
to do desktop stuff you can treat it the
same way we've actually done some
experiments like this where we actually
have JavaScript code right and we were
kicking off local we actually have a
demo extension in chrome where we can
actually run the console window right
inside the browser but the script that
that drove that thing was JavaScript and
it lives in the cloud and everybody that
so rather than have everything like
based in the in this client world and
then like tickling the browser the last
mile right or the last inch its jiggly
other way because there's so many
benefits of the cloud and we're not
benefiting them so really in a call me a
little bit wack but this is starting to
happen you saw it today right on Android
and iOS and stuff like that is you write
your stuff as if it was a web
application using these kind of
technologies and then if you do have to
do that you have a little tiny shin we
use like a local proxy right or you can
write an NPAPI or kind of an apple
interacted in practice most of this
stuff is taken care of by writing a
bunch of rappers and tell upon certain
that kind of services that you can talk
to from from your extension so this way
even if you have an existing sort of
legacy system what you do is you just
write a rapper service on top of it and
just you interact with it as if it was
just in the cloud about in general I
mean it's not clean and Jason will argue
that you know you shouldn't necessarily
care about you how you need to break
away from the past altogether but for
example for the teams as a simple
example something for some teams that
really are insisting on using webdriver
for whatever reason then what we do is
we generate the webdriver code for those
test cases as well and then allow people
to run that's a religious difference we
actually have I think it should never do
it i think it's like those world should
never cross eyed really think that like
you should do it from the cloud to start
with because of all the benefits of test
execution test distribution reporting
like portability all those benefits but
i mean the reality is if you have like a
legacy system and on the clients and or
your embedded systems and you have lost
legacy code and stuff and don't do this
kind of thing right it wouldn't be like
cost-effective right but if you have a
new project or something yeah it's not
an either/or proposition either but
there's also this contingent the apps
are moving toward the web right and so
we're trying to get out a little head of
the curve for testing it thank you well
I'm not done answering okay yeah anyone
else yeah so you guys said you had a you
know about five or ten people dedicated
for you know you test how is that any
different from just having five or ten
people that you have yourself if they're
dedicated viewing cool all right you
were paid by you test right so the cool
thing like you test is number one there
twenty-four/seven right there's a few
lists of these I think they they have
another propaganda material to write but
they're available twenty-four-seven so
like if we do a build everyone loves the
build on Friday night right the Dubs aw
got the last final build right and it's
friday at six o'clock right and they go
like oh the test team going to stay the
weekend or not right you don't worry
about that you actually just push it to
the crowd because they've got this 24 7
you know the Sun never sets kind of on
you test right in the crowds so that's
one thing that really interact
real-world ship cycles even at Google
you could say you have a remote office
and Hyderabad and we've tried that too
but then you have to worry those
orchestrated handoffs and stuff like
that
but the other with the big one that we
actually found on Chrome was that you
you know you can only pay dedic and
dedicate like you know five or six
full-time headcount right to this kind
of stuff or I will shine so type numbers
but you can only like have so many fix
people they're fixed resources and
you're spending and whether they're
testing or not right and then they're
sitting there the reality is is that if
you want to finish your test pacity of a
security patch right like a security
issue and you want to do a full test
pass before you push and you wish and
everyone wants to push it immediately
right everyone's been this kind of
situation so what do you do you turn the
dial on the crowd right you say like
give me 100 testers right in the next
like hour right and you can like
parallel eyes just like we talked about
paralyzing selenium execution earlier
you can paralyze human execution through
the crowd so it's actually pretty sick
the other big thing the last one is is
that you get a lot of variety right like
the google test engineers are kind of
myopic punched yeah i want the same
interview process they almost all live
the same place they have the same view
they always use gmail and people with
different context and different insight
right from their various experiences in
other places they've tested or their
lives really comes into play that's
where we saw a lot of the value coming
in from the crowd-sourced testing is
that they have different perspective
they would see bugs that if you sat our
local engineers and they looked at
straight on they wouldn't see it so
there is that good there's liking the
one for a little while but they don't
pay me yeah how about now my name is
Gotham I'm from netflix great talk a few
questions so they want to repeat that
actually sit again could you repeat that
great talk thank you yeah
I totally believe in the vision the
first question is how do you test your
test tools to make sure they're finding
the real bugs so we ironically I mean it
like everyone else does we didn't the
first to be frank right we didn't test
these things partly because we call them
experiment because we're also a little
bit lazy and testing and they got away
with that for a little while tell team
started want to use it what happened is
that one of our developers actually like
an SCT a software engineer in test who
was doing just feature work said like oh
crap we pushed the bad build and so now
we started the test thing right so we
just instituted better coding practices
and making sure that we did exploratory
testing every time we did a release so
we essentially dog food that process
right and we used we used bite to file
some bugs actually hunger on our own
system when it was working so it was it
was very organic bottoms up and we only
really started testing it kind of like
you know test of us the Grim Reaper was
saying earlier is that we only test it
when we when we need to know if it's
working right when it goes right the
last second before goes to a customer
right or a little bit after when you're
embarrassed that's when we actually had
a testing to the tools second question
how do you ensure that your crowds out
testers I'm not filing do bugs because
developers hate duplicate bugs yeah we
actually there's a mitigation part in
then there's a sort of a back-end piece
to this the we mitigate some of this by
the bug overlay that you have seen
earlier essentially what we do is we
just like when you're driving in a
street and you see this thing that says
your speed is 35 miles an hour in a 30
zone you basically get to see okay there
are bugs in this area there are already
pre-existing bugs so that's part of it
and the other pieces we kind of owned
the cloud that also has the issues that
we track and so that that's we haven't
done this yet but we do plan since the
format of these bugs it's kind of
uniform we can pretty much do a diff and
figure out if a bug is already exists
and we did our experience with you test
we actually gave the bite right so they
were filing bugs with bite and so they
could actually see the existing bugs are
already filed that's the whole purpose
of the overlay and then also a you test
specifically has
some pm's associated with stuff so if
your team's like really anti dupes and
you don't have a test on the other end
to want to D dupe things they have like
program manager people that will
actually filter this stuff for you you
just pay them a little bit more okay i
will repeat great talk cool and but now
unfortunately the time is over but so we
are going into a break these two guys
are going to be here for the rest of the
day they're also going to be here for
the beer and brats tonight so you guys i
know you guys got a lot of questions go
ahead and continue to ask them during
the break and and tonight during this
the beer and brats session so i do want
to say that these tools it's it's kind
of a google thing to build a tool and
get it you know almost done and then
just let it go because that's the way
you find out whether your tools are
really interesting and useful to people
is that they'll they'll participate to
continue the tool even after you stop
working on it so when we change from a
test team to a dev team we gave these
tools up we open source them and we just
threw them out to google and the chrome
team has picked up two of them and the
open-source folks are picking up more we
hope you know mo go test maybe they'll
take the the bots stuff but no no no
what else have to say they have they do
a better job at the diff they do a
better job jason said so so anyhow
please pick these tools up from open
source go to the Google testing blog
that's where the links or the
open-source blog all the links are there
and you can find them all on code google
com do some cool stuff with them and
interesting stuff with them and will
keep the chrome team honest whatever
updates they make we will continue to
nag them to open source those as well so
the weekend we can continue these these
test tools okay thanks a lot guys we're
going into a break
