with that I would like to welcome dr.
Eric Dane to Google
thank you Matt for the introduction and
thank you it's a pleasure being here
today or like to present to you a very
interesting study that we did at Harvard
and it's interesting for many reasons as
all of you know probably probably
preaching the choir but obesity causes a
whole variety of diseases from heart
disease to cancer and and of course
increase the mortality so if everyone
knows this already then why are we here
for many reasons and notably why are we
discussing a major league baseball and
this is the study we're gonna cover that
stands a hundred and thirty years and
house actually has a very profound
impact and results beyond just baseball
and beyond just body mass index and
mortality and you'll see why so I have
no disclosure Babe Ruth for those who
are familiar baseball is one of the most
famous baseball players of all time and
he was also famous for being one of the
most obese as well however his he wasn't
always quite so obese when he first
joined the major leagues he actually
started at 215 pounds which is a BMI of
27 we'll go into that details of the BMI
index later but his later on he gained
substantial weight and it was quite
significantly obese at the height of his
plane when he was with the New York
Yankees in more modern times you may
know Barry Bonds he was very skinny of
rookie in 1986 but today he's known as
one of that heavy sluggers a major
league baseball so body mass index why
does it matter it's a relative incident
index a relative body composition for
guiding healthy weight and generally
reflects body fat and generally is
actually the purpose of our talk here
today however the calculation is very
controversial how would the World Health
Organization defines normal weight as
between eighteen point five and twenty
five overweight as over 25 and obese as
over thirty however this classification
is very controversial and many people to
actually diss
that's it so how big of a problem is
this two in three adults in America are
actually overweight and obese this is
quite a substantial epidemic and for
those who are familiar with the term
epidemic but don't actually know the
history of the obesity epidemic let me
give you a quick rundown this is the
beastly trends in the u.s. between 1985
and 2009 and it's very self-explanatory
this is early 80s late 80s 90s the
prevalence of obesity you can see is
escalating exponentially in every state
in 2001 a new color is added for
Mississippi that first ever talked over
25 percent then but it keeps going in
the past 10 years we've actually had to
add another color Mississippi leading
the way again but pretty pretty soon by
2009 no color is blue anymore the light
blue anymore and you can see the
comparison the stark comparison between
the early 90s and 20 years later and
this is where we are but we all know
that but what's the implication in the
linkage with obesity so what's the story
what's the story and what's so special
about athletes and baseball players here
is the problem BMI is generally
recognized as an index of obesity in the
general population however everyone
knows it's just a simple calculation of
weight in height and weight is
influenced by many things most notably
muscle mass so if you're an athlete you
run a lot or you weight lift a lot and
you have a substantial amount of body
mass you can look like the guy on their
left but if you're sedentary you can get
look like the guy on the right however
just a doctor taking a height and weight
would not be able to differentiate you
two and that's the limitation of the
body mass index because you can have the
same weight and same height and same BMI
but look completely differently and
obviously we would know who's more
likely to die but the question is is
should the athlete on the Left ignore
his body mass index because everyone
says oh it's all I'm heavy because I
have a lot of you
muscle mass doesn't bother me it doesn't
affect me I don't need to listen to BMI
guidelines obesity however is that true
so the controversy is it's been long
been our measure of obesity
however it's it's not well generally
well accepted among athletes and
especially those with high lean body
mass so is it even relevant for athletes
in terms of health so whether you are
professional baseball athlete or your
runner or your weight lifter I think
this question applies to many more of us
than we think so the objectives of the
study so a scientific jardín jargons
laid out on the left of why we did the
study but plainly we want to ask our
baseball players getting fatter over
time does BMI increase the risk of death
among these major league athletes now
how does homerun hitters put on play
because the results we get are quite
striking and homerun hitters for those
who are not familiar are notoriously the
largest players in the MLB so the study
design so what we basically did we took
the entire history a major league
baseball from 1870s there's been five
major leagues and we've compiled them
all together and we know basically
baseball it's a very unique sport where
everyone is a statistic nut and
tabulates basically every single
statistic ever recorded
so during play including height weight
date of birth date of debut in the major
leagues and so we tabulate from all
these major sources including many
official databases used by that Major
League Baseball and from there we
calculated body mass index from height
and weight historical records we know
that exactly the date of birth date of
debut and that's our baseline and we
then we ascertained the mortality in all
these databases from historical records
obituaries and Social Security Death
Index and basically we have a
near-perfect follow-up for baseball
players even dating back as to the 1800s
because baseball does have
a complete of a history so in terms
analysis we did some multi-barrier
Russians but most notably we did time to
event analysis where we asked
specifically do baseball players who are
more overweight die sooner and that's
what the the relative risk answers
basically does it increase the risk of
dying and dying sooner and again the
baseline was 1876 for endeth onwards for
whenever the baseball player debut into
the major league and we have entered
follow-up through the end of 2007 the
raw counts over 131 years a major league
baseball we have seven thousand four
hundred deaths with among 15,000
major-league baseball players which is
pretty much all almost all major league
baseball and we have a total of half a
million person-years a follow up across
130 years through the general
characteristics well body mass index 24
like medium weight you don't expect
baseball players to be skinny but we
overall had 43% overweight but that's
across all years and for the most part
they were in their 20s and retired just
for their 30 so this is the broad
distribution of BMI in the players
across all these years it's pretty
normal distribution but the story is
there's much as much more complex once
you break it down by year however how
overweight are baseball players
some people say baseball players are
baseball you don't have to be the
fittest Olympian to play baseball but in
terms of other sports we you can see the
NFL Knapp National Football League the
prevalence of overweight is basically
95% or higher compared to n Hanes which
is the u.s. national population it's
about 60% and then 20 to 30% obese so in
terms of baseball players baseball
players are about 60% overweight and
only 2% obese so if anything baseball
players are not only healthier than
football players
no big surprise but they're all so much
healthier in terms of body mass index
than the general population so they're
they're very in general you can pretty
much say this is a very lean population
and this is the height and weight at
their date of debut which is basically
when they are the most fit and the peak
of their performance
so some quick stats well this is the
actual tabulation of the body mass index
across 130 years that is a scatter plot
of all 15,000 people and the red dots
are the mean BMI and you can see 25
being a threshold for being overweight
it was hugged under 25 for many years
but in there in the recent 20 years it's
definitely surpassed a mean BMI of 20 25
and hence you can see the obesity and
overweight prevalence is substantially
increasing so a temporal trend just
quickly summing up the last slide 32%
were were overweight prior to 1880 but
by the most recent decade we have over
55 percent who are now overweight and
homerun hitters note notably were more
than twice as likely to be overweight
than non homerun hitters and with the
doubling of odds of being overweight for
every 10 home runs batted per season and
the home line hitting story does not end
there it actually gets much more
interesting yes
home-run-hitting is what we use a
continuous variable so we can either
categorize because home-run-hitting in
1920 you know if you hit like 20 it's
considered very high but if you hit just
20 today it's not very high so it's not
we didn't use an absolute cutoff because
it's such a century different so we used
um for every ten additional home runs
hit per season so you have for every ten
additional you have doubling of the odds
odds ratio of being overweight in sense
so this is the basically the main result
the main result that body mass index of
players at the playing debut and the
risk of mortality for many people who've
been following the news you know the few
years ago there's been studies that says
overweight is associated lower deaths
not sure what whatsoever in many and
many many other studies and very also
not true among athletes because athletes
if anything's many suspected that being
overweight as an athlete does not
increase your risk and only does it get
when you get to the obese level doesn't
make your increased risk be present
because over weights among athletes
generally reflects main body mass and
muscle mass so this was actually much
stronger than we anticipated because if
anything we only anticipated increased
risk in the overweight in the obese
range above 30 the last category how are
compared to eighteen point five to
twenty two BMI you can see the increased
risk starts as low as 25 to 27 which is
at the low end of overweight category
and this was very significant with
higher and BMI increasing the risk of
death
starting at 25 so the key findings BMI
is strongly associated with with risk of
total mortality when other words is
associated risk of dying early and these
results are justed for the age and the
decade that they play because players
are fatter today than they were
in this decades past but this reflects
not simply the decade a phenomenon
because we adjusted for age decade and
wide variety of covariance so this truly
does reflect BMI not a temporal trend
risk increases teens as low as a modest
25 which is very surprising because my
BMI is actually a little over 25 myself
she puts a man and with almost a
doubling of risk of 94 percent increased
risk among obese players but also
someone once imposed this question well
there are half the players who are
really obese in really out of shape in
baseball because all you have to do is
run one base and you can be fast
sprinter and still be very out of shape
because that's all you have to run is
like basically a baseline but if we
stratify those these all these results
and we look among those with high number
of stolen bases which basically are the
leanest leanness fittest sprinters in
base Major League Baseball these super
lean fit sprinters actually you saw the
same phenomenon so it doesn't matter if
you're just the designated hitter who
may be quite overweight and out of shape
or if you were actually a sprinter with
high stolen bases this increased risk
still holds up now the homerun hitting
is when the results get extra
interesting but also disturbing the
increased risk of death with overweight
was actually stronger among homerun
hitters well earlier I said homerun
hitters are more overweight and you know
of course somebody would easily think of
course if they're more of a weight
they're more likely to die but the story
is not that simple
they not only did they had stronger risk
of dying but they also there was an
effect modification in other words the
effect differed among
for for BMI immortality whether or not
you are home run hitter an on home run
hitter specifically homeland hitters
with one additional home run average per
game had 15 fold higher risk of dying
sooner compared to over overweight
runners overweight players who hit fewer
home runs this is quite surprising
because you're comparing overweight
individuals to overweight individuals
but per additional home run they have a
15 fold increased risk of mortality this
is basically saying that this is a
general trend among all baseball players
but this slope is actually much deeper
among homerun hitters so in terms of
what that means we can only speculate
some people suggest steroids however its
steroid use
you know however hypothetically
prevalent is today it's only been a
phenomenon in the past 20 years
so in but in terms of mortality across
130 years this reflects something I
think much deeper that we are not quite
sure yet but the strength is magnitude
is very surprising and I don't think it
should be ignored and again no such
homerun of hitting mortality risk seen
among non overweight so if you're non
overweight and you hit more home runs
you have no increased risk of death so
it's so it's a double-edged sword it's a
it's a double whammy into a four to be
overweight and home run hitter so in
terms of Major League Baseball what they
really care about is like our baseball
bigger baseball players better baseball
players because if they're bigger for
them for all they care you know that you
can be as big as you want if you can hit
all the home runs there your team needs
basically your salary go up and no one
will care about your health risk but in
terms of actual implementation in in
terms actual salary and compensation and
other performance measures this is a
bigger player mean you are better player
and
this is just for Major League Baseball
curiata city's sake and when we graph it
this is total hits and total runs batted
in RBIs by body mass index the total
hits is blue total RBIs is orange and
you can see that the higher your BMI
actually goes back down
it's bell-shaped instead of a positive
slope that you know you would expect
from more overweight players and that
who can supposedly hit more home runs
and other hits so there's no performance
correlation between a bigger size in
total hits and runs batted in in terms
of homeruns this is what everyone is
hoping the payoff would be the bigger
the player the better the slugger but
that's not true at all there's a simple
bell-shaped Association and there's no
general correlation or Association
whatsoever so our larger homerun players
being overpaid I don't know
and in terms of batting average this is
this is as null as it gets
basically there's absolutely no
Association correlation between body
mass index and playing on batting
statistics so again you're not paying
for any premiums by hiring and
entertaining more overweight players on
your team but what is the bottom line
body mass index and player performance
no relationship whatsoever
so in terms of summary baseball players
have become significantly bigger across
130 years of professional baseball
history with home line hitters being
substantially more overweight than than
players with fewer home runs in higher
the BMI associated higher risk of death
and as modest as a BMI of 25 which is
actually very modest by overweight
standards with home run hitters again
getting the brunt of the mortality risk
because for homerun hitters who are
overweight they are substantially and by
substantial I mean 15 fold greater risk
for additional homerun the game which is
quite significant so in terms of future
work in this area well in terms there's
much to be done because the mortality
are presented were only for all cause
mortality not mortality broken down by
specific causes we want to break it down
by cardiovascular causes cancer causes
decimal to cause accidents and so forth
however this requires obviously
substantial funding for staff and
national debt index search and there's
also a wealth of other data about player
performance injury rates as well as you
know left-handedness right-handedness
and of course there's many other sports
we should we should verify this and if
it holds among baseball players then
surely among football players with 95%
prevalence of overweight and five full
greater prevalence of obesity issue the
risks are probably much higher and worse
among professional football players
however these are things that we look
forward to studying the near future
thank you very much and that's my link
for the campaign of cancer prevention if
you're interested
and I understand we have some time for
our questions
yes the raw data is available it's
online actually and so this is what's so
interesting about this project because
the data was derived from online
resources they're open access
however the playing data is not in the
same data as the mortality data and to
get them to merge so you can access them
player by player and you and you have
you can access the raw data set for the
plane but the mortality data the raw
data set is not it's by request however
once requested you have to merge a data
set together which takes up quite a bit
of time we're compiling from the
different data sets and merging all
15,000 players but that's actually how
we accessed it hi Eric I was wondering
if you shared the results from this
study with the Major League Baseball and
what their reaction has been or you know
I have individual baseball players you
know if you've heard any comments on
this like in the media well I am when I
presented this abstract previously and
it did get some media coverage however
the commentary from I don't believe we
didn't get direct commentary from them
however one of theirs team physicians
for one of the major league teams
commented and he says well this tells us
what we know all along that you should
keep your weight down but I don't think
he
but when reading the article I don't
think he'd be quite grasped but that
we're talking about not only that
obesity is increasing among baseball
players but also that the mortality risk
is increasing about face baseball
players study the mortality risk
actually come from the 130 years of
baseball players and that you know as
low as BMI of 25 you've see increased
risk which basically forearm covers 70%
of all baseball players today have a BMI
of over 25 which is quite disturbing and
basically they're all elevated risk so
in terms of direct home
carreño but in terms we have gotten few
small commentary but not official
commentary
any other questions
yes
in terms of women among women athletes
there's not such a long-standing cohort
existence because most female a
professional leagues didn't emerge until
the past two decades at the earliest
and so those players who were playing
then almost no one has the idea so
baseball we are able to benefit because
baseball has such a long-standing
history and you have you can accrue
seven thousand deaths to do such a study
you can't even actually do it with
National Football League actually
because in terms of total number of
deaths NFL is actually a very young
league and same for basketball it only
dates back to 1930s 1940s so the the
total number of deaths has accrued to
study the mortality risk is apse is very
limited for other sports and very very
limited for women unfortunately however
there's the findings definitely do hold
up in women because they've been stunned
the Nurses Health Study for example
based on Harvard which has over one
hundred fifty thousand women in each
cohort so three hundred thousand women
for the past twenty thirty years and you
know BMI definitely increases risk
similarly in women as well as men but in
terms of actual athletes unfortunately
don't have women yeah
I was wondering just early on in your
presentation he showed slides of how in
the United States you know
state-by-state the obesity rate has just
been going through the roof you know
each decade and then I don't I'm just
I'm asking about the relationship
between basically the general public's
obesity rate rising and the rise in
obesity among baseball players I was
wondering is the baseball player right
rate rising faster than America as a
whole or is it like Oh or is the
baseball player rate just a reflection
of Americans getting fatter
well that's a very good question in
terms of the trend we don't have quite
good data on the prevalence of obesity
back in the 1800s however if we answer
today for example and Haynes here shown
here is is a nationally representative
US sample for US adults and so here you
can see that overweight is similar
however obesity is 25 percent among and
the Haynes
however only two percent among these
baseball players so baseball players are
much leaner than the general population
as expected although it's opposite of
NFL however in terms of actual trend
it's hard to say because the actual
trend we don't have the trend data for
as many years for national prevalence
but it's it's likely that the epidemic
is very very similar Paul although in
the past 20 years I would say looking at
the graphs the evolution of obesity it's
gone up substantially faster than the
general population then in baseball
yes I was wondering about the causes of
obesity and particularly the long term
trend so for example I could imagine
between you know coming the 1800s maybe
2000 or whatever we're just you know
there's more prosperity and we're
healthier but I just can't imagine that
between you and say the last decade or
the last two decades that prosperity has
changed that much that people are you
know the you know diets are changing or
whatever that much because of just
economic reasons so what - what do you
speculate or attribute the causes among
the general population among baseball
players well either and or let's say
both and particularly why it continues
to go up recently
well of course obesity there's it's many
it's a multifactorial disease there are
many causes contributions such as
greater sedentary activity we're all in
front of computers much more than we
were in the 80s we don't exercise as
much that there's a whole host of
environmental reasons such as bike paths
the urban um the suburbanization
of cities and having to drive more and
then there's dietary reasons of course
like potentially sugar sweetened
beverages like coca-cola prolific
proliferation coca-cola in past 20 years
there's many other risk factors and
basically a lot of foods have gone
cheaper I mean it also you know the
proliferation of fast food there's in
terms of actual obesity the causes are
endless but in terms of Major League
Baseball so it partly Eiger flex the
increasing trend among the general
population however again perhaps there's
more motivation now to use steroids in
Major League Baseball
not that all baseball players do it but
there's much more propensity to want to
use it and the rewards for hitting more
home runs have increased ever since
because you know in the past
basically years before the recent two
decades baseball playing was uh pretty
much damaged
paying sport is a professional sport but
the pay of it was mostly like a
middle-class middle-income class well
today is is to the level of superstardom
and the compensations and so there's
basically the desire to be bigger and
hit more has also increased so I think
in terms of general population diets
physical activity our environment is
substantially changed but in terms of
baseball I think also there's many other
potential and motivating factors that we
can speculate more on
any other questions
so the question was do I have any data
on diabetes risk and incidence of
diabetes the it's a good question
however again we only have mortality and
we only have total mortality because we
only know the database someone died to
get cause of death we need to go to
death certificates of individual of all
7,000 players and Counting who have died
so we do not have the resources to to
fund such a huge endeavor at the moment
in terms of like diabetes incidents in
linkage with medical records first of
all most medical records are not
electronic linked in the United States
and getting access to current players
but not yet died the medical records you
would need inform consent
and for past players you have to track
down the families so it's unlike
unlikely we can get disease incidence
data the best we can do is get disease
mortality data and that even takes
substantial funding that's a point
however obesity is one of the strongest
predictors of diabetes with increased
BMI of 35 or 40 you have basically 40 50
fold increased risk of diabetes and so
with increasing BMI it's it's a foregone
conclusion with there's also increased
risk of diabetes cardiovascular disease
and cancers and many other OBC related
diseases
yes how trustworthy are the heights and
weights in people's stats I can imagine
a lot of players may lie to seem like a
better athlete and the way a lot of
people will lie at the DMV about their
weight that's a very good question in
terms of how trustworthy the weight is
we actually got height and weight from
two different sets of data and they had
a perfect coral near-perfect correlation
of nine point nine eight point nine nine
so they independently verified in terms
of actual reporting this is their debut
weight and so in terms of historical
records
I'm sure there's not as much fudge in
the numbers in the old history books in
the Korean history books even if there
is a little fudging downward putting
thing is you know among baseball players
do you want to list your weight higher
or lower it depends and it's unlikely to
bias the results because they those who
fudged your numbers or do not know their
future mortality outcomes and basically
it's it's random randomness
classification is non-differential
misclassification compared to the
disease outcome so only if they actually
knew they were gonna die soon a higher
risk of soon dying and they fudged their
numbers would there induce any bias and
that's very unlikely in this kind of
data set but a really good question
well thank you all for coming and please
contact me if you have further questions
