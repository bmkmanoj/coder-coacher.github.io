excited to be here you may not know it
but I am a resident of Switzerland
I live in Verbier most of the time so
it's a great pleasure to be here and the
talk today is about the essence of
software engineer the seemeth approach
so I will have a couple of things to
talk about first is just to talk about
what is seemeth and what is essence
these are two concepts and but I would
like you to know what it is before we
leave this room
how many of you know about CIMMYT is and
how many no assets okay I will say 95%
at least didn't and so positively to
this question these questions but
remember when you the rest of your life
you will always remember this was the
first time you heard about this concept
right so I will introduce the concepts
and then we have two talks here welcome
to state club it's a a new way of
thinking about software development and
how you actually can measure progress
and health in your endeavor having done
that we will talk about a welcome to the
world of practices is how you actually
can compose your method your own method
your own way you're working in by
composing practices and how you in in an
organization as large at Google can
actually be a continuously learning
organization so that is what it's all
about today M first what is C mad it's
actually a community
which we founded in 2009 he it was a pot
for myself it was Burton Meyer who most
of you should know at least the Swiss
people and richer solely who is chairman
of the object Management Group which is
a forum where new standards are taken
this SEMA stand for software engineering
method and theory it has originally when
we is identify what is it that we want
to do we wrote the case for action it's
time to act
and we got about 40 signatories we
didn't ask for more when we had what 40
or little s we said this is enough it
makes sense to do and among this thing
that those we find people from famous
people from around the world in
different areas including a computer
science software engineer things like
computer science I think I mentioned
that so it's twice we have basically any
era a a drive
pre Hydra so the whole community is the
whole area is really represented a 2000
supporters have signed up for it and we
also wanted to have some customers
people who really say this is what we
need this is what good for us so we have
about 20 companies Ericsson IBM
Microsoft not yet Google maybe that can
be outcome of today if we do a good job
we also have a twenty academics in that
those meaning universities that are
using it for s for education and for
research there is a quite large
community of people searching for a new
theory in software engineering general
fear in software engineering and we are
publishing themselves quite a lot based
on work during being down here seven
chapters of cement in China India Japan
Korea Latin America and South Africa and
chapter is created if you have a
distance in way for instance
geographical distance or language
distance so these many recent speak
English so well so we need to have a
chapter
so we initialize the hold seemeth we
have a taste for action it had two parts
first was what we said when software
engineering is gravely hampered by
immature practices and second we support
the process to refound software
engineering it's a quite aromatic
statement we want to refund it actually
it is easier than that we didn't have a
foundation in the first place so now we
are going to create the foundation what
is software engineering a specific
problem we identify is that we have a
huge number of methods and method
variants with differences little
understood and artificially magnified
you know every methodologist magnifies
is our work that this court we gain and
and another refounding we said we need a
kernel or widely agreed elements so we
need to find these things that are
universal for all software wealth so a
kernel of widely agreed elements is what
we felt we needed and that is what
seemeth has been working on for almost 5
years and we can see the result now so
why why do we need a kernel of widely a
great element because we have no common
ground when you teach anything in
software engineering you have
the basics thoughts from level zero
maybe some terms you can use but we
don't have a vocabulary we don't have
any foundation so that was if it all
started basically we don't like methods
and practices how many methods do we
have in the world do you think it's at
least more than hundred a thousand
hundred thousand at least so it's like
many the problem is we don't but no way
which way or we have no way to learn
from one novel really even in a big
company you may have twenty five thirty
different methods and people working
with one in one area of a company cannot
move even if they are very professional
ten years experience cannot easily move
to another area because we have no
common ground they have to sit on the
school benches I have done it I know how
it is it's terrible you have lots of
experience the young kids started
yesterday or maybe here know much more
than you do because they know the
language of this organization that's not
good we don't take care of our best
people so every one of us knows how to
develop our own software but as a
community we have no widely accepted
common ground that is a dilemma so if
you see here we have all kinds of
methods or practices user stories user
use cases scrum CMMI
Waterfall whatever but they are isolated
island you cannot you learn one area and
then you cannot easily move over to
another do you recognize this problem
those who are senior here ok good i it's
it's significantly more than we aren't
positive ends like with last question so
anyway but we want to do is build
bridges between ways so you can easily
connect and base
the such a foundation we want to create
should be should not this should not
compete with these ideas they should
still be them they are still good but
they should help us to have a common
ground for them so basically what we say
today is that we use we power these
technologies we improve them we may swim
make them more effective by using
essence as a platform because essence is
the result
it's a first result of a cement so yes
this is my first right is we call the
essence kernel so this is a common
ground on top of which you can build
practices 1 2 3 4 as many as you want
and you will see more about that in the
next presentation
these practices can share things they
can also be composed and the overlap
will disappear will be nicely integrated
practices the interesting thing is
though we have 100,000 or more methods
in the world we only have a couple of
hundred practices that are documented
that is got so and basically we one of
the most important discoveries we did 10
years ago is that basically every method
is just the composition of practices so
you every method is a super practices
because when someone creates some effort
they do take what they like and
understand not to forget that you don't
understand everything so you just take
what you understand and you make your
own soup and that su-mei work usually
because you're good people or it doesn't
work
so this common ground is what we call
the kernel and we use this notation to
talk about a girl so what is now the
kernel was inside this car well the most
important things are what we call the
ultras we alphas alpha is a new term we
have never had met in the software
engineering community so it's a new
concept we you will see why it's new a
second one so these are the things we
always have always produce and always
have when we develop software we always
have stakeholders people who want to use
and consume what we develop they have
seen an opportunity and the opportunity
is implemented in a software system mmm
software system is a helps to address
the opportunity it fulfills requirements
so when you see these word requirements
don't think about the specification
don't think about the document because
requirements are there even if you don't
talk them when you build something you
have an idea and in temped what you want
to build and this is can be documented
it can't be discarded in many case it is
but it doesn't need to be so
requirements exist even if you have no
documents just to take weeks three you
also have work to do to fulfill
requirements and you the work will
result in updates and changes to the
software system you need a team as
always a team to develop a software team
maybe only one person in case but it's
always a team and then you always have a
way of working a methodology even if
it's not documented you always have
our team applies a way working and every
way of working guides of work so these
are things we have identified as always
universe something you always have when
you develop software if they are not you
shouldn't think about these as
documentation you can have a way of
working without ever describing it it's
in the group in the team and I guess
much software is developed without
having this described method we have
three different concerns you see we have
a customer concern which is related to
the opportunity and the stakeholders we
have a solution that is requirements and
software system and then we have a
endeavour which is work team and way of
working these thing progress
independently they are different will
basically represent different dimensions
of of software development
another very important characteristics
of each Alfa's is that they have state
progression States and so for instance
requirements move through a number of
states from beginners just conceived and
then it is bounded meaning you you have
an idea of what the limits of a system
are and and so on so we move through six
states for requirements they every state
is defined by a checklist and it here to
be right we have a checklist for for
every state and then for we also have a
little car for each state so basically
we have two kinds of cause we have cause
for each alpha it's one of these
requirements software system and so on
and we also have a state for each one of
em
so each alpha goes through a number
state you don't you you may produce a
real good work means you produce all
these things at basically at the same
time he is another perspective it
actually this is a tool developed by in
Italy by some people at the University
phase view here in this picture you see
that these alphas represent dimensions
you have seven different dimensions when
developing software if you forget one of
them you will take a big risk so for
instance you have so you see all these
alphas I mentioned earlier represent one
dimension and when you work you progress
each one of them basically in every
iteration never sprint you have to take
consideration each and every one of
these now more things you can have taken
consideration but at least these things
so one of the most important things here
is the checklists and the checklist or
incredible powerful a for instance
flying an airplane a it doesn't happen
without going through a checklist for
many different things and no one would
sit in an airplane without knowing that
has happened I mean we wouldn't fly sir
drums have the checklist do we've about
19 different shakes asking things like
just be patient have a known allergy and
so on and from a beginning these
surgeons didn't want to have it they are
qualified they don't need to have
Shaklee they have been educated for many
years this is ridiculous I am to do this
but result is that the the number of
unsuccessful operation meaning deaths
were reduced by almost 50% by just using
this simple checklist so simple
checklist save lives
why not software projects of course but
we have had checklists in the software
community for forever the problem has
been movie set list that they were
asking questions like have you written
Viscount have you made have you had a
requirement specification signed by
managers and or have you done with job
have you made this activity that is is
really and not not give any real value
because you can write the document
without having done anything really
useful people fill in templates just to
have done for job so these checklists or
measuring real result the treatments so
all questions image exists in our case
or here our measurement of progress
independent of how we read it if you use
use of stories or use use cases or use
feature driven development or any other
thing doesn't matter you measure
progress in a uniform way so the great
thing is that in an organization like
Google you could have many different
projects going on
but you use the same way of measuring
progress okay you can add more to it but
you have a starting point by using this
work so this is work that has to be done
within the seemeth community it's not
the only work is more done a
particularly with fury in the search for
theory for software engineer but this is
the most interesting to us in the
industry so it has become a standard
where is a book by sector of several
books but this is one book that we have
written about the essence of software
engineer which describes how to use this
car
practice so it's essence is a kernel and
language for software engineering
methods
it's very agile so it's easy to change
it is easy to do what you want with it
but you have a starting point so now
I'll get to the second section which is
about playing serious games software
developer games he call it welcome to
state club and how to be lean and agile
we processes checkpoints and governance
you know in the this is of course
referring to a Fight Club
bye what's his name oh yeah you all know
who is and instead of the fists we used
cause he is a set of course it has not
52 but almost 52 to course and they are
used to play and I'll show you how we
play with it we also have four in a team
we have a little bigger course so we put
on the wall so people can go and write
on it in the tea so it's the same course
but it's used on the wall on the wall so
you can actually describe where you are
and so on and of course we have a little
smaller one so as for all tastes here so
we will do a couple of things here now
show how to use these cards to build
health monitor and we playing two games
a progress poker and chasing the state a
progress poker is to agree on which
state or the team agrees in on in which
state they are right now and shares the
state is that the team
a agree on what where are we now
totally and what do you need to do next
so the course are we usually state cost
to visualize the health of your software
development endeavors so basically you
can think the scenario you go into team
you've never been there before you never
made not necessary button but you can in
quite the short while get the team to
agree on something where they are right
now in a way that was very hard to
express otherwise you would have to
express it in terms of documents or
something
that is more visible more tangible here
this is even if it's tangible it's more
abstract so it doesn't make names but
you have to convey on a particular
methodology you can use any methodology
you can use it to small teams big teams
I mean large organization you can use it
for any kind of software development
project any kind of application
the same thing can be used an issue is
being used in in a very concrete and
valuable way so let's look at this so we
are building a health monitor for be
used by a team we start by laying out
the course so these are the Alpha cause
these are the chords with this guide
every Alpha and it states so it's the it
it given overview of what states you
have so here you have a first date is
that the stakeholders are recognized and
you see underneath you cannot read it
but underneath or a number of
checkpoints you have to get the V state
you have to agree on but these things
have happened so it's recognized
represented you have follow the people
who are representative state coders and
should have a say in what we are doing
and
as in this way you add more and more
next line of alpha core opportunity and
you have all be caught here to the left
you have a V alpha the key elements that
you have to measure and to write the
United States how far you have reached
so you start by looking at take up one
of a course and you go sorryy you take
one core and then you remove it to be
left obviously I will show you later how
it actually works so what do you do we
had last year in Nashville Nashville a
presentation this is an Edgar conference
and had about 80 people and presented
the case where they actually got some
documents to start with and look through
the documents we had about 15 minutes 10
mins to the Troubadour and then they
went in and evaluated which state are we
and of course these states cannot be
100% unambiguous because it's just
English but the value is that they make
you as the team to think about things
have we reached this state and what do
you mean what does it mean is a
discussion point was that they need to
reach the state
what does visca tear me a reject point
and the discussion results in an
agreement enmity and that discussion is
more valuable than if there was a forum
where a formal definition of every
checkpoint would not give us anything of
value so and collect these documents and
then you sit in the team and agree on
which takes your items so for instance
you start by looking at the first car in
stakeholder and see is it are we
recognized having been identified
is there an agreement on which
stakeholder group should be represented
and so on and you check if they are
approved and if they are done the first
car on the top will move to the left so
that this one something you do you could
take the next car you see it is you see
that little thing here you see a shake
you took two hours to do so when you
take the next car and see if it's
represented a signals representing yes
yes yes they are wonderful second we
went to be left - then you get to call
where you find no this is not done this
is not done we have not got the
stakeholders involved they they don't do
what they're supposed to do that's a bad
thing okay it's really good to force you
to say this is not done so we cannot
really move forward if we move forward
we take a risk so we should be aware
that we take a risk
so this car will stay where it was not
moved to the left and that way you go
through line by line and agree on be on
where you are and some of these you may
not have done anything for instance
there was no no work done and where
you're working so you still have to
progress back and that means if you look
at record you will find this is not done
this is not otherwise risk you should
you should think about what do we do to
remove at risk
okay so in this way we can show where
the team has reached and helping them to
decide where to go next because
obviously to move to the next car is
wherever team should go
this has been used in several
organizations actually quite many
organizations around the world now I
have to tell you that this was first
done in in my company he by yochelson
International which is represented in at
least five countries I think it's more
but we have companies in five countries
and not come to Switzerland and we which
is they have a head offices by the way
so it's a Swiss company he and we have
been working with it for almost 10 years
so in my company we did these things for
five years and then we said no no no
this is not the right way to do it this
is should be the standard we need a
standard otherwise nothing will really
grow because if ours everybody will
create your own color and then you have
no foundation so if you try to describe
practices on top of the corner which we
will talk about in the next next
presentation so this has been used but
the in for five years it was used
entirely in my company then we started
to go to make this community and when we
did the community we agreed to give away
everything we had seen but not push it
so when we started to work on microrna
we didn't present our kernel to the
others we started to find a way to work
on it so this is actually in China it's
the team working on Internet
applications and they used this course
on the top of the a on the top they used
to cause do to measure progress and they
put them on task board so they could all
the reason about it they usually it's
because that I showed you but we were in
Chinese here and they were also in gray
him they helped the team to be a drive
they help them to set goals for the
sprint and we've retrospectives
so not only are these cards used to to
guide the team on what to next but
actually go into the tee and look at
where they are and what we haven't yet
done so creates retrospective and they
help us in imagine the whole
organization this in this case there
were many project many teams working in
parallel and we only all used the same
way or measure progress and in that way
we could learn from one another in a way
we didn't do before so this was in China
this is the Carnegie Mellon on the west
coast which is university teaching
software engineering and they had 28
postgraduate students but all were out
working in the industry and we wanted to
come back to learn more so they created
seven different teams of his 28 students
they could develop any application they
wanted it could use any methodology they
wanted but we used the essence kernel to
measure progress and health so to the
right we have the different 7 teams and
how they worked after 6 week we had
reached different states some of them
worked very balanced they progress each
dimension each alpha in every every
iteration
some of them focused on the early more
like what of waterfall approach which is
completely ok if you want to work
waterfall this works very well for that
as well but of course most people today
will use it for iterative development so
this allowed the different teams to to
measure progress regardless of what
practices were used which practice is
used
and they help them to discover problems
early because for instance if their
stakeholders were not engaged they would
get that question early and then now
they are not engaged so I cannot
progress and then we can say we have to
do something here or we take a risk so
that is the first game we play facing
the state and there is another game here
and that is - as well as you can show
where you the team is the course can
also be used to create checkpoints to
show where the team should be so they
use this through use of course and to
identify where it should be so we
imagine the situation that you have
you're developing software that should
be go to operations for deployment
you need to have support ready to take
on ownership of the system when you get
to that point and the critical legal
compliance requirements must be checked
so this is a real situation that you
have would it be good to have a
checklist that could be used to confirm
whether or not the software system was
ready for release so can you so how do
you would you confirm today that this is
ready for release we're a little risk
it's not an easy problem it's one of the
problems we have is always to define the
definition of that when are we done with
something so in this case we started by
saying which alphas do we care about
software system where should it be it
must be ready and ready is defined by
number of reports and requirements well
it should be addressed and fulfilled
so this is where we want to go get with
requirements opportunity addressed
stakeholders satisfied for deployment
and so on so if your fruit and all these
things help you to agree on what should
be done
so these checklist sufficient not
necessarily for instance you may want to
have something extra an extra check
point that you don't have yes please we
are going to give you 30 minutes for
questions that we am so it's better to
say we've unless it's okay so that will
be planned as planned and we hope you
prepare a lot of questions because that
is real fun thought for us so if you
raise a software system you can add
checkpoints that's it your organization
needs by the way as you can understand
it easy to scribble something on these
course if you want to answer so we is
very flexible what we provide is a
starting point for you so you can start
with something and learn from that learn
and you will definitely prove it so it
fits your needs better in the long run
so here is an example you want to have a
certificate in place before you consider
the software system and you just add it
on the card so as well as showing you
where the team is the course can be used
to create a series of checkpoints to
resent your development lifecycle and
help with governance and comply so you
can see now create your own life cycle
for for a software system usually
companies buy into one life cycle one
life league pushed on every project you
have instead of having different life
cycle which you can have based on the
kind of problem you're solving
so you know about these working in
sprints you have a iteration serie where
you set up a project and make a plan
iteration 1 to n you develop and test
you get feedback and the iteration 9 is
you release a product after every such
fakes or step that something needs to be
done you need to know when you can move
to the next step
that is not trivial to define this is an
example where you can use the course and
I'll show you this is another very
particular method to use for scaling a
drive by Scott Ambler and they he has
three phases each such phase must have a
definition and when you are done it's
not easy it's not easily done we have
this thing where you have a lot of ideas
and you find business cases and so on
and you have after the end of each phase
there should be some criteria for when
you can move to the next phase because
this is all about business decision it's
not about like iterate to develop where
you sit in in and and and move develop
feature to even teachers means that one
by one so you need to have phases phases
and needed in the software development
here's an example from one our customers
KPN in Holland in where they had an
approach for the number of phases each
phase identified that something needs to
be done in there before we started to
work with them and now I say we I mean
actually my company so VC was actually
done before SEMA was created or about
the same time as CMAs
created him so for every such face you
had to deliver some document and for
Eastern to the decision to fund and was
a couple of hundred pages of document
you had the review to see if it's Mossad
it was document based and that is not a
good measure so instead we added these
the colonel and we alphas so you can see
here that you have every row represent
an alpha the top row represent
opportunity and the green point
represents what needs to be done it's a
state all these little boxes represent
states so you need to have reached the
particular state to be able to move from
one phase to the next so this was used
here the value was that for instance
here opportunity be the progress of
opportunity we moves from state to state
he over these five phases so what we did
is moved away from signed documents to
recognize achievements that you really
can measure achievement without looking
at the documents so that was the KP end
so in general you can lay out your life
cycle I say I want to have in this case
three different milestones or
checkpoints decision to fund decision to
go live and decision to handover so what
would now using because so what would
you require to get the decision to fund
well you look at the course and you come
up with that the first four cause a for
opportunity must be fulfilled before you
can fund it and so on you see
the zoster system you have one call
needs to be mushy mushy you need to get
the state first state of the software
system before you can fund it meaning
you should have an idea of what this
that is a solution to the problem and in
this way you can describe a any
lifecycle using the cause very clearly
distinct something it is very hard to do
is just use English or communicate with
one as you see some coarse or lying down
that is the way we use when it's
optional if we need to get estate it's
optional
here's another customer
this is unitary in Germany the largest
reinsurance company in the world
represented in United States in in
Singapore and I think in many other
places
they started to use viscose and here you
see another way to represent it it's a
poster with sliders so you move and call
the states up and down the slider and
you decide to reach and to the left you
have a different states every different
checkpoints so in this case you have
four different checkpoints for a project
and you decide by with how far you need
to have reached to pass a particular
shape lot now they found they have
several different kinds of proteins they
had one they called exploratory and that
is risky projects new projects we have
not done it before so we had a different
milestone for that you should have a lot
of these kind of project here so you may
have a different milestones different
check points - that works for these kind
of projects when we have a standard
project this is more like adding more
features to an existing system they had
another and then they said we need a
fight check points for this one and
small enhancements
that's maintenance you made small
enhancements so they had another one and
they used the same course to define
these life cycles so and finally for
support we use the same key ideas to
define what are different checkpoints
and what is the definition of a
checkpoint definition of checkpoint is
done by specifying which states should
have been ashamed or V alphas there is a
an act unfortunately only on iPad and
iPhone I apologize but this may change
can easily change after today
so you and in this app you can actually
also you have a States so you can click
on it and you can for each of them each
of the year states you can check if you
have reached so this is a tool you can
use in your project it's free but the
risk you take is that you like it so
there particularly for things to
remember over what I've just said so
this is basically kind of summary a
seemeth relies on a common ground or
kernel we call this kernel essence we
cannot include seven alphas to be used
to measure progress on health so that's
another so this alpha concept is new to
software engineer
it relies on a simple intuitive visual
language you know we have so many
languages in the software community some
of them may know about you man these
languages are not easy to use the tools
are not easy to use I remember when I
worked at rational software that people
said that the tools could only be used
by priests these derivatives and whereas
most people are not really interested in
in the technology they want to have
support so we have been spending an
enormous amount of time to finally a
simple way to express ourselves and that
was one of the goals and then that we
play a software event has played as
serious games on our website I now mean
my company's website we have seven
different games that you play in
developing software but a really helpful
in doing it so now I come to the second
major section of his talk welcome to a
world of practices here I have asked
colleague of mine Ian Spence who is also
working in IDI my company and who has
been instrumental in the development of
a kernel and what we have here he is the
guy who knows more than anyone else
about how to use the kernel the essence
and the practices in real situations so
welcome again afternoon
okay so this is going to be a bit of a
lightning talk as you haven't got that
much of the timeless there's a few
things I'd like to add to what evils
been saying in the way we can use the
kernel as a foundation to empower our
software development teams to innovate
and share their practices and this is
where we can act as a worldwide
community to improve how software
development works and the interesting
thing is we're in a very competitive
market the world is changing the
technology is changing we can't afford
to stand still this is not an option for
the companies we work force and you're
not an option for a company like
yourselves can't imagine you ever
standing still but we need to keep
moving quickly and keep up with the
times
and as companies grow we need to be able
to share those things that have helped
us be successful with each other and
what you find in the software industries
there is this tendency to think there's
one true way of developing software
there's one method and what I want to
tell you is that there is no one true
way to develop software there is no one
method the agile movement has given us
lots of great things lots of practices
but there's a worrying tendency for them
to say these are the one true practices
tie them all together and produce
another big method
I mean Eva himself once tried to do the
unified process this was very popular
for maybe about five years or more but
if you look at the practices in it
things like use KC is iterative they
still go 20-30 years later I've been in
software development over 30 years now
and there's still some things I learned
there's still a foundation of things I
do today so if we can get and understand
those practices understand the
circumstances and every team's way of
working becomes a collection of
practices and when teams are trying to
do things that have never been done
before they will start to create new
practices
now if those practices can play well
with the others then everyone can
benefit from I'm sure many of you do
scrum in your projects we had a little
tour earlier I saw at least one scrum
board and somewhat a board saying look
with which we can have sprint people
within what has made scrum so successful
and kept it alight it plays well with
other practices it doesn't tell you how
to do the requirements right now when
people pick up scrum they think they
have to do user stories for example but
you don't you can do use cases you can
do features when I've spoken with my

he's done projects with use cases
Alistar come Alistair
Coburn is quite big in the agile market
in it like me and Eva he's done books
and things on use cases um but what
you've got to do and one thing Alistair
does on all these courses is he makes
everyone swear an oath of non-elites
we need to free the practices make them
independent there are practices I know
that have come out of Google in the
areas of testing other things that other
people pick up and apply but their
environment is not the same as yours
they might need to have different kinds
of controls we're using different
technologies so if we can free the
practices we can create an industry
where we keep competitive in our
software development we keep moving and
we can share with all our other
developers and communities around the
world and that's part of the goal of
SEMA so I'm gonna practice he's a very
simple idea it's just a repeatable
approach to doing something and what
we've done with the kernel is come up
with a way to make the practices be able
to play well together so you can see how
they fit together so they complement
each other do they
conflict with each other and a way of
expressing them so with the card idea
and I'm gonna try and skip a load of
slides in them on the fly Hey so we have
the card so just like the kernel was put
on cards we can put our practices on
cards just like the kernel had
is in it to show you the big picture
practices can add once to show you the
little picture if you're using user
stories for example I suspect you
somewhere you have a tall or you can see
whether they've been prepared like
they're ready for done whether they've
been completed whether they've been
accepted that's a classic case of a of
an alpha you'll have documentation to go
with that describing the story
acceptance criteria um when you're doing
activities like a workshop to find use
cases or a workshop to find user stories
it will be useful to have one
information to help you plan how long is
it going to take you should be involved
so we have activity cards that show that
information and they can also refine a
one on the Statler is a a checklist for
people undertaking an activity IV are
you ready to start have you done the
right things are you ready to end and
again right with the kernel you can use
these to communicate with each other to
find out where you are and to drive
things forward you can also plug and
play with the practices so this idea is
very powerful and just like surgeons
benefit from checklists this is a this
is anyone know what that is that is buzz
old Ewing's glove from when he went to
the moon he had on his glove a card and
on the card was a checklist right so
that him and Neil Armstrong when they
were on the surface could toward innate
their activities this is what we're
trying to do provide the information
that lets our team's work communicate
and collaborate effectively it's the
same it's the same kind of thing
with this you can and with the kernel
you can bring your practices together
plug them together safely you can look
at the other thing other things than
just the outfit in the kernel there's
some maps of the territory allow you to
when you add a practice you can add
information into the checklists in the
kernel so if you are doing use cases
when your requirements are conceived
maybe you should have a use case model
so it also
that's to come together and let's you
there's stuff to help you analyze and
understand your practices so I will skip
over that a little bit okay and this
separation of concerns is key you're
mainly software engineers so your life
software engineering practices you can
share with your colleagues but there are
other practices in your business that
you need to be cognizant of okay there's
always some kind of financial governance
and time recording and things like that
let's make that important but not
constraining how you develop your
software you're the experts on those
things and business practices as well
you have to work with your stakeholders
in your business how are you going to
communicate with them it's great to say
we will talk to you every day but it's
not always possible so you might want to
add practices in those areas so that's
the the key ideas is empowering teams
we're not trying to sell you a method
which you want to sell you an idea that
will allow you to explore and create and
establish for your team's the best way
of working to do that job and understand
what is the best practice in your
situation you can't set up something
that tells you the best practice in all
situations
now look at their strengths and
weaknesses and this is the the idea and
so I mean there's a couple of other
slides in here but I think we can just a
couple of case studies with a company
that had different life cycles and
different sets of practices for
different kinds of projects and
customers
another example is Fujitsu services
where they set up a set of practices
that they could use when they bid with
their customers that included both
waterfall and iterative ways of working
because the customer gets to set some of
these to some of the patsies not the
supplier but it also helped them pull
their tools together by lining the tools
up on the kernel they ensured that they
could use the same tooling regardless of
which practices the teams were using
which then frees the teams from being oh
I'm using this tool I must use this
practice and it
got as far as cards appearing in their
alm tool in Jireh that they use
sylvester when they got a task they
could see the cards and the checklists
that applied to that piece of work okay
so sure you've got the idea this is a
powerful idea it helps bring people
together it helps you build communities
where the practices come from they don't
really come from people like Evo and
myself they come from people like you
people who are doing the work doing the
innovation what we do is we meet you and
say that's a good idea we'll write that
down take credit all right
but we're scared so we can take out
those middlemen and have communities and
practitioners working working with each
other okay so I hope that's been useful
for you bit of a lightning view over
there now if you go out the slide deck
there's some more detail on the
different kinds of cards and things but
now I'll hand back to IVA for questions
and the final weapon so who wants to ask
the first question
actually I have a little bit more to say
yes I will be very happy when we get to
the questions so just to to give you
some kind of conclusion here see Matias
and the essence have been going on since
2009 we sought to write the paper for
dr. dobry on earth in need of a theory
in software engineering that was 2009
and it's fury basically was when to get
an understanding of foundation we
developed essence to stand on it be
taken in June this year
sorry and we have this book and a number
of other books we can highly recommend
you to read this
a so what you could do is find out more
about the practices you can go to our
website and now I mean idea is website
can also go to see Matt website where
you'll find a lot of material and papers
published by many big people and also
working on and so readable and playing
the games you can find the Alpha state
course and on our website and I see that
there will be some cards like this
available for you and them so you can go
and you can go to LinkedIn to
participate the discussions and uses of
it that's all we want to say we are in
five different locations right now in
have companies in five different
locations in in the US UK China
Netherlands and in Sweden so we are
happy to now go over to the questions
finally the customs working thank you
very much for coming and sharing with us
I want to preface that sometimes it's
nice to understand something by probing
how it's different than your
expectations so if it sounds like
criticism please just take it as
engagement I find that for a lot of
teams here at Google the goal isn't to
win it's more like to survive or the way
that well survive and thrive but in the
way that pragmatic programmers put it
we're not really building structures
we're gardening and we're trying to tend
to things and make them survive and last
and
and grow a lot of these methods seem
geared towards starting progressing and
completing which ignores the fact that
we need to have maintainability and just
long term continued progression without
ever completing could you please address
how we would use that for that situation
I think this is quite typical for a very
successful technology company which are
moving very quickly
but eventually it will be necessary that
you create an organization that is
continuously learning from one another
and it's very hard to do in
traditionally it has in in my experience
in so many companies that we have worked
with been very hard for companies to
create the organization that people can
can continuously grow their knowledge
and learn from one another so this is
one of the objectives of seemeth to do
that but there may be something more
into your question that I didn't really
grasp or comment are these method useful
for understanding the maintenance of a
system that continuously improves and
never completes so all the cards never
move over to the left so yes seems to so
an interesting thing about the kernel
and the cards is it's about
understanding where you are and then
putting that in context so you don't
have to have a fixed life cycle but you
can understand what it means say for
example for your software to be ready a
lot of companies do continuous
deployment or you can look at the
checklist to see if you've gone back
right maybe if you've forgotten a few
things and actually it's not ready for
deployment anymore so you don't have to
use them in a linear sequence you can
use them as a map to see see where you
are and then balance that against your
your goals and objectives
so they're useful in lots of
circumstances in terms of having a
healthy understanding in the team of
where you are who's involved what's
going on so that can be helpful in those
circumstances as well are you okay okay
yeah and you should stand here because
otherwise they don't see you but that's
a benefit for the people on the cabinet
I would like to follow up on this
question it also seemed to me that the
cards as far as we saw them were mostly
informed by projects that were just
started and had to go to completion so
the question is were these cards
actually informed by projects of the
type that were just described that are
very long-lived that evolved for a long
time over time yes okay so maybe we just
need to look more closely at the cards
and so first very important as Ian Ian
second the second part of a talk at the
end game is about adding practices on
top of a kernel the kernel is universal
it's something that every project would
encounter so two to reach two specific
things you need to add practices on top
of the kernel which every practice has
its own alphas it also introduces work
products which are not in the corner and
activities things you need to do so they
are working for all over the whole
lifecycle for not only a starting as you
saw also one example mu Nagori has used
this this model to describe different
like milestones for maintenance projects
as well and I have an unrelated question
I can imagine that you can use Seema to
create a map of all the existing
methodologies kind of where their
strengths and weaknesses and has has
ever been used to actually go into a
team
look at how they're doing and then maybe
choosing a different methodology for
them to compensate for the weaknesses
that you observe in how they are
currently doing
yes definitely in several cases but this
is very M is the expert but what one of
the things that has been done most with
the kernel is exactly that to help a
team understand the strengths and
weaknesses of their current way of
working and look to improve it so I've
used the cards just in retrospectives
with scrum teams because you know never
seen them before but you've been going a
while and you know you've taken your eye
off the ball in some way so you can go
and see see where you are and you can
take your practices like what you do on
post-it notes
stick them onto the kernel and see what
we haven't we have 50 ways of describing
this but we never talk to our
stakeholders she's seen some traditional
organizations so that's being used a lot
in those in those areas you can use
these things without making a full
commitment you don't have to build a
method you can use and just to
understand how your tacit way of working
is shaping up and I take it these were
successful interventions yes I mean that
they good thing about when you do the
cart you get a conversation started so
people find strengths and weaknesses in
their way of working and things like
that and then they use that to drive
improvement so yeah and they're very
easy to use every one of the most the
common mistakes that were done in China
at one of a big companies we have been
working with a really big company was
that they never didn't involve the
stakeholder so there was no thinking
about stakin we had stakeholders but in
a loose way so they the seven projects
were just the catsuit no one really
wanted a product so simple things you
know as when we talk about insertion
they had a fifth almost 50% of all
deaths that we have before were
disappeared by just the simple checklist
and this is very simple checklist all
the stakeholders in agreement
all the stakeholders first of all do you
have you identified man L very in
agreement and that is something we also
forget we develop us we we think we
understand what needs to be done
hello yeah thanks for for talk I just
wonder about the efficiency if you have
measured efficiency together with some
control group of teams kind of using
this checklist compared to any control
group and what the result was from that
then how you measure it basically do you
want to take you honest the the
interesting thing is the most of the
efficiency will come from the practices
that have been selected the kernel
allows you to understand how things are
progressing probably the most sort of
scientific studies has stuff from
Carnegie Mellon where they looked at
those seven people doing individual all
at the same time and there are believed
the papers being published on that and
that's quite interesting
you will look at those graphs on the top
right of that slide and you would make
some judgments about what kind of method
they're using and who's who's doing best
or not but what's interesting just shows
you the situation though what the where
I've seen this used what using it does
is it helps projects be more successful
but whether it makes them more efficient
that there's no no real evidence of
those con those kind of efficiency
measures very difficult ok so what was
the results for them successful rate and
nor how did you measure if a team was
successful compared to the other well
like I say this is about understanding
where you are what I did do a lot of
work at kpn where they had 14 programs
over 400 projects and they used a method
based on the kernel they did their key
way based around the results so had you
got the result you needed rather than
had you done it the way right and some
projects opted out
of working in this way and but everyone
was measured not just with not with the
colonel but with you know productivity
measures and things and the ones that
opted out and carried on in the
traditional way all did worse in all the
measures they had worst quality more
slippage than all of those things
now you can't attribute that purely to
the fact that the others had to have the
colonel involved is also the practices
but that that's sort of you have seen
that kind of separation but there's not
a lot of meaning in in our industry
there's not a lot of good science done
on the effectiveness of methods and
practices when the same holds for
agility and things like that let me add
to be svet them the colonel is just a
month old the standard we had a colonel
in my company and use this so we have a
experience from using a colonel the
Conor was raised that we had is very
similar to the standard so it's very
easy to move people if it were our
customers can easily move to the seemeth
color even if it were to us but what we
haven't seen is comparisons for instance
well people working with scrum and they
have been out and writing papers about
how they experienced how much better it
will be
by using seam at essence as a platform
for scrub instead of describing scrum
like in the use of the scan guide you
can describe it on top of essence you
can make a much more concise description
and it's also a they easy to find holes
in scan where scam doesn't really
support you that you need some other
practices and so but we would like to
see that kind of papers experience
reports it's not yet available so in the
last part there was some talk about
business practices as well the worldÃ­s
division into three
different groups so is this going to
stay a software engineering thing or are
you planning to branch out to practices
and all kinds of work in general I think
it and we have interesting enough we
decided or written when we start the
seemeth we took a hard decision should
we support more than software
development and we said we have to make
it successful for software development
before we go to other areas and the
other areas is typically systems
engineering business engineering and
there are other areas like projects in
general in Russia there is a group of
people that has from in cosa which is
systems engineering which has made some
minor in extensions to the existing
kernel to make it applicable for systems
engineering so that is a group of people
working there's another group of people
in also in Russia working on using it
for project Indiana
so not only software products or systems
but any project any and ever human
endeavor and finally there is a group of
people is working on using the kernel
for education in high school for high
school students in software so but this
is just the beginning the interesting
thing is that the academic community are
really taking on using it because the
first time in the history of the
software development academics can teach
what is B what is the core of software
development what is it that you always
do and they don't need to teach a
particular method in sweida friendships
one university teaches scrum another
university extreme program and a third
one Kanpur so when people come out and
they meet they're sitting there with no
foundation and have to fight to get to
some agreement have you seen that by the
way that should be normal but if you had
a phone because there is nothing really
fantastic about this curve it's just the
foundation we don't need to have a lot
of arguments about whether this is the
only it's not the only foundation we
could have had it's a one foundation and
if you don't like it make some changes I
mean you see they modeled their sales
process and other things using this way
what I like to think is that for too
long in software development we've been
looking at other industries and taking
their ideas I think it's time they
should start looking at us and taking
some of ours so hopefully if this is
successful within software then we take
other other other areas will pick up on
it so it could be generally applicable
I'd like to see that thing turned the
other way around
the software isn't manufacturing it
isn't building buildings it's a new
thing and we've got lots of new ideas
not just us everyone um so yeah you may
be touched on my question with this
answer do you have an established
process for operating the kernel itself
like not extending on it or updating it
for a specific team but the master
kernel itself or do you think that it's
universally true and will never ever
ever change so let me tell you perfect
can you repeat the question was if they
have a process for keeping the kernel
evolving the kernel improving it and
keeping it up-to-date you think it's the
one true kernel never needing to be
changed now first of all we don't
believe a is one true car we don't think
they believe a kernel we have now is is
the best one but it's a good one we
because as you know
the best maybe be enemy of good so a and
then when it comes to changes this is
thankfully now organized within object
management group so they have a
developed a formal process for changing
and there will be there's already
started the next version of a current
but workers always thought that
immediately when the standard was taken
so Marion's working on on identifying
problems come up with new solutions
server will be in maybe one years time
the new version overcome but it's not
dramatically it's probably not
dramatically new only if is really
dramatic problems but we haven't heard
anything actually we don't hear any
problems we only hear people are doing
well so if you hear and know any
problems we should please tell us we
would love to hear about them thank you
it's just a sort of on softer side of
things but you give it a given that
you've had a lot of experience you
crossed a lot of different organizations
why do you think it is that software
engineers in general seem to have such a
hard time arriving at methodologies for
developing software I mean I myself have
been experienced I've experienced
multiple different organizations every
time I go into an organization there's a
huge debate as to how things get done
lots of things are clearly wrong and it
seems to be very very difficult to
arrive at a good way of getting things
done and it seems to be something to do
with the culture I'm just curious to
know what your opinions are Matt so he
requested yes can you related so the
question was what why is it so hard to
establish a method in an organization
and what why do they when there's
obvious problems why are they so hard to
address just the cultural issue
other forces it like yes if ik question
it's really just I'd like to hear
general impressions given that you've
had a lot of experience across different
types of organizations yeah I I can give
one answer I would ask you and to also
add to it I think the general problem
here is that we we have so many
different contexts so if you for
instance every company think they are
doing something unique successful
company if you go to banks basically
every bank Finkley they know better than
anyone else the software people how to
develop software for banks you go into a
defense industry it's the same thing
telecommunication and the area after
area people think they have something
really unique and so basically they
drown in this that I so much
context-dependent thing so what we're
trying to do and and if you read our
book you will see in the front page we
quote Mitchell angular Mitchell angler
Michael angler is for right
pronunciation saw that he when he did
David he got the big block of Auburn and
he could see David inside that block a
mall but no one else saw it but he saw
and the only thing you have to do was to
shape away the things that were not part
of David that was his only job and we
have paraphrased that and said that we
have found the essence of methods and a
among the massive efforts and we take
away the things that are not essential
but are not universal for all methods
and if so it wears the people out there
they see it we have a particular problem
and we have no description the
foundation of a software engineering is
they have a method they have another
method they have a third one
and they try to do the best of our
knowledge having this basis where you
can stand on top and then add the things
that you think are great we love course
make it easy then just to add to that
the single biggest reason for the this
is they people don't break the practices
out so they think they've got to change
the whole method right and then they
have Wars about it yes all right
and they try you know they change the
things that don't need changing because
if I want to do this one I have to do
the others and then it just churns they
never give people time to mature or
experience and they don't allow the
people on the ground to to define these
things is so much more complex than
discovering single senior practices
because every method is the soup of
these practices and if that makes it
complicated and also when you create the
soup you want to add a little here and
you want to make it a little unique for
you so we are two two two two Taylor did
the joke and you know in the sixteenth
chapel in Rome and we should
Michelangelo
he made a painting in the ceiling and it
was damaged some years ago it was
damaged so we had to fix that damage
they couldn't ask anybody to do it so
they asked El Greco and he was a Soviet
Becker you know you are maybe most
prominent painter now alive and you see
that damage up there can you please help
us to fix it repaired el gecko looked up
and he took a step backwards oh no no I
can't do that but I can repaint the
whole thing and that is very much what
the people who create methods want to do
and even if I is a good
bass is too startled and we need to get
away from it and that is part of what we
do so you built basically a meta
language that lets people that speak
different methodologies to talk to each
other and you built a way to measure how
good they are not what they do
do I need to improve in the way I gather
requirements or do I need or in the way
I address the problem or requirements
not just gathering what I think it's
lacking from this model as far as I see
it is actually the cultural aspect and
the environment where these projects
operate you're gathering a lot of data
about what are what are good they are
but not in which areas they are good
our I am working in something that is
like highly regulated industry like
building the software for that airplane
or am i working in a very place where I
can be much more take much more risk and
the other side also the cultural things
like I'm working in a society where I
have I can address Authority easily or
not and I wonder why are not you are not
gathering this kind of data because it
will be extremely useful for the
community the software industry itself
you know if I have to address this
particular aspect and I'm this being
this particular context then these
practices cannot meet the best across
all the things that are ready and
available and once you have the data
it's easy to do the math to figure this
out automatically but there is no one
that's gathering this data on a very
large scale
okay so lady and summarize your question
oh thank you one and there is you know
native english-speaking person I am
speaking English so the question was
about the we've defined the kernel and
language for defining practices and
that's good but are we collecting
information about the context in which
the practices would work and the some of
the cultural aspects around things so we
have a team
that's one of the elements in the kernel
so we can collect practices around there
and stuff but is anyone collecting data
that would help you understand what when
it is that certain practices work and
when it is the certain practice it would
be a long thing that's a very good
question I let the en answer and I think
allowances as part of the C Mac
community and the research we hope that
by establishing some common ground
people will do this research and they
will gather this kind of data and
hopefully that will start to happen and
this practice is get added people need
to say in which circumstances these
things are applicable so we're hoping to
build that and I believe some of the
researchers are looking at this in a
small way but there's nothing
significant happening but I would love
to see app in person and it's sort of it
within the remit of the community to
look at those sorts of things but as an
industry we have a total sparsity of
that kind of information and I would
like to add to it to you know and as you
know a CMOS stands for software
engineering method and theory a we have
always believed from the start of is
that we need to get the academic
community to be portal it and not be
dominant I just described it that this
work needs to be driven by the industry
formulated by me
so I felt we need to have a general fear
in software engineering as underneath
whatever we do and if I see quite a
large group of people now working on a
general fear in software engineering
they have their meetings every year at
and present papers and there will be a
special issue in some magazine I don't
remember which it is about just the
general fear in software engineer the
what they expect to be able to do is to
predict what happens if you have this
situation
and you remove this practice we have
another practice will it be better will
it be worse and similar questions
prediction which is something we can
only do in a little few cases right now
so we'll be academics behind it we can
get better education we can get at
school so we actually teach something of
use the universities we do a third but
maybe could be more useful what it it
and also the research you know less than
1% of all research in software
engineering is ever useful that is to to
low number because we really don't know
what to heat but to hunt for can you
share some experience about application
of the methods in a context for of
geographically distributed teams so yes
let the responder with hard question
it's yes I mean the the ideas and the
kernel certainly the one that we had in
IJ I have been used in very large and
geographically distributed projects and
ones with outsourcing and by having that
common ground and being able to
communicate that help brings the parties
together but also you can understand
which practices are being done in each
each location which practices need to be
the same across all the people and where
you can have the variance so one of our
big adopters is a company called Muni
Creek and they are all over the world
and they've had to establish some
practices that everyone shares because
they're part of Munich but they don't
they leave holes in this setup for all
of those different areas to go their own
way so it can certainly help bring bring
people together and understand what the
interfaces are which bits of the kernel
they responsible for which bits of the
kernel are we sharing which things are
you doing oh you sing that quite a lot
answers your question
okay hi and the thing that interests me
is you started this talk trying to
address the issue we're up to a point
trying to address the issue of a person
changing an environment and switching a
team or something like that so in that
well in two teams that use different
methodologies or whatever so I'm
interested in have you measured or do
you have some useful data about how does
your your platform help people change
environments and adjust to a new
environment better because if I
understood correctly that's one of the
big issues you're trying to address and
if not do you have plans to gather some
really measurable data about that and
run some experiments thank you so this
is a really well Ian can can based on
his experience in working with big
clients Munich Re kpn and fritz so and
so on we also have a similar experience
in China where several big companies are
working with the essence as a platform
and again but we haven't really reached
enough people to be able to get good
enough statistical evidence where we've
used it in large companies with
disparate communities or companies are
bringing in different out sources then
having the common ground certainly
allows them all to take it up to speed
more quickly than they've done before
that measure is a qualitative measure
that's what they've said rather than we
haven't actually been in a situation to
do controlled experiments or measure
those timelines but we have seen teams
coming together and becoming effective
and getting on the same page of each
other more quickly than we've seen
previously
but it's anecdotal rather than measured
information any last question okay
so thank the speakers again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
