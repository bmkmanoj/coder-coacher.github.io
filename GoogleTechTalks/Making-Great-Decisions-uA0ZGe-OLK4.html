here my name is Adam we'll Dave ski I'm
an engineer from the New York office and
I'm delighted to welcome you here I I'm
gonna tell you something that's not
strictly true I'm a big fan of pair
programming which is true so I wanted to
get a book with two authors here so I
could invite invite them and get an
example of pairs speaking but well you
know they say open with a joke it
doesn't always work anyway without
further ado I give you David Henderson
and Charley Hooper thank you well I
guess I should try my pair of joke I had
a girlfriend years ago and I'd say to
her do you want a pair and she said no
I'll just have one
this is the book making great decisions
in business in life I'm an economics
professor at the Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey I'm also a research
fellow at the Hoover Institution my
colleague Charlie Hooper was one of my
star students of Santa Clara University
quite close to here 27 years ago so
that's our little background the phrase
work smarter not harder has been
repeatedly ridiculed in the Dilbert
comic strip not because it's a bad idea
but because it's thrown as a Drent as a
brick to drowning
employees to tell someone to work
smarter is like telling him to be
happier healthier or wealth or wealthier
it's not much help just to repeat the
objective
what you need is means of achieving the
objective our aim today and our aim in
our book is to help you achieve your
objectives we write wrote the book to
help those in business and those in the
business of life in other words everyone
to make better decisions what we offer
is both simple and powerful a better way
to look at the world based on techniques
we've either discovered or learn from
reading other literature who here has
ever driven through the corn country of
Iowa or Nebraska all right when you go
and you you just drive through it from a
certain angle what you see is this
jumbled mass but then when you get to a
certain place you look down you see
these completely straight rows well our
book is the book to help you see through
the corn Keith cornfield of life that
once you apply these techniques you find
that some very apparently complicated
problems can actually turn out to be
relatively simple and Charlie's going to
start with one
so if you've ever seen the cover of our
book and if you haven't just look up on
the screen
my brother Douglas took this photograph
in addition to doing work like this he
also does fine art photography and
wedding photography and I know this
might be surprising that I'm actually
related to somebody with talent but it's
true
and one of the weddings Douglass was
photographing years ago was at the
Stanford Faculty Club and he was
preparing to photograph the remaining
elements of the wedding and that
included the garter toss and the bouquet
toss and the cutting of the cake so he
went over and talked to the wedding
couple and he said you know here's how
I'd like to do it here's the steps I'd
like to go through they said well that
sounds great but we're not gonna be here
he said wife you know this is your
wedding you're the wedding couple
where's you going and they said well you
know we thought we'd be done by now so
um you know we scheduled a limousine to
come pick us up and as soon as the
driver shows up we're gonna leave and
that's because he's gonna charge us a
fine of $1 a minute if we don't leave
right then so think about this they've
planned four years for this event
they spent tens of thousands of dollars
they've invited hundreds of people to
their wedding and they're gonna leave
early before they finished their their
wedding reception to avoid paying a fine
of $1 a minute I mean what were they
thinking and maybe they weren't thinking
now if they thought about it a little
bit differently maybe they would have
come to a different conclusion so
somebody could have come up to them and
said you've already got the mariachi
band the deejay all the food the drinks
everybody's happy we could just extend
your wedding for a dollar a minute you
know we can extend it for an hour for a
mere $60 which is a small fraction of
what they'd already paid or maybe
somebody could have said well let's just
pass the hat around and collect money
from everybody and just leave the limits
limousine drivers sitting out there for
an hour they would have had to collect
27 cents from everybody at the wedding
to make this party go an hour longer
the other thing is maybe they could have
called a limousine driver and
rescheduled and they also didn't have to
leave right when the driver showed up
maybe they could have delayed at 15 or
20 minutes to photograph some of those
things and then left so have they
thought about a different leave they
might have come to a different
conclusion and now I want to tell
another story from from my life I call
this story saving my father's life I
grew up in Canada and I've been in the
United States for virtually the whole my
adult life in 1988 I got a call from my
cousin in Winnipeg that's near where my
father lives in Canada lived in Canada
and there was and he said My father was
suddenly in the hospital and there was
something about his tone that made me
wonder if he wasn't telling me something
I called the doctor and finally I
managed to drag out of the doctor that
my father had purposely taken an
overdose of sleeping pills and I was
puzzled I didn't understand why I had
talked to him two weeks earlier and he
did seem to be doing fine what had
happened so my next call was to the
airline and I went up to see my father
on the way up I had a very ambitious
plan it was to try to talk him out of
committing suicide but I realized there
are steps in that plan the first one is
to understand what happened what had
changed in two weeks that he had done
this because I didn't understand what
happened why he was the way he was I
couldn't do anything
so when I got there I found out that
he'd had these pains in his legs he had
polio during World War two maybe there
was a connection and he couldn't imagine
life without using his legs he was a
very active man he was 78 years old he
bicycle 20 to 30 miles a day still he
could not imagine life without his legs
so then the question I asked was what if
you could have some kind of surgery so
that you could use your legs again would
you want to live and he said well of
course and I said okay well then that's
the question we need to answer is there
a surgery so I go and find the doctor
it's a small Hospital in small town in
Manito
I find the doctor in five minutes I find
out yes there is a surgery which by the
way is something my father had not even
thought to ask now as I said it's in
Canada so there's a little there's a
little hitch here in Canada they have
socialized medicine which means everyone
lines up you have to wait for surgery
you have to get on a waiting list and so
the doctor said yes there's a surgery
but your father isn't in serious enough
shape to be at the top of the waiting
list so it might be months or years so
I've told my father both pieces of news
got him happy about the first piece of
news there's a surgery unhappy about the
second piece and he said I don't know if
I can wait months or years well then
there was a new thought there's this
country south of here where you can
actually pay for health care and you
don't have to line up so I told them I
bet you for twenty thousand this is a
1988 dollars we can get surgery that
will fix it I'll come up next week and
drive we can drive you down to Grand
Forks or Fargo and we got it nailed my
father says yeah but 20,000 you know
that'll reduce the amount I have to
leave to you and your sister
I mean he's got this house that's paid
for his retirement income exceeds his
expenditures even with him giving us
generous amounts of money every year and
he's worried about you know the estate
being 20 thousand less and I said I
think certainly speaking for myself I
can handle without the expert in so I
talked him into it and I had to walk him
through that reasoning by the way this
is one thing you'll notice when you
start applying these principles and I'll
get to the principles in a minute
I had to walk him through the reasoning
again and again through the weekend till
by the end he could recite their
reasoning to me because people get stuck
in the old ways people get sunk and you
need to keep pushing it's easy in the
sense that it's simple to apply these
principles it's not necessarily easy
psychologically but by the end of the
weekend I talked him into it and then
the kind of good news in a sense was a
situation got worse he went to the top
of the list and got his surgery in
Canada a week later so now from
Charlie's story and my story certain
principles emerge think back to the
wedding what were they telling
themselves they were saying I must we
must leave at five o'clock well there's
a novelist who wrote a novel in which
one of the characters says the only
things I have to do in life the only
thing I have to do in life is die you
know everything else is a choice so
there are all these things we tell
ourselves we must do that we mustn't do
they didn't have to leave at 5 second
one to think on the margin they put all
of this money into this wedding they've
planned it for months people have spent
we show a little calculation in the book
people have probably spent $60,000 on
the whole wedding and the marginal cost
of having an extra hour of this wedding
is $60 do you think that might be below
the marginal benefit
create better alternatives and Charlie
talk about some of the alternatives what
you could do you could hand out the Hat
you can do all these things in my
father's case the alternative to suicide
was surgery that's creating a better one
and then if he couldn't get a surgery
and kin of the alternative was to have
in United States and think about what
matters in both cases the wedding what
matters 60 years from now if they have a
good wedding and by the way they're not
starting really well here well they look
back and say gee I'm so glad we saved
that 60 bucks even with compounding
you're not talking huge numbers and so
those are you know those are some of the
principles that emerged from those two
stories and what we're going to talk
about next is some of the other
principles so ask what changed think
value think arbitrage know what you want
before you choose and biases affect the
best of us now ask what change is
actually a very good principle for clear
thinking and I'm going to tell you a
statement and you're gonna tell me
what's wrong with it okay fewer people
are attending major league baseball
games this year because baseball is
boring
I think he's got it I'm sorry okay well
if you think it's always been boring
then it's a lorry this year if you think
was exciting last year it's probably
exciting this year nothing's changed
I mean baseball hasn't changed maybe
there's different players in action and
there was a strike or something but just
saying that doesn't explain anything
because it hasn't changed so I want to
give another example I wrote a piece in
the San Francisco Chronicle back in 1999
at the time gasoline prices had gone up
in California by about 40 cents a gallon
and if you looked at what had happened
to the price of crude in that same time
it had gone up the price of a barrel
would translate into only 10 cents of
that increase so why the other 30 cent
increase well people's favorite
explanations and there were people
writing editorials saying this was that
the oil companies were greedy that that
was the explanation now you're laughs
and why right because they're always
greedy right and by the way that doesn't
distinguish oil companies from drug
companies or Google right I mean their
goal is to make money now Google does
give a lot of stuff away and thank you
very much for that I mean you've changed
my life in a positive way but the point
is that companies are out to make money
so there was no change in greed and in
fact if you had the greed explanation
notice how we're an explanation to be go
to the pump it's two cents less who they
came a little less greedy go to the pump
10 cents more they got a little more
greedy and in fact what I pointed out
was there been renewed refinery fine
refinery fires in California that meant
there was less supply and usually you'd
have arbitrage which we'll talk about a
little later where you would have fuel
coming in from other parts of the
country but because of EPA regs fuel
burned here Kent isn't produced
elsewhere we got have special a special
blend
so the ask what changed thing really
applies to that another alternative
another op principle is gonna show you
okay
yeah is that to create better
alternatives and this is my pillow story
in fact we almost called this book but
was - inside a joke hard heads and soft
pillows my wife daughter and I were in
Phoenix in 1994 and we were spending six
days there over the Thanksgiving week we
woke up the first morning and our next
eight especially my wife's in line next
eight and we realized it was these
really hard pillows so we had five more
days in front of us so we called around
to all these hotels and found out we
could get in a different hotel we'd pay
at least $40 more a night which is 200
more dollars to us that was a lot of
money in those days and then we thought
what I think you're thinking right and
it was wait a minute our problem is not
with the hotel room it's with the
pillows so let's look into pillows so we
went down to Sears on a Sunday morning I
lay down on the floor trying out all
these pillows got the top-of-the-line
pillows for 30 bucks each
90 bucks even if we gave him away we
were better off and in fact we figured
how to scrunch him into our suitcase and
so we created a better alternative come
up with you know buy new pillows because
that's what was bothering us so we've
told this story to a number of people
and just like happened here people go
buy new pillows and they say it as if
the solution is obvious but is it
obvious and what we found is most of the
time it isn't obvious to most people and
it wasn't obvious to Lance Armstrong now
as everybody knows he's the only time
only seven-time winner of the Tour de
France bike race and in his book it's
not about the bike he complains about
the hotels he stayed in and the food he
was served as he raced and trained
throughout Europe quote some of the
motels we stayed in made Motel 6 look
pretty nice there were crumbs on the
bare floors hairs in the bed sheets to
me the meat was mysterious the pasta was
soggy and the coffee tasted like brown
water
sounds like he's having a good time huh
now consider for a minute that Armstrong
lives in a 2.5 million dollar mansion on
a riverbank
he lives in Austin Texas not Mountain
View California
he drives a Porsche and at the time this
was written he was making two million
dollars a year
couldn't he buy his own pillows couldn't
he stay at better hotels or eat at
better restaurants or give his cook more
money to buy better groceries so for
perhaps a few thousand dollars extra
year Armstrong could have been
comfortable while he was earning his
millions so it certainly wasn't obvious
to Armstrong
otherwise it will be pitted you may be
doing some cement order they will have
to do it
that's a good point sir you can't even
get your own groceries or you can't get
your own girl saying you can't have your
own but you cannot have here you cannot
just go that way
real still well guess what well get your
name and give you a little footnote in
the second edition it's a little less
gutless nobody still could have gotten
could got back a better copywriter
groceries yeah better coffee right I
think this is not about the book was
written before you know kind of earlier
in his career but that's a very good
point good point yeah so I want to get
to another principle if you could show a
little principles again no principles
yeah yeah think value think about what's
value and one of the things I want to
highlight in this is the value of time
and by the way every story we tell in
the book is a true story unless we say
otherwise and in the book we say we're
making the story up but 95% of the
stories are true and if they aren't we
say so and this is a true story a friend
of mine an economist invited a Nobel
prize-winning economist to his school to
give a lecture and my friend went to
pick him up at his hotel and the
economist and and they were running a
little late as it was and they had to go
to the president of universities house
for a nice dinner a little socializing
and then the talk and when he picked him
up this Nobel prize-winning economist
said I've got this just raging headache
and my friend says okay let's stop in
the little drugstore in the lobby of the
hotel gets you get you some aspirin so
they look at the aspirin and this
economist says for 95 a bottle at home I
pay 250 let's go to another drugstore
my friend was looking at his watch I'm
saying but if he figures out a solution
I'm gonna make up a name this isn't the
name because I promised I would never
tell the name this is your lucky day
Gunther I'm gonna buy you the aspirin
now do you notice anything ironic about
that story given that was about a Nobel
prize-winning economist he should have
been the one to point that out
and by the way I don't want to dump too
much on them and fat there's another
point to make which is that we can all
do it we can all make these mistakes
I brought a novel up here to read last
night and I noticed it's overdue two
days ago and I thought 25 cents a day
you know I think I can handle that
you know why do a side trip to the
library and the way up here so think
value another one is think arbitrage in
our lives there are often arbitrage
opportunities that present themselves
well sometimes they don't present
themselves sometimes you have to notice
them and again I want to tell a story of
a colleague of mine who since retired
named Pat Parker who when he was 17 did
this he was sailing off Long Island and
this was in the late 40s and he was just
thinking about things his father was in
the minerals industry was in mining so
things like prices of minerals were
discussed around the dinner table we had
just got out of the Second World War the
price controls on all these things had
come off and the price of let of lead
had shot up he realized he was sitting
on a lead keel and when he did the math
he figured out his lead kill was worth
more than he paid for the whole boat so
he pulled the lead keel off took it to a
lead dealer sold it so put an iron keel
on the boat did full disclosure revealed
to the buyer that it's an iron won't be
as good sold that boat and thought wait
a minute
I can do that again so he bought another
one and did it another one did it hold
did a whole bunch of them during the
summer the 17 year old kid he arbitrage
he moved resources from lower valid uses
to higher valid uses kind of like using
unused time at the NASA airfield for
example and which was great by the way I
don't know why people are dumping on
that and I was at his retirement party
and I reminisced about this story and
I'd never heard him tell how much money
he'd made doing this this is in 1948 he
made $20,000 in 1948 dollars that was
you know triple the the median income of
a family in those days do you want to
just offer inflation
yeah I did that one what would you do
this 25 200 thousand here's some three
hundred three hundred thousand three one
thousand today's dollars yeah so nice
money and you okay thanks David
now what is the main measure of success
for any business
I'm sorry yeah and profitability right
profitability okay so I'm a consultant
sorry so how successful would I be if I
came in Google and said I got this great
idea let's increase profits okay I'm
gone I wouldn't get very far right
that's because this is like the brick
lifesaver the David mentioned in the
beginning you know you're throwing a
brick lifesaver to somebody you know
grab onto this it's like it doesn't help
because all we're doing is repeating the
objective we're not actually helping you
achieve that objective
so people who thought about this they've
realized yeah I can't go in and just
tell them to increase their profits I
need to do something more so they think
okay now what are profits now profits or
revenues minus expenses well tell them
to reduce their expenses yeah that's a
good idea
reduce your expenses well what am I
going to tell them about revenues okay
well revenues see how do your revenues
well you have good custom you know
products and services and your customers
like them and they buy them and they're
happy and they just went down the
sequence of kind of logical steps and
they ended up with the thing we've all
heard which is treat the customer as if
the customer is always right so I don't
know if you've ever seen you know some
people have posters up on their office
wall and it's rule business rules number
one the customer's always right number
two if the customer is wrong see rule
number one this is kind of ingrained in
our society and when I worked at Syntex
in Palo Alto years ago the HR people
thought that we needed to be better with
customer service so they told us the
following story this older woman walks
in a Nordstrom store and says I've got
four car tires that I don't want anymore
and I'd like to return them well
Nordstrom's doesn't sell car tires and
Nordstrom's doesn't sell any automotive
equipment Nordstrom's is a prestigious
retailer of fine women's and men's
clothing with very good customer service
and a great return policy well now the
question is is what did the clerk do
well in true to form
you know she's a quintessential
Nordstrom clerk clerk so she took the
car tires and gave the woman a store
credit but now we have to ask the
question is the customer always right I
mean is it possible that they're wrong
and what I'd like to do is tell a story
for my business and my company is
objective insights so when we get
projects we try to provide objective
insights so we had this project with the
small young company and they developed a
novel formulation of a corticosteroid
now corticosteroids aren't new and many
of you have applied one to your skin for
dermatitis or psoriasis it's normally
like a cream or a salve but this company
had developed a novel formulation they
were very excited about and the CEO
reasoned that the market in this country
for corticosteroids with 630 million
dollars a year back then so he thought
if our product is so good we should be
able to get 200 million dollars to that
at peak revenues so he said ok sounds
like an interesting project we took it
upon and we really looked into it as we
always do and we came up with objective
insights this is not an ad by the way
kind of so-so but one of the insights
that we came up with was that this
product was exciting because it was a
novel formulation but that also meant
that it was pigeon-holed into a very
small subset of the market so when we
went and presented our results to the
management team in the CEO our objective
insights we told them that the peak
sales for this product wouldn't be 200
million like they thought it would be go
17 million
well the CEO wasn't very happy about
this and he yelled at us and then he
kicked us out of the boardroom and I
think it goes without saying goodbye a
client
goodbye future business and they never
called us back
now years later this product did launch
and we tracked its history and we looked
at how how much it sold and whenever we
present the forecast for a new product
we present a probabilistic range now our
midpoint of that range was 8% to low so
the product did a little bit better than
we thought so here's here's our estimate
the product did a little bit better but
the CEOs estimate was a thousand percent
too high so I would say that we had
better objective insights than he had
now years later when he realized that we
were right and that we presented
objective insights you know I would have
thought that he would have sent flowers
or something but it never quite happened
so now the question is was this customer
happy no certainly not
did we do the right thing yes we did and
we've since done it other times because
if week out ow to a customer's
unreasonable expectations we see well we
lose our reputation and we cease
providing a service a valuable service
to our reasonable customers and our
unreasonable ones it's a deal back to
David our little gimmick thing later
yeah and so by the way just one thing if
the customer were always right there
wouldn't be Google I would have thought
of this in fact I used to think I almost
I guess I'll confess this I used to
write a column for red herring that's
not the confession by the way but I
found Google so useful starting around
99 2000 and I thought how they going to
make money that I almost contacted
Google to offer I calculated that my
gain from Google was about two thousand
dollars a year and I almost contacted
Google to offer to pay them five percent
of that annually because I didn't think
they could make money and and to even
write an article for free on the website
telling everyone else why's they should
do the five percent so it shows what I
knew about Google
so back to the customer always being
right there's a company called Best Buy
I'm sure you always heard of it you've
all heard of it that realizes the
customers not always right and in fact
they have divided their customers into
what they call angels and devils the
angels are the easy to deal with
customers they come in they get the
product they like it they're planning to
keep it the devil's are people who do
things like buy it bring it back the
next day and get a refund come back the
day after that and buy it as I'm out of
the box special of 15% off you know that
kind of thing and so they divided their
customers into angels and devils for a
hundred of their 671 stores and when we
wrote the book those hundred stores were
doing much better than the other 571 and
so the point is the customer is not
always right and that leads to something
Charlie wants to talk about yeah so
that's a good segue into another
principle which is that we bring up in
the book which is called factor 16 now
many people have heard of or familiar
with Pareto's law
Wilfredo Pareto was in a con Italian
economist like 150 years ago who came up
with this law of income distribution and
his law said the 20% of the people a
small group create 80% of the income and
80% of the people create 20% of the
income now people in this country these
days are worried about income
distribution and everything but as you
can see it's not an American phenomenon
nor our modern one goes back to Italy
150 so years ago now as we point out in
our book this applies to a lot more than
just distribution of income and as David
mentioned with best buy 20% of their
angels or their angels 20% of their
customers create about 80 percent of
their profits and on the flip side 20%
of their Devils you know their customers
who are devils create 80 percent of
their problems
now in our book what we do is we take it
to the next logical step which is if you
have this relationship 20% create 80%
80% create 20% we come up with factor 16
these people in this group are 16 times
as productive as the people in the 80%
group so let's say you have a
pharmaceutical product that is sold by a
prescription and you're going to promote
it to doctors who do you promote it to
you go to the doctors the really
prolific ones who write 80 percent of
the prescriptions and there's only 20%
of them so it's easier to get it and
there were 16 times as much am I gonna
do the next yeah okay now I want to do
something that involves you a little
more I'd like to volunteers on the
prizes five dollars it's not one of
these phony things when you give it back
at the end of the talk you know you
really get to keep it so do I have two
volunteers all right what's your name
Charles and Richard okay so we chose a
number in advance we just Charlie had
this little Rutan random generator thing
and to choose a number between 1 and 10
and so I'm gonna just have Richard go
first and we know the number remember
you okay we know the number what's your
guess and you and the closest one gets
the $5 three
number seven number was seven now
good for him okay the point is that if
you hear three your best the response
then should be to choose four because
you get everything above four and four
whereas if you chose say something like
seven you know you'd be well the seventh
was it cuz if you chose something like
one you'd be really way off if you chose
but what if he had said nine he would
have got it and we were gonna run this
experiment a bunch of times but we
didn't bring that many fives and also we
don't have that much time so here's the
point he made a good choice but what if
it had been what if the number had been
nine and he's said nine he would have
won the five dollars he would have had a
good outcome but he would not have made
a good decision the good decision is the
one you ought to make again and again
not the one you got lucky with there's
this old saying in sports it's better to
be lucky than than good
no you should be good and hope for luck
you can't plan on luck that's why it's
called luck and and so the point is
you've got to distinguish between good
decisions that get sometimes bad results
and bad decisions that occasionally get
good results that's a very important
distinction to make do you actually want
to show that oh yeah so we chose
actually since you generated you walk
you through it yeah so we happen to have
an example with with three is the first
number that's picked so let's say
Richard dick Richard Wright pick three
which he did and Charles picked one now
there's some probability eleven percent
the Charles would still win because 109
and he would win two would be a tie and
then he would lose if it was four five
six seven eight nine ten and three you
can't pick it again so he would lose if
it's one and that's one number out of
nine so it's 11% two would win if it's
two or 1/4 would win if it's five six
seven eight nine ten before and and ten
would win if it's seven eight nine ten
so it's four out of nine so the point
here is the highest probability is four
which is what Charles picked and and he
won but he could have picked this one
that would have been a very good
decision and he could have lost there's
a twenty seven percent twenty three
percent chance he could have lost now he
could have picked this one and still won
there's an eleven percent chance you
could have won so when you when people
judge decisions based on the outcomes
they're not judging the decisions
they're judging the outcome and to
really know if somebody made a good
decision you need to look at it this way
and see what they were deciding between
right guys said one thing sure Richard
let's say you don't now that we've gone
through that and you don't know it's
three okay what would you say now as the
number bingo you got and then second guy
we didn't make clear did we we did not
make clear year what he said being the
second guy given that that Richard chose
three could I be the second guy in
choose three and pocket half of it but
we didn't make the rules clear but I
guess it didn't matter
no he's not saying would have been a
good choice it's just in retrospect
right same interest we didn't say the
rules but the rules are you can't pick
the same number but what you could do is
agree with him that will split it
regardless yes yes and then you have
guaranteed two and a half the question
over there should be point seven eight I
think yet seven nights
you only got nine to choose from so it's
seven ninths yeah when we should around
it oh yeah this should be 0.78 in point
six seven point six seven yeah sorry
about that
okay way sharper audience in the fortune
500 firm we gave this yeah well not that
you guys aren't but the fortune 500
management we gave it to ya we gave we
gave this to the management team of this
company and they were just being so
obtuse I'm Dave and I are looking at
each other's like where's the hidden
cameras okay now who here has a list of
to-do items you know honey do list at
home that's just like so long and you
keep doing stuff and you never get to
the bottom Ryan I mean I do sounds like
everybody does and and work to the same
thing happens at work you know I've got
this huge long list I never get to the
bottom of it
okay this is what we call productivity
table and this can help you figure out
what to spend your time on what's most
valuable for you to spend your timeline
and a couple of ground rules if your
daughter breaks her leg go to the
emergency room you don't need to do this
if you promise to be in court on Tuesday
go to court on Tuesday you don't need to
do this and if you're just thinking
should I spend two minutes and check my
email you're just gonna check your email
anyway don't do this so this is kind of
for bigger things and what we did here
is we just kind of put down some things
that were on our list
you know select the best child the best
school for my the best child with the
value be higher you know place ads for
an old car do some tree trimming you
know fix and some boards on my deck
things like that
the next column we put how long it's
going to take and then for some of these
things there's a penalty if you don't do
it well so if I don't fix the boards you
know somebody might trip or fall through
and have some kind of a problem so that
would be a penalty and then there's also
rewards so for example if
you know I make do my investments and I
get a higher rate of return you know
there's some reward there so this is
what you put in the table and then what
we do is we look at the the weighted
return which is just the reward
basically press + the penalty and then
we divide it by how many hours it's
going to take and even if this is just
as far as you get what you notice is
that some of these have way higher value
per hour than some of the other ones so
right there that tells you maybe you
should be working on the higher value
ones at least first but there's one
thing we left off here which is that
life is probabilistic it's not
deterministic so I might not fix the
boards on the deck but I might never
have a problem - so now we're gonna do
to make it a little bit more complicated
so we're gonna put some probabilities in
so let's just say I signed a probability
50% that somebody's gonna trip and hurt
themselves
now you might disagree at these numbers
and that's fine you put your own numbers
in here these are these are our numbers
but now what we do instead of just
taking the the return of the reward plus
the probability we take the prime the
the penalty the reward and the penalty
we take the probability weighted total
return so we multiply the penalty times
its probability plus the reward times
its probability and get that and then
what you see here's a way to return and
here's the weighted value per hour and
what you'll notice is there's this huge
difference here so this one looking at
my investments is worth 2,500 an hour
who here makes 2,500 dollars an hour
well we thought there'd be a bunch
so this might be the best one to do
first but even the lowest one which is
$25 an hour that's still a reasonable
return its 1/100 as much so if I'm gonna
do something maybe I should do my
investments first and then my
tree-trimming only after I've done the
other you're right the probability I
just well we actually cover that exact
topic in page 55 in the book okay I just
want to say that you're right in the
probability and you're right that if
someone and the experiment I do with my
students I say I come in with a loaded
gun you know six chambers all loaded I
aim it you know to a two feet from you
I'm a don't have to be a really good
shot what do I have to pay you to take
that shot and of course I get the answer
infinity almost always interestingly a
student from a very poor country I teach
military officers said if he if I made
it ten million he would do it because
he'd have that to leave to his very poor
kids but the typical answer is infinity
and as you say a finite number times
infinity is finite but here's the thing
we're taking a prom all probability of
dying and if we look at the way we
behave we treat those probabilities of
dying as finite in the sense that we
have to be paid only a finite amount to
take them so economists have looked at
what extra wage do people make to take
risky jobs and they can back out of that
what we call the value of a statistical
life and then you just would put that
number in there and weight it and so on
well and that's one answer another
answer I went to Stanford for grad
school and I studied under
rot Ron Howard not not the actor happy
days brilliant guy but he came up with
this concept called micro boys now you
would never sell your whole life well
most people wouldn't just because you
wouldn't be able to enjoy the money you
got but we sell little bits of our lives
every day you sold a little bit of your
life when you drove here today in your
car because there was some risk and so
what a micromort is is you take little
tiny increments of risk and you sign a
price to it so micromort is a 1 and a 1
million chance of dying so now if I buy
a safe car or buy an unsafe car I'm
paying more Mike remorse to buy the
unsafe car and there's a price to that
and let's say you put a price of 20
million dollars on your life each
micromort would be $20 and you can
actually calculate if you want to go
through it we give a little example in
the book that that depending on how long
you keep that unsafe car how much you're
paying in terms of micro morts versus
the more expensive car we have one more
oh yeah
yeah five minutes go you never see the
enemies live so you get something that's
local talent we never gonna get to it
that's a hurt and and you shouldn't yeah
you shouldn't you never gonna get to it
what's the alternative you get to it but
you didn't do one of the higher value
things and then as you say create other
alternatives hire someone to do it so I
hire a gardener for example I want to
spend eight hours I'm gonna go fishing
right cuz and as you know some other
intangible and you would just try to
come up with something to make this work
you would come up with some monetary
value of the fishing you know what
what's the value what would I pay 500
for the fishing you know stuff like that
yeah I mean these these are just values
we assign so like if painting your house
was up here you know how much would you
pay right now if somebody just said tada
your house is painted you know and
that's maybe the value put up there
okay another principle we'd like to talk
about is that biases affect all of us
we're basically all biased and once we
know that then we can make better
decisions because we realize we're
biased and the problem is is that people
form mental models about the world but
our bias perceptions go into those
mental models and so we might build the
wrong mental model or come up with the
wrong conclusion so here's an example
years ago I was talking with a female
colleague of mine about electronics and
computer stores in this area and she
said confidently and unequivocally I
will never again shop at Fry's
Electronics so whoa you know why not
and she said adamantly they
discriminated against women I asked her
well how do they do that you know their
employees and she said no the customers
they ignore women shoppers and don't
help them I said well I had exactly the
same experience at Fry's I mean I go in
there and they never helped me
so I just assumed that Fry's is trying
to save money so they could have really
low prices she on the other hand
associated herself with a group of
people women and when she didn't like
the experience she had there she
extrapolated to that group of people
women and she said Fry's doesn't treat
women well whereas I was thinking fry as
was just trying to save money
it's much yeah okay now there are lots
of times when we face bias and so one of
the stories we tell in our book is about
a man who kind of was very clever in
creating other alternatives to figure
out a way around bias so it goes to our
other principle create better
alternatives there was a black man in
the early 1940s in Chicago who wanted to
borrow $500 so he could start a magazine
aimed at a black audience and he took
his plan to a bank and it was run by
white people and the guy looked at his
plan and said very good plan
unfortunately we can't lend you money
in fact he was told quote boy boy
we don't lend money to colored people
unquote and this man said but you think
it was a good plan right he said oh yeah
can you mention can you recommend a
place that does lend money to black
people and the guy gives him a name and
says oh and you think it's a good plan
would you be willing to write a letter
to that effect he says sure it's not
breaking any of our rules so he writes a
letter the man goes gets the loan starts
Negro Digest goes on starts evany and
jet and his name is John Johnson and
just because he created an alternative
for getting around this bias rather than
letting it stop him don't ya don't
forget he's a billionaire too
oh yeah he died as a billionaire a
couple of years ago now another kind of
bias is we net tend not to do what we
call check your base so let me give an
example it comes up every year at a
certain time of the year when there's a
newspaper story about what kind of car
what's the one you know what kind of
cars get stolen and you'll see the list
and it's typically got Honda Civics and
Honda cords and stuff like that and the
way it's reported oh you know you better
not have a Civic or an accord right but
what they're really doing is they're
looking at the number of civics that get
stolen the number of Accords that get
stolen the number of BMWs that get
stolen
how many BMWs are the role of to civics
way fewer way fewer so in other words
what they forgot to do was check their
base to take the numerator the number
stolen over the base over the
denominator the number out there and
that's a very different number I mean a
BMW is much more tempting to steal
although I'm not sure it's as good a car
but that's another story
now another example of checking your
base or not checking your base and it's
a much more serious example is in the
intelligence leading up to the attack on
Iraq this came out in the in the later
look back at what had happened the US
authorities had reason to believe good
reason to believe that there was this
kind of tanker truck well they pretty
much knew there was this kind of tanker
truck the Saddam Hussein would use to
transport chemical weapons and they had
all these aerial the satellite photos
and in the few weeks before the invasion
they noticed a dramatic increase in the
number of pictures of these tanker
trucks more pictures of tanker trucks
but they didn't check their base why
were there more pictures of tanker
trucks because the United States was
planning invasion and if they're
planning an invasion they're gonna take
more satellite photos there were more
pictures of tanker trucks because there
were more pictures
another principle which we laid out near
the start was think simple Einstein once
said make a problem as simple as
possible but no simpler and sometimes
you have a problem you're looking at
where you've got all these variables all
these things and it would be very costly
to get a lot of the information to solve
it and get everything nailed down not
always but sometimes you can do what we
call use thresholds you can say if this
certain variable is above X or below X I
know my decision and Charlie's going to
give you an example of that that he used
in a consulting project so here's
another project where we provided
objective insights but instead of
kicking us out of the board room they
were actually very happy with us so we
don't get kicked out of every board room
this was for a young small biotech
company and they developed an hiv/aids
medicine and this looked to be a really
good drug but the thinking within the
company was that they're just this
little small company they don't know
what to do with this big drug so they
were gonna license it out to the big
pharma company that had the huge sales
force and the marketing teams and the
experience management and of course the
big pharma company would sell more of
this product than the little company
would right but we said you know we'd
like to look at this and analyze this so
we wanted to look at the two cases keep
the product or licensing now if you keep
it you have to set up the whole
marketing organization sales all that
stuff it's very expensive but when you
get revenues you get to keep a hundred
percent of it now when you license it
out it's easy you don't have to set up
that stuff but when you get revenue when
when the revenues come in you just get a
percentage of it
that's your royalty rate so we went to
the management team we said ok the big
pharma company is going to do better
than you'll do how much better you know
10% 50% give us a number and they were
very uncomfortable giving us us a number
so we weren't forted what we did is we
used thresholds as David said and we
went back and looked and we compared the
two alternatives and made them equal
how much more would this big pharma
company have to sell just to break even
on that decision turns out the answer is
5 so for every hundred bottles that the
little company would sell the big
companies have to sell 500 now we took
this to the management team and we told
them 5 just to break even if it's less
than 5 you should keep the product if
it's more than 5 you should license it
out and we told them 5 5 is the answer
and you could just see their jaws drop 5
said no way is gonna be 5 you know they
were thinking maybe 30% or 50% more but
no way no way would it be 5 and so we
had set the hurdle rate and we knew that
reality was going to be below that and
so this company did take our advice and
they kept this products and they've been
very very successful
since then ok by the way Adam how long
do we have to go so I want to leave a
little time for Q&amp;amp;A at the end
no chill now I'm one if we should do the
airline example versus these closing
thing I'm gonna do the closing
oh yeah okay I'm gonna skip something
let me just tell if I don't wants to
wait around I don't know if you have
time but we show you this nice little
numerical example of how do you decide
whether to buy a ticket in advance to go
to a meeting and imagine you're paying
for it not your employer to go to a
meeting knowing there's some probability
the meeting will be canceled and we just
kind of walk you through how to do that
but I want to end with what we call it's
our last chapter in the book do the
right thing we've focused so far in our
cut talk and in the book in the previous
X number of chapters on expanding your
alternatives having more options you
know doing better for yourself we
haven't said a thing yet about ethics
about making good decisions about making
ethical decisions and now I want to talk
about that and it turns out if you use
this same way of thinking that we've
applied you will get to the conclusion
that you ought to be pretty ethical I
mean you ought to be honest not to
defraud people steal from people murder
people stuff like that and I want to say
why because offhand it's might not be I
mean it might be obvious to you because
you brought up that way but it might not
be obvious in a very narrow cost-benefit
sense and that's what I want to show
think about if you start stealing from
people it seems like you'll expand your
alternatives right whatever you had but
you and I are equal you start stealing I
don't you have more options because you
steal stuff but here's the problem as
you get found out your options your
other options actually start 3 shrinking
the example we give in the book is let's
say you decide to be accountable people
would start avoiding you especially
around mealtime
and as Adam Smith pointed out in
civilized society he stands at all times
and need of the cooperation and
assistance of great multitudes while his
whole life is scarce sufficient to gain
the friendship of a few persons in other
words we have this incredibly extensive
division of labor everything you're
wearing today I guarantee you did not
produce we've got this incredibly
extensive building division of labor the
required cooperation from a lot of
strangers you're going to get more
cooperation by being more having a
higher reputation being easier to trust
and so on because otherwise you get
found out now it seems like a famous
counterexample is PT Barnum who's famous
for having said there's a sucker born
every minute he didn't say it in fact he
said about someone else who tried to
cheat people poor soul not to understand
that the hardest way to make money is
dishonestly for that same reason I
talked about your narrow your options
shrink and in fact here's how he made
his money when the circus used to come
to town he ran a circus when the circus
used to come to town the circus would
rob you they actually had employees out
there to rob the crowd and other
employees to go to the where the people
in the crowd lived and robbed their
houses because they're at the circus and
that word got out very widely and PT
Barnum said hey I got an idea
create new alternatives we will
guarantee that with our circus we won't
have people robbing your house or you
and we'll even have some plainclothes
people looking for the robbers and
that's how his circus did very well
now think about so what we say is you
know the US Constitution Constitution
day was last September 17th I gave a
talk on it down in Monterey Peninsula
and I pointed out that the Constitution
is a set of things that the government
cannot do and then a very narrow list of
things that can do its enumerated powers
if it's not on that list can't do it
what we say that you should have your
own Constitution so instead of We the
People I the person have a list of
things you won't do so if you're tempted
you go back to that and it's a way of
saving and thinking and saving on
thinking about temptation just no I
thought that went through when I was
really calm and I wasn't as drunk and
that woman you know that very attractive
woman wasn't there and so on and so I'm
gonna go back to my rule and I'm not
going to do that right and so you ought
to have your own Constitution and I want
to just end with one quick story to kind
of the moral the whole thing I was a
friend a teenage son of a friend of mine
years ago I live in the Monterey area
was sitting around talking to these
other teenagers and I was listening in
on their conversation and one of them
said wouldn't it be neat to get a job at
Pebble Beach that's kind of a dream of
you know seventeen year old boys and in
that area and one of the other guys says
well a man as a matter of fact I have a
part-time job at Pebble Beach and
everyone goes really really how'd you
get that and he said oh I just went down
and applied
so our lesson to you are moral to you is
just go down and apply thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
