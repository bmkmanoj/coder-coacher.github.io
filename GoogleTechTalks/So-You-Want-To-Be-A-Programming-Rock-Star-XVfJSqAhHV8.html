and I'm a program manager with ng D U
and I'm happy to welcome Joshua Carey
offski who's the founder of industrial
logic and he's going to tell you a
little bit about an e-learning
opportunity that we offer here at Google
through industrial logic and he's going
to show you how you can become a
programming rockstar using it so Josh
thanks very much
let's pleasure it back here at Google
we've been teaching workshops here in
person for about four-and-a-half years
and over the space of that time we been
working really hard to make elearning
that could effectively replace us in
learning
got a really bad name I think in the
early days more than 10 years ago people
would take PowerPoint slides and sling
them up on the web and quality learning
and we we kind of we like a challenge
and one of the challenges we've been
going after is how to automate ourselves
as you know practitioners and
programmers we routinely teach workshops
and I think the best kind of people that
that teacher also hands-on programmers
because if you're not doing hands-on
programming you just don't have the
goods to deliver so we keep ourselves
with our hands dirty quite a bit but we
teach a lot of these intimate you know
twelve person workshops let's say and
they're wonderful but they don't scale
they do not scale company the size of
Google needs you know there's hundreds
or thousands of Engineers who need to
learn really important design techniques
and we teach those but we said how can
we make this be scalable how could we
replace ourselves how could we create an
experience online that would rival what
we do in person and in some cases we
even wanted to make it better than
in-person how could we make an
experience that would be better than
in-person we're constantly pushing the
boundaries to make that you know happen
and I think well what I'd like to do
today is demonstrate what we've done so
you can get a feel for the kind of
e-learning that you actually already
have access to here at Google Google's
and GDU Department have worked closely
with us to offer this to you so this is
really kind of a way for you to just get
a view of what's what's available so I'm
going to spend probably at least half of
this talk if
more programming live for you and
uploading some of my results and seeing
some of the graphs that we generate and
stuff like that so if you want you know
ask questions along the way I'm happy to
answer them let's get started first off
I'm showing you a home page here which
has numerous albums on it okay
the main album's that we've built over
the years have gone around design
activities design things like code smell
sweet each code smells because we think
it's important to know what bad design
looks like so you can know how to
produce good designs so the whole album
just devoted to code smells then of
course refactoring is how do you clean
up code smells how do you improve the
design of existing code all of these are
available in Java C++ we also happen to
do them in c-sharp then we get into
micro testing how do you write good unit
tests right unit testing here is
extremely important it's important in
companies around the world well we've
decided instead of starting by teaching
people test-driven development let's
teach them how to write good unit tests
first and I'm going to demonstrate some
exercise in there as well and then
there's testerman development this is
the probably in my opinion one of the
most important advances in software
development easily in the last decade it
turned programming upside down in that
it basically said start out by writing a
failing test before you write any code
and get in that cycle we're gonna see an
exercise that I do in there as well more
about mock objects and fakes and stubs
and all those things we are we've
covered a lot of the Google's own
technology so we use G tests for C++ how
many of you here are C++ programmers
okay good
maybe I've almost happened excellent so
G test we use extent that's the only
thing we use and jima we also use gmod
quite a bit
for Java we we're using J mock and going
through all stuff like that so we also
get into legacy code how do you deal
effectively with legacy code there's
that's probably what most of us are
dealing with and there's a bunch of
material on that finally begin to design
patterns we have a three-volume box set
on design patterns this represents about
15 years worth of work over a lot of
pain in building this material with my
colleague Brian foot so there's a lot of
material here this is part of our design
patterns workshop and we've you know
automated a lot of this so let's let me
um I want to jump in for a second to an
example of what we're doing first off
our operating opinion is that most
people don't have any patience with
anything on the web so you've got to
make this extremely compelling to keep
people's attention so our design says
that every page has got to hold your
attention so for example if I wanted to
study the the command pattern okay one
of the first things I'm going to see is
some image that's hopefully going to
stick in my head and actually I'll go to
full screen mode here and here's an
essence video we have lots of little
videos three minutes long typically
which which teach the essence of
something so this is the essence of the
command pattern
I find it to be elegant versatile and
powerful I've used it on web projects
it's used as the backbone of organizing
tasks and shaking it girlscouts forward
it
so you get the idea
so that's giving the essence of what
that pattern is all about then we're
getting into lots and lots and lots of
examples our general style is - it's I'd
call it almost death by example we want
to give you lots of real world example
code so you can look at it and
understand what was happening there in
the design every page usually doesn't
involve too much scrolling so it's all
right there
if you don't know what a composite is
you just put your mouse over that and
learn about a composite for example
here's a player's page which gets into
very specific design concepts of you
know what's the context what's the
command what's the dispatcher for the
commands and you can look at another
example which is slightly different from
the others so we try to give you lots of
you know short quick information on how
to understand the pattern quickly and
then we get into some really intense
quizzes this particular quiz here it's
one page right but this thing could take
you easily a half an hour to do because
there's lots of source code here that
you're gonna be studying okay and
actually I'm gonna see sharp version of
this we have all three languages so some
test code to study so you'd be studying
all of this code and then ultimately
answering these questions here now when
you answer the questions I'll just
randomly answer some you can show a hint
okay it says three out of six are
correct maybe that's gonna make us think
a little bit deeper about you know what
the answer should be ultimately I'm a
hit show answers and I get commentary on
each and every one of these these
entries here if I don't agree with one
of them I can post my thoughts I can
answer a fasiq a question or make a
comment or point out an error so it's
really meant to be two ways we want you
to be interacting with this as much as
possible so and we usually get back to
you sometimes within minutes but usually
definitely
in 24 48 hours okay so I'm gonna now
take us to some live stuff I'm going to
go into our refactoring album the
refactoring album has grown over the
years and the material is continually
growing but we're going to look at a
particular lap here's another lab that
we first started out what's called the
automated refactoring lab and it's
basically talking about how important it
is to use automated refactorings so we
we want you to quickly learn about some
refactorings that are important like
rename method extract method some of
these are pretty basic there's a video
to show you using these these
refactorings I won't show that right now
and then there's a lab to give you
experience so here's what we're doing
we're saying there's some before code
and it looks like this okay it's pretty
straightforward an employee a programmer
and manager and there's some after code
okay we want you to get from A to B
using refactorings using as many
automated refactorings as you can even
if you're doing C++ we will watch what
you're doing now in the old days for us
so five six seven years ago we would
reflect we'd use reflection to look at
your final solution or in the case of
C++ we would do some other fancy things
to look at your final solution so we
could say yes you got from A to B
correctly but how did you get from A to
B what did you do did you sit there and
hack away and have failing tests for 30
minutes and then finally get the test to
pass or did you use some of the built-in
refactoring support that's available to
you did you run the test frequently we
wanted to know not only did you get to
the to the final design but how did you
get there and that's one of the things
we've worked on very hard in the last
year so I'm going to show you doing this
actual lab here are some instructions
for how to do the lab some things to
keep in mind about what we'd like you to
do and here it's saying you know how
many people are beginner intermediate or
advanced
I actually have examples of this so
here's one of these labs that's live on
our web on our website and here it's
showing right 36% are considered
advanced when they take this lab 59% are
an intermediate 4% are beginner okay
that's a specific lab it's the one of
our hardest labs so we like to show
statistics that you can kind of get a
feel for how hard something is or not
now I'm going to actually do one of
these labs for you so we've made it
relatively easy to import things that
just to get back to the presentation you
would just download the code here on one
of these pages and we've made it ultra
simple to import it into Eclipse we also
support IntelliJ right now for the
analysis we're doing we need you to use
eclipse will eventually support
intelligent so I'm gonna actually do
this work right now I'm going to come in
Eclipse here I'm going to import an
existing project into the workspace it's
going to be the automated refactoring
problem from Java okay there it is
so I'll close all these and I'm going to
run the tests
okay they're green so time to start
doing some work here's the programmer
class and I happen to know that the
instructions are saying to me while jobs
done should really get renamed to be
jobs completed and jobs done counts
should be called jobs completed counts
okay so I'll run the tests again good
now time to do some pull-ups refactor
pull up I'm gonna pull up jobs completed
job skipped jobs completed count and job
skip count common mistake people make
when they were factor is they hit the
finish button too quickly if you hit the
finish button you get to miss something
important you could be pulling up from
the manager class at the very same time
these are siblings programmer manager
can pull up from both at the same time
okay actually what I'll do is I won't
pull up from the other one I'll just
pull up from this one for now I'll hit
finish so it did the work I'll run the
tests still passing okay so here's the
manager class now and it still has these
methods that it really doesn't need so I
should be able to just get rid of them
because it should be inheriting them
let's make sure that's okay okay it is
alright and now we see here there's a
programmer class that has a perform job
method and a manager class that also has
a perform job method and a method called
responsibilities I want to factor out
perform job I want to move it up to the
superclass but you know I have almost
the identical thing here right it's
almost the same so what I want you to do
is highlight this code here and refactor
extract method I'm going to call this
responsibilities okay and then I'm going
to take this except a little work and
I'm going to inline it okay and I'll run
the tests again good now I should be
able to say refactor pull up I'm gonna
pull off the perform job method okay I'm
also going to pull up responsibilities
but and this is also not that well-known
here's a little drop-down list box
that's the epitome of bad UI design
right you how would you notice to chop
down this box here you have to know so
you click and you say declare abstract
and the destination and I say next I'm
going to do it for a manager as well
and it's gonna do all this work okay so
I'll say finish and it did the work and
I've got a problem it's not happy about
something responsibilities I think it
has to do with the visibility well let
me just run the tests and of course
while there's errors so I got a problem
if I click here it's gonna change the
visibility for me and I'll rerun still
have errors so it's still unhappy about
something and it really wants this to be
protected so I could do it this way I
could just start typing or I can use a
refactoring I can say refactor change
method signature make this protected
okay and let's see if we're okay now
still have errors so this is a common
situation you you run into here it
doesn't know that this should be
protected so it's just gone backwards so
I'm gonna have to tell it what to do by
typing sometimes you have to type okay
so did I just spell it bill yes I did
misspell it okay let's use a rename okay
and I know that it should be okay now
so responsibilities is here I have to if
you don't spell things right you get in
trouble
and it's really gotten itself confused
so this thing here needs to go bye-bye
and there I think we're okay
the overridden okay fine so well I'm in
a red bar situation here so I've really
messed up and and I really what I should
do is backtrack at this point right but
what I want to do at the moment is stop
and I'm gonna run our little archiver
right here and this will generate some
output for us okay so I can upload this
right now and start to get some feedback
if I want to but what I would like to do
is at least get past my compliation
problems so I will come here and make
this protect it and now it's of these
compiling so at this point let me run
this test ok I'm back to green awkward
little session there but I finally got
back to green so I'm not really doing
great refactoring in in theory if I did
something and I got into a red bar
situation I would have backtracked a
little sooner let's just see what the
analysis now tells us I'll run this
again and here's our upload and now I'm
going to upload this lab so the next
page says go ahead and upload and I'm
going to change languages here to Java
and I will upload this
okay it's done the upload on this next
page it seems I've got an 83 percent
score so I didn't do everything that it
wanted but I did pass numerous tests I
passed that it found the right classes
okay it had the right inheritance
hierarchy the correct methods are on the
class is great sufficient testing was
performed I did run the tests I did a
rename method i reaiiy sorry a rename
field and a rename method I used the
automated tools to do that I pulled up
some fields I pulled up a method at one
point I pulled up the perform job method
with that little cool technique of
declaring get abstract in the
destination and I pulled up from two
classes at once we're actually testing
to see if you know how to pull up from
two classes at once you can do with the
tool so our tests are looking to see
that you actually did it
now here's a nice pretty chart which
kind of shows what happened so this is a
number of her factorings on this axis
and time on this axis here and as you
see things were going along pretty well
until the bar went red and the bar was
red for a pretty long time until finally
it went to green over here so this is a
sort of a mediocre refactoring session
it's not it wasn't that great it wasn't
terrible so I got an 83% question
well it did ultimately work Oh
it knows that it works if it won't even
show this graph if you can't compile it
so the code write the codes now
compiling and running if I had uploaded
it prior to that it would have rejected
it it says well you have to give us
compiling code we did see it go green it
goes between right here do you see that
edge so right here a little past five
minutes it finally goes green any other
questions about that let me go to the
next yeah yes
yes the prior in the early part of the
lab we said we showed you a few of these
techniques okay and we also really if
you I didn't go through it very slowly
but we sort of said okay you know there
is a field called jobs done and there's
a field called jobs completed it's the
same thing it's subtle duplication make
one of them called jobs completed so
they're both the same do that right we
so we expect you to do that with an
automated refactoring because that's the
best way to do it and then at some point
we expect you to pull out that
duplication from the sibling classes
into the superclass and again there's a
refactoring to do that so we are yes we
there's numerous tracks that came before
this right we call them tracks because
we think of these as albums and we've
taught what pull up is what rename is
what extract method is and all that so
we're not trying to set you up for
failure here however when you click the
next button here's your customized
feedback in this particular case there
were two particular items we wanted you
to learn more about correct fields on
classes your final design does not match
the target after design employee should
have only two fields jobs completed and
job skipped well what happened well what
happened was employee has three fields
it has jobs
what is jobs jobs is a let's see what
jobs is let's say references on the
project oh look there are no references
jobs is dead code we want you to be
looking out for dead code we give you
instructions to do so in this lab and I
forgot to get rid of that dead code so
we flagged you for that
in addition extract method performed
it's saying here that you could have
performed the extract method refactoring
on this code here to produce the
responsibility's method okay now I did
do that you saw me do that right the
only thing is I didn't spell
responsibilities right so it's not
perfect this technology it it's it's you
know only as good as it can be so the
the point here is that what we're trying
to do is to digitally look over your
shoulder we want to as best as possible
look over your shoulder to see how well
are you refactoring
okay and you could argue that a big part
of refactoring is knowing your tools and
using your tools correctly okay so this
does this is very tool centric it is
looking to see that you did certain
refactorings okay other labs are a
little more focused on what's the end
result and we don't necessarily know how
you're going to get there but this one
is a little bit a little more specific
okay questions about that so far
again we're doing this in C++ and in
Java and the the code base that is a
featured part of this album is called
some elections okay here's the album
smell elections is our collection of
really badly written collection classes
it's the Earth's smelliest collection
classes a map a list is set and you
basically have to clean them up there
are it's a four part lab okay and I can
tell you from okay well actually let's
do this let's go to part four of this
lab and I'm gonna upload some student
results okay from around the world so
people have been using this from around
the world and we're gonna see what they
did one guy in particular I think was a
pretty amazing
so let's look at this one here this is
part the part four of the spell
elections lab it's what's definitely by
far the hardest I've seen veteran
programmers completely stumble on this
lab it's it involves some significant
changes to the math class and if you
don't know what you're doing very easy
to get into a red bar state and stay
there for a while so this person got an
88% score okay
now let's look at his chart alright one
thing you notice is our time line is
actually in hours it can adjust you
however long the lab took now I don't
know exactly what happened here but he
started out refactoring these are
automated refactorings and in the second
close to the second hour he did a few
more and then he must have gone to sleep
or something he went to the pub I don't
know because I
I think this guy's from London and then
he decide he woke up and did an inline
method and then he went back to sleep I
guess and then he had this flurry of
activity where he you know he did all
this stuff and the most remarkable thing
to me is he only ran the tests a little
past the 15th hour so you know this was
kind of startling to me I we hadn't
really been looking at the data this way
until recently the graphing that we're
doing is is relatively new and it's get
causing us to rethink our scoring
because our scoring you know he got an
88% there and to do all that work and
not run the tests until the well into
the 16th hour it's just something's a
little off there I think so so that was
kind of odd let's look at let's look at
someone else's
result this was a fairly good one and I
just picked these off our site and check
them out sometimes
this one had a 72% score and you know he
he or she finished this in about a
little over an hour had a few red bar
situations so that was a bit of an issue
but you'll notice there was never any
refactoring that happened during the red
bar right if you see refactoring
occurring during a red bar this this
this background color means the desks
were green and they went red and so
forth if you see refactorings during red
bar it's usually not a good sign
usually I'm not gonna say always but
most the time it's better to be
factoring when the bar is green when the
tests are running perfectly so this this
person did fairly well sufficiently
green test was a test he failed or she
felt you had numerous test failures
during this lab okay we found there to
be too many it doesn't mean that there
were just two because you saw two red
strips that there could have been
several of those it's just how that's
how long the bar was red so we we ding
them on that and this scaffolding
methods this lab really requires you to
create some scaffolding extracting some
methods that are there temporarily which
you then inline later
you take the scaffolding down and there
was a bit of a problem there so so
that's um what other results are doing
now a big part of this this album is not
just you know these labs of course it's
learning really important techniques and
I wrote a book called refactoring to
patterns back in 2004 and I've taken a
lot of my insights from that book things
that I didn't really even fully
understand yet and I've distilled them
into videos and material in this
e-learning so in many ways this is
beyond where my book was that doesn't
mean it's harder in fact I found it to
be easier techniques so for example
refactoring strategies and tactics this
is a very important part of this album
teaching you what are good strategies
and tactics for refactoring we have a
whole collection of them and you walk
through these and watch videos and learn
about them here's a simple one rejected
parameter it's one of my favorites if
you're extracting a method sometimes
that methods gonna say oh you want to
extract this method you need 15
parameters to get past it or even three
parameters to get past it and you don't
want to do that so you don't do that you
you find a way to reject some of the
parameters using some of these
techniques okay and there's a video that
goes into three different examples of
how to do that another thing to keep in
mind is a refactoring Rash so one of the
things to watch out for when you're
refactoring is a rash where is the rash
here
this is a referring rash if you see a
bunch of little tiny red marks all over
your IDE it usually means that you've
taken too big of a refactoring step
you've got a rash so this this kids not
too happy and you will be in a world of
pain a few of what if you get into this
situation so you need to try to avoid
this kind of situation how do you do
that well one thing you can do is a
graceful retreat it's probably something
I should have done earlier in that
exercise right I was having trouble and
I should have gracefully retreated now
great a good retreat is better than a
bad stand an Irish proverb there's also
just some simple strategies some of them
are obvious okay this one you probably
know they call it a gradual cut over a
gradual cut over each one of these
question marks is gradually being turned
into a quest into an exclamation point
okay you want to make a change in your
code to thirty different things twenty
different things do you want at a time
that's that's relatively simple what's
not so simple is something that I would
call a parallel change or narrowed
change let's look at one of those
if I can find it I'll go to contents and
just type it okay here's our parallel
change strategy the parallel change
strategy we've found to be extremely
important all this all this e-learning
you're seeing here we write it ourselves
by the way and we're constantly
refactoring the code as well so we found
parallel to change to be hugely
important build new behavior next to old
then gradually cut over from new from
old to new what you're doing is you're
parallelizing all the code that you want
to change with new code it's very simple
it's very conservative as you parallel
eyes all of these every place you want
to make the change you put the new code
in let's say you used to talk to a file
system in 30 places now you want to talk
to the database in 30 places so go to
each and what every one of those 30
places and put the new database code
it's still not really being utilized yet
it's just there once it's in place once
you've paralleled it of course you may
recognize this as the Bay Bridge project
going on here
once you've parallelized that that code
you have to then do the cutover
and hopefully you can do that cut over
in small little steps and then
eventually get rid of all the old code
so that's a little technique a little
strategy for refactoring that we found
to be very valuable
another one is narrow change narrow
change says you have a bunch of places
where you need to make a change okay
it's a few too many find a way to narrow
them to a smaller number of places that
you need to make the changes narrow them
down to a small number make the changes
then get rid of anything that's that you
still don't need like scaffolding so
narrow changes another strategy that you
can learn about and these are meant to
be used in the labs so we teach you
these these strategies and tactics and
we distinguish the two like the rejected
parameter I showed earlier is more of a
tactic than a strategy this is a
strategy it's something you can use
quite a bit to to do some good
refactoring all right that's probably
enough about refactoring
let me quickly move to
the unit testing unit testing is also
extremely important and one of the
things we did in unit testing was to say
how could we know if people are writing
good unit tests okay so this is our
album on on writing good unit tests we
call unit test micro tests they're
testing micro pieces of behavior of
objects micro behaviors so we call them
micro tests it's really synonymous with
unit tests although some people have
different ideas of what a unit test is
so we're very explicit about what a
micro test is now there's lots and lots
of background here about how to write
good micro tests and what are bad micro
tests and you know we get into all that
stuff so there's there's a lot of
material about you know what does the
test look like and differences between
j-unit versions how do you design
effective ones so we're looking at
things in quizzing you lots and lots of
quizzes in here
and ultimately of course it leads up to
a lab so this is one of our labs on
micro testing we put you in an air
traffic control situation and we supply
a class for you so there's a class
called a tail the tail is short for an
airplane okay and your job is to write
the code write the tests to effectively
test one of these tails okay so it's
kind of like a legacy code situation but
it's a little simpler it's a single
class and you've got to cover it with
tests so we walk you through some of the
issues about the the tails tails can
have different kinds of priorities in
terms of how important it is for them to
land for example and commentary from the
gallery there ultimately you'll download
the code and you'll upload something so
let's I'm going to upload some student
labs from from this environment okay
let's go to the upload page here it is
and I'm going to upload these are these
are going to be examples from Googlers
who have done this so it analyzes it and
gives a score once again now this is
very different from refactoring right
we're not looking at the automated fat
drink you're doing here but we're
looking at it's the quality of the unit
tests you just wrote okay so here we're
saying that you did pass several of our
tests if you compare a tale to itself
does that work correctly is you have a
decent test to test a tale to itself
turned out they did comparison of
identical tales sure but counting for
the priority class okay all of these
things are important tests and there's
only one test that they failed here
accounting for last contact time they
missed that somehow ok so again this is
an example of us sort of digitally
looking over your shoulder okay all
right let's any questions about that yes
places for somebody to say
that oh okay let me let me let me show
you that real quick
yep yeah the question was back on the
page about so right here in this lab and
by the way this is a very fast way to
navigate at the top here so I can go
straight to that how you scored age the
question was there's two options here
right to choose from so it says you know
your tests don't account for the last
contact time in other words this field
could be altogether missing from tail
and your chest wouldn't know it here's
just saying I missed testing that role
or I didn't bother it was too hard and
if you pick one of those you'll see how
many other people were in that situation
it'll give you a percentage of who else
you know was in the same boat of course
this isn't my hard drive so it's not
showing the real numbers but online it
does and then of course if you don't
agree with that you can put some
commentary in and say why you didn't
feel is important to test that or you
know whatever whatever you thought other
questions okay a couple of quick things
every page has a rate this page feature
because we want to know if you just
don't like a page let us know okay
and in addition you can say I want to
post some thoughts here and you know
tell us what you think of the whole page
rather than just an individual part of
it so that something's wrong with the
page or something like that so we're
pretty prompt about getting back to you
on that I want to show you playlists
real quick
we we invented the concept of playlists
while we didn't invent it it went along
with the metaphor here of albums we said
how could we give people a pathway
through all this content there's a lot
of content here each one of those albums
I've been showing you often takes from
four to six hours to go through so if
you're in a rush or you're only
interested in a specific area for
example you might be interested in
attacking legacy code we love this album
cover here you know
you might want to just go through this
and this is going to hit material from
various albums
okay is actually six to six to ten hours
of content so that's a giant one but
some of them are smaller I'm not showing
all of the playlists up here but so
here's a playlist about design patterns
that are involved with object creation
and here's one just about code smells
okay so we're having fun with these
album covers but my favorite by far is
this one here the a few smells patterns
and refactorings is a nice blend of
different content from about six
different albums okay and you know you
just go through it and and learn
something so the playlists eventually
will you'll have your own ability to
make your own playlists for now it's
it's just something we're providing all
right I think it's time for me to show
you some test-driven development and the
new stuff we're doing there this is the
very newest thing we're doing I'll come
down here to the java version of this
album and as usual we spend a lot of
time teaching test-driven development
before you get you ever get to a lab so
there's all kinds of activities and
videos I'll show you an example here's
here's our a search first video at one
point we made all of our videos
captioned for the hearing impaired so
it's also good for people that I don't
speak English as their first language
and you can click here to go fullscreen
we're gonna make up a method to XML 2x
the better will be the method we call it
get back the XML we have just done a
search first programming and run the
test
it doesn't even compile of course it
doesn't compile there's no class
associated with XML builder and
certainly no method to XML that's okay
we're designing what we need in the test
by doing an assert statement first it's
a great way to organize your thoughts
about what you actually need to test
you're sort of working backwards just
like we work backwards we do test-driven
development
so lots lots of these videos that guide
you through things here and ultimately
you get to some lab so what I'm going to
show you now is a new lab it's not even
public yet this is very very new for us
it's about a spreadsheet we want you to
test drive basically an interpreter an
interpreter that's going to interpret
little formulas okay very simple
formulas so here's here's a produce the
spreadsheet here's so Brian's gonna walk
through what we want you to do there's a
formula it's doing some evaluation
here's ultimately what the composite is
going to look like and we want you to
test drive that great so we go through
some more background material what it
should look like or what we think it
should look like saying you're gonna do
a test first and ultimately you download
some code and get started so I'm gonna
do that real fast
I'll just directly import it in we
always supply some kind of engine
starting example so it makes it easier
for you you don't to create a whole
project from scratch okay so there's the
interpreter spreadsheet and I'm gonna go
here into an existing test we created
I'm actually going to rename this just
to be called constant and I'm gonna test
drive this code I'm gonna say the search
equals let's say 42.0 constant dot
evaluate so there I am doing a search
first hit control 1 create the local
variable will give it a type called
constant expression and it will be equal
to a new constant expression I will
create this in the source folder and
make the evaluate method on it and
import this sir equals and run and I got
my first failure of course it's
expecting 42 but it got back null okay
so test first would say well what's the
simplest thing that I could do to make
this pass well I could just return 42.0
this is where some people say what what
are you crazy
but this is this do the simplest thing
that could possibly work concept hmm
still failing well what happened here
oh we might have a little precision
issue I'm gonna use a precision argument
here that you existed already and we're
at green okay pretty good now I can do
things in here that the analysis is
gonna say not very good for example
here's another test I'll test summing
this can i sum two numbers search equals
and I'll say 50 and I'll say some dot
evaluate okay and let's just create this
thing and I'll just say equals new
constant expression right and that will
of course fail because it's not at all
what we want so we're going to fail your
situation right now what if I start
refactoring during this failure I'm
going to say for example let me go to
the constant expression and I'm going to
refactor and I'm going to extract an
interface I'm gonna call it expression
okay so it main expression and it made
constant expression implement that
interface okay that's pretty good if I
run the tests while I'm still in a
failure mode here so okay let's let's
actually make this actually pass instead
of saying constant expression I'm gonna
say some expression which doesn't yet
exist and I'm going to say new constant
expression 48.0 and new
okay and this entire constructor this
entire class doesn't exist let's create
the class in the source good let's
create the constructor here I will tell
it that I want this to be an expression
called the hog and here I want it to be
an expression called the add end good
save that and at least we're compiling
now right what doesn't it like here oh
yeah I never did close the well I closed
with that can you say that again correct
right okay so let's look at our constant
expression and say we need something
that's going to take a value so 42.0 is
really what we want let's create that
good so I'm going to give it a name
constant and I'll assign it to a new
field okay and I'll have this return
that constants
okay so let's delete some of this
unnecessary stuff and still read but
we're getting closer now I'm
intentionally doing bad TDD here because
I want you to see the analysis that
shows up when we don't do good TDD but
at least we're at least at this point
we're compiling so let's go back to the
sum expression and say okay well we
obviously have to save these things so
I'll sign them two new parameters and
assign this to a new parameter and we
will return the aw end dot evaluate plus
the add end dot evaluate and rerun the
tests still green still red sorry
now what dumb thing have I done now
so we got constant expressions here
first of all these should be expressions
it shouldn't be constant expressions
they don't need to be later on that
would hurt us so I'll do this and of
course I could have done that an
automated way but I didn't but that's
still not going to do it so we have we
need a precision okay precision now we
think we should have a green bar okay
we're at green let's see what the
analysis shows us about that session
again I will run this little archiver
and we just wrote a plug-in that's going
to do this instead of having you run
that little program but I'm not gonna
show that today and let's upload that
take a look
okay did the analysis and right now
we're just going straight to a diagram
let's understand what happened here so
point number one was we started with a
failing test so we did do that nicely
TDD wants you to start with a failing
test and so we're at a score of one a
TDD score of one we went up to two here
when we made the test pass okay and
that's when the bar went green and then
at point three we again started with
another failing test right the first one
was it says it here it's the constant
test this is second one up here was this
some test but then we did something that
was that we considered bad that's why
you went the the graph went down you
refactored while the tests were red okay
and there were several little
refactorings we did but this shows up
here this is this is the bad thing to do
you just don't want to refactor when the
tests at red it's not a good idea better
to get to green before refactoring but
we did eventually get things going it
took us a while look how long it took us
to finally get to green so this is 0.5
where we got to green and finally we
were done and that shows this particular
TDD session in the future we want you to
be able to see lots of these graphs
compare them to experts get you know
even more feedback from us in the graph
about how well you did so you can kind
of help yourself learn we we we would
use this technology and in-person
classes or in online so there's actually
for us there's very little difference
between the in-person experience and the
online experience we're trying to make
the e-learning so good that we'd be
crazy not to use it even when we teach
in person the only big difference is we
can't see your facial expressions while
you're doing this stuff but of course
you can interact with us online so
basically that was kind of a whirlwind
tour of a bunch of things in our
e-learning there's lots and lots of
content
to go through I've just shown you just
the tip of the iceberg and Google has
licensed all this from us so you know
you have access to it I have this here
if your internal at Google you can go to
I go / IL elearning is a site that has
tons of information in fact amanda has
rolled this around the world and it's
it's actually I think we rolled it out
worldwide we had almost zero questions
about how to do and people just follow
the instructions and got their albums
and started studying and there were no
issues so if you have any questions you
can email Angie to you - training at
Google comm we are working on those I
would say it's probably at least a 1/4
away about 3 months away 2 to 3 months
away the question yes sorry great one of
the IntelliJ plugins coming so it's
about three months away that were we're
working on that so we we do definitely
want to support IntelliJ the the data
much of this data was just a little bit
easier to gather in Eclipse but it's
it's totally possible to get it in
IntelliJ so that will be there any other
questions yes
yes yeah so the question is I was
showing most of things in Java and can
we do this in C++
the answer is we have all of these all
the labs I showed you today are all
available in C++
in fact we operating run in right now
real fast the only difference is you
don't have as many of the refactoring
tools available to you have some you
have renamed method in the CDT
so I'll take for example the automated
refactoring lab we looked at earlier in
C++ here it is okay so here is this
thing it compiles it in fact we've even
written a little plug into eclipse to
run to allow you to see a green bar so
I'll run that for you real fast and the
only major difference so if I say run as
G test it ran and here the G test
results okay green bar so you'll get a
green bar red bar and you can go and go
to the source you can do a rename method
a rename right here I can say refactor
rename that totally works so you know
it's not as full featured as the Java by
far but you you can do a fair amount
with it and we've instrumented G tests
so that we're picking up a lot of this
metadata we need to do the analysis so
it's we're doing our very very best to
support it as much as we support Java
okay that's a great question so yes the
question is does it affect the analysis
at the end we are inferring refactorings
by looking at snapshots of your call it
as you work for C++ so if you don't use
an automated factoring to do something
like a pull up you're pulling up from
two subclasses and to a super we will
look at the the differences in the code
and say yep they effectively did a pull
up so you get credit so the answer is
yes we we do account for even manual
refactorings any other questions yes for
the TDD graph is that data that you
could get when I'm doing my own TDD or
is it taking advantage of knowledge that
you're building this looking at this
expressions lab the TDD graph is the TD
graph is really pretty generic I mean
it's it's doing it for for that
particular lab but it could be for from
anything you're doing there's a little
bit of metadata stuff that setup that we
expect there we're trying to make that
go away as well so with a simple plug-in
that data will be available but that's
that TDD stuff is pretty early on we
have you know I'd say at least another
month of work to do to get that out
because it's pretty easy to trick it I
didn't show you that but you can trick
it pretty easily you can be in a test
and write a cert 1 equals 1 or 1 equals
0 and it's a failing test you can go and
write some production code and says
hello world and then you can go back to
the test and say you know assert 1
equals 1 and it looks like you have you
went from red to production to green one
you didn't do TDD at all so we're we're
actively looking at ways to make it
really really industrial-strength and
focus on not letting it like really
seeing if you are truly doing
test-driven development that's why it's
not out yet but you know ultimately we'd
love it if you could use it on any any
project not just our labs if that's what
your question was
yeah
okay well thank you very much for coming
