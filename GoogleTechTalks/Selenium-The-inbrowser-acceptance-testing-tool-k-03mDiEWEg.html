a couple of name drops yesterday and
various sessions so our staying down low
yesterday or poke my head ends anyway
yeah some of the original author but now
as time goes on my contribution to the
project it's less and less as more
people come in and refactor of the code
that i may have written the past or
build add-ons and even some like that so
it show a hands-on so little curious how
many people are aware of Sonya Burke I'm
you Sonja I thought it's about half this
a little more than so maybe you don't
need to be so much tutorial stuff I'll
do some that stuff anyway because I have
to apply to my mom okay so let me just
hit the slides and it passed that nigga
detection so so there's a problem all
this complexity and this was my complex
problem that led to the development of
selenium for the our in-house time
expense application that i wrote the
team of operatives we at bobberts very
unruly Bunch and can't just say use
internet explorer we give them Dells you
say userdel may go in bed by max so we
have to support kind of Safari and
Firefox and Internet Explorer just that
when a user face then also from a kind
of development you know mindset we would
have developers who would only do stuff
in Firefox and check it in and the next
week we find out a token ie
I person and so this is very complex
thing and back this was Sony Prince I am
this was a year before Ajax so this is
back when the days when javascript is
bad we had a lot of Java developers on
this side java good javascript fat as a
selenium actually it took a couple of
aborted attempts finally was able to
convince somebody no no javascript is
good and that's why slam I think was in
this weird right place the right time
because it grappled this problem which
only now since javascript is good people
care about this stuff and also these
other things at the bottom later on
people didn't really like the original
format of selenium so they want to be
able to write their tests in Ruby and
Python and Java and C sharp be able to
use it on any different kind of
framework and always surprising things
so we kind of try to distill down all
this complexity to a relatively simple
tool but nothing's ever that simple so
let's repeat how do you test your web
app on all platforms browsers web
frameworks and regardless of
implementation language or language you
want to write your tests in which
sometimes in the same sometimes remember
so the solution of course automated or
I'll hear how with silentium of course
with a couple of icky bits that all show
you so slime is actually a minor player
all this level you're showing you today
so actually I'm interested a little bit
of a context ingredients i'm going to
show you i had to kind of converging
ideas but the name the main one is a i
kind of wanted to see if you could use
selenium to build up a show or ask a
question they want to occur the sites
cold like browser cam com site vista
calm browser
calm any anybody remembers about okay so
you give it you give these sites a URL
and then give you a screenshot back of
that page and you actually can select
from a grid like I want to see firefox
on linux and safari whenever mosaic what
is any class on Blackie thing
essentially on sit back there I saw that
all that let it cool if if he gave the
selenium tests you can only just take
one screenshot of one URL you could give
it you could say take a screenshot oh
and now go click here type that then
take another screenshot or maybe not do
that just report a movie and then taking
that idea towards its at served
conclusion there was a convergence of
video in the sense that writing tests is
very pouring if there's very little pay
off but at the if this tangent I'm
trying to bring together all the cool
kids are doing screencasts for their
projects I think I was loud with like
everybody else when I first saw the
movie for ruby red granted I don't think
probably script that all through
selenium but I had this idea that had
one step down the road of an illiterate
function tests for storytests actually
making your business there selenium
tests executable documentation so your
documentation and delivered the client
if you make it easy to read it that you
don't have to spend another week making
screencaps actually every time you check
in you get a compiled screencast in
Safari Firefox and ie so that's what I
fried and mostly got working for this
talk so so this is these are all the
ingredients to this idea that I have
someone working on computer so apple
macbook so interesting sir about this I
didn't one until last month my top
proposal was to black this other
converging idea they now that Max or
intel-based you can run all these
different platforms on
and I had that originally problem of
needing to test Safari Firefox and
Internet Explorer well a mac mini or a
macbook actually would solve that
problem so yeah I didn't own that book
so I got accepted to this talk saying
I'm going to be using a Mac so look so
this is basically the syntax exact so
the way to I got my wife to agree to 11
by that I did try to actually do all
this work with a stock math book with
512 megs of ram but that second I put on
one extra virtual machine everything was
crazy said two gigs of ram that if
anyone wants from cheap as a whole go
out and buy ram because it doesn't come
open up well for all this crazy stuff I
do so the next thing parallels desktop
virtualization software and I guess
vmware is closed on their trail i'm
grinning if you didn't care about Max
and Safari you can do all this stuff
just using VMware actually that's one
I'm unconcerned about this is that I
like being able use it be nice to
develop here and take a virtual machine
employ that on the server it's not quite
easy because parallels have their own
standards are not quite and are off the
bowl between all the different vm
formats yets that's one little side note
there one other little bits in my bag of
tricks just a center a couple of the
powers based in the UK put together an
optics base distribution called bill
dicks and it's a tightly integrated as I
really supposed to you know compete with
all the other big linux distributions
but it's nice tightly integrated cruise
control trap and subversion and evening
a JavaScript and Python guy and
definitely afraid of Java's I've
actually avoided cruise control for all
these years it's a Java thing and then
there's buildbot I guess the Python
community
novi looks likely so I'm just kind of
stuck control actually does look okay
but now they put it in a virtual machine
I don't have to die don't care that it's
anything I have to edit a couple of and
files which are it's bearable but all I
have to do is install a new virtual
machine and use it and run it works and
it's it's nice so that's actually kind
of the radar traffic control of this the
brains this little thing we should also
of course selenium there's many aspects
of selenium confuses people but showing
you a little bit the selenium ide for
Firefox that's the record played actual
which may or may not be useful or good
but it actually does report playback we
didn't notice a huge spike in interest
in the project even though some testing
expert friend said report playback is
evil bad but you have to kind of go or
your users are and your users start with
report playback so at least if you get
them hooked and then you can lead them
on the trail right better tests and then
also we have this kind of advanced
version slimy normal control server now
that's you it's a Java proxy server
again I didn't write it but the cool
thing about it is that it's a proxy so
you can write your tests and pearl you
guys don't know this but a Perl Python
Ruby Java C sharp proxies the requests
over HTTP get some posts and then it
knows how to launch various browsers and
configure them some pop-ups don't show
up and things like that I'll just show
you briefly until control and then of
course Peppa underlight needed really
its own slide but it was very cool for
this little automated screencast thing
pi VNC to Swift is a very strong sauce I
guess of the first and elementary it was
it was stupid simple to take an RSS feed
and get the parts that I needed so I'll
show you a little bit of my setup here
and I'm actually go back to showing a
Firefox I eat something like the bigger
parts of the toolkit I have just
oh let's get this so i got this set up
so this is a plug-in called virtual
desktops so lets me have six virtual
screens I've got over virtual machines
running so I've got to just windows for
my math stuff but I've got the licks
ringing its own screen then I have
Django which is running on a Bluetooth
server now this is different than I
think the way buildings kind of has been
described I actually set up my own test
server with the Django web framework and
then I had SSH connections back before
between buildings and Django so this is
interesting because then I actually take
that virtual machine it's very
uncrustable departs and I could actually
put that on the developer eventuate
about burns a hairy bears or developer
playground or maybe not using parallels
with VMware this could then that I'm
deploying to this virtual image but if
it was smart good I could probably no
simple matter programming perhaps use
that as my production box BM grid kind
of a thing so I wanted to separate out
the build software from the the actual
test for observer and then I've got to
desktop operating systems I got a boon
to desktop and they got windows XP and
also it's not really down here but
behind the scenes I've got a second
concurrent user of Mac OS it'll be doing
the screencasts and a keys or account so
it will be taking a stranger so just do
the quick flyby because this thing is so
cool but ill text you know really it's
just running headless so it's really
nothing same with you know
hagar nothing interesting this is
interesting anyway so I got a full moon
to desktop and just that doesn't come
back the money
and I've God's on our go to and then on
the Mac user interesting these uh Kermit
Luke's going on listening for checkings
on my on the build xbox and if it
doesn't work when my dad was not going
to be surgery
yeah well I got some freak and movies in
there so i'll show you those instead
I've got windows and how much to say
about that anyway so that'sthat's this
cuts the setup I'll briefly to show you
why quit Django herbs art what selenium
looks like for those
so it demo as well and i saw this click
all run and this is it just doing its
thing this is the original version that
i can lay claim to like a layout and it
was the whole thing was I like fit but I
didn't like the fact that just did stuff
behind the scenes and I said oh I did it
all I worked like really so I'm
originally actually emailed war coming
and saying hey no one's written fit from
the JavaScript framework so I'm going to
do that but then I realized the action
pictures and I was forking the spec
because I needed clicks and verifies and
sucks different things like that so
anyway so he's kind of inspired by fit
and then became at something and as you
can see to handle well thought of popups
is it can't handle closing in this demo
but all the things that Ajax is yeah an
automation tools computers and so yeah
it's actually this is actually running
in Safari I don't think any vendor
because you might be some open source
tools but anyway so that that's just if
I itself that is the original version
let me show you actually the Firefox ide
so cool others first you show you little
django app you close this
ok sir
illustrative interface may be on the
record just yet keeping simple
this is IP connections
all right okay so it's going to show you
the Django application that looks like
it's not working so let's go move along
I will show you the selenium IDE and
perhaps that leads to record a couple of
things in the login screen I swear is
all work intensity
so it's reporting everything so it
reports the URL base URL in fact I type
nothing into those user field second
tape and
log in vegas it's man so it's
interesting so this is the again kind of
i guess the technical term for this kind
of style and tests will be keyword
driven test maybe if you squint your
eyes you can stay it's a domain-specific
language but the down the fatal flaw i
think to this kind of format is that the
source code is HTML that's ugly and i
hate aunt so I a little bit of a Dueling
double think project error that I hate
ants yet this is okay so it's fine
because in this format you actually can
write I think stealing the ideas from
war I guess I didn't think much more
like your dog liked it so short he can
you there anything right these tests and
word tables or Excel and this is nice
for business analysts and things like
that so I said okay I sure also because
it's so stupid simple it's easier it's
easy to very compile down from Java to
this so a lot of actually people very
first kind of months of selenium they
don't like the tables they use jsps or
PHP to compile down the HTML tables was
pretty simple but but since then you
actually can record in court actually in
any form okay this interesting thing in
the in the selenium IDE you actually can
change the format they supported
languages we have for the RC so that's
why people notice I think they see
selenium HTML tables and all of that
stuff and then ourseives with heart set
up and how do you go from cables to Java
well you actually could work record your
test here and then just translate it's
got some regex stuff behind the scenes
to
of course my favorite so that's
interesting so then you can cut this cut
and paste this into a proper ide and
start massaging this down until real
test another reason why people didn't
like so much the HTML tests if I can
defend
we're not sorry and complete it's an
imperative language and give you one
step at a time thing kind of regressing
I guess is you know stadia languages the
true test or the true proof that this
was kind of lacking use when someone
submitted they go to keyword or commands
for the project saying oh we need loops
so here's a go to function like coaching
previously I don't know so we very
deliberately have kept southern needs I
guess it's called a stupid language
because if we added ifs and loops and
well behind the scenes to the start look
like and then else because it's a
hierarchical structure also be
fulfilling for insolence I'm
implementing list all over what was the
point yes yes yes so one of the things
I'm actually playing with but it's not
fully baked is some step between a
full-scale Java Ruby whatever and the
texts emails actually be able to just
write your tests and just straight
JavaScript but that's not so easy
because JavaScript as Joe is pointing I
yesterday it's single threaded so you
can't run JavaScript and then stop like
when you say go open this page you can't
do that through ajax but you can't do it
in the actual window so well if you're
interested in writing your test of
JavaScript I'm fine whatever but it's an
interesting interesting engineering task
so anyway so that's that's some of the
things on this you didn't brief to show
you I can get
it's going to show you some of the
they're there
so in the syntax I guess for the the
remote control so you actually can write
it unit test framework now using the
same kind of API and Python Java C sharp
Ruby Ruby example isn't a Java server
spaces i think it's going to page just
as to a jet and then pearl so those
things so i add on this pub Hammond that
I at least cover birth control at some
point what's up today so there you go
home all right so now on to this crazy
stuff that I want to do so here here's
the here's the flow we actually called
Chris Reese master and Andy Dabrowski
and Chicago working on a project li PA
and they have they have slain well
integrated into the whole continuous
integration environment and they call it
the two-tiered flow sorry I don't have
to slide but this is just a complete
they've got cruise control build
automation number one up here on the top
of the stack tier 1 and then 2 is your
functional test stuff you're so lame
stuff so the weight the basic flow is
developer checks into cruise control one
that runs unit tests and then that
deploys a test server which then
triggers a second tier build and it's
interested in it's important to do
signature bill because developers don't
care about unit tests so you want to get
them the feedback right away and also
its function tests are slow so that's a
good kind of place to cut it that's
second tier actually I think on their
project it launches the browsers that
does those things my architecture is a
little bit different in what I want to
do today and going with the mind of the
browser shots or get kind of like their
idea where you've got these servers but
you know someone on the other side of
the planet you've got desktops that will
phone home and see if there's a request
and do it for you so
so I don't yeah so I kind of a future
thing but actually that second tier is
really listeners on the desktops waiting
for a new successful bill from for build
/ building so let's actually not go here
and shows it build its own page
hey all right so this is your bill dicks
start occasionally Maxim instance it's
very nifty cuz you some user management
sort of pretties page we have
it's nice
don't know one
okay yes Italy for me
alright so I want to do more charades
here
what was that Thank plugin now I
actually got my own little virtual
network right here so what I've actually
seen happen before is if the cable gets
on a power port it heats up and resist
equations or it unplugs the first thing
to add okay very the first thing and so
let's go there sir
yay alright we're back on okay first
control this is what I'm one should yes
alright status page they've also have a
nifty little cruise control widgets
sometimes for this talk is cooled by
then anyway so yes so I'm gonna play
around the dashboard too much but this
is good enough for now so buildings
comes with a couple projects math config
stuff like that so I've got to I've got
to build serious with T a time expense
application I was playing with a little
project and then T screams for recording
the screen casts I have my bill actually
for the purpose of the demo as long as
my cables are plugged in check every 10
seconds you might want to not want to do
that on a real project anyway so just to
keep this in mind actually going to
trigger a bill I'm not to go and do a
test driven or actually edit code an
interest time but anyway just keep this
in mind te a 19 I click on the home page
you can actually go back and look at all
the bills the previous builds creative
artist
but yeah all i did was a hit build
trigger not txt its trigger built so i'm
going to go trigger another bill and
hopefully te a 19 go to TA 20
I was going to change the white space
the developer tools it's kind of
interesting I really wish I really miss
tortoise svn just being able to be
plugged right into Windows Explorer you
don't have that so this is the service
of me so I'm going to commit my build
trigger txt triggering another build
all right now let's go check crystal
fast aha already caught it and hit a
building and it's done and it failed I
lied because it the IP addresses again
so let's go take a look at what happened
actually it's looking down there
it failed now root the host so I can
have some pre can't stuff in there so
let me actually show you what that bill
was it was pretty simple because I ya
want to get something
but
go to be
source repository of the project Kristin
fulfilled very simple stuff I actually
try to use hands as weak as possible so
I ssh into my django host and do an
Apache stop guys consider then I do a
ugly stuff SSH in there again I'd given
us version up update and I run some
k-pop ipython database refresh script
and then every start apache so since my
IP addresses are messed up the bill
failed but what should have happened is
meanwhile on the Virtual Machine branch
I would have had this listening guy as
you scroll up here yeah he was waiting
for quite a while and some at some point
in the past when I was testing and maybe
I'll surely show you
all right there's waiting waiting
waiting and then it founds i used the
rssp a cruise control all the build
status and look specifically for a past
or a passing build and that actually
then triggers off the screen cast and
stuff so then that calls pi b and c 2
swift and that was interesting because I
VNC of Swift as a screen capture
recording tool but I found out in the
course of trying to view this demo that
it doesn't have a timeout so I actually
a hack in some like launched this
process and launched another process
listening when that process to kill that
process in 30 seconds that wasn't fun so
I actually couldn't even get it working
in widows in time for this demo today
that's why I just keep zooming past this
one because i think that the screencast
route in time but i did get it working
in a boom to and i did get it working in
and in in safari yeah so just bounce
down their rights it writes the file and
it goes actually commits the file to the
repository and it waits in my teammates
again actually let me show you some of
those movies that are out there
Oh way
t screams
let's look at the timeline so after it
builds and eventually these these
screenshots get a screen casket check
back in so I had a user named Mac he had
access up data the Safari screencast
wonder if any of these are filled
actually looks pretty ugly going
straight in from here
original France
venture
yeah anyway so it actually reports the
movie that has me trying to get ready
actually learning through tasks I
actually flips right at a bougie long as
well
yeah this was an interesting idea way I
would have had a test of that Django
application wrote it through the IDE
check that in and then see these virtual
machines record that same test in those
various browsers on those platforms and
chose in and and all you have to do is
him when you commit it and go straight
back into track and then just wait for a
movie to show up so this is a you know
all these things just to kind of give
you a kind of backdrop of course my name
is pretty stable then around for two
years I think actually for your
anniversary with like last week I did
all this stuff i'm showing you is kind
of like mad scientist research and all
that kind of things trying to get it
going so this is kind of like me but
it's an extension of what is possible
anything use things like selenium and i
like and when you embrace something like
this when you start with the
screencasting or backwards from that I
guess you have to kind of agree that a
screencast might be useful maybe this
particular ones I useful but your user
documentation so David Hanson every time
he comes out in the news 50-person rails
she doesn't have to go and do those
things also taking it one step further
max especially yet another reason to 5am
this poll has really good speech
synthesis so you can imagine getting
another thing I would love to have some
time today but something that's actually
made possible by the tactic of slinging
or no control when it's on the server
side you can go to a server-side process
and they can do something to browser or
do something on client and do different
things so as an example of that perhaps
you could actually tie in a synthesis
from from apple and make an actual more
interesting screencast so imagine close
your eyes
so imagine going to the front page
here's
can you hear that
well that was my old sounds over let's
run it now I could do it again but use
your imagination the sense that you
could use voice synthesis and the next
notes okay yeah coming in I saw the
Steve Jobs demo of leopard coming up
next year this voice synthesis is even
better actually you can't tell us a
robot so imagine recording us to mp3
concurrent to the running of the tests
and you you sling and broke remote
control you can time it specifically q2
sounds wait for that to be done then do
a couple of interest in commands to the
screen and also if you go again with the
focus of doing it through screencasts
you keep your tests yes they're brittle
with an announcer your application and
you don't want your you mutation
you want your documentation to be brutal
but also because people potentially use
this essentially if you do it right
could this can be a good example is like
a marketing tool you will write short
pithy tests and so going down this track
you might actually make the argument
that you probably use selenium the least
but its flashier stuff like the actual
testing of your business logic going to
be doing a glycol protocol later or
somewhere else and you know tests of
course willing to them and this would be
kind of the flasher stuff that you ought
to be so those are the things yeah
without without the IP IP go hunts down
there but really have one of us here so
perhaps remove it early but I can open
it to questions and discussion
anything we're kind of testing
reflection second
hi Jason thanks for the announcement
well as you know I've been using to
singing for a while and I'm very very
inspired by what we've done today I
think I'm feeling that maybe in a couple
years time this will be sort of some
sort of multi-million pound business
that we can also submit our requirements
in your goals and generate these videos
from um unfortunately now i can't can't
figure how to make money on this it's
open source so and i just hold you ought
to do it okay i'm sure they'll be one
yeah totes Muslims anyway what I'm
interested to find out is obviously
these videos can get quite big yes and
if you're doing this as part of every
bills tracking checking it in the trap
especially with is tracked subversion is
a terrible idea it was the simplest
thing that could work is a good question
well most definitely okay I was getting
too i was getting too you know for the
time being obviously they're quite big
can you see way of this actually being
perhaps use just on an overnight basis
and so i could come in the morning for
example and i can just say right no I
had that the bill failed and it felt
because one of my selenium tests failed
okay I'm going to go play back that
video now and do you think that's going
to be manageable for a lot of
applications in terms of integration of
salvation and will display some storage
and some honestly have no idea second
but what I do I went with this is the
simplest thing that could work I knew
that protocol is webdav and it was you
know check-out check-in all the
authentication was just all there but
but yeah because the version stores
every copy of it you might only want the
last one and also there's something else
that someone brought up you only want
really to see these if they failed I
mean who's going to just watch it run
again but it passed well if you go with
the thought that your potential users as
a marketing tool those are useful but
yeah it's something better would it ends
in any ftp ftp it over the overlay
something like that those are things i'm
still
trying to figure out I really like the
atom API again thinking of kind of
deserting a grid of having computers all
over the world kind of checking in doing
the recordings and that's a good
standard that I'm really kind of eagerly
following but as far as actually how
what's going to be best on the server
side of where things get store veteran
yeah by a big hard drive thanks I think
what you've done is really cool and
cinemas have done things look great
potential so think about and you see
this completely Sheila talk in
conference racing hi this is ryan
campbell with red hat over here yeah so
one need i think a lot people have is
for ensuring visual consistency between
different browsers so that it generally
looks the same across browsers right so
one way to kind of extend what you're
doing and incorporate kind of small
multiples that we're tough to select
take these screencasts and put them in a
grid and play them together all
platforms play at once right to like to
kind of see how the platforms differ
visually let you zoom in on ones that
are aberrant or something like that so
just kind of a cool idea to build on top
of that see the cross-platform please
yeah actually don't put it up on screen
during party
second oh yeah that's a good idea I
any other questions
we're in the final stretch here so I'm
amazed i kept I don't see if you make it
was like yeah are they from a small
company with an efficient ship uglier a
little what's the most complicated
application of this is the people done
in production what's the most
complicated I don't I haven't seen him I
know we have lots of name well tonight
name dropper that made dropping any
fortune 500 companies are using plenty
of moons or products and i don't know if
i can actually mention eight but yeah
we've got some very interesting I
thought me to me later but i know theres
big companies so if you can go with the
logic that big companies have big
applications and they were actually
coming after us to see if we could
provide support contract so that for
that then i guess ergo is being disowned
complex I'm kitchen but I've to go
transit center
probably the least used is the Django
interface attainable which house
maintainable are selenium fests answer
that a couple ways the HTML tests
themselves is like the tests or the fit
style their own making because you can't
breathe oh yeah cuz they're not sure and
clean i'm interpreting that point they
or exited you can't do it loops or hips
loops refactoring in a function into
comments up so those those are meeting
your maintainable weather good enough
that's in small doses if you use
selenium remote control and then you
write it in Java then it says
maintainable with anything else is on or
as not maintainable as some might say
but the
the GUI changes well write tests are
brutal I'm making kind of a contrarian
point though that when you deliver
documentation that's like the pain of
everyone so we have developers testers
that don't forget the guys you document
stuff because I think they're kind of a
third like the third forgotten stepchild
suffered about that the people have to
document all this stuff there's always
that problem between the docs being out
of date from the code in that sense you
want a couple the documentation to the
code you want it to be brittle wenco
changes that changes otherwise you don't
know it's a big complaint a lot of open
source projects oh yeah and the
documentation but it's ten years old and
so so you kind of go with this trade-off
it's going to be brittle but then it may
be in that sense you use it less for the
things that need to be written
documentation but for stuff that you're
testing your business logic yeah I one
in the hard way I used when we first
made selenium slinging was the all being
functional testing tool everything that
was not the unitized library was
selenium and I think I realized that
over time i'm using it less and less and
less but for more interesting things i
don't know if that's a refreshment okay
it use it less and then it makes easier
alright Jason thanks very much I do
