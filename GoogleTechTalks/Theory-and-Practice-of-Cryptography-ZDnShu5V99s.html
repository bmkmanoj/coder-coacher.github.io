and practice of cryptography course and
it's my pleasure to welcome benedita to
give the final talk on cryptographic
voting protocols and verifying elections
with cryptography Ben is currently a on
the research faculty at Harvard Medical
School working on some privacy aspects
of electronic medical records and has
done a lot of work with voting in the
past and is also on the research group
at Harvard and so without any further
ado I'd like to turn it over to Ben hi
everyone
last year at this time almost exactly at
this time I gave a talk on voting if you
were at that talk don't worry you'll get
new information at this talk if you were
not at that talk don't worry either I'll
go over some of the basic stuff I went
over back then but this talk should be
more technical you guys have had a
little bit of crypto with Steve so we'll
get into some details of cryptographic
voting protocols and I'm going to try to
keep the beginning of it high level very
sort of general protocols and dig into
the crypto about halfway through
approximately so please interrupt me at
any time with questions I prefer them
when you think of them as opposed to at
the end so raise your hand and Steve
you'll let me know if somebody asks
online so please don't hesitate to I am
Steve or whatever you do to ask a
question over the over the network so as
Steve said right now I'm a research
faculty at the Harvard Medical School
where I think about privacy of health
records but for my entire PhD and for a
chunk of my time right now I think about
what cryptography can bring to the field
of Elections in the sense that elections
well there's issues around elections
right last year there were a whole bunch
of articles published right around
election time and the articles went
something like this
does a voting need paper trails there
was one state sued over the lack of
paper trail
more than one state student in that
situation there was an HBO documentary
which came out really right around
election time that said basically your
votes not going to count it's going to
be trashed you might know you might as
well not vote in California there was a
report that said that the voting
machines there were letting people vote
more than once and in like May basically
three days before the election there was
a report that said Hugo Chavez is in
your voting machine and this was the
headline was justified because a board
member of one of the voting machine
companies turned out to be from
Venezuela and had some prior business
associations with Hugo Chavez thus Hugo
Chavez is in your voting machine so on
the one hand you had all these articles
that said we're in trouble
right this you might have will not vote
or or vote by mail or vote on paper
whatever you can do just find a piece of
paper and write your vote on it and on
the other hand you had the head of the
election assistance Commission Paul
DiGregorio the election assistance
Commission is a federal organization
created after the September the Florida
2000 election Fiasco that said okay
we're going to fix this right
and Paul DiGregorio wrote an editorial
on October 26 2006 and said don't worry
everything's cool your votes going to
count and the thing I want you to notice
here is that you have this you have
these extreme statements on the one hand
your votes not going to count on the
other hand your vote is definitely going
to count and on both sides you have no
real evidence one way or the other
because we have very little information
as to whether the elections are going
well we have very little information
because the process of elections is such
that we end up with very little
information about whether they were
successful and this talk is going to be
about how we can use techniques from
cryptography to give us a lot more audit
ability than you would think is even
possible in the case of an election of
course things do go bad sometimes and I
can't have an election talk without
talking about some of the funny times
when they go bad here's one quote right
after the election in Rogers precinct
with
there was more than a hundred percent
voter turnout that's even better than
Russia it's shocking
better than 100 percent in another case
a thief grabbed a voting machine from an
election officials car now you have to
ask yourself what was the voting machine
doing in the election officials car to
begin with well you have to understand
that to get all these voting machines at
5:00 a.m. in every voting location the
only practical way to do so in some
cases is to have the vote election
officials pick them up the night before
and drive them in the morning of the
elections so there's all sorts of subtle
process issues around actually running
an election which make it particularly
hard and which lead to such silly
headlines and then of course people got
really upset and then one voter smashed
a touchscreen machine in Allentown
Pennsylvania now you read that headline
you think maybe maybe the press is just
exaggerating turns out they're not they
really did smash that voting machine in
Allentown Pennsylvania and of course
we're gearing up for another election
season so this is all stuff that I
talked about last year but we have new
issues coming up right now
in Colorado the state has just
disallowed a whole bunch of voting
machines including touchscreens optical
scans and the statement they've made is
a very strong one they've said the
standards for evaluating voting machines
at the federal level the federal level
standards are no good we cannot trust
the federal standards we're going to
have our own standards for evaluating
voting machines it's a pretty strong
statement you know as far as election
official statements go
and this might trigger a few other
states to do the same thing in Ohio
there was a security review that was
just published last week about some of
the voting machines they use there and
they found out that using a PDA with the
infrared port and a magnet to dislodge
something inside the voting machine
they're able to basically completely
override the software that runs the
voting machine and therefore completely
corrupt the whatever that voting machine
is doing so things are pretty bad in
terms of voting machine equipment in
terms of the process but they're very
bad because it's quite hard now I'm
going to tell you a little bit about why
it's hard
this is an excerpt from a story that I
also showed this last year I really love
showing this because it represents the
court one of the core issues of
designing cryptographic protocols or
secure protocols in general here's a
story about a guy who was running for an
election and his wife in tiny tiny
locality and his wife Roxanne goes to
City Hall to see the election results
and he got zero votes so she comes home
to him and says hey did you vote for
yourself because if you didn't if you
did then something's wrong with the
election and if you didn't then why
didn't you write but what's funny about
this is not so much that there were zero
votes for him it's that his wife came
home to ask him if he'd voted for
himself because that what this means is
she clearly didn't vote for him right is
she if she voted for him she wouldn't
need to ask him this question right and
the reason I point this out is because
there are inherent limits to what you
can do with certain protocols the
security can only be so good if you get
zero votes it doesn't matter how secure
the process is you know your wife didn't
vote for you right it doesn't matter how
good the rest of the protocol is so in
it's interesting when you design
security protocols to look at the inputs
and outputs and figure out what the best
case scenario is and in the voting case
there are limits to what you can do
here's a little bit of history some of
you might know it about how we got here
in the first place and it helps to
explain things a little bit in the
beginning of mechanization of voting
machines in the 1920s and 30s
approximately we had these these these
lever machines that came out and these
machines basically had counters and you
turn these little levers and if you
lived in New York in the past few years
you've seen them in use they're still in
use in some places I don't know what the
status is for 2008 they're supposed to
be phasing them out but you never know
so you turn some levers next to the
names you want and there are some fancy
hardware interlocks that prevent you
from voting for two different candidates
in the same race and then you pull this
big lever and kachunk all the levers
reset your vote is counted don't worry
everything is cool you can leave the
buthe now in fact they had set them up
so that when you pull the lever it also
opened the curtain at the same time so
it's very convenient so these machines
may have issues in particular they only
keep an aggregate count of the ballots
and they're mechanical so they have
mechanical failures and so there was a
statistical analysis done on results
based on elections that were run with
this kind of equipment and it turns out
that the digit 9 appears a lot more
often in these election results than it
should
randomly and the reason for that is that
these counters tend to get stuck when
they turn and when they get stuck they
usually get stuck rolling over between 9
and 0 so when you vote and you're at 9
your vote might not get counted right
it might not trigger but the thing to
roll over in the 50s and 60s we decided
ok well these punch cards that we're
using for computers they could be useful
for tabulating votes too and in fact it
was actually quite a good idea because
if a punch card system works well you
have a record of every ballot one ballot
is one card right and if everything goes
smoothly you can do recounts you can
inspect them and try to see which holes
have been punched and such but of course
we know the story with what happens when
the equipment gets old and when people
don't punch holes all the way and you
know butterfly ballots make people vote
for the wrong candidate potentially it
can get messy in part because the layout
of the ballots was made to fit these
punch cards and so the weird butterfly
design if you've ever seen the Florida
2000 ballot where you have candidates on
the left and on the right and arrows
pointing from both sides and it's kind
of hard to align which one is which that
is because of the constraints of punch
cards with these holes that are close
together and so you're trying to
maximize how much data you can fit on
one of these punch cards the principle
was a good idea fitting the user
interface to the technology turns out to
have pretty disastrous effects when the
race is closed then eventually we
started moving to optical scanners at
first the scanners were centrally
located meaning you filled out your
ballot and then you just dropped it in a
box and eventually they were moved to a
central location and scan there the
problem with that is that if there's a
mistake on your
ballot you filled in too many bubbles
you don't get any feedback right away in
fact the only time we know that you
filled in too many bubbles for one
candidate is when it's too late at the
central location when we count your
ballots it's a bad ballot oh well
there's no way to reach the voter again
so we move to precinct based optical
scan where if you voted Massachusetts
you've seen these and they're kind of
all over the place now there's about 40
to 50 percent of voting machines that
work like this you fill in some bubbles
you feed in the paper it gets scanned if
there's an error gets spit out and
you're told there's an error and you get
a chance to revote and then of course
there's the touchscreen machines the
main advantage that touchscreen machines
have over optical scan is in places
where there's a whole bunch of different
languages in LA County you need to
support sixteen different languages and
having 16 different pre printed optical
scan ballots 16 different types of pre
printed ballots is very painful so
there's a good reason for all of these
technical progressions but security was
never the major issue if you talk to
election officials you find out that
really they care about people
participating in the election first
that's the major issue that they try to
solve and then security effectively
becomes second any questions so far
let yeah all right I'm trying to get did
people change its name yeah they just
changed their name to premier election
systems not not the whole company just
the election department yeah any other
questions right to be extra fair you
know I think Diebold gets a lot of the
rap but really all none of the vendors
have have done that much in that regard
they've tried in very good faith to make
elections easier but the problem is that
we have no evidence that things are
working well and so they could be
working poorly right
do the touchscreen-based solution
produce paper some of them have been
adapted to produce paper trails the
machines that are adapted to produce
paper trails tend to perform poorly in
usability tests because of the fact that
they've been retrofitted with these
printers that break and jam and such
things
so machines that are designed from the
start to have paper trails tend to work
better yeah
we're seeing the documentary of any
notions and have paper trails they found
election officials thrown away get our
rap the cons is that even with paper
trails you can throw away the paper
trails and that's exactly what I'll get
to in fact I think I'm going to speed up
a little bit because sounds like you
guys are really on top of the stuff so I
just want to briefly mention a couple of
things that were funny last year here
was the Princeton report they were able
to build oops they were able to build a
vote stealing control panel into one of
these touchscreen voting machines where
you just get to slide the slider and
decide who wins and they were able to
infect the voting machines this way so
that the voting machines would act
normal but record votes in whatever way
you wanted them to record them they were
able to modify all the audit logs to be
consistent and spread this virally by
memory card from one machine to the
other but it's not just
touchscreen machines or as they're
sometimes called D re s for direct
recording by electronics the word direct
I don't think was intended as a pun
given how indirect the recording is
since you're going through the machine
but that's what it's called direct
recording by electronics it turns out
that in some optical scan systems if you
put a post it in the right location you
can prevent the little detector that
says you voted from being triggered and
then you can pull your ballot out and
vote again and pull your ballot out and
vote again keep doing this a few times
hopefully the election official would be
able to detect this but maybe not all
right that's the fun history it's really
easy to talk trash about this stuff what
can we do right
how can cryptography help
now if you've listened to the past
lectures that Steve gave for the most
part and if you look at the way
cryptography is handled for the most
part in the press you think of it as a
military type of technology the
technology that's there to preserve
secrets to preserve authenticity to
basically generally keep things in the
dark or at least to keep things yeah to
keep secrets effectively there's a whole
aspect of cryptography though that has
to do with proving that things happen
correctly with verifying that things
happen correctly and you can begin to
see it when you talk about digital
signatures but I think that Steve
briefly mentioned zero knowledge proof
before and that's really the area where
cryptography can do a whole range of
things that have nothing to do with
military-style applications they have to
do with audit ability and they have to
do with audit ability in situations you
wouldn't think were auditable to begin
with and that's the kind of cryptography
we're going to use for this kind of
protocol so the point of an election and
the reason we want this is because the
point of an election is to convince the
loser that he's lost this is a real
quote from 1966 you want it to be such
that the loser can be as angry as he
wants but at least he's in agreement
that he's lost so providing enough
evidence to convince the loser okay but
you also want to provide enough in the
process you want to provide enough
evidence to each individual voter that
they've their vote was correctly
recorded so we'll take Alice our usual
character in cryptographic protocols and
we'll we'll say okay a voting system
whatever the system is needs to convince
Alice that her vote was properly
captured but then we have this issue of
the secret ballot this idea that Alice
can't turn around and convince Carl the
courser that she voted a certain way now
this is tricky Alice has to receive
enough evidence to be sure on her own
that her vote was correctly captured but
not so much evidence that she can turn
around and pass it on to a courser and
what's really tricky is this is not a
voluntary choice we want it to be such
that even if alice is willing to be cool
first paid $1000 have her dog you know
maybe you know if her dog is threatened
and she's like I love my dog I cannot
imagine living without my dog I'm gonna
I'm happy to be course for my dog even
in that case we want to prevent that
from happening so it's not voluntary
privacy of the vote its enforced valid
secrecy we didn't always have it that
way
this is actually a fairly recent concept
this is how we voted in the early days
of u.s. elections here's the guy in red
voting in front of the whole crowd
giving his vote to the guy in blue who's
swearing him in and the two people
behind they're recording you know for
duplicate this is like an early version
of raid mirroring right two copies of
the record it was only in 1892 that we
have we adopted the Australian ballot
from Australia which included among
other things the idea that you would
show up and it'd be isolated in a
private booth to vote and that there
would be some enforced secrecy as to how
this works all clear about that that's
that's the key issue that makes this
hard it's the fact that we have to give
you some confidence without giving you
too much right just the right amount
and it's really this kind of dilemma
this kind of appear this these
conflicting requirements that can be
best resolved by tools like cryptography
so I like to make elections talks a
little more current so I've updated my
slides to talk about election 2008 and I
believe I'm since I'm talking to the
Google crowd these are probably the two
candidates that matter the most at this
point so let's assume that come election
2008 we are dealing with Barack Obama
versus Ron Paul and let's see how the
process works
right I apologize to those who would not
choose those two candidates I had to
pick to write Alice the voter is going
to pick Obama and she's going to pick
Obama because I get to write the slides
she's going to seal her vote in some way
then she's gonna drop this vote off in
the ballot box then there's this weird
cutoff if you voted you notice you drop
it off and then that's it you're kind of
not involved you go home and at some
point the results are announced and
again Obama wins here because I get to
write the slides there's this black box
here there's this sort of part of the
process you can sort of see depending on
which precinct you're in but you
oftentimes you just don't get to see it
you drop off your vote you go home you
turn on the TV and you found out who won
right what we've done this because we
want to preserve valid secrecy and it's
the only way we can think of doing it is
to have this cut off at which point
identity is now dissociated from the
ballot we shake the ballot box and
that's it we just count after that and
so security of the system has to be
enforced by a chain of custody and the
chain of custody goes something like
this somebody writes source code it gets
installed on a voting machine it gets
delivered to the polling location
Alice votes there's a ballot cutoff
there's a ballot box collection and
there's a result and every step of that
process corruption could lead to a bad
result bad source code or good source
code that's poorly installed or a voter
twiddling with a magnet and a PDA could
screw up the vote we have this Chain of
Custody security process because it's
the only way we can think of of getting
the ballot secrecy right and it's
somebody mentioned very accurately the
paper trail gets you the following thing
it bypasses all of this process at the
beginning but it doesn't really help you
for the ballot box collection which
really is a black box at that point and
the paper trails could very much go away
so what happens well because we rely on
a chain of custody we get ballot box
floating in San Francisco Bay that
happened in 2002 we get helicopters
crashing in Afghanistan probably not on
purpose but that affected the vote
because they were carrying ballot boxes
absentee ballots lost in Florida Mexican
presidential
last year ballots found in the dump an
18,000 votes last year in Sarasota that
looked very fishy and it's really hard
to tell what happened to them all right
let me skip ahead for a second because I
I'm taking a little longer with this
than I thought but let me just tell you
very quickly that it's very clear that
people often ask the question after all
of this they say well maybe secrecy is
not so important maybe we should just do
away with ballots secrecy maybe we
should all vote in public make our
voices heard everybody's in the same
boat we all get to voice our choices and
then we get perfect verifiability right
it's not a crazy argument but it turns
out that the data we have from Chile
which is the only time in recent history
that it changes happen in the secret
ballot the data we have is when you
implement the secret ballot you get huge
changes in the political outcome in
other words coercion whether it's
employer to employee or spouse to spouse
or parent to child or whatever it is is
rampant when you don't have the secret
ballot so we think it's important so now
the question is we must have secrecy and
we must do better than Chain of Custody
verification so what can cryptography
bring us let me restate those properties
we want Alice to verify her vote alice
is going to vote we want to make sure
her vote is counted as she intends
everyone wants to verify that the
counting up of the votes was done
correctly and we got this third
requirement that Alice cannot be coerced
by Eve
we want from a process the question was
we want should Al's verify her vote at
the polling station or after the fact
after the fact we want her to be able to
have some confidence of the whole
process not just of the point where she
gives her vote right so remember what at
some point we had public ballots so
let's start with public ballots and
let's Aude meant them to be to support
the secret ballot I
we have Bridget and Carol who have
already voted and now Alice is going to
vote and post her vote on a public
bulletin board you know just everybody
can see it and then everybody can tally
and everybody's happy right Alice sees
her vote everybody tallies everything is
great how do we make it secret
well let's encrypt things right let's
start by encrypting the ballots that are
on the bulletin board okay now we know
that Alice has voted but we don't know
what she voted for and it's unclear how
Alice verifies that her vote was
correctly encrypted so we need a process
for that
how does Alice verify that her vote was
correctly encrypted and then how do we
tally things that are encrypted right
we've got encrypted votes how do you
count them all cryptographic protocols
are based for voting are based on this
concept the idea of a public bulletin
board where you can see everybody's name
and their encrypted ballot and then two
processes one to allow Alice to verify
that her vote was properly encrypted and
two to count encrypted votes is that
clear at a high level at this point you
should be like okay but there's some
serious black magic happening here
because of what's going on yes sorry
yeah
is there an issue about learning whether
somebody has voted it's a very good
question people disagree on that in
today's system you can find out who has
voted it's actually considered a
security feature that you can go and
find out if your neighbor has voted
because if you find out that your
neighbor was homesick then you know
somebody was stuffing the ballot box so
in the current legislation in the US and
in many other countries you can find out
who has voted and so this doesn't change
that property yes
so the registration lists are should
also be public you can go find out who
is registered to vote what their address
is and that's how you get all the
political mail by the way it's because
those lists are public and so is your
party affiliation that's why you get all
these illness may oh so yes that should
be a public resource where you can go
make sure that the person living here is
really a person as opposed to a business
or you know an empty lot any other
questions
yes she's going to be both allocated
which is about the first about when you
build cars to affirm people
I couldn't quite hear the rest of it it
was annoying that when I had turns up to
vote India's atmosphere to do not owe
identification yes that is definitely an
issue yes it's an issue that is actually
much more social than it is technical
because we could enforce really strict
requirements for authenticating when you
come in to vote but then there's a
problem as to who has the means to gain
those authentic ation tokens and such so
oftentimes we like to handle this with a
very serious threat of you know federal
you know prison if you you know like Ann
Coulter you vote in two different places
then maybe you might go to jail who
knows you know Christmas is around the
corner any other questions yes
because Alice has okay what you want
yes right right you do want to ensure
yet and again this is certainly an issue
that needs more exploration generally
from everything I found it tends to be
much more of a social issue for example
even requiring ID is something that will
prevent a whole bunch of people from
voting so there's a give-and-take here
you have to be very careful about to
somehow make sure there isn't massive
fraud while at the same time massive
disenfranchisement which is a problem
it's a tough one I think it's a lot more
social than technical in that case and
this in general this is the difficulty
with voting right everything you try to
do has a social impact I'm not talking
too much about the social impact of
using cryptography here but I'm happy to
take questions about it at the end
because there are certainly issues there
so the question everybody should be
asking is okay great how do we verify
stuff when there's encrypted data how do
we you know it's garbled the whole point
is we can't tell what it is
what do we how do we verify so this is
the idea that Steve mentioned before of
a zero knowledge proof I'm going to dig
into some more technical stuff now the
zero knowledge proof is the basic
construct that allows us to do
verification of operations on encrypted
data among other things but in this case
here's the example I like to use and I
last year I did this with physical
envelopes if I want to convince you that
I can give you an envelope that contains
the word Obama doesn't not a specific
envelope just I want to make sure that
you get an envelope a closed sealed
envelope and you're convinced that that
envelope contains the word Obama how
might I go about doing that well I could
give you a million envelopes all
containing the word Obama and you could
open all of them except one and you get
to choose the one you don't get to don't
open right so I give you a million you
open all but one you find out that all
the ones you open say Obama you're
pretty darn sure that the remaining one
says Obama because you got to pick which
one wasn't open does that make sense
that interactive process of me
committing to something by sealing a
million envelopes and you challenging me
by opening all of them but one and
having something left is the classic
interactive protocol of a zero knowledge
and we can do it with data by doing
encryption instead of sealed envelopes
and we can do it with really funky math
underneath that makes it way more
efficient than having to do a million
envelopes but the principle is that
right now at that point you may say okay
but now I've got myself one closed
envelope and nine hundred 9999 open
envelopes let's say Obama and if I walk
out of the voting booth with that then
it's pretty clear to anybody else given
all these envelopes I have what happened
right okay so I forgot to there you go
click through those two things the last
envelope likely contains Obama but now
you have all this evidence of the
process okay fine
so we're going to give you fake evidence
for the other process right before you
walk out of the booth I'm going to give
you nine hundred ninety thousand nine
hundred ninety nine open envelopes that
say Ron Paul and now you're walking out
with these two sets of open envelopes
and you're coercer is saying what does
that closed envelope say and you say it
says Obama I promise I did this
interaction I opened all these envelopes
they all said Obama and the courser says
yeah but all these other envelopes say
ron paul so which one is it what
actually happened in the booth there and
you have no evidence to convince this
person of which one happened you know in
your head what happened you're convinced
of what happened but you can't prove it
is that clear because that is the crux
of most of this stuff right any
questions
no no they're just stuff that gets
trashed afterwards like we're generating
a million envelopes on the fly you open
all them and the one that you don't open
ends up being your vote but the others
go away
not what right so sorry I didn't repeat
the question the question was whether
these million envelopes were the the
votes of other people and no in this
case this is this is purely for one
person voting we generate all this extra
data and then eventually we destroy it
and then the second question was how
does this actually apply I'm going to
show you that just now you have to
partially trust that we can do this
electronically in a way that doesn't
actually create a million physical
envelopes and and that's a hint of how
it applies but exactly how you make
these protocols human verifiable is very
tricky I'm going to show you an example
of how we do that just now any other
questions about the general concept yes
we two party devoted the person you are
trying to basically vote in the election
of thought yes the guy you're trying to
conceal from how you actually vote
and the zero-knowledge fruits team seems
to have more to do with how you actually
go through you it's it's both it's a way
of being sure that the system that's
letting you vote is encoding the right
vote while at the same time preventing
you from selling it so it's playing both
sides basically is that and the question
was there's a confusion as there's two
things that seem to be happening here
right the person who's helping you
encode the vote and the person who's
trying to coerce you does that answer
your question okay yeah there is an
issue that maybe you're hinting at which
is that the person who's creating those
envelopes for you knows how you voted
right obviously and that is always the
case when you're entering data into a
machine or when you're scanning it there
is a machine or some piece of the
equipment at that point that could know
how you voted in that case it's it's
something there is an issue there that
we can dig into yes okay clothing that
can write Alice coded for Bubba I'm
sorry to get closing you loop can yes
okay that's a very good point so the
person that the question is that the guy
writing the envelope could encode some
information on it may be an invisible
ink that says this is Alice voting or
something or other that later allows you
to trace that vote to Alice and this is
actually a very real worried in
cryptographic voting systems where
there's all this random data that goes
into encryption as you probably have
seen over the last few weeks you get to
pick the randomness so there could be
some steganographic technique for
embedding Alice's name into the
ciphertext and there are protocols that
defend against that but it's a brilliant
question yes yes in the back if I was a
cursor wouldn't I just change my tactics
like if I did find Paul or Obama to win
I would just target Googlers and say if
I see that you voted you're going to be
in trouble and that by de facto
suppressed come on you guys are way way
ahead of me yeah that's excellent and
actually this there's a sorry the
question thanks to you the question is I
could switch my coercion technique and
just make sure that nobody in Mountain
View votes right if I say anybody in
Mountain View votes I shoot them right
like that's all I do like if I see that
you vote I'm just going to shoot you
right so and so basically target a
region that you know votes one way or
another right and and force them not to
vote this is a this is a real issue you
can force them in different ways you can
have fewer voting machines in that area
for example which has happened in the
past right there's lots of ways to do
that based on the knowledge of who voted
and I don't have a good answer for that
because this is a real issue there's
another issue that's related if you're
interested in this and I'm perfectly
happy to go down these paths if there's
a kind of attack called a force
randomization attack where you can't
force somebody to vote a certain way but
if the protocol is formed in a certain
way you can force their vote to
effectively become random so I can't I
don't know how you voted but I know that
you didn't probably didn't vote for who
you wanted so again I can target an area
like Mountain View and force
randomizations by coercion of a bunch of
votes and I've effectively reduced the
votes for Obama right these are
excellent questions this is the these
are the reasons why voting is so hard
right all right let me run ahead because
I am I think I'm 33 minutes in or so and
I do want to get to some I can run well
I know that people have other things to
do you know you guys produce software to
write so you don't just sit in talks so
I want to present a system that I code
designed with Ron Rivest don't try to
poke practical too many practical holes
in the system because this system is
meant for pedagogical use it's meant to
explain how you would do these things in
the real world it does have certain
practical weaknesses but there's only so
much we can cover in an hour and I think
this can be pretty useful I'm going to
go through it a little quickly too
because there's I have done this before
and there's some interesting principles
in the end that are particularly cool
the general idea is you arrive at the
buthe and you receive two ballots in
fact you might get to pick them from two
different piles right and the ballots
look like this
they have perforations where the dotted
lines are down the vertical and over
here above this grey area which is a
scratch surface kind of like a lottery
scratch surface right this is a 2d
barcode which contains information I'll
tell you what information later and the
order of the candidates is randomized on
the ballots so likely you're going to
get two ballots with two different
orders of candidates and then there's
spaces for you to mark check marks on
the right hand side of the ballot okay
at this point you the voter are going to
pick one ballot to audit and one ballot
to vote with okay you get to choose you
flip the coin and decide which one you
want to vote with the one you want to
audit at the voting location there's a
place with a barcode scanner you get to
scratch off the scratch surface which
reveals some random data and you by
scanning this and scanning this this
data that you just revealed the display
on the reader should tell you exactly
what's on the left side none Paul Obama
right I'll tell you how that works in
just a second but the point is as a
voter you come in you pick a ballot to
vote with the other ballot you scratch
off beep beep you look at it you compare
you say yep that sounds good and then
you destroy that ballot the scratch
surface is basically void if scratched
right just like lottery tickets
sometimes so that ballot you destroy you
go vote with the other ballot at that
point if somebody was trying to cheat
you with a bad ballot and I'll tell you
what those are in a second they had a
50/50 chance of getting caught and in a
typical precinct with 200 voters they're
pretty much assured of being caught if
they try to corrupt more than just a
couple of votes just a handful of votes
and of course if any bad ballot is found
we do a serious investigation right all
the way to the source who printed them
who manufacture them why was this wrong
etc right so there is a first level of
auditing here interestingly this level
of auditing can be done by a political
organization a lot of these
cryptographic voting schemes have to do
with empowering
not just you but anybody else let's say
the ACLU the NRA they're all there ready
to help you audit your ballot you pick
one you give the one to the NRA and you
say check it and they check it they say
it's good you can go vote good you just
you move ahead right empowering
activists organizations and generally
all of these political organizations
that have a desire to make sure the
election is happening properly is a very
powerful side effect of these
cryptographic auditing techniques all
right so you checked one ballot you're
about to go vote with the other now
you're in private you're in the voting
booth and now you mark Obama because I
get to write the slides and at this
point you have selected Obama and you
then in private tear this thing in half
along the dotted lines right and you
discard the left half the left half goes
in a bin in a shredder or whatever
in fact ideally there's a whole bunch of
other left halves there so you can take
another one and claim you vote in a
different way right it's the principle
here that counts so now you step out of
the voting booth with just the right
half and the right half no longer says
who you're voting for it's just you know
it just looks like this does who knows
who you're voting for at this point you
then show this to an election official
who verifies that this scratch surface
has not been tampered with that you
haven't looked underneath it at which
point this gets detached and shredded in
public view this then gets scanned this
piece that remains gets scanned and you
also get to take it home
that's your ballot here is the public
Bolton board with ballots you have no
idea whether these votes are the same or
not and it turns out Alison Bridget
could have the same vote and Alison
Carroll even though their vote is in the
same position could be different votes
it depends on the ballot and the details
of the ballot are encrypted in this 2d
barcode so 2d barcodes we can stuff more
data on to the paper that's all it is
right any yes
you to audit to make sure that the
ballot you're dealing with is properly
formed because what you want to do is
you want to make sure that whatever is
encoded in here matches the candidate
ordering you're seeing on the left half
yes I'm sorry let me forget to say what
the question was which is what why did
you have to balance in the first place
you had two ballots in the first place
because one of them is for auditing and
the other one is for actual voting sorry
good I just if you took the check it
gets scammed so even a copy is posted on
the bulletin board yes so that's why you
get to take it home because you're also
scanning it I'm repeating it because I
forgot to repeat the question again
okay so now we're about to dig into it
sorry oh yeah
as I was actually going to ask the
audience if they at the end of this what
they what why they thought we threw that
away I the question was what do we do
with the scratch surface at the bottom
of it let me go through two more slides
and then I'll answer the question if
that's okay with you
because I'm about to tell you what's in
the data and what's under that scratch
surface and it should explain why we
have to destroy it so now I'm about to
get a little more technical still you
guys remember el-gamal encryption
algorithm crip ssin you don't have to
remember the details exactly you just
have to remember that you have a public
key Y and a secret key X and the public
key is G to the X modulo of Prime I'll
go over the math if you're following it
great if you're not hopefully your
you'll still see how this works
and GNP are well known yes we agree on
those parameters at the beginning of the
of the election P is a large prime at
this at this point and G is what's
called a generator of a ZP star to
encrypt a message we create a ciphertext
that's composed of two values the first
value is this this generator G
exponentiated to a random R that we pick
at the time of encryption the second
value is M times y to the R Y being the
public key now why do we do this we do
this because first of all by picking a
random number there can be many
different cipher texts for the same
plaintext right that's really important
in an election because when there's only
three candidates if encrypting the word
Obama always gave the same thing it
would be very easy to tell who voted the
same way right so encrypting Obama has
to give a different ciphertext every
time so that's why there's randomization
in there decryption happens by taking
this first value G to the R
exponentiating it to the private key so
that G to the power of R to the power of
X which is the same thing as G to the
power of X to the power of R and G to
the power of X is y so that's y to the
power of R and we can factor that out of
the second number and we get the message
back
right so using the secret key X we can
effectively factor out the randomization
from the second part of the ciphertext
and get the message back now why am I
telling you all this because algum all
has a really cool property called the
homomorphic property you can probably
forget most of what I just told you
except notice that if you take the
encryption of a message m1 and the
encryption of another message m2 and you
multiply them together you get the
encryption of the product this is how it
works in details the only thing you need
to notice that's that the randomization
factors get added up in the exponent and
the messages get multiplied so that's it
you've get that you take two ciphertext
you multiply them together you get the
ciphertext of the product okay well
that's not all that useful to multiply
stuff in elections but it would be
really useful to add stuff right if we
could add stuff under the covers of
encryption we take ciphertext and we can
add them together without knowing what
we're adding we would have some fairly
powerful primitive right wouldn't it be
nice if we could do it with an addition
instead well we can we can just by
tweaking algum all and putting the
message in the exponent right when we
multiply things messages in the exponent
get added right so instead of m over
here we do G to the M and then we can
add stuff of course when you decrypt now
you have to do this logarithm operation
discrete logarithm operation which is
hard to do so it turns out messages have
to be short maybe 20 25 bits 30 bits if
you've got Google MapReduce right but
you know limited in size so taking the
discrete log base G is okay for short
messages but really what you want to be
using is this more much more complicated
crypto system down here called the PI a
crypto system which lets you do the same
additive operation with much more
efficient hey there's the dog I guess we
were not coerced successfully at least
so the way that by a crypto system you
can decrypt messages much more
efficiently even if there
thousands of bits long so I'm giving you
an example with alcohol but really for
these systems you'd want to use PI a
that's not a problem don't worry
my wife will find this very amusing when
she sees it on YouTube so so what we do
now with these messages we can add right
if we had if we were voting Yes No
we could just have yes be one and no be
zero and when we have encryptions of
ones and zeros ero sum them up together
homomorphic Li and get one encryption at
the very end of the election just one
ciphertext and decrypt that one
ciphertext and get the counters get all
of the results get the result for the
yes no well we're not voting yes no
we're voting you know Obama Paul and
none or you know Green Party and other
candidates potentially so what do we do
well we just take the bit space that we
have and we slice it up into different
counters right there's only so many
voters in the US 28 bits is actually
plenty to represent the number of people
in the US so with a thousand bits we
have plenty of space for multiple
counters right so a vote for none would
be a one-off set appropriately a vote
for Obama would be a one-off set this
way and a vote for Paul would be just a
one and then if you have these encrypted
ones offset to the right position you
can just multiply them all together
literally I mean you just take these
values that are ciphertext and multiply
them all together and at the end of the
election potentially for the entire US
you have one ciphertext 1024 bits and
you just decrypt that and you have your
sums yes so you can't do both sadly in
the same system we don't know how to do
both the question was if you could do
multiplication and addition of
ciphertext you could do all computation
under the covers of encryption it would
be beautiful it would be a revolution
and we don't know how to do it it's not
clear we can do both in the same crypto
system you'd have to switch between one
and the other and then and don't you
know you can't do it anymore
yes
I didn't quite hear the question there
was a yes probably although you probably
have to be more worried about a
tempering of the so the question was if
you tamper with one vote do you could
you prevent decryption you would be able
to tell very quickly which vote had been
tampered with because it's easy to check
for whelmed form this of each individual
votes in these systems but the bigger
worry is if you tamper with one vote you
might be able to change the results in
two without being detected
right so yes you do have to worry about
these things being correct and that's
why you want to associate votes with
individual people who are registered as
voters so you know who's responsible for
what encrypted vote basically so let me
link it back to this scratch and vote
because I just went off into crypto land
here and maybe you're not quite sure why
I did that all right so this is the
ballot and the parameters are published
for the world to see this time I put
Paul is number one that way keep
everybody happy right these are just
public parameters number one is Paul
number two is Obama number three is none
and then we decide that the counter size
is going to be ten bits maybe that's all
we need for this particular election and
so in this 2d barcode now we're going to
include ciphertext for the three
candidates in the order that they are on
the left-hand side of the paper so that
means first the encryption of two to the
power of ten since that is Obama right
he's offset by one counter size the
second one none is number three so
that's two to the power of twenty and
then the last one is Paul which is just
one because we said he was the sort of
bottom those counter here and then down
here we put the randomization factors R
1 R 2 and R 3 that we use in the
el-gamal encryption or in the PI a
encryption it doesn't matter it's the
same concept yes
the bar for the bar code displayed of
the website or whatever to also contain
all that information so it will be very
useful
order so you're saying the barcode
contains all that information it's on
the website
yes but it's encrypted data so you can't
tell which one is which no in fact what
you need is you need to be able to have
the randomization factors which is why
we have the randomization factors under
the scratch surface so that when you
audit the ballot you're scratching that
off you get the randomization factors
which allows you to see aha
that that's Obama that's none that's
Paul good that matches what's on the
left side you need both the barcode and
the random factors underneath the
scratch surface does that make sense
so at this point maybe I can ask this
question why would we destroy the
scratch service before why do we visibly
destroy the scratch surface in front of
officials before we post the ballot
there yes exactly because if I have
access to the answer was you can't show
it to the courser if I have access to
these randomization factors and my vote
is now on the public bulletin board then
I could easily say see I voted for Obama
because with these randomization factors
you can decrypt the ciphertext here so
we show the the scratch surface to the
election official and we make sure it
hasn't been tampered with to prevent
coercion does that answer your question
okay great and yes sir is not the
election official it assumes that
there's enough people watching that
process and that's why we sort of rip
off the left half before we do it so
that there can be different party
officials watching this and making sure
that you're not being coerced by an
election official in general most
elections have that central weakness
which is if the election official wants
to coerce you they can put a camera in
the voting booth there's lots of things
they can do to figure out how you voted
that's really one of the weakest points
in general but maybe I answered the
question or yeah
any other questions okay here's another
question for you guys
remember thing I described there's one
thing if you're paying very close
attention you should be very worried
about and it has to do with the way that
we're homomorphic Li tallying things up
I said you know the ones are offset over
here and you just sum things up and you
get the result at the end is there
anything we should be worried about yes
exactly exactly that's much better put
than I could have thought yes exactly
good that the answer was greater than
100% turnout is what we want to be
worried about in particular if we have a
corrupt election official who's
collaborating with a corrupt voter he
can hand me the wink wink magic secret
ballot that contains 42 over here for
Obama so that when I check that box
magically I add 42 to the Obama counter
and I get greater than 100% turnout yes
yeah yeah you'd have to associate it
with a valid person and it would have to
probably be signed by the voting
official at some point but you're right
that in general if you're not careful
about how these ballots get onto the
bulletin board you can be worried about
this in other cases so you're we're
getting to a solution there by what
you're talking about is it which the way
you said is maybe the data could be
signed so that we know that this ballot
is an official approved ballot in which
case we're still worried about the
election officials tampering with it but
yes we're getting closer to a solution
did you have another point yes except at
the end of the day you have to have one
ballot associated with your name on the
public bulletin board that's one of the
that's that's important it's actually
one of the ways you can prevent ballot
stuffing in these systems is by ensuring
that every ballot is associated with a
name the question was maybe you can vote
with both ballots instead of auditing
one and voting with the other any other
questions about that and we can make
this even worse because I could have +42
over here and -41 for for Paul let's say
right and then I wouldn't have more than
100 percent turnout I would just be
taking votes away from the other guy the
way we fix that it turns out is that we
can have an extra type of zero knowledge
proof inside here which is called a
non-interactive zero knowledge proof
that further verifies that all of these
ciphertexts encode one in the
appropriate spot I'm not going to go
into the details of it but think of it
as extra math that provides integrity
checks that this is done correctly and
it's even stronger than the signature
approach because you don't have to trust
anybody you can just look at the proof
and the math will tell you that these
cipher texts you don't know which one is
Obama which one is Paul and which one is
none but you know that they're only one
of the of the three and nothing and not
42 of one but that's the kind of stuff
you have to be worried about when you
use the tricky math right like hey
summing under the covers of encryption
that sounds great but you've got all
these issues that you have to deal with
is that clear like so in summary this is
what your ballot looks like you've got
ciphertexts over here in the 2d barcode
you've got randomization factors under
the scratch surface you've got the left
side here that better match these
ciphertext and that's what you ought it
in the first place and then you have
homomorphic tallying based on the
ciphertext here and the selection of the
ciphertext indicated by the checkmark
that's scratching vote do you start to
see and please say no if you don't but
do you start to see that there's
something different about this process
compared to other election systems where
now as an observer you have the power to
look at the public bulletin board and
make sure your vote is there you have
the power to Reaper form the tallying by
multiplying all these things together
and you have the power to look at the
proofs the mathematical proofs or
delegate to somebody nerdier than you
write to do the proofs for you and make
sure that this happened correctly yes
right so this is an issue that I've kind
of swept aside because otherwise there
are just too many things to ant to
answer the question is who decrypts the
tally at the end and the decryption is
done by a number of Elections officials
together in a threshold scheme meaning
that only when they all get together a
representative from each party let's say
can they perform the last decryption so
we prevent any one party from decrypting
a single ciphertext we just wait for all
of them to agree on what the tally
ciphertext is and then they get to
decrypt that one so is that clear or if
you're unsure of why this is any
different process wise please ask this
yes
yeah so the question is how does Alice
verify that her vote actually counted
from Obama for Obama in the fact that
Alice gets two ballots at the beginning
and gets to audit one meaning making
sure that the one she audits is
performed correct is has the correct
ordering she gets a certain degree of
confidence that the other one does and
you could do with a thousand ballots if
you wanted more but that's a little
tedious so instead in this scheme we
rely on the aggregate of all the voters
doing this and making sure that if one
of them has an issue its investigated
more deeply does that it senator
question so in count in combination with
the fact that that she can take her
ballot home and then check that it's on
the public bulletin board of course
right so she the idea of having these
encrypted votes is that Alice gets to
keep checking after she's gone that the
vote made it to the bulletin board that
it's still the same given the barcode
that it made it into the talion that the
decryption happened correctly so there
is that sort of the the moment that
you're there in the voting booth
you get certification that it was
captured correctly and then afterwards
because it's encrypted you can track it
like a FedEx package all the way to the
end right yes yes the barcode is part of
the bulletin board
yes ideally you have your barcode reader
but like I said there are some edge
issues here to deal with but yeah oh
yeah you can look by hand sure yes why
so we're
that's right the secret key for
decryption has been thresholds shared
among the the various political parties
so each political party has a share of
it basically yeah correct
if the key were to be recombined it
could be used to invalid to figure out
everybody's vote which is why the way
you want to do it is with protocols that
allow that don't require the physical
combination of the key it allows every
authority to perform their share of the
decryption and post their share of the
decryption on the bulletin board I
didn't want to get into the details of
that because it gets a whole nother
chunk to explain but yes when you have
to do that decryption part carefully yes
yes one party is going to win make it
all white population by giving yes and
the question is if all the losing
parties realize they're losing they
could decide to not decrypt what you
what you usually do in that case is that
you take their share of the key and then
you seek re secret share that across a
whole bunch of the other parties so that
basically if somebody's being
uncooperative the other parties can say
well we think you're being uncooperative
and recover that share it gets a little
messy and complicated but that's the
general idea is you do give yourself
backups in that case yeah yeah any other
questions there's a couple of other
really cool things I wanted I want to
show you but I'm closing in on the end
of our time people want me to continue
all right
I'm happy to continue what I want to say
is I've presented the system because I
think it's useful to present but there's
a whole bunch of other work in this area
that I strongly recommend you look into
if you're interested work by folks like
David Chou and Andy Neff and Ron Rivest
and a whole bunch of people it's just
fantastic area of work but the one thing
I want to tell you about is the question
that should be on all of your minds
because clearly when the next election
comes you're not going to be selecting
one of the candidates right you're going
to be writing in your choice not
everybody does this of course
right ends are this issue that's that
you know very rarely does a write-in
candidate ever
Wyn but the fact that it's there on the
ballot can prevent some of them ugliness
from happening at the registration of
candidates at the time of registration
of candidates right there is this sort
of disincentive to make it too hard to
register as a candidate because you
could always run a write-in campaign who
knows if it really works in that sense
but it's there
and it's one of the attributes that we
would have to preserve if we wanted this
to be a real system and there's another
issue which is that sometimes people
don't feel so good about the idea that
individual ballots go poof right the
idea that you only get the aggregate at
the end of the day sometimes people
aren't very comfortable with that they
want the individual ballots to remain so
there are solutions fantastic solutions
to being able to anonymize individual
ballots instead of using this
homomorphic combination to whittle them
down to one ciphertext and the class of
protocols and does is has called mixed
Nets you may have heard of mixed nuts in
and not anonymous communication
protocols there are different kinds of
mixed nets the ones we use in voting are
called robust mixed nets or sometimes
synchronous mixed nets or basically they
do all their mixing in huge batches they
don't mix in small batches like like
various anonymous email protocols do
this is this is about waiting for all
the inputs and then producing a mixed
batch of the inputs and the idea is that
a mixed net is composed of a number of
mixed servers run by mutually
distrusting parties right so think of it
as there's a bag of the you know there's
a ballot box of votes and the
Republicans are going to shake it up and
the Democrats are going to shake up the
ballot box and the independents are
going to shake up the ballot box and
because everybody's had a turn
everybody can trust that you know
they've shaken it up enough that nobody
knows which vote went where and
literally the idea is to take every
individual input an encrypted vote
shuffle them and output them the problem
is when you're dealing with data and
cipher texts that are unique because we
said we use randomization so that no two
encrypted ballots for Obama ever look
the same well if I just take a whole
bunch of data and shuffle them
it's not really hard to figure out where
they came from right their unique values
they're just bits how do we actually
shuffle them so we actually need to
modify the values along the way and the
simplest way to do that is using
something called a Chow Mian mix net or
an onion and that is to say the value
that goes in is not just the encryption
of a message it's the layered encryption
of the message first the message is
encrypted with a last NIC server's
public key and then with the middle
mixed server's public key and then with
the first mixed server's public key so
it's like an onion with layers of
encryption and it hopefully doesn't make
you cry but the message goes through the
first server and it gets decrypted one
layer gets decrypted the mix server
can't go any further it can only do that
one layer because only it has that
secret key and it doesn't have the
secret keys for the internal layers so
it one layer gets undone and then it
gets shifted to a new position and there
you go so the outputs don't look
anything like the inputs and the same
thing for the second mix server it
unwraps one layer shifts it to a
different position and the same thing
for the third one and at the end proof
out comes the plain text vote now we can
all count them does that make sense is
there a problem with the system
exactly right I mean the mix server can
do whatever it wants right it could at
this point it could just produce a value
that is the the double layered
encryption of whatever plaintext it
wants so how do we trust we can trust
this for privacy the fact that enough
shuffling is happening but we can't
trust this for integrity because the mix
that could introduce any values at wants
so protocols that verify mix nets there
are tons of them and they're fascinating
and there's so much cool math there but
the simplest one the most beautiful one
involves very little math and it's a
protocol that's due to Jacobs to Jew
Jacobson jewels and Rivest and this from
2002 and it goes something like this
well if a mix server has Mitch has mixed
a bunch of votes
let's audit it by asking how it mixed
half of them right so where did you mix
this one I mixed it here and here are
here's the proof of how I decrypted it
the mix server has to reveal that
information what about this one and this
one and this one and this one okay I've
audited half of them and then when we
ask the next mix server well we're
careful to ask about different ones so
we don't create a whole path all the way
through
we basically query the mix servers and
ask them to reveal half of their
correspondences with all of the
cryptographic information needed to
understand how they decrypted it and how
they passed it on and we make sure that
there's no path all the way through
otherwise we would reveal how Alice
voted does that make sense any questions
on that it's super simple and it has
some very nice properties which is that
if the mix server screws with one vote
it has a 50/50 chance of getting caught
if it messes with two votes it has a 75%
chance of getting caught and the more
votes you get the higher the probability
of it getting caught if it's messing
with ten votes it has a 99.99% chance of
getting caught and it's going to get
caught right
it's not perfect because it could mess
with a couple of votes and we don't
really like that we could do better than
that but it's very clean and very
beautiful and it involves very little
math is it does that make sense
there is an operational problem with
this because what happens is that very
much like somebody asked over here one
of the mixed servers you know let's say
the green party mix server could decide
you know this election is not going so
well for me I'm just not gonna mix today
sorry you know I just don't want to do
it I got the secret key I'm not mixing
looks like we're losing you know so
instead we can do re-encrypted mix
servers el-gamal has some beautiful
properties remember I told you you can
mix you can multiply ciphertext you can
multiply values under the covers of
encryption well one of those values you
can multiply in is one right take the
encryption of a message multiply it by
an encryption of one and you get the
same the ciphertext for the same message
but with different randomization and you
don't need the secret key to do that you
just need the public key so you can
create the encryption of one and then
multiply it in that's all you need so a
rien Krypton mix server basically takes
its inputs rien crips it effectively
sprinkling in some more randomness and
put shifts into a different position and
if any mixed server decides to take a
day off then you can just replace it
with another mix server because it has
no secret data there's no fixed secret
data ahead of time that it needs to have
to know how to do this does that make
sense
you can still verify this with the same
method but what's really nice with Riaan
Krypton mixed nets and the properties of
algum all is you can have all sorts of
fantastic protocols that allow you to
get much higher probability that no
votes were ever messed with and here is
the simplest technique by which you can
do that you have the mixed server
mix once it's true shuffle the one
that's really going to count and then
you have it do kind of a shadow mix a
second one and also output those outputs
over
here right so it's outputting it's real
output saying these are my real ones and
then these are my shadow outputs and
then you flip a coin and you say okay
either reveal to me your shadow mix over
here all the randomization factor you
used and the permutation you use to
shift those things around or reveal to
me the difference between the shadow mix
and the real output mix over here
meaning what is the permutation that
gets me back to the real output and what
are the differences in the randomization
factors if you look at the math it
actually works out if you do both three
encryptions you can actually figure out
the difference between the rien crip
shion's and so by doing this by saying
okay give me a shadow mix and then
challenging by saying give me the pre
mix or the post mix you're forcing the
mix server to do the right thing and it
could only lie on one of those two on
the on one side or on the other side it
can't lie on both so every time you do
this you have a 50% chance of catching
it and the beautiful thing is you can do
this over and over and over again you
can just say okay give me another shadow
mix I'm going to challenge you on that
one
give me another shadow mix I'm going to
challenge you on that one now you do
that 80 times and you've got a you know
one minus two to the eighty chance that
everything is good one okay which is
basically perfect you can just keep
challenging on shadow mixes and asking
it to make sure that it did that
correctly and because for a given shadow
mix you're only revealing the left's
half or the right half but never both
you've never revealed the whole mix in
fact you reveal no information at all
about the whole mix does that make sense
this should feel similar to the envelope
trick I talked about earlier right this
idea that I present you with some
information I kind of commit to the
shadow mix and then you challenge me on
part of it and if I if I screwed up on
that part then I get caught and we can
repeat this over and over again to make
sure that there's very little chance I
screwed up and all the time without
revealing the main mix
does that make sense any other questions
I'm reaching the end here I talked about
the decryption I just want to say a
couple words when we have these
anonymized ballots at the end we need to
decrypt them and we need to do so with a
threshold system that allows multiple
parties to do that together and no
single party to do it alone because we
don't want somebody to decrypt before
the anonymization has happened before
the shuffling has happened and we want
it to be provable that I'm definitely
sweeping under the rug you just got to
trust me that just like you can prove a
shuffle you can also prove correct
decryption there are other math
techniques to do that they tend to be a
little more complicated but it's it's
all in the end of the day it's all math
related to the el-gamal encryption and
these interactive protocols for proving
that you know how the decryption
happened so at a high level popping all
the way back up crypto voting schemes
all work the following way Alice and her
pals are voting by encrypting their
ballot somehow there are many different
techniques scratch and vote is one of
them there's a process by which Alice
verifies that her vote was properly
encrypted and gets a receipt of her
encrypted vote at that point the
encrypted votes go through an anonymous
Asian process which can either be the
mix net or the homomorphic compression
there's a couple of other techniques but
those are the two major techniques they
go through a decryption process which is
threshold meaning it's distributed among
multiple people so there isn't one group
that can do all the decryption and then
the results are posted for everybody to
tally and at every step of the way there
are mathematical proofs produced that
these things happen correctly and Alice
can make sure that her vote made it here
that the anonymization process preserved
it that the decryption process preserved
it and that it made it into the tally
the right analogy is some kind of FedEx
tracking number that actually has
meaning not just isn't just random and
in the first step you verify that
meaning you verify that it is truly the
encryption of your vote and after that
it's just a tracking number
yes she can't track exactly what path it
takes but she can see from the proof
that it was preserved all the way
through she doesn't know which point
where it ends up she just knows it ends
up somewhere the question was how does
she track it through the mix now she
can't track it exactly but she can know
it's somewhere in there
that's right so the anonymization steps
and the decryption steps are performed
by election authorities and every result
is posted on the bulletin board think of
it as a website where you can go and
check and see aha
there's the data coming in the votes
have now been anonymized and now
decrypted and here are the proofs I can
download them and check them and
literally you can have anybody do this
the voters you know the newspapers the
the political organizations anyone can
look at this data and make sure it
happened correctly
if the key is found that's correct
that's why the key is never present in
one place it's generated in a
distributed manner
it really is physically never in one
place it's not like the election
officials get together agree on it and
then split it up they really just have a
protocol that where it's never
physically or even digitally in one
place it there's shares of it it's the
piece I didn't describe because it gets
to tends to be quite technical but I'm
happy to send references if you're
interested it it is in general in these
voting protocols there is a way if all
election officials collude for them to
know how you voted right if they all
collude they could decrypt your vote
that sounds scary but it turns out not
to be very different from the situation
today if everybody at the polling
station is collaborating against you
they can just have the Machine tell them
how you voted when you scan your piece
of paper in so this is just more
explicit about it yes
how does she know that her vote counted
so it's a combination of things there's
not a single check right there's the
check that it that it was properly
encrypted that she gets to do in the
voting booth and then she checks that it
when she gets home she checks that her
receipt matches the website and then she
checks that every step was performed
correctly when does the vote get on the
website there are different theories
about that it could be immediately or it
could be at the end of the day probably
for security purposes in the fact that
you don't want these machines networked
all the time
dumping them to the website at the end
of the day is preferable just for
practical security purposes not for any
deep reason you this would this delay
results it turns out not so much that
the process for anonymization and
decryption of 2000 ballots which is
bigger than most precincts is under half
an hour of computation time on your
average computer oh but the auditing can
happen afterwards right the auditing can
happen as long as you want and the
verification takes about takes a lot
less time actually so once it's posted
you know what you what you could do is
you can post the encrypted votes post a
proof of the naanum is a ssin post the
decryption proof well no post the proof
of anonymization and stop here give all
the papers you know an hour or so to
check it
say yes thumbs up and then decrypt and
produce the results the important thing
to note is that even though election
results are given to you the night of it
takes two weeks to certify them meaning
the result can change for two weeks
after the election and sometimes it does
in this case this part of this almost
certainly wouldn't slow things down any
more than they are currently and the
right way to do it would be to produce
the result and spend the next two weeks
verifying and making sure that
everything went okay giving everybody
the time to verify it before
certification yes
the wall suppose miss counts and someone
lost the chip that happened there just
purely random with some some percentage
a chance and not a lot malicious those
are enough stuff get lost every election
that there's no way you can do this
completely so the question is doesn't
enough stuff get lost that there's no
way you could do this completely I think
if stuff gets lost here it's really
going to happen before it gets posted
here once it gets posted it's really
just data management by the precinct and
if stuff gets lost at that point there's
a there's a problem the nice thing about
cryptographic voting systems is that
when stuff gets lost
you actually know which voters were
affected so you actually could
theoretically ask them to come back I
mean there are some process issues
around that but you could write yes
auditing point of view is testing
background chisholm I guess so you
challenge the server you get a response
back that's black box testing yes versus
white box we actually would even have a
source code and the algorithm like is
there an argument to be said that
everything along the way should be like
verifiable down
here that's not a good result but the
source-code ebony - so that's a that's a
very good question the question is this
is black box testing versus white box
testing should we be also verifying the
algorithms and everything inside there I
believe that yes it would be good if all
of the code were there for you to verify
but the problem is that you have no idea
which code is actually running on the
machine so the only thing you can do is
black box testing and the only thing you
can do is verify that the results not
the process was done correctly and this
is actually a really interesting
distinction that at first sounds very
subtle but actually it's very key to
this whole thing which is that we give
up on verifying that the source code has
been correctly installed we give up on
verifying even that the source code is
correct we only check the results and
the mathematical proofs of the result so
it's a black box proof that gives you
exactly what you need which is to say
these ciphertexts were correctly mixed
that's all you care about
so one subtle case where what you're
saying matters is for example maybe the
random number generator that shuffles
these things around is not very good and
it didn't really shuffle them very well
we actually can't test for that we just
know that they were shuffled we don't
know how well they were shuffled and so
we fixed that by saying a bunch of
people will shuffle them and we hope
that at least one of them will do a good
enough job but that's the subtle
distinction and it's it's what I think
is particularly cool about this
cryptographic verification which is that
you say I don't care how you write the
code you want to write it in Fortran
have a blast just you know whatever you
want to write that's fine it actually
even enables proprietary models for
voting companies that are very afraid of
releasing their source code I don't
think they should be afraid but they are
so we say okay don't release your source
code but produce the mathematical proofs
that let us know that you did the right
job without telling us how you did it
but this is a key question I'm really
glad you asked it thank you yes
has this been implemented it turns out
that the company that has come the
closest to getting that that has
implemented this and come the closest to
getting it deployed is a company called
vote here in in Seattle they have had a
very hard time getting this approved and
used even though they've made
unbelievable advances in the
practicality of it especially in the
vote casting sense it's very difficult
to actually show people to explain to
people how revolutionary this is because
if you look at the talk I just gave and
I've given you know a dozen of these
before it's really hard to explain to
people all the interesting details of it
without getting too technical and this
is where this stuff gets really hard and
sometimes disappointing which is that
it's pretty advanced and people believe
that because it's advanced it can't be a
good system because a voting system
needs to be understandable by everybody
and so on and so forth so that's a very
deep and interesting conversation I've
written quite a bit about it my personal
feeling is that if the process is public
if the algorithms are public there are
people who can help you verify it and as
long as it's open as long as the only
thing preventing you from auditing is
just skills and reading enough books
then that's a much better system than
auditing by privilege being the right
person at the right time who gets to
audit so even though this is more
technically complicated and the adoption
process is bound to be gruesome I still
think it's better because there's no
preference as to who gets to audit if
you want to put in the effort you can
it's no it's open to you
are there risks that are not enough
implementers and so that one implementer
could corrupt the system I think the
right question or the the sort of the
question that would hit at a closer
problem would be are there enough
verifiers because if there's only one
implementer but plenty of verifiers it's
totally fine right oh well they should
be writing there that's right so
implementers of verification systems
fair enough
yes there should be enough implementers
of verification systems to make sure
that this is done correctly is there a
risk that there aren't enough I don't
know I think this would make a very good
project for your average grad student or
your average you know all these folks
who want to build useful systems that
are of a certain technical level a very
great job for Google to you know you
could the point is that anyone with a
few extra a little bit of extra time
could write the code right and if your
family only trusts you to help them with
technology you could write the you know
a couple hundred lines of code because
really that's all it is
to verify this and you could say yes
I've checked it it went okay that's the
real power in my mind you can ask
anybody with the skills and they can
write the verification code the
verification code is much shorter than
the proof code by the way yes another
question
it's it's a verification of the results
of the output so it is black box in that
sense but it's not just the results come
with these proofs right these
interactive proofs I mentioned where the
math tells you it must have been done
correctly and I know for folks who are
used to testing in sort of black box
white box testing this is very odd and
this is very weird it should appear to
be very weird and hopefully you know the
only thing I can hope for in this talk
is to prompt you to look more into it
because all of these cryptographic
proofs these your knowledge proofs are
really counterintuitive at first they
really go against the grain of typical
software engineering but they are truly
powerful in the sense that you don't
need to look at the source code you just
need to look at the output and the
output is self-certifying yes please do
they get to choose their random numbers
in the process that's wow that's a
really deep question because if you get
to choose your random numbers then you
can maybe put some subliminal
information in there and it gets a
little crazy
choosing the right random numbers is an
interesting challenge and there there
are different ways to do that that's a
that's a whole nother conversation but
it's a good question yeah the hard thing
is making sure you're picking good
random numbers but you're not giving
individuals in the system too much power
that they can start using this as a side
channel basically some random numbers
get like folder and say eventually if
you'll just like
that's correct so can the voter in the
Machine pick random numbers together
that's generally the approach that's
taken those getting some randomness from
both sides the problem is making sure
you do that without making the process
too complicated for voters right that's
the difficulty yes okay great mm-hmm
yes
so Barbara Simmons was here you're
saying from a couple weeks ago and she's
from verified voting and you're saying
that's yeah
and wonder
right so you're saying that Barbara
Simmons you asked if why don't doesn't
verified voting set their sights on
systems more like this one sorry and she
said that's not really their goal I
think to be as objective as I can be
about this there's a number of people
who think truly honestly that we are
never going to be able to implement
these systems or at least not anytime
soon and so the best we can do is try to
implement paper trails and better audit
ability of existing systems without
revolutionising how they're done my
personal opinion is that if you look at
how far the technology has come and it's
much further along than what I've
explained here we are really ready to
start testing this stuff and we actually
probably have a duty to start testing
this stuff because in the end I think
it's much more democratic to have as
many people as possible be able to
verify it but there are honest
disagreements about how ready this
technology is and I think Barbara fits
in the category of folks who certainly
is aware of this technology but doesn't
think it's quite ready yes
that's a very good question which is
maybe the readiness is not a is not a
technological question it's a societal
acceptance question I think that's true
at the same time the argument has often
been made that we don't seem to worry
about the acceptability of a lot of
other technology that we use for
life-saving purposes on a day-to-day
basis what we care about is the
auditability process in the involvement
of enough people in the case of voting
we should be able to involve as many
people as wished to but I think it's
acceptable to require a certain level of
technical knowledge to do so but you
know that's a really that's a tough
discussion it's a tough one yes yes
since that system is more adapted to
standard
yeah systems which like multiple
channels that's correct so the question
is what about things that are more than
just voting for one candidate turns out
voting for multiple candidates you can
do with homomorphic tallying and you can
probably do with mix net too but the
interesting question there when you
choose to publish individual ballots is
you hit that issue I was talking at the
beginning which is the inherent
limitations of a system when you have a
given output if you give the voter the
ability to embed significant information
in their ballot for example rank the
following 25 candidates according to
your order of preference right then you
could just pick the first two you really
like and use the bottom 23 to embed
information about who you are right as a
subliminal channel so the difficulty
there is a much more fundamental one in
these other voting systems how much
verifiability can you get if you have
this much more information you can embed
in the ballot these systems can be used
it's just they hit a natural limitation
much earlier yes is no one adopted this
no one has currently adopted this kind
of system at this time that's right hey
could you yes my president
yeah get them to adopt it for their
University and then every way to the
society because everyone go to that way
oh hey it's it's a very big oh yeah so
the question is can we start with
student elections and sort of get get
this stuff through people's heads and
then they get used to it and eventually
the world is a better place that's a
strategy that a few of us have been
trying to follow but it has it and it
has been somewhat successful to a
certain degree I should give credit to
David Cham and his team because they
have used one of these systems punch
scan David Chapman
which is also a paper-based system a bit
like scratch and vote but with some
slightly different technology and
they've implemented it on paper with the
printers and the hole punchers and
everything they need and they have run a
handful of student elections on it and
they're trying to follow that route so
maybe that is the route that will become
successful there's another point of view
that says those will always be looked
upon as toy elections student elections
and in fact it might be
counterproductive to go that route and
we really just need to have a method for
testing in real elections and that
method might be you pick a precinct and
you say this year you guys are the the
guinea-pig precinct and here's how it's
going to work you're all going to come
in and vote using this new technology
and if something goes wrong you come
back tomorrow vote deal using the old
technology and that's how it goes so
there are different points of view on
this we've got a we have to wrap up
folks I'm thanks so much for probably
the best set of questions I've gotten on
this subject in a long time certainly
competitive with the folks back at
Harvard when I gave this talk over there
Harvard grad students too so if there
any other questions you can reach me
then at ECS harvard.edu or you can
google me I'm sure and find all my
contact information I really appreciate
it thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
