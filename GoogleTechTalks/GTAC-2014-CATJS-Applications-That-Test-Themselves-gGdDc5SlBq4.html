energized and hydrated and alert once
again hopefully nobody ate too much
don't fall asleep we have some really
good talk lined up right now Miss around
and dr are going to talk about their
open source framework that they have
developed that helps mobile apps test
themselves thanks so hi everyone my name
is leo and joining me today run and we
are from HP softer what was usually well
back sometimes i go mercury interactive
and i want to discuss today about caches
which is a new testing framework for
mobile web but before we drill down to
how it works and while run sets of the
demo are live demo hopefully i would
like to give a little bit of a history
about why we created it what was the
motivation for creating yet another
testing framework so and it all happened
when I was asked to create a new project
a new product inside HP software that's
my day job I in Cuba new project and I
did what I usually do I got budget for a
small team I assembled a small team we
call that the 18 because we had four
guys and set the strategic direction for
the product so everything was
progressing really really nice after a
few weeks were already we had a walking
MVP and there were two major factors for
having that bad product that MVP first
we had a killer pipeline which enabled
us to push code and experiment a lot and
the second thing is that we had a great
team culture it was based on trust on
quality on fast feedback again an able
us to push code very very fast and
achieve good results so everything was
looking bright and then we found out
that we made a small mistake that most
of the users will consume the product
from mobile and not desktop well big
surprise
and so our designer we're happy right we
designed the old think maybe the
responsive to support all the different
form factors the developers were happy
they got some new devices and we start
implementing the application and then we
start testing the application and we are
failing we are stuck we just couldn't
understand what the quality of the
product of the application too many
devices dominated too much time and not
enough tools so we did was what most
engineers good engineers do we start to
research and identify the most common
frameworks out there and we narrow it
down to two or three and start
implementing this but what we found
quite fast that we are spending sorry
investing a lot of time it was investing
a lot of time on the infrastructure of
the test on tests on flaky tests as a
lot of people mentioned here and at a
certain point we understood that well
most of the time is going on the test
frameworks on the test of setting up the
test and not testing it even got to a
certain point that we were developing or
investing more time on the frameworks or
making it work then developing the
application so we took a decision and
instead of adjusting our developer our
developers to the framework we put the
developer in the center and try to
enable and empower him to write test
much more easy and much more fast so to
do it we had to overcome few challenges
the first challenge is our developers
just wanted to write test and that it
will run on any device any operating
system any project that they didn't want
to do any any configuration just push a
code and have it run on any device any
browser anyways the second challenge was
to make it simple readable and reliable
again flaky test maintaining the
infrastructure they didn't want to focus
on that so
we handle that and of course we also
made the co deserve the test code based
on the same code based of the
application which in our case is
JavaScript or a big believer in html5
that's the project it was focused on
mobile web third we wanted it to fit
into our existing life cycle we all
already had a good pipeline we didn't
want to change it we didn't want to
create a new standards we wanted to
stick to the existing existing existing
their standards like unit test and now
you report it and so on and so on and
last we wanted it to be extensible in
open so if a certain developer doesn't
like the assertion library that we come
in our framework we can just plug in
another assertion library and it will be
very very easy and also enabling to add
add additional test type for example not
just functional tests but also
performing tests or usability so our
architectural which is plug-in based
enable them to do so so a little bit
about kgs architecture in a very very
high level oh how it works it has three
steps or three components first you
write scrubs this is a new approach for
testing where you write your code your
test code side by side with your code
scrubs is small building blocks set a
functionality which you can write and
test once you write your tests or your
right your scrub you then run catch is
that jess is based on on GS basically
what it does is scan your project
identify the different scrubs inject the
testing code into application rebuild
the application as a test deployment
push it to the device and then execute
it and of course report back to our
central repository of result agente and
so are there any other sea ice so now
one will demonstrate how we can have a
demo in less than five live them on less
than five minutes I I hope
everybody for those who didn't catch my
name I'm Lance near and I one of the
developers of kgs and i want to show you
an example with kgs that will give you a
small taste of what coaches is all about
and how easy and fast it can be
sometimes to build a full automation of
your mobile web application we need to
switch to the slides place it's can you
switch back to the slides ok great thank
you but before we start we need to set
up our environment so as Leo said car GS
is based on no jet technology so by
simply clicking NPM install dash gk Diaz
will install kgs as the command line
tool in your environment and cut yes we
call it cut CLI will help you to create
and execute your test deployment we have
a new approach for testing this is based
on scrap scrap is a small common
temptation that you need to add to your
application code that will be later on
in with the cutter like process will be
injected as a small functionality unit
in your test deployment collecting all
the scrubs together we'll create a full
automation of your mobile web
application and this will add the
ability to the application to test
itself instead of other framework as you
know and now scrubs are pluggable you
can use the building plugins that we
already created for you like the jas
assertion if you need to test and check
things send Jeff like and the most
common one is the jquery mobile but if
you really like you can create your own
customized plugin for your own needs but
scrub can do a lot more than regular Dom
manipulation scrap can also manipulate
jeaious objects
as you can see the scope of angularjs
that I think you will like recognize
that get training from Leo relevant to
Anthony and the test deployment now for
today's event I have created a kind of
example that will show cut yes abilities
now if we can switch to the computer
great okay we all talked about continues
the delivery now in our team we have
created a application that check GPS
location but we had many troubled
checking that so we found the solution
with coaches and I created for today
when the application I am at this is the
kind of a game that you need to guess
where you are while the application
reveals where you really are now after
24 hours of flight from Israel Tel Aviv
to you I can really relate to that
because I woke up in my hotel this
morning and I need to have any clue
where I am so luckily i have this
application so i know that today I'm a
GTECH so we'll click google Caitlyn and
click go now to maps will be real one
will be the guest where I think I am and
the other will show where I really act
so simple now let let's create this
automation with kgs so we need to add a
couple of scrub to the application code
and let's dive into our code we have the
input element we need to set that we are
at Google Kirsten so we i'm using the
jquery mobile plugin to set the text of
the input where to google kirkland
simple first step now let's create
another scrub we need to click the Go
button now I'm adding another scrap by
simply using them again the jQuery
Mobile plug-in to click the Go button ok
I finished with that
need to check my result I need to check
that point a my guess and point B is the
exact same point at the exact same
location so I'm taking the scope of
angularjs with the point a and point B
and i'm using the assertion plugin with
the google maps api and I think that
radius of five kilometers is about a
correct guess and the test will
succeeded otherwise it will fail now we
need to run it so in the meantime when
they all show you explain about cut j/s
i created a small mobile lab over it
with few devices that you will see just
now and now we will run the test we will
see that on all the devices also in my
laptop and we can see cut you I on the
right corner that shows that is setting
the text clicking the Go button said ok
about the location yeah you didn't
manage to do that and now we can see
that one map is ok we see the same
location and the other two two devices I
have bug on them the GPS location is not
working so well so those results will be
later on will be imported to Jenkins CI
and that's it simple as that five
minutes it took me and I think it's
wonderful in this time now let's move
back to the slides and we'll go to
finish wrap it up and actually cod jess
is an open source and we need your app
to take to take action in this growing
community we want you to download us
from get up all the npm repository give
us feedback tell us what you need and we
will try to up you as much as we can we
haven't also we given process this month
for selected up the
with kgs so try us out and thank you for
listening great talk thank you so much
do we have any like questions in the
audience and thanks for your hot spot
right hi it's a great test automation
tool I think I have a few questions that
I wrote down well during the
presentation so doesn't the codebase
increases the size of the whole
application given that it is running on
the device so I'm writing down my code
and in embedding the application I'm
melting my test automation right yeah it
doesn't really increase the size of the
given that it is running on the device
itself it's a notation base and before
production for example I think that
might be the problem part we can minify
wait we can take it out but it's like
adding comments to your code which isn't
so good it's so bad you know usually you
want the destitute reflect what's the
code is doing yeah in general we have
test code separate than the dev code
like the world production code so that's
why I'm asking this and there is also a
second option that you don't have we had
a feedback before so there is also the
possibility to do it outside of your
code so there is that configuration and
you know it's just a new approaches what
we are feeling yeah we'd work for us to
have the code the test code and the code
side by side and that port for us okay
and is there any way to actually when
the code is being shipped then take out
the code automatically or is it like now
we have can take it outside gain so why
not experiment you minify your project
all the annotation moving yes so and why
it is restricted to devices only I may
not it's not it's not no Emma Watson
devices that yeah I think that that what
why we created it it's because we had
problem with mobile web it will work on
on web I think that in most cases
that the automation in web is
commoditize already there are a lot of
frame-up so already a lot of switches
that are running and I don't think that
people should you change that and
rewrite all there to help you but having
new stuff for developers or something
which is much more easy or a gel and
simple think that's the direction today
and the last one is you mentioned a URL
for the github is it like go there and
do what I mean it's just you just
download it like bronzer and start using
dr. yeah installed and that's it okay
any ID okay to integrate with current
application is it like it easier or
difficult are there any steps to follow
to integrate this tool into current
applications to current application
should be simple that a lot of focus
that we had and not changing your
ecosystem but just fitting it into the
existing one yes I'm there's this video
you just saw the step so simple Oh five
minutes alright cool thanks thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
