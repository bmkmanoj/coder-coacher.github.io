talk today my name is cliff Schmidt and
I'm the executive director of a
nonprofit called literacy bridge and
today I'm going to talk about how we're
using audio technology to reduce global
literacy poverty and disease all in one
through audio technology and I'll kind
of explain how we're doing that and most
of it has to do with taking advantage of
the knowledge that already exists in
developing countries and just simply
providing a technology by working with
organizations there to to take advantage
of that knowledge and share it with
everyone else so that's what we have in
mind I should just say a little bit
about what literacy bridge does our
mission is to empower children and
adults with affordable tools for
knowledge sharing and literacy learning
that's that's what we're trying to do
the reason we're trying to do that is
because there's without question
education is the only answer to dealing
with global poverty long term now the
global health programs that are going on
the microcredit programs those sorts of
things we have to have those that's
we're dealing with today but if we want
to get to a world where we don't have to
deal with that tomorrow we have to be
dealing with education right from the
beginning and that means improving
education in schools but it also means
improving adult education so that an
educated at parent is much more likely
to educate their children so this is why
this is our mission is to deal with
these these issues of education health
economic development democracy and human
rights but we're doing it by enabling
the most basic part of education which
is literacy and the way we think about
literacy differently than another
organization is that there are a lot of
organizations out there that are just
focused on getting people to become
literate and we want to do that too but
we also want to say on day one we want
people to be able to take advantage of
knowledge to be able to improve their
lives before they're literate
so we're trying to bring people to a
state of literacy but not wait until
they get there to be able to take
advantage of knowledge since knowledge
is the key thing they need to be able to
improve agricultural techniques and get
crop yields that now not only can
actually feed their families but maybe
even have a little extra to to sell to a
market or to understand the importance
of using bed nets for children for young
children to prevent them from getting
malaria and especially for pregnant
women or for understanding how to
prevent the spread of AIDS or for
learning how you can start a village
savings and loan program for economic
development so much of economic
development is just about knowledge it's
it's learning things so that's what I'm
going to be talking about but I want to
start off with just talking about
literacy the state of the world today so
the UN organization unesco which focuses
one of the letters in there e on the
education is has just recently released
the latest figures of 774 million adults
who cannot read or who meet the
definition of the term literacy now that
number is actually much lower than the
adults out there who really can read to
any functional level and the reason for
that is that this number typically comes
from surveys they ask people hey can you
read or not and people tend to be a
little more optimistic about what they
can really do when they answer those
things and also the definition what
they're really asking them is can you
read or read and write a simple sentence
about something you do every day you
know I I worked on the farm today okay
you're illiterate so so that's we're
saying 774 million people can't do that
beyond that obviously there's quite many
times more with literacy skills that
don't enable them to really do as much
with their lives and with empowering and
creating a stronger country as much as
they could of course two-thirds of these
people are women as with so many issues
in global health and development the
women are the ones that have the hardest
job they're also the ones where an
investment in a woman
yields much more value in the community
in general than the same investment in a
man for so for those two reasons there
are a lot of programs focusing on
looking out for the women because they
haven't been reached before and because
they can do more good when you when you
do reach them an educated woman is has
so much more effect on her children's
potential and education and especially
on her children's health an educated
woman is more likely to know the things
that's going to drastically lower child
mortality rates so that's the state of
the world the state of the world in 2015
is not much better still two thirds of
the illiterate adults are women and and
684 million unesco in 2003 announced we
are starting the literacy decade for 10
years we're all all countries in the UN
we're all going to be really really
focused on literacy because we know how
important it is and at the end of that
literacy decade here's here's what
they're thinking which is great that is
not getting worse but there's a lot more
that needs to be done so I see two
problems in this and and i should say we
at literacy bridge see two problems in
this and that's what really helped us to
find our mission one is obviously we
there are inadequate literacy resources
you we there aren't the adults today
that haven't learned to read they didn't
learn to read because school wasn't
available enough to them ten years ago
so that's one thing you need to work on
one of the problems you have is even
when you do have a ratio of people to
teacher ratio of as low as 60 to 1 which
is you know there's a lot worse out
there there are some places in primary
school where you might find 35 to 1 but
that's sort of the ideal in in a
developing country that's that's that's
really making progress 62 1 101 is not
uncommon but even if you get that 35 to
1 or 60 to 1 that teacher that's there
that's making that ratio workout is
typically I'd say you know depending on
where you are roughly half the time is
not a trained teacher too
not go to school to learn to teach and
in fact one of the lace things going on
in Ghana where I visited the summer to
to work on some of the research behind
this the latest things they're doing is
something called the National Youth
Employment Program which is a great
program you know employing the youth is
great and one of the two main areas that
the youth get employed is as teachers
and that's nice to accept that a lot of
these youth have only done the the
standard nine years of free education
that you get in Ghana you there the
system goes up to through twelve years
but you have to pay quite a bit of money
to be able to get those last three years
of education and most people don't do
that but for the ones that are lucky
enough to have nine years of education
they didn't get such good training just
such a good education and then they get
three days in a lot of these places
three days of learning how to be a
teacher and now they're in charge of 35
to 60 students or 100 in Afghanistan and
so they need help and so any kind of
teacher training aids or anything at all
that can be used in the classroom to
help a teacher hasn't been trained will
make a big difference and I mentioned
the beginning about parents the it's so
important we're not just focused on
adults because adults are people too and
you know it's not just that we we we
don't want to only focus on the next
generation but we want to pay attention
to the generation that's going to be
around for the next 28 40 years but also
that if we focus on adults then that
affects the children an educated parent
is much more likely to value education
for their child and also how many of you
have heard how important it is for a
parent to read to their child well
that's right it's it's a lot harder when
you can't read so so that's a that's one
of the things I've learned is just it's
so important this first few years it
really makes a difference if in this
country in the US if you get behind the
curve if you if you haven't been exposed
to reading enough books by the time
you're five you are it's it's years that
you're set behind I mean the the
statistics showing like how far back
people are so off in ninth grade that
there's levels are still
much worse off than the kids typically
in the higher income families who were
read to more often it really really
makes a big difference now let me just
give you an idea of when I talk about
few resources and also to just give you
a sense of how much people want to learn
to read and how much they are willing to
put in the work to do this themselves I
want to show you a short video that I
took in Ghana it's some it's what they
call a night circle and so the adults
after they finished working their farms
will get together maybe around seven
o'clock and in Ghana it's it gets dark
by seven year round of course being so
close to the equator and and so it's
dark and there's no electricity in most
of these villages and in the rural ones
where I'm where we're mainly focused and
and so let me just show you a little bit
of what that's like
okay it's really dark it's hard to see
but there's a reason for that so this is
someone going around with some kerosene
oil and trying to light the little
kerosene lamps that they were able to
afford and they were able to afford this
because it came through a grant from one
of these local nonprofit organizations
and so these are the they're mostly
women in this particular class and
they're all there after working on in
the farms and and in this dark room with
with a little bit of candlelight are
trying to to learn to read they're not
trying to learn to read English which is
actually the the national language in
Ghana because it was colonized by the
British they're just trying to learn to
read and write in their own language to
start with before they move on to
English because English can be helpful
for for doing things throughout the
country so so here's so you're getting
just sort of a little bit of idea of how
they start off and one of the big
expense for this program for this local
nonprofit is getting kerosene fuel like
that's the thing that they they they
have trouble with so okay that was just
sort of just to give you a little bit of
a sense of that yeah it's kind of hard
to see too much with this so so that's
on the low resources side then the other
problem so there's two things one is
literacy if we're obviously people are
not being properly educated not to
properly educated even getting a basic
education literacy the other problem is
that that results in limited access to
knowledge and that is the key thing
right literacy is great because it's
nice to curl up and read a good book but
really what we're talking about here is
people being able to make use of
knowledge to improve their lives and to
improve their country so what so that's
really where we're focused the way that
this works now is that you've got a lot
of of NGOs nongovernmental organizations
these nonprofits that work on poverty
issues
some of them are international ones with
local local offices and then some of
them are local ones I spent a lot of
time I spent about five weeks in the
upper west region of ghana about as far
away as you can get from the capital of
a crop and i was there with a local
organization called wrap the rural aid
action program and so that's their
office they've been around for about
seven years there are people from this
from this rural area in the upper west
and and this is Ghana in West Africa and
they went off to college and then
instead of getting a good job as one of
the few college educated people they
decide to go back to their community and
try to improve life for for everyone out
in the rural areas and the way they do
this with very limited funds they they
just simply spread knowledge they have a
few other things they build buildings
for people to meet in they they provide
fuel for for these night circle
education classes but mostly what
they're doing is they're going out and
they're either passing on knowledge
directly knowledge about health issues
or economic issues or or strictly
education formal education or they train
other people to do that now that's great
and it is really impressive to see how
much they were able to do and they they
they actually when I was here it really
reminded me of a tech startup a very
small group of people and they the whole
work hard play hard thing they they
worked crazy long hours they also had
you know a lot of fun every once in a
while when they could but but they their
whole job was to go out and try to talk
to people so let me give you a sense i'm
going to show you one more video clip
here to give you a sense of how they do
that actually maybe i'll just show you a
couple slides first and then i'll show
you something on video so this is a
typical way in a rural village in the
upper west region of ghana when our
village will come together to learn
something when if they hear that there's
going to be a skit about family planning
or preventing the spread of hiv/aids or
something like that this is the tree and
most villages have a big tree like this
that people will gather under and and so
you can see that just give you a little
bit of size of the crowd and this is a
backdrop that that they were using to do
a skit in front of and here are you know
here's all the people watching one of
the things that I noticed when I was
here was how much people laughed at this
comics get that was going on and how
engaged they all were I kind of wondered
if you know when the the NGO comes to
town the nonprofit and they get there
and they they say we're going to teach
you about health you know do people
really care or do they say yeah you know
I'll deal with it when I'm sick and and
I mean this group was just so engaged
and really interested in all this so
there's something that you can't that
you have to have in a lot of these
places is this community gathering
that's something that's never going to
go away but what would be nice is if
there was a alternative mechanism
something in parallel a way to
distribute information that where you
didn't have to deal with this in such a
non scalable fashion because what
happens now is that you get these guys
you know one or two of them gets in a
truck or on typically on a motorbike and
they ride out maybe 30 50 miles out to
the village that they haven't seen yet
or that they haven't seen in six or nine
months and they get there and then they
they speak to everyone and tell people
things and hopefully these people
remember in most of the these villages
I'm talking about most of the adults are
illiterate and gone across the whole
country it's only forty percent of the
adults who are illiterate and I say only
forty percent obviously that's a big
problem but out here we're talking about
maybe eighty to ninety five percent
depending on the village urine so just
to do this remember they've got to pay
for fuel now when I was there a gallon
of gas cost about four dollars and fifty
cents it's probably up to about five
dollars now I would say and and they've
got less resources than we do to pay for
that fuel and they are driving out you
know over these roads now let me show
you what these roads look like this is
this is the video just
stumm so now it might look like it's a
shaky camera but look at the dashboard
in the road now probably most of you if
you woulda guessed you might have
thought people drive on the left side of
the road in Ghana since it was colonized
by the British actually they drive on
the right side he's on the left side
right now because you can't drive on the
right side so now he's crossing over to
the right side because there are fewer
potholes this is the good side okay this
is a typical road out in the rural areas
so imagine the damage to the trucks
imagine how much it costs to maintain
trucks like this how long it takes to
get places how much do you pay for fuel
and this is the best way that you can
distribute information so the
information is in the country people
there are a lot of very very sharp
people that have all the knowledge they
need for dealing with health and
economic issues and education it's all
in country but spreading that to all of
their fellow citizens is not being done
very well today so because there's no
options so that's that's all I wanted to
show you for a couple little pieces of
video so now let me talk about the
talking book project which is our main
program at literacy bridge it's the it's
the one that we're spending all of our
time on right now it was the one that we
were formed for back in September is
when we became a formal nonprofit
corporation so these are the principles
behind this program and I just want to
mention this before i get into the
technology so you have an idea about
what we're trying to do what's important
to us unlike some organizations or some
projects that are out there and i don't
mean this disparagingly we are truly
focusing on the poorest of the poor it's
it's just so much more efficient to grab
a lot of people help out a lot of people
when you're saying well we're looking at
people who are kind of poor you know
really poor by our standards but you
know are easier to get to and what we
want to do is really reach the people
who need it most because we think we can
the other thing is that we want to serve
children and adults we want to focus on
women and also the disabled so if you
are blind in ghana you have very few
options for getting
information you there's not a lot of
Braille in Ghana so even if you've got a
great education even if you were able to
do that you just don't have a lot of
resources so one of the things we're
looking at is being able to use this
device to help out the visually disabled
so are visually impaired now the third
thing I mentioned this a few times we
want to address the cause which is
illiteracy we want to address that and
try to improve that and provide tools
and a means to improve literacy but we
also in parallel right at the same time
on day one want to deal with the effect
which is that people aren't getting the
knowledge that they can use the
sustainability I mean that both
environmentally we don't want to create
something that's going to add a lot of
junk or that's going to require a lot of
batteries that are just thrown out so
we're looking at the environmental side
but also the financial side is really
important we don't want to create a new
financial dependency on a program there
we want a program that in whatever
country we go into and we are our pilot
program is starting with Ghana but in
parallel today we're looking we're
working with organizations in Kenya and
we're talking to people in India and
Afghanistan and the latest one is
Cambodia those are sort of the
directions were going and Kenya's
literacy population or the illiteracy is
not nearly as bad as a lot of places in
Africa it's about twenty percent or so
illiterate but the organizations that
we're working with our and pockets of
Kenya where the literacy rate is really
low so that's another thing is we don't
want to just take country by country we
want to go to where people need it even
if they're in a country where the
literacy rates overall are high but on
the financial side we want this thing to
be self-sustaining it may take a little
bit of initial funding to help get going
but we want this we want to develop an
economy around this where this thing can
go on without a dependency on someone
from the US or Europe and finally the
locally powered scalability what I mean
by that is we if we thought we could
provide all the information people need
will we be wrong for a few reasons we'd
be fooling ourselves to think that we
could know all of the things that
important in every different region we'd
have to deal with all of the different
languages there are well over 40
languages spoken throughout Ghana I
think at least 25 or so recognized by
the school system and so English is the
national language but is not spoken by
the majority of people in the rural
areas so you've got that problem with
languages you've got cultural issues you
know we might think we're doing a good
thing and actually be kind of doing a
little bit of cultural imperialism in
the meantime so the content has to come
from inside the country that now there
may be some other content out there that
was developed in another country there
may be things that we can do to bring
other content it would be nice if
Wikipedia could be available to two
people in developing countries but but
we are primarily focused on locally
created content because again the
knowledge is there the knowledge about
the best spacing between soybeans in
order to get the greatest yield you know
the knowledge about things that work in
that local area is there and we want to
leverage the people that are already
there to produce this content and when I
say lovers the people I mean a little
bit of the blogosphere I mean a little
bit of we would like everyone to be able
to participate in this and build content
but to start with most of the quality
content I expect is going to come from
these nonprofits and from some of these
government agencies that are out there
today already solving these problems
already distributing knowledge but
they're doing it by driving out
delivering it in person and maybe they
have some brochures but very few people
can use them so what we expect in the
groups that were already working with
today are people and organizations who
will simply record an audio what they've
already written in brochures or what
they're already saying to people when
they go out in the field so that's what
i mean by locally powered scalability
and here i just want to talk about kind
of just quick little image of this is
one of the places that i stayed in one
of the villages kind of a typical place
where maybe a couple families an
extended family will live in about three
buildings like this and you might have
20 people living in in three of these
buildings and and here's just a shot I
took from a
a vehicle going down the road and this
is a typical borehole pump water is
obviously a huge issue in developing
countries this project is not going to
solve that but I one of the problems
with water is how far people have to
walk to get the water there's just not
enough of these bore holes to be able to
pump out clean water and so it's not
unusual that you walk 30 minutes to the
closest one or you know sometimes an
hour or more and and that then when you
get there of course there's a big line
of people who are all trying to get this
so there are some people who spend most
of their day just in bringing the day's
water going out and getting the day's
water and bring it back we can't do much
about that problem but it would be nice
if while people were walking they were
able to listen to something that they
found interesting and and that would
help them so here's the project it's the
talking book project it's basically a
five-dollar ipod it's it's not really an
iPod but it's a five dollar mp3 player
and and also you might think of it as a
digital video a digital voice recorder
sorry not video it's some the way we can
get it so cheap to be in the five dollar
range you may have heard of the one
laptop per child and the XO laptops
which are locally called the
hundred-dollar laptops they actually
cost around two hundred dollars or so so
this is the five dollar mp3 player and
actually some of the early ideas came
out of when I was working with the one
laptop per child people i was helping
them out a little bit with ideas they
had for locally created teaching content
and how teachers if they developed a
great lesson plan how could they
distribute that and then we started
working on some literacy ideas and from
there i decided to go off and explore
this idea more and and and now we have
an organization of about ten people
working on this and literacy bridge to
deal with distributing information and
literacy and it's cheap a device as
possible so that the old pc laptops the
XO's it's a great project and i've been
a big supporter of it from the very
beginning but this is this is to reach
more people faster about a more defined
problem as opposed to a bigger strategic
term project so to get it to be five
dollars you you can't do high fidelity
music quality sound we compress it a bit
more than that we use off-the-shelf
integrated circuits we've whipped
chipsets that are often used for toys so
we use chips that maybe cost around two
dollars we spend another couple dollars
on flash memory and and then a few other
things around that and that gets us
roughly in the five dollar range we're a
little more than that right now in what
we've been specking out and i'll tell
you about our timeline and the prototype
that we're working on but that's that's
where we are now so you and you do have
podcasts you just don't download them
from from the web instead you download
them from a kiosk or maybe you actually
just get it from someone else's talking
book device and if you take to talking
book devices and dock them together you
can transfer whatever content works out
well so it was a little bit of a viral
distribution thing so that's what I was
kind of referring to as devicenet or
kiosk net so that's that's basically
what the the talking book is it's got a
couple extra features though page based
navigation in other words we are going
to focus on if you have a book side by
side with this if someone was to read a
book then you should be able to easily
correlate without a visual display
easily correlate where you are in the
audio with a page on the book may be
going up and down a line in that book
especially for like children's books or
or the kind of books that adults would
be reading as an early literacy
education tool the device to device copy
i mentioned is a key thing playback
speed control being able to do variable
speed but constant pitch that's not a
great new innovation in these days but
what we're trying to do is to take that
and squeeze that down into something
affordable and really useful in this
scenario and there have been several
tests that research projects that have
shown that if you give a child a book on
tape kind of thing and that might
typically be 90 words per minute they're
listening to that at that right now
give them the ability to change the
speed on that you'll find that there
some that will want it as low as 30
words per minute and someone at 90 and
you'll see actually a little bit of a
bimodal distribution there but so what's
important is that each child or adult
can have the book read at the speed that
they need and that's where they're going
to to make the most progress with it
audio hyperlinks is the ideas it's
probably self-explanatory it's that when
you're listening to something wouldn't
it be nice if you heard a reference to
something you thought I'd like to know
more about that and if a tone in the
background indicated you can find out
more about that if you hit the hyperlink
button right now or if a little LED came
on and you saw that you said oh I want
to learn more about that and you hit
that just like following your underlying
blue link so we're we're building a
couple extra features into that because
we think that might be useful for a
number of knowledge scenarios but it
might also be useful for if you have a
book and you've got targeted vocabulary
words and vocabulary is it obviously an
important part of literacy and so if
you've got a word that someone's not
quite sure if they know or not and they
push the button and hear the definition
that's that's one of the uses we think
of the audio hyperlinks one thing I
should mention is every once in a while
someone asked me is this only can this
only be done in English or and and I i'm
pretty sure that this audience you you
get the big picture here this is just
audio it's done in any language that
anyone produces content and it's just
it's just an audio recorder
interactivity we are allowing for some
multiple choice scenarios so when you're
finished some reading comprehension
questions some phonological awareness
questions where someone might say which
of these words starts off with a
different sound than the other these are
what we're doing is we're going to look
for all the kinds of scenarios where the
the experts and literacy education today
in the u.s. say we could really use
something like this these are things
that we do in a classroom and we try to
adapt that to a device and then we work
with local organizations that focus on
literacy in the country we're focused on
and they decide how they want to create
content whether that works for them and
so and then finally if you really want
to make an inexpensive device but you
want
to work in a group scenario in a group
setting which is is a very common way
that people might want to learn together
aside from just simply a parent and a
child or a teacher and a student then
you to do that the way we decide to
dress that is just put a little very
inexpensive FM transmitter in there too
so because the typical family every
family typically has a radio radios
costs about five dollars about the same
kind of device that about the same price
point for this device that that way you
can take advantage of the ant built into
the radio and the batteries that are
already there for the radio and keep
this cheap so people can listen to it
through earphones or they can transmit
it to a radio for groups scenarios so
that's it i'll show you i'm going to
show you something that that I haven't
showed anyone yet before so it's really
early but we just have a little flash
prototype of this we have not had a
designer look at this yet this was a
flash programmer decided to try to start
building some of the functionality but i
just thought i'd give you a picture and
show you something here so so here is
here's what we're working with right now
so you can see we've got some volume
buttons here and and you've got a a play
button and we move to the the next track
or the last track I'll I'll show you
let's see I guess you were going to be
probably not going to be able to hear
this too well
but but what you can see here is we've
got a like back five seconds sort of
button imagine for tivo or for some
other digital voice digital video
recorder how you how it's useful to go
jump back a little bit you might also
want to skip forward so that's going to
be especially useful in stuff that's not
tied to books to be able to move through
content we think a lot about you know
what's the best way to navigate through
audio and then and these might be your
multiple choice buttons maybe that one
is your hyperlink button and so you hear
a particular piece of audio and you jump
out of that so this is sort of roughly
the kind of size of the device we're
talking about and that's that's about it
so just a little small thing in your
hand a little bigger than not quite a
nano so it's a little bigger than this
but maybe maybe a couple times bigger
than this but it's something that should
be easy to carry around something that
people can listen to while they're
working in the fields while they're
walking to get water or when they're
sitting down in a family setting with a
radio nearby to to output the sound so
yes when you flipped it around the port
is that a standard port or is that oh
yeah thanks good question yeah it's some
USB so we actually are able to build
we've got we've looked at a few
different options and we haven't set on
anything and we probably won't for a few
months but some of the options we're
looking at now they have integrated ROM
and RAM and USB handling and a few
different so we're buying the stuff the
reason we're able to get it so cheap is
we're taking an advantage of things
produced for the toy industry that have
a lot of this building so we will have a
USB connection there that we will have
these things to be able to device
directly to doc director device without
any cables because we think that's
important if if to farmers show up at a
market in in a village that neither of
them lived live in so a farmer from
village a and a farmer from village be
go to village see because that's the
on that day of the week they have the
largest market in the area and they go
there maybe they're selling some things
maybe they're buying some things and one
says to the other did you hear about
that great piece of audio content
available on the talking book that the
Ministry of Food and Agriculture put out
and the other one says know what tell me
about it and it says yeah it's just you
know some very basic things that that we
can do agricultural techniques not not
new things we have to buy and that have
been proven to produce better yields and
hey I've tried it it and it's great
while those two are there in that market
together one should be able to quickly
transfer to the other that piece of
content and that's enabling this viral
distribution model now at the same time
the reason we have that USB jack is so
you can also do a upload download to a
local kiosk we think that you also need
to have some a little bit of a central
point in a cluster of villages for
people to come to and and that these
kiosks there should be as many of them
as there are entrepreneurs that find
business models around these things like
renting out devices or charge recharging
rechargeable batteries and the fee for
that which would be less than people
buying disposable batteries so things
like that would be a reason for people
to assemble at a kiosk to learn things
to trade information and then the kiosks
become part of a network a decentralized
network that uses things like cell phone
reception to transmit and I'm just
talking not digital but even just analog
playing a recording from one thing to
the other so we really try to work with
as the low tech side as we can in fact
to give you an example of how low tech
will be willing to work one of the ideas
is where there's not cell phone
reception or whether the power
requirements of dealing with that or
even the expense of dealing with the
bandwidth costs what we might do is take
advantage of these local kind of
informal transportation systems you have
someone in a little van who says hey
every other day at noon I leave as soon
as my van is full and it costs fifty
cents to take you 150 miles to this
other village and these things are
pretty common in different countries in
Ghana they're called wrote rose there's
there's different name
for them all over the place and and so
giving a small incentive to that driver
to take a piece of flash memory from one
kiosk and drop it off and be paid at the
other kiosk is another way that we might
look at broadly distributing information
so that's some basically the big picture
around the device now content content is
the key thing to make this work if
although we aren't going to focus on
creating the content and we're not going
to create any content i should say we do
feel responsibility to make sure content
is created so we are working today with
universities and local nonprofits and
with government agencies to develop get
some of this content created now so that
when we release this later on at the end
of the year that there's on the order of
a hundred or more very high quality
pieces of content on day one for people
to get a feel for what how you might use
this and so contents really important
I'm going to talk about a little bit the
development scenarios and then about
literacy although the face to face
things really important although you
can't do a puppet show or skit with
these devices and make people laugh and
really appreciate learning new things it
would be nice if when you left you could
leave notes and if people are learning
to read but can't don't have strong
literacy skills yet it would be nice if
if they had some notes that they could
use and so they already have these
devices you just simply transfer the
content onto everyone's device and you
leave and they've got something to be
able to check out later maybe a 15
minute program these devices by the way
I didn't mention two to get it to the
five dollar price point we're looking at
around 32 to 64 Meg's that's plenty of
memory for speech level codecs to be
able to store on the order of a couple
three hours maybe of speech content so
you might have ten ten to twenty fifteen
minutes or ten to fifteen 15 minute
programs or you might have five to ten
thirty minute programs or anywhere in
between but that's sort of what we
expect that these devices will have
multiple pieces of content that get
traded out however people want from
device to device or through the kiosks
and and that's what they're listening to
so using it as notes I mentioned sort of
the Ministry of Agriculture offering
some information having information
about how a village can put together
some of its money to create a savings
and loan program that works for people
with low numeracy and literacy skills
and how about the fact that there's a a
large number of domestic violence
complaints that are just recently in the
last few years in Ghana have been filed
but very few of them have been pursued
and the biggest reason for that is the
having to deal with the legal system and
the biggest barrier for the women who
are our much many more of them have not
had an education to be able to become
literate that's that's obviously makes
it difficult to figure out the legal
system so wouldn't it be nice if an
organization that was helping women be
able to deal with this could record this
information in audio format and then
participatory democracy I spoke with the
Ghanaians Apter of transparency
international and they would like to be
able to use this device to be able to
let people know about about corruption
concerns they have or about important
legislation that they want people to
speak to the representatives and demand
that they that they vote for that so
that's one set of scenarios and then the
literacy because remember we don't want
to create a dependency on the audio
either we want people to get knowledge
right away through local content but we
also want people to learn to read so I
gave you an example of a phonological
awareness things of which of these
sounds is different from the others or
any sort of training that you have where
typically most of these scenarios you're
pairing up a book with audio and then
vocabulary I think I mentioned that
already Family Literacy I've tried to
emphasize the importance of a parent and
being educated and working with their
child on being able to read a book a
family literacy program might involve a
parent going to learn to read one
particular book and then later that day
being able to work with their child on
this and if they can practice reading
that book right before they talk to
their child if they have this at home an
audio version and they hear it read to
them and they see the book and they
practice it a few times and then proudly
they put that away and they read that
book to their child there's a lot of
good things going
that scenario and then I mentioned being
able to allow people who had the
misfortune to not be able to see let
them be able to have some lives to where
they're can get knowledge from from
sources on their own independently
without having someone to have to go out
drive out there and talk to them so I've
also kind of talked about this I'm
running a little short on time and I
want you to be able to ask me any
questions you have but I have talked
about one of the key things there's the
device and that's where most of our R&amp;amp;D
has been spent so far but we're we're
just starting to ramp up on is some of
these ideas around a content
distribution network with kiosks and a
means of distributing so kiosks is both
a center point around a village and one
of the spokes in a decentralized system
of distribution I guess uh no can you be
a spoke and be decentralized so
financial structure what literacy bridge
is doing is all the rd that's where all
of our efforts are being spent right now
and on collaborating with these
organizations in Ghana and India and
Kenya and and then what we're going to
do is once we get this to a point where
we say we have a device now that the at
least the parts can be purchased for
less than five dollars and we're going
to get down to a completed device for
five dollars but once we have that one
thing we could do is say here's a parts
list so we're also working with
entrepreneurs and and people in local in
mostly in the cities who might look at
this as a business opportunity to build
these devices and charge just a little
bit more than the cost and and
distribute them throughout the country
we actually have no interest in a
footprint in Ghana or in any other
country we're just trying to enable
ecosystems around this some sort of a
little economy around this and we want
this to happen to have devices and
content distributed so that's mainly
what we're also going to probably
through a separate foundation literacy
bridge foundation we are going to
financially support the these systems
getting started as well because
it's very important that they become
profitable in other words that they
aren't requiring a dependency on foreign
cash coming in or even a large
dependency on a government budget that
is so strange right now to meet the the
needs that they have but we know that it
takes time for any business to get going
and be profitable and so we're going to
provide initial financial support so I
kind of talked a little bit about the
device is being distributed the the I
mentioned before the kiosks there is a
business model and therefore a group of
people that want to get together and
look at a micro credit loan to build a
kiosk and then charged something out of
that that's be able to charge for
rechargeable batteries or renting
devices or get some ad revenues through
a couple different ideas we have with
ads that's one of the idea one of the
ways that the kiosk and the distribution
system might be supported so and when I
talk about distributing devices this is
a very rural small village I think it's
actually about a thousand people in this
village and this is a market day here
let me just dim the lights for this for
a second and so here's this is in the
village of hang and where where I spent
most of my time for the five weeks I was
in the Upper West and you can kind of
see this this is sort of the different
vendors are in here and here you can buy
soap and you can buy toothpaste and you
can buy locally made clothes but you can
you know buy batteries that are made in
China so you buy a lot of different
things here and so there is a
distribution system that gets out there
it's not a very cheap distribution
system it's not very efficient and
that's why we really think it's
important what we're doing by where the
primary value is in content that can be
distributed for no marginal cost or for
very little in the in the kiosk system
so this is what a typical village market
looks like here's a little you know some
clothes being sold here and and here a
couple some of the people at the market
these are a couple people who are trying
to sell me some actually very good pito
beer and okay so i just wanted to point
out that you know there is a market in
in even the most rural places
so as far as deploying we are starting
in Ghana and we're doing that because
Ghana may not have the worst literacy in
the world I'd say they're probably
around maybe 18th or 19th worst you know
with forty percent of their adults not
being able to read or write a simple
sentence but that's obviously a pretty
strong need there but also we want to
start where we could be successful in
Ghana has had about six percent increase
in GDP for the last canseco yet each
year for last consecutive five years or
so they've got a very stable government
they have a second four-year term
president about to end you know after
several peaceful elections and another
one about to come up this year and and
also because we have partnerships there
now and and that's really a key thing so
when we go to the next country in these
countries that we're starting to work
with now we're looking at the same set
of factors the need and then our ability
to be successful and as we start doing
this more and more will start taking
more risks on countries like Afghanistan
or a Congo or places where it's we don't
have as much there to work with but the
need is great designing for large and
small scales we're designing for large
scales because of that number i
mentioned the nearly 800 million adults
that's that's what we're going after and
the hundreds and hundreds of millions
more who have low literacy skills but
might meet that basic definition but
we're also looking at small scales
because if there's a pocket in kenya
that has a strong need and there are
people there that want to work with us
we want our system to fit that need as
well and finally the timeline we as I
mentioned we started in September the my
trip to Ghana was actually before
literacy bridge formally started up and
in September's when we started
assembling a team and that's grown from
about four so in September to where we
are now with actually if you count the
people in Ghana worked about 13 or 14
people and so over the last few months
we've just dealt with requirements
working closely with our partners in
Ghana creating all of our functional and
technical specifications and you know
enhancing these partnerships figuring
out who's going to deal with content
development building the team
a lot of administrative stuff for
instance we you know not only dealing
with a non-profit setting up nonprofit
corporation and you know assembling a
board and all of that but filling out
your IRS 501 c3 application with its 13
pages of single-spaced backup text to
all the different questions and then
just yesterday we are now officially a
registered Washington charitable
organization and yesterday morning I was
not able to ask for money luckily there
were actually people who were donating
to our organization even without as
asking so that worked out nice but as of
today we're now an official Washington
charitable organization so lots of that
kind of stuff now what we're focusing on
for this year is fundraising but the
software prototype I kind of showed you
the early stage of that flash
application and hardware development so
we're once we get enough funds to be
able to in the order we're talking
around like twenty thirty thousand
dollars for a tabletop hardware
prototype so we're getting close to to
to getting to that point in February
we're going to have that built and from
that that's what's going to help us
raise more funds to be able to to really
ramp up all the way right now we're the
13 of us are all volunteers on this
project some of us are full-time
volunteers and some of us are halftime
volunteers but that's how we're working
today in q2 that's when we take this we
have a iteration of the prototype that
we now take out to the field and test it
there we're also to to be more efficient
we're going to take this flash prototype
once we really work that out we're going
to take that on a laptop wire that up to
an empty mechanical chassis you know
that's that's had an industrial designer
work with it what the person that we're
working with now used to design cell
phones for sony ericsson and we're going
to take that and go into the field and
see how this really works and then we'll
do a pilot program between maybe we're
looking at maybe around four or five
hundred devices where we put out there
and we see all the system really works
after the prototype testing and now
we're now we're kind of checking a
system to see how well this thing works
and then and that's all our support and
a hundred thousand units that we're
planning based on our talks with the
organizations in Ghana so far that is
all we don't pay for that we will front
the money for that to get this started
but the end users pay for that or the
government's education system pays for
it or an international NGO says this is
a great way for us to distribute the
information that we that's our in our
mission to do and so this is where we
start to get to the stage where our
initial R&amp;amp;D costs drop down a lot and
our operational costs table out and and
then these units just sell themselves
and and then 2009 is when we'll really
start looking at other countries once we
know we've got Ghana right and beyond
that some of the other ideas really what
we're trying to do is get information
out there and I know that at Google you
know a lot about that we're trying to do
it in places without electricity
certainly places without internet access
and and so we're going to discover a lot
of things about how information flows in
rural developing areas that we don't
know today and and we'll just see where
that goes print stick a printer in one
of these kiosks and now you've got a
distribution system for literature that
that might have that might cost a lot
more money by having trucks deliver
textbooks so this is one of the things
we're looking at of course you still
gotta deliver paper and ink but that's
one of the things down the road little
small lcds obviously we're focused on
affordable devices so as we find
something that that is getting cheap
because it's got widespread use in you
know a toy industry for instance that's
what we're going to take advantage of
and work that into future devices and
and a few other different things
entertainment content again our focus is
on financial sustainability so if we can
create some sort of a music market or if
we can provide the technology for
countries to create their own music
market then that might help pay for
other things so that's what I had in
mind and thanks a lot for all of you
coming here in the middle of your
workday and let me know if you have any
questions thank you
yes sir okay so the question was to our
partners and where are we doing our work
we most of our focus has been in the
country of Ghana so far that's where
that's where the research for this
happened and that's where all of our
permanent partners are and what I mean
is we're also working with a few
organizations in Kenya in India
Afghanistan and Cambodia and we're just
starting to work out some ideas with
them and for a lot of them what they're
waiting on is let me see the device and
get a better idea with our Ghana
partners it's a true partnership that
they're they're helping us design it in
fact we're bringing people on our board
of directors in Ghana because this is
not meant to be an American organization
but a true international one to move
this thing forward so did that answer no
we because we just started in September
we have a lot of talks going with a lot
of different universities and other
organizations but but we are not
affiliated with any of them as I
mentioned the early part I personally
have worked with the one laptop per
child folks and we've got a lot of ideas
of the ways these laptops can be used to
design some of the what we call complex
content the things that have audio
hyperlinks and multiple choice things
the building that content is going to
require more than a five dollar device
and it would really help to have a
visual display so there are a few things
may be using these laptops in kiosks
that's not the cheapest way we could do
it but there are a few different things
that we're working with OLPC but we
don't have formal partnerships with any
other organization right now other than
the Ghanaian ones we're working with any
other questions
why the five dollar price point or the
it was it was you know the typical way
you get to a price point you you look at
the the supply and demand so i looked at
the demand side and said you know I
spent a lot of time going through those
small markets that I showed you and
taking lists of how much different
devices how much different products cost
and what people will pay and saw radios
that range from the cheapest one three
dollars and fifty cents which amazed me
of course from China and but most radios
I saw were the ones that you'd buy for
five or six or seven dollars and every
family I still had a radio now that's
not true in every country there are
their countries in Afghanistan not every
family has a radio but it was a price
point that I knew people could afford
themselves and even people living on a
dollar a day it's going to take a while
to save up to five dollars but if it's
something that they know is not just
really helpful and that their hearing is
something that can really help empower
them to do things but is the cool new
thing that you know everyone's talking
about which is why we're getting we're
bringing in game designers and
industrial designers to work on making
this thing really nice if it's the cool
new thing that people want and it's
educational we know that they will pay
that so and we'll know to a stronger
extent once we we go and test out our
pilot program so that was the demand
side on the supply side it was just
taking a look at memory prices and
processor prices and the truth is that
five dollars is is a challenge might not
be a strong enough word and it just
wouldn't been any fun if I said ten
dollars so why not say five and because
we're going to get there we're very
close to it now we're closer than I
thought if I knew this I would have said
three dollars so we're trying to get it
as cheap as we can so it can be a
profitable business yes
distribution can your distribution known
on batteries for a while and I thought
what you could actually mail something
out to a post office never actually have
a delivery Jenny but he's at the post
office people know they can walk to the
post office every Sunday mm-hmm download
right that's something cool right there
just get male connector okay so just for
people watching later your point was
that could you mail and I assume you're
saying for the kiosk and the content
distribution system to spread that far
could you just put this in the postal
service and have it like general
delivery and someone goes there and does
that that's that's a great idea and I
think that is something that could work
now the postal system is a little bit
slower in some of these countries than
others and a little bit less reliable so
as long as you're ok with it getting
lost or taking a couple weeks you know
between two and four weeks for going
within the country that but that's okay
we can work with that but what we're
trying to do is actually start to build
something that can be the fastest way to
spread information now one of the
reasons we want to do that isn't that
someone needs to know about family
planning today is not that it's that we
want this if we want the system to be
profitable if we want there to be
businesses that can be built around this
we need to not make it we want to make
it as strong as it can be we don't want
it to be just something that's kind of
packaged together want to be something
that could actually support a really
interesting future now what you're
talking about and having something go
through the postal system sounds a lot
like my idea of let's pay drivers to
deliver this it's low-tech it's what's
existing and it works and so it's a
great idea from that point of view but
we're also looking for something
stronger you know that's more scalable
different infrastructure for delivery
physical object yes yes yeah exactly yes
you had mentioned
when we had lunch last time you did
mention an interesting statistic on that
I thought people other people would find
interesting about how much money it cost
to have access to a library for those
people have access to library and then
how much they're willing to pay that
relative to other entertainment right
here though that's great okay so rod
asked me to to talk about something that
he and I discussed at lunch I one of the
partners that were working with is a
University University of development
studies in Ghana so their whole
education system is focused on programs
to improve the economy and health and
well-being of their country and so the
person i'm working with most there is a
professor's name is damasus and my last
email with him i said you know what do
you think about the five dollar price
point do you know how much flexibility
do you think we have there I just kind
of want to know because you know should
we subsidize these devices down to five
dollars should they be seven on the
first day for instance you know if it
takes a little while to get to five
dollars and he said he said you're fine
at five dollars the truth is if it was
ten dollars it's possible some people
might pay I don't think you're going to
get the very poorest of the poor paying
at ten dollars but he was saying you've
got some flexibility there and he gave
me an example he said the libraries only
charged ten cents for someone to go
there and spend all day sitting in the
library reading as many books as they
want now that might sound like a strange
idea to us because none of us have ever
paid money to go into a library because
we have a government that can afford to
support public libraries but that's not
the case in these countries but instead
of paying ten cents some some of the
students and I think this is a little
bit of a you know professor saying you
know my students what's what's with them
they don't have their priorities in
order what he said was instead of thing
ten cents to spend time in the library
and learn more about maybe the subjects
he's teaching they spend forty cents to
go see an American war movie and his
point was it still you know people are
people it all comes down to their
priorities and and what's important to
them and they can they can find a way to
afford things that are more expensive
than other things if it's what they
really want to do
and so what that says to me is we have
some flexibility in the price but it
also means that we really need to make
sure the content is really valuable and
that this is a fun device for people to
use thanks for bringing this any any
other questions I think we're probably
running short on time but we'll take one
more question I'm sorry okay great
question the question was how much do
illiterate people want to become
literate and I would say it's you know
it's always tough doing generalizations
but I can tell you what I've seen one
thing I've seen is what I tried to show
you I don't know if you were here for
that video so that video where i showed
you before which i'm sure people
watching this online are going to have a
hard time seeing but because it was so
dark it was at night and after working
the fields people go in there with their
little lamps and are straining to be
able to see a chalkboard and their paper
to be able to learn to read so those
people obviously really wanted to learn
and and and that room was packed and is
always packed so as many people as they
can afford to have instructors they want
to learn to read another way to answer
the question is if people think that
they can provide a better education for
their children or better health for
their children by knowing more things
like the the statistic about the child
mortality rate being drastically lower
for educated mother's right now I
understand right
want to do more
yeah no I understand so too to be fair I
think I met one farmer at one point who
gave me the impression he didn't say
this literally he was about 50 years old
which is getting up there for the life
expectancy in a lot of developing
countries unfortunately and he gave me
the impression that he didn't really
feel like he needed to learn to read he
did want to learn how to improve his
crop yield he kind of felt like he was
sort of that you know towards the end of
his life and he wasn't about to start a
formal education and so there will be
some people like that and that's why the
knowledge distribution of this is so
important for people to still get
knowledge without learning to read but
for the vast majority of people I saw
they don't want to be dependent on
someone else or on something else you
know the natural human instinct is to be
able to do things for yourself and to
provide more for your family and and and
what I never saw as a problem was people
wondering whether education was
important everyone actually understood
the value of education it was just a
question of is that it is it more
important to send my child to school
than for them to take care of our crops
you know and provide enough food for our
whole family and you know that's a
scenario where i would like that child
when they're working on the fields
instead of being in school which is
compulsory in ghana but it's hard to
enforce it be nice if they could be
learning things while they were working
the field so they wouldn't be so far
behind when they can go to school ok i'm
guessing that we're probably about out
of time because i don't want to steal
you away from all the cool projects
you're doing right now but again thanks
a lot for taking the time to listen to
what we're up to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
