schoolmate of mine and he's a between an
electrical engineer and a programmer he
likes to hack embedded systems also
lately he worked on mobile phones and he
implemented some of these payment
solutions for mobile phones as well and
let's listen to him hello so this talk
is going to be about one very specific
and very old and surprisingly hard
problem of the web which is charging
viewers for content so back in back in
1992 when Tim berners-lee
added status codes to this HTTP thing of
his then he could think of only five
reasons for refusing serving content and
blaming it on the client so those five
and you can see that the middle three
sort of have a similar semantics meaning
that the resource does exist but the
server thinks that the client has no
right of viewing it and the first one
authorization required actually provides
the user to with the domains of
rectifying the situation as you can see
those numbers in the right braces are
actually Google counts it counts so you
can see that of all of these 402 is for
all of these 402 is by far the most
obscure and I'm not sure if any one of
you have ever encountered the status
code now of course later and many more
status codes are added some of them even
more obscure and even my favorite 418
which is what network connected teapots
are supposed to return when someone
requests coffee over HTTP namely I am a
teapot
and I believe there are many reasons for
the unpopularity of 402 and one of them
can be illustrated by an analogy aptly
noted by everyone's favorite supplier of
Knick apparel thing geek so if you think
of this analogy the semantics behind 402
would be abundantly clear but we have
certain social conventions against
making it explicit and I believe that on
the web even though the social
conventions are not that strong the
sentiment still exists that it's somehow
wrong to do that and if we try to make a
case for charging users for viewing
content then what some media executives
would tell you that you know producing
quality content is hard it takes a lot
of time and effort and it should be
compensated but in my opinion that just
plain old arrogant greed because if you
think on the other side that you know
reading the content also takes time and
effort so maybe New York Times should
pay me for reading it so I believe that
the real reasons they like lie elsewhere
so if so we have this old problem of you
know who should be producing content
what content should be produced how much
time should be spent producing this
content so this is lumped under the
general problem of resource allocation
and you know finding out what content
people want to see and obviously there
are many algorithms for doing this
efficiently and your company is actually
excellent at inventing such algorithms
and implementing them but for a very
long time humanity has used and
discovered long time ago a distributed
very robust and
surprisingly scalable algorithm for
efficient resource allocation the market
and it's a very natural idea it occurred
to berners-lee even before 404 which was
even more obvious idea but still it
occurred to him that maybe you know
having people directly paying for
content that they want to see is a good
idea because it will help solving all
these problems and people have been
trying and failing and most of the
failures end up being such that the
reason the solution is not being used is
that people hate it with a red passion
and when I started working on payment
systems that was back in 2003 2004 I
started experimenting and finding out
why why why everybody has failed and how
we could possibly succeed and in order
to do that I looked into a science of
human decision-making which is called
economics and I'm by no means an expert
so I just found that even some of the
most basic results are surprisingly
relevant very useful and undeservedly
overlooked and ignored so I would so
this be the purpose of this talk is to
raise awareness of of economics and its
relevance to designing human computer
interfaces in particular for the purpose
of payment so let me begin with a very
superficial and very brief introduction
to economics so they have this
economists have this very very simple
yet surprisingly powerful model of a
human decision maker which is the
rational actor rational player by
rational they mean that it he has some
concept of costs and benefits and they
may be different for different people
but nevertheless the decisions that
people end up making are such that they
tend to
their costs and maximize their benefits
and it is a consequence so it's not an
axiom it's actually a consequence of
several things that if people do that
and they are free to exchange the things
that they have and the costs of
transactions are minimal and everybody's
well-informed and so on and so forth
then we will achieve efficient resource
allocation we're efficient also has a
very specific meaning namely that if we
change that resource allocation then
necessarily somebody will be worse off
so an efficient resource allocation is
which cannot be improved in the sense
that we cannot make someone better off
without also making someone else worse
off and an inefficient resource
allocation is one can that can be
improved in such a way that everybody is
better off but that if here is a very
very big if so it's not at all clear
that under any circumstances if we just
introduce the market then it will
magically solve everything and I will
explore these problems a little bit more
in detail and one of the things when we
are talking about information we of
course cannot assume that everybody is
well-informed because they want
information in the first place
so the first assumptions that we drop is
that everybody is well-informed know
there are many many relevant pieces of
information that people do not have and
therefore these pieces of information
are modeled with certain probabilities
that people attach to you know if I do
this if I take this decision then this
might happen that might happen that
might happen and subjectively I assign
certain probabilities to them and then
we can also figure out how people decide
and the most obvious model the simplest
model which is unfortunately not quite
accurate is that people simply maximize
the expected the expected utility so
they expect
they calculate the work they somehow
have a feeling of the utility of the
different outcomes that their decision
might entail and they somehow try to
maximize the expected utility and
instead of you know building more and
more complicated models of humans
there's another school of economics
which is called behavioral economics
which sort of attacks the problem from
the opposite direction and what they do
is they say well let's look at how
people actually make decisions let's
look at their decisions and try to work
backwards how people actually what
people might have had in mind for making
those decisions and the updated theory
is that they introduce certain greetings
into the expectations and instead of
expected utility theory that is called
prospect theory and you can look it up
what results they have but basically
what happens is that they introduce
certain additional costs that people are
obviously aware of the opportunity cost
of a decision is that if I decide to do
something it obviously stops me from
doing something else and that might have
some other benefits that I lose this way
so the cost of the missed opportunities
and it seems like people are painfully
aware of these opportunity costs so if
we make the impression that by deciding
something people lose something else
that will not be very popular and it
will be very relevant to interface
design the other thing is that mental
accounting itself has a certain cost
meaning that if you have to stop and
think about decisions it's you know it's
it's it's bothersome so it's it's also
something that is perceived as a loss
and there are some well-established
phenomena in behavioral economics and I
think I believe that the jury is still
out on the reasons for behind them so
they're still arguing why they are but
the phenomenon
selves are very well-established and
they're all related you could actually
add irrational before all these bullet
points so there's loss aversion loss
aversion means that people hate loss is
more than they like benefits so if
something entails so if they need to
choose between avoiding a loss or
getting a something that is gives a
comparable benefit they tend to avoid
losses even if the benefits would be a
little bigger then there's the stink of
risk aversion and also risk seeking
meaning that if some decision entails
the possibility of a big loss even
though that possible
the probability is relatively small and
the gains are overwhelming nevertheless
people have turned to avoid risky
behavior under certain circumstances so
the way it actually works and there are
many lab experiments and those
observations of real markets and and
other situations that the way people the
kind of risk people try to avoid is when
the losses can be arbitrarily large or
very large and the gains are predictable
that's the kind of situation people
don't like and so for example you can
see the absolutely rational fear of a
flight and terrorists and things like
that that we observed for more resources
now the harm caused by those things but
also there's the other side when the
costs are predictable and bounded but
the gains are potentially very large
then we type tend to to take those
decisions which is what the ambling is
that we buy a lottery ticket and even
though the expected gain is smaller than
the price of the lottery ticket because
that's the whole point of the lottery
people still tend to buy lottery tickets
so that's another criticism of of
expected utility theory and you know the
killer is the st. Petersburg paradox by
the bernoulli cousins
which is that there's this hypothetical
lottery that you pay a certain amount
down and then someone slips a fair coin
and every time there's heads the pot
doubles it starts with $1 or whatever
and when it's tails and then the game is
over and you get the pot so with the
probability 1/2 the your your payoff
doubles and then it stops now if you
calculate the expected value of this
lottery it's infinite it diverges to
infinity and yet if you approach people
that how much would you like to pay for
being able to play this game with me you
will find surprising with small amounts
so nobody would offer you let's say a
thousand francs for playing this only
beginning with one friend and I don't
want to go into this it's a very
interesting topic and we can discuss it
in the bar afterwards it's not very
relevant to interface design it's just
highlights that have for the actual
human behavior is from maximizing
expected utility that's not what people
do and the things that also affect it
are the endowment effect and sunk cost
effect which are also somewhat
irrational endowment effect is that once
you own something you get sort of
attached to it and you put a much higher
value to it than to something that you
do not own the sunk cost effect is
somewhat related that if you keep
investing into something you won't let
it go even where it if even when it's
completely rational at that point now if
you look at rational decision making
past costs that are not recoverable
should not be taken into consideration
at all but behavioral economics observed
that that's not how people work if
people have sunk certain amount of costs
into something they're not gonna let it
go and it influences their decisions
very heavy
so now that we have seen these we can
actually see why certain payment systems
are more successful than others which do
not take these things into account so
for example the most direct payment
system if you do it naively that you
know if you encounter a Content that
needs to be paid for example an article
then you can you can do something that
is payment and then you see it white
people would hate it because it's
against everything that you see here it
entails a huge mental accounting cost
that is way above the amount of money
that you pay because you just need to
make decisions and it distracts you from
reading the newspaper it entails a
possible loss because you pay for it and
then you can get something that you are
not even interested in and so on so
let's look at something that does work
that's as far as I know the only widely
used and to some extent successful way
of charging people for content
subscription what subscription you
upfront you pay a huge amount of well a
large in not a non micro payment you
make a non micro payment a substantial
amount of payment and then for you get
this way you purchased the right to view
a relatively large amount of content so
what are the benefits why why this is
successful because the mental accounting
tasks are infrequent so once in a year
or twice in a year you make a decision
whether or not to subscribe and that's
it you don't need to make decisions
every time you access the resource the
cause the actual costs of performing the
payment are negligible compared to the
amount paid because in case of micro
payments you have this problem that the
the operation of payment takes so much
time and effort then it is quite
comparable to the amount of sand
or even Millicent's that you end up
paying and in case of subscription that
problem is avoided because the task of
payment is actually much smaller than
the amount of a subscription and what's
also good about it is that the costs are
predictable you paid this amount and
potentially there will be something very
interesting and you can gain a lot but
you definitely won't lose a lot so maybe
this is the solution so far at least
this has been the only solution that has
worked to some extent but it has
downsides and you know whenever we see
that something is inefficient then we
should see also an opportunity to
exploit in this case the problem with
subscription is the huge opportunity
cost and since media got online this is
even more pronounced if you subscribe to
something precisely because the amount
involved is not a micro payment it
definitely means that it's a sizeable
chunk of your budget for purchasing
content and if you subscribe to this you
don't subscribe to that because you
cannot subscribe to everything and on
the internet precisely because of the
hyperlinks we can to you know jump serve
back and forth between different
contents and if you have to subscribe
for everything it sure that it happened
to you as well you click on a link
subscription required there so that's
one thing why people hate subscription
and the other problem has to do with
song costs and endowment you know if
somebody subscribes to a expensive
journal you can be sure that they will
go up to lengths to explain why this
journal is absolutely brilliant and why
you should also subscribe because they
have this endowment effect they make
this commitment this huge commitment and
unrecoverable costs and from that point
on they are only focusing so they are
consuming that content they're rejecting
content does not reduce it and so on and
so forth and you become less informed
and on the other side it's also
repulsive because people know
to some extent we feel that we are that
way so we don't like to make commitments
like that so you know if there's a
journal with which I know that I do not
fully agree usually and I don't want to
I don't want to to fall into that trap I
find a fit so I kind of feel bad about
giving them a huge chunk of money just
in order to access it for a year so
maybe we could do better than that
so obviously we want to be maximalists
so we want to have our pie and also eat
it we want to have all the benefits of
subscription and hopefully none of its
downside and this is one thing that I
have done in 2005 when I was a graduate
student at Queen's University in Canada
I did this experiment on campus it was
quite illegal because what I did was I
subscribed to a very expensive yet very
popular weekly newspaper which won't be
named here and I certa by proxy and I
was reselling its content based on the
principles that that I figured out and I
had only one rule to keep the experiment
honest I never so I never did anything
that would undercut the the newspapers
every time I made something it was set
up in such a way that the owners of that
newspaper could also do just that
without hurting their business so I just
went for day lost opportunities with you
know with the naive hope that maybe they
will no the problem was of course that
not only did they not know this but the
part of this experiment that was even
more illegal was not the fact that I
used the content of that newspaper but
the fact that I was using university
infrastructure for commercial purposes
which is strictly forbidden but anyway
the solution was fairly simple there was
a web server module with the content
provider and
was a payment processing server because
I was thinking you know forward that
maybe they will be more content
providers I will have my own payment
processor server and they will make a
business and the here's how it works so
upon you hit some premium content
without subscription you get 4:02 with a
form where you can enter payment the
fact that I used single-use codes is a
mere technical detail so it could be
just a yes/no button if you are somehow
subscribe to the payment processor it's
it's a detail the fact that you get a
form where you can decide whether yes
you want to buy it or no you don't want
to buy it it should be noted that the
way that newspaper operated back then
since they have changed their policy a
little bit was that their premium
content was only available to
subscribers so even if you purchased the
paper Edition you could not access the
premium content and there was no way to
pay for parts of the premium content so
premium content was only accessible to
subscribers so once the payment is
successful in my case the entered code
was valid the payment is transacted and
the premium content was displayed and if
the paid amount was sufficiently large
than a subscription to place I offered
one hour subscriptions and one day
subscriptions compared to the one year
subscriptions of the newspaper and I put
out in the library some cards with the
logo of the journal and a single code
that people could just try and you say
and read one piece of you know
restricted country mem content what
ended up happening was that people would
take decks of this code educational
obviously it was not a very large
commercial success because otherwise I
would be working for that newspaper by
now but you know it had some sort of
success it was definitely better than
nothing because there was genuine demand
for that kind of micro payment
the protocol turned out to be very
simple and versatile the company that I
now have a point system uses the same
protocol for selling wireless Internet
access via little routers and it's
exactly the same protocol and it's
actually is a bit limited but still a
commercial success so it's it can be
used for many things I also learned that
daily and hourly subscriptions make
sense that was actually introduced a few
months into the experiment the bad news
is that you know making that decision
whether or not I want to view that
content it still sucks it's
substantially worse than in the case so
I just subscribe and then I don't need
to ever think about it again at least
till the subscription lasts entering the
single use codes time and also bad news
is that it was not good enough to turn
it into a profitable business so let's
have some wish list how can we make it
even better without you know
compromising on anything so it should be
fire-and-forget so you should be able to
make something and typically not trigger
you need not to make recurring decisions
about the same thing it should still
avoid commitment so you should not be so
you should be able to pay one large sum
and never think about it but that large
sum must be recoverable it's very
important not to not you need not to
commit that wholesome and of course the
costs need to be limited in the sense
that you know the trivial way of making
micropayment work and in that's how the
cellular telephone service started out
that you know when you make calls they
just keep charging you without asking
you and you know that in the 90s in
Europe but I believe that in the US it's
still the case some operators charge for
airtime so if somebody calls you they
still charge you for the amount of time
that you talk
and this is what people hate because you
have no control over who calls you or
you have some limited control but not
not much and you know there's still a
possible loss that somebody calls you
you don't want to talk to that person
and yet you end up paying and it's very
frustrating so I wanted to avoid that as
well so here's the solution that we came
up with it's it's something that is
built on top of the previously described
protocol so this is a Firefox extension
but so basically we modified the browser
which the idea itself is from the way
browsers handle 401 so if you look at
401 status what happens is that if you
have some restricted content then the
browser would ask you for credentials
which can be a username password or
maybe a certificate so it will
authenticate you and then it will
display the content and it's the same
thing so we added this extension which
handles 402 the same way
namely it works sort of like a wallet so
you deposit a certain amount of payment
into your browser conceptually and if
you encounter a 402 first time the
browser would ask you whether or not you
want to pay and you have a third option
here that okay I want to pay for this
moreover from this if a request from the
same domain comes that asks for this
amount or less then dot don't keep
asking me I want to pay it on this
website so the default threshold is zero
it cannot happen that somebody charges
you without your consent but if you keep
returning to a website then it will stop
asking you there's some visual feedback
of how much money you still have and
there are some things that ended up
being added
as user requests one of the interesting
thing is that this little visual
feedback some people like it and some
people don't so you can turn it off also
it's very important that the whole thing
can be turned off so if you just want to
browse and you don't want to you don't
want this extension to to keep bothering
you you can turn it off and it's very
important that funds can be both added
and withdrawn which means that it works
sort of like a subscription to
everything which is basically what
people actually want that you pay you
once you make a decision of allocating a
substantial amount of money to browsing
to viewing premium content but still you
don't need to decide on a particular
provider of this content and the good
thing about it is that it makes the
actual transaction costs very low
because most of the time you don't even
see them and but secondly you do not
have to make decisions that you have
once made again and again so it lowers
your mental accounting costs as the Act
as well as the actual transaction costs
so it hopefully helps that problem as
well and also it will not entrap you but
the bad news is of course that we have
discussed with my partners what we want
to do with this once we have made it and
I figured that it's this is not our core
business because we're doing you know as
Peter has just told you that we're in a
completely different line of business so
I just decided to share this experience
with you and maybe someone will find
some
raishin in this work so thank you very
much
that was it and if you have any
questions I will be one answer yes of
course well there's still one click so
the if you if you want to and and it you
know one click is one click too much in
case of content where the value the
potential value is maybe less than a
cent than just making the decisions of
whether or not I want to see this
you know once it's okay but you know if
in the same newspaper you have that if
you have to purchase every article using
Amazon's one click too much right but
we're talking about content information
that you want to read if in case it's an
application that you want to download of
course the payment is no longer micro so
if the costs are in the range of you
know one one or two dollars then it's ok
to click every time but if you're
talking about cents then one click is
not good too much
it's an interesting question thank you
oh so the question was am i sure that
this these ideas will get some traction
in the news industry and if they are the
biggest beneficiaries of of these
developments it's an interesting
question obviously you probably know
that they the american association of
news publishers has issued a request for
implementing micropayment and as far as
I know Google has read it but back in
2005 when I was experimenting with those
things and you know I was quite public
about it it did generate a little bit of
buzz so what did happen was that I got
interviewed by a new scientist so in the
June issue of a new new scientist in
2006 I believe you can read a two-page
interview with me and there was even a
small company that wanted to add
subscription-only so there was a small
company that even had me sign a contract
but it went belly-up before they came up
with with any meaningful product so it
seems that there are some interest but
as I mentioned in the beginning of this
talk and why I really like your question
is that the thing is that you don't know
in advance what the optimal resource
allocation would be and it can vary and
if they think that it is their content
that people want to pay for they might
be well mistaken so maybe there are some
popular bloggers who can eat their lunch
because right now with subscriptions
people you know brand names are really
really really valuable because you want
make a big you you want buy a
subscription from a blogger because you
don't know him and you can still buy a
subscription
from New York I'm so I think that
there's a real possibility that if such
a system gets implemented it will
actually shift funds from big publishers
to to the little guy yes
well you can see that the solution that
I have just shown you decomposes this
problem completely so there's the
payment provider to which you you submit
your form on the 402 page and then when
the payment is processed you get
redirected back with a digitally signed
receipt of you know account amount times
time signature you get redirected back
and that server module about which I
thought processes it and I search the
content meaning that how the paper where
the payment comes from and how is it
actually processed is delegated to that
payment provider and you can ease the
use there so for example the very simple
thing that we used we just use a
single-use codes prepaids and we use
codes works surprisingly well and maybe
you could implement something on top of
you know Google Checkout or something
it's so it's these two things are
completely separated in this model and
once you have established a way of
paying you will still gain all these
benefits and you will never know how the
actual payment processing is is done
now these are things that people
typically don't care about so if you
look at behavioral economics again you
will not so if you will not exert effort
forgetting your ones on back so no if
this system does not let you get your
sons back but if you have paid for one
page and it just once and it's okay so
you will not sync big amounts of money
into it just you went here here if
you're not sure then you say yes pay
once and the next time you will not pay
for it and that's it and you lose one
cent on whatever so for example there's
one thing that is also well recorded in
the literature that when people move
they buy a lot more boxes than they end
up using because it's still better to
have one box more or ten boxes more than
have one box less and it's exactly the
same case here
is there a question here from remote
site
can I ask yes so the question was that a
scrum remotely please okay yes I'm
curious about the two issues of market
segmentation the population that wants
one article is different from that that
wants ten articles and could be charged
a higher rate versus people's ideas
about fairness that there's a big
resistance of people to being charged a
really unfair price you know five times
as much as another user in a different
country or something how both of those
two sides interact with this system well
I can answer the first question be
caught with at least with from some
experience because at that University
there are those poor students who do not
want to subscribe to the newspaper but
they were obviously willing to shell out
a little bit of money for read in
particular articles so I believe that
there is a market segmentation here and
there is a market that newspapers that
are offering subscriptions only are
losing because of this so I do think
that there's a market segment that can
be successfully reached this way and as
for the second part of your question
unfortunately that I cannot answer
because I just have no real-life
experience to draw from but it's
definitely an interesting question worth
exploring
right
well first of all I'm not necessarily so
it's it's not the only goal of coming up
with this not even the main goal and
secondly well as far as I know figuring
out where your clients come from is not
that difficult you know based on IP
addresses and things like that or
language settings and if so because of
the amounts involved here or
micropayments
yes you can cheat but probably cheating
is just not worth the effort on that
small scale so I would be surprised if
someone who just wants to read you know
New York Times would pretend that they
are from India just in order to make
them pay the Indian price but I don't
know so it's it's its interest it would
be interesting to find out obviously
with the movie industry it's it's a
completely different so but we're not
talking about micro payments anymore
there and with movies of course of
course the you know the region code was
well worth defeating but in this case
maybe it's not not that relevant
the short answer is yes the long answer
is very long so yeah there there's a
whole bunch of different security
measures here and we can discuss them if
you're interested the about the
recurring payment there's one
fundamental break here that it does not
allow you to charge more frequent so
from the same side it will not allow
huge charges more frequently than once a
second or once so the time is actually
you can set it I think maybe the default
is months 10 seconds or something like
that so there's you can put a frequency
limit on the whole thing and there's a
default limit which is somewhat hard and
also if you see that you're on a page
which goes like this then you stop it
but there's also a hard limit which is
conceptual and I think it's very
important that this is not taking money
from your bank account it's not linked
to to some big amount of money no you
first have to put some money that this
is what you allocate for reading and
then that's a hard that's a hard limit
but yet for cheating and you know the
providers claiming to have received more
payment than they really have the users
accessing content without actually
paying and things like that there's a
whole bunch of security measures but
it's it's a matter of the payment system
we can talk about it later
and that's a good idea actually thank
you thank you I was anticipating that
question being at Google and thank you
so much for asking it yeah it had to be
asked right actually originally I put
that into my presentation but then I
figured somebody would ask it the answer
is that in the beginning remember I
talked about efficient resource
allocation so the whole payment thing in
my view is just a communication a
feedback between the content producer
and the content consumer that tells the
Preferences of the content consumer to
the content producers and you know money
is the ultimate truth theorem so they
are telling the truth with their payment
and the problem with ads is that they
put one or even two additional parties
into this equation makes it more
indirect and there are many ways in
which the content so any of the involved
parties will try to game the system and
as far as I know well the most obvious
the way in which this resource
allocation is not not efficient is that
some people put effort into putting ads
on web pages and other people put effort
into blocking ads on web browsers and
obviously the resource allocation can be
improved it's not efficient because if
neither neither of them did what they
did everybody would be better off
without anybody losing because the user
doesn't see doesn't see the ad anyway
but there's a more important waste of
resources involved with with in the
process where their advertisements and
as far as I know this company spends a
non-trivial amount of money on what you
call spam in a very broad sense
namely that you have these algorithms
and people are trying to game them and
you're working on outsmarting those
people and you know there's a huge fight
going on and a lot of resources end up
misallocated and that money is obviously
up for grabs so I think that if
obviously it's not so I'm not saying
that payment would replace advertisement
in a way because in many cases
advertisement is very well aligned with
with content those are the good
situations where ads are the perfect way
of paying for content but there are lots
of lots of cases when the two are
misaligned and the alignment itself the
effect of viewing pages and so on and so
forth they all entail wasted resources
on a big scale and if we can implement
direct payment then I believe that a lot
of resources will be freed up and they
can be shared between these parties as
profit so that's that's the answer to
that question
yes first of all I do like the idea so
flat a flatter is sort of a peer-to-peer
implementation of this in a way that you
can you have some correct me if I'm
wrong but the way it works is that you
have some fixed tie which you can share
between the content producers that you
like and and the company that provides
that service is paying based on the some
of the things that you you end up
collecting from these files as a Content
producer right that's how it works
that's the basic idea and I think that
its main drawback is the fact that it's
because the size of these files are
fixed it distorts the signal of how
important people think these contents
are and how valuable they are and by the
by the soap from these two questions
yeah from these two questions it might
provide a good answer to the first two
but it definitely does not answer the
third one because you cannot compare
your activity to some alternatives which
do not involve you know content so you
cannot decide whether hey I should be
writing articles or I should be baking
bread what what am I better at what
people value more so I think that it's
somewhat so by making it not quite
payment you somehow dilute the truth
serum
definitely so as I said here so there's
that payment processing server and where
that payment processing server gets its
money it's it's its technical detail and
if the protocol
nope nope yeah I think it's it's
important there's a industry of paid
content which it's not very often talked
about
yes
right but they do not have such stronger
need for Emily neither neither D right
there's even even more interesting one
which actually the company that I found
that there's one thing that people are
willing to pay money which is voting
their favorites oh so there are these
phone and calls when you but you
basically vote for your favorite band to
be higher up in some ranking and you
know teenagers end up spending hundreds
of dollars and they want it to bring the
same thing to the web and that's why
they got interested in the system so
yeah they're there many places where
micropayment seems to be seems to be
needed sorely needed but precisely
because of the things that I mentioned
it's harder than it appears</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
