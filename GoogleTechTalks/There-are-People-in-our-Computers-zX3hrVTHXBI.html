pleased to be introducing David Wahlberg
I'm sure you're already impressed that
Alan Eustace is his opening act and you
know here is the real show he'll be
speaking about work that he's doing at
University of San Francisco I know him
from my other life as a computer science
professor and the wonderful work he does
in education and encouraging girls to go
into computer science and I'm delighted
to share this opportunity with you about
finding out about his research this talk
is being videotaped so don't ask any
questions with Google confidential
information until the video tapes off
the talks can you go up on google video
so huh thank you so Ellen comes we have
this program every summer for for high
school girls to encourage them into
computer science and Ellen comes and in
about five minutes hasn't talking about
research and in 10 minutes they
understand the scientific process you
know which I try to teach up to my
graduate students it takes two years you
know so she does a great great job there
and we have a lot of fun so I'm Dave
Wilbur I'm a CS professor at USF I've
been trying to finish my MFA in creative
writing over there I started at about
seven years ago but I had a son about
five years ago and became the department
chair about 34 years ago and pretty much
have a written for those those years but
one of my goals is to not be a computer
scientist and be a writer so we'll see
what happens there my other project is
called who's funding whom dork so I'm
real interested in political software
and the San Francisco Ethics Commission
came to usf said hey we need some help
getting our data up that people so
people can use it and we basically you
know us that's kind of a Jesuit school
they encourage public service so what we
did was we basically built some
visualization software so now you can go
and see you know who knew some got his
money from and and follow funding trails
and find out what's going on in politics
in the Bay Area so a pretty pretty neat
stuff so years ago I worked on its
system called web top and it was a kind
of like Google Desktop shared and the
idea was kind of think of the desktop as
part of the web so we kind of analyzed
the the links within the desktop did an
index of course and then we kind of gave
a treeview a file manager which had no
boundaries between files and the web and
let people kind of go through inward or
outward links or directory links and
kind of got rid of the distinction
between different kinds of links and
that project was fun and got about
ninety five percent done and I pretty
much abandon it but but kind of my my my
goal or my motivation for this kind of
work is I have a terrible memory people
call me the absent-minded professor okay
so I'm always thinking about tools to as
remembered say something to help me as I
do research to record it and help me
work on that stuff anybody know Ted
Nelson some of my students have called
me Ted Nelson because I'm such a
scatterbrain and I work then try to work
on these big systems anyway so here's
what I'm not going to talk about I'm not
going to talk about people in terms of
the plumbing okay I think a lot of times
we can get caught up in fo for X F in or
RDF semantic web and we get caught up in
you know what kind of file formats we're
going to use to transfer things around
the web and what I want to talk about
here more is from the whole other level
from what kind of tools can we build for
users to start adding semantics into the
web and start recording their the
research I'm not going to talk about
social networking the stuff I'm going to
talk about is kind of orthogonal maybe
but basically it's if I don't talk about
people research as opposed to you know
some kind of connecting to friends and
buddy lists okay obviously you could
think of those things integrated but I'm
going to think on this side you know
there's 10 million systems and thoughts
on the other side and finally a research
system but not a research system so I
don't know what they'll always talking
about them sorry okay so what am I going
to talk about people research so people
as data I want to talk about and people
beyond budding so getting getting past
the social network angle and I want to
think of people as first class objects
on the web so I think documents kind of
kind of rule the web right now and I
want to kind of think of documents and
people on the same level give them a
little more credence and I also going to
talk about kind of an aggregate virtual
identity so what's it mean you know what
is Ellen spertus on the web what's the
collection of all things that make up
Ellen spertus finally I want you to
think in terms of people is not the same
as users okay in most systems social
networking systems and others the only
people that exist are the users on that
system and finally i'm going to show you
the system i it's a prototype i'm
building called people issues
okay so here's my short history of the
web you know first a bunch of sites
scattered all over then the Yahoo guys
built their first you know the first
directory bringing order through a
hierarchical structure then we had
search engines page rank of course in
big bold letters and then you know just
a few years ago finally we started
seeing some users re-engineering the web
and delicious was a big popular just how
many people use delicious ok you know so
delicious it shows social bookmarking
and it was kind of one of the first
systems that really got people to to add
annotations and semantics to the web and
you're adding categories social
networking of course is taken off and
then what I see is kind of the next step
is people as first class objects
whatever that means and then maybe we're
going to have some people's directories
and it kind of as a joke I said you know
David's people directory notes it's
going to be everyone's people directory
so I think it's going to be more than
one people directors give me a lot of
people directories I think it's going to
be much flatter than Yahoo's document
directory and of course user user
generated so that's that's kind of a
some context for what I'm talking about
so you know here's here's my if you know
the big sale we all Google people every
day right we go and search for a person
put their name in we get a bunch of
links and we filter a lot of times it's
a lot of work to do that Phil trained
even with David Wahlberg there's a bunch
of other David Wolfers and even if there
wasn't even if my name was completely
unique you still get a bunch of junk
links in there so everybody searches
find the links filters keeps them on
their desktop maybe sends an email out
or creates a document which is about
that person they're researching but they
don't save that information anywhere
okay so i like to call it purposely
purple is purposeless lee private data i
don't like to say it but i like to call
it that okay and the idea is people have
a lot of stuff on their desktops that
they'd like to share they won't mind
sharing what they don't okay let's try
to get some of that out where people can
take advantage of it
so people are second classes on the web
whenever you go look at a document
there's there's people involved but you
can't see them they're not they're not
around the author the people refer to in
the document you don't know anything
about those people there text that's all
you got that's starting to change
finally you know you let's say we're
trying to put the old library system
online well we've got a great topic
catalog well we've got google search for
our main catalog but when you're talking
about associative data and user data you
know delicious and social bookmarks have
given us a topic catalog but we really
don't have an author catalog or a
referred to catalog you know here's a
person what documents do they exist in
and what documents did they create
there's nowhere to go right now to get
that information so you know where's
where's the people in software so search
search you can search and you can search
for people but you know there's no
people that come up right and of course
there's yellow page search and you're
starting to see people searches around
delicious when you go to delicious there
are people there but their users and
they have usernames and that's it and
what you can do is go to that user name
and see all the links that that person
is inserted in the system okay so you're
starting to get a user which is a little
more than just a user but has some data
but not much what I would love is to go
to delicious and see this person has
tagged this item and be able to go
somewhere that says oh that person works
at North Carolina State and here's their
software they worked on here's their
blog etc right I don't want to have to
dig for that information myself I
continually go to delicious see this
user and then try to find out who that
person is because if I like their links
I'm going to want to know more about
them and what projects are working on
all right so social networks people are
certainly their profile info feeds a lot
of so
networks Ivan time gone into orchid
they're starting to let you say okay
these are my blog feeds this is my
delicious feed and we're starting to get
more information for each person well
you don't have you know people are still
just the users and this is built into
the system for a purpose for instance
orkut you can only join by invitation
only and the idea is let's you know
let's somehow keep it restricted so we
don't get a bunch of noise and into the
system okay and that's that's a good
idea for social networking but what
about just people research what about if
you want to do research on people that
are not users ninety-nine point nine
nine percent of the world right that's
that's the idea wikipedia of courses is
probably the best example of where you
can add data about people to a system so
anyway we'll talk more about wikipedia
later finally you know one more
motivating factor you know Semantic Web
wonderful great but we're not not going
too far and and what I want to see is
semantic markup in a real simple manner
you know who's the author of a page
who's referred to and be able to come up
with this collection of documents about
a person we kind of need to make this
bridge right here between people and
documents and it's not there and this is
not rocket science right i think it's
real easy to get caught up in in the
details of rdf and trying to say let's
come up with some system that can can
read semantic data and figure out when
you should you know schedule your dental
appointment next week alright i'm not i
don't i say let's not worry about that
right now right now let's get some of
this basic data into our system so
people going to use it to find stuff
okay so let me let me do a little demo
here of the system and so here's here's
someone's blog and the idea is you know
add your browsing at you're finding
things if you find someone's blog one
thing you can do is say okay let's let's
kind of personify that Vlad let's let's
let's add whoever the person behind the
blog let's add that to our database okay
so I've got a couple bookmarklet set up
for the system and I can say okay let's
add a techie and what what people
interest does is it goes out to
technorati and it tries to grab as much
information as it can from from
technorati how many people claim a blog
at technorati ok anyway technorati you
can go there if Dave / can go to
technorati and claim his own blog okay
but I can't go there and say this is Joe
Smith's blog right just like kind of
with social networks it's restricted to
the user talking about himself ok so
anyway if if it's there people issues
will go out and grab the data so it'll
grab as rss-feed grab his first and last
name grab an image most the time it's
not there not too many blogs are claimed
okay but a lot of people if they want to
get traffic or whatnot they'll go to
technorati and kind of set this up okay
so usually you're going to bring up this
page and you'll have to input the
information yourself and I'm kind of the
one power user of people issues right
now and what I've done is I've done a
bunch of research finding people finding
blogs and I've input them into the
system and basically you go find an
image form you go find their blogs you
find their delicious name if you can and
you kind of input it in there and also
you've got this kind of profile for a
person and you know it's pretty nice to
have so I'm just going to click add and
add Robert to my system okay and all of
a sudden what I have is you know a
profile for him and you know it's got an
RSS feed
so it goes and gets his posts and it's
got the sink called person marks which
I'll talk about later I can go back and
edit his info if I want okay and the
other thing I can do then is I can add
this guy to to list so and the other
thing kind of people are being allowed
to do on the web now is create lists of
things so instead of the programmer
saying these are the this is the
hierarchy or this is the organization a
system like people issues allows anybody
to say okay let's make a list for this
and for people the list turn tend to be
companies or organizations topics or
kind of types of people something like
that but you might also think of lists
of of a more ephemeral nature right a
conference you're going to a conference
you might want to build a directory of
all the people that conference anyway
I'll put Robert in a couple he's a
blogger and I'll adam is at and I can
also say okay let's let's just put him
in something else so let's say he's a an
IT expert and I can add a new list to it
to the system and I'm done and now I've
got this this person object he's in a
couple lists and when i go back to his
profile here i can now look at him in a
group and so what this group view kind
of gives you is it's a way to you know
one way to look at it as a way to set up
an aggregate RSS reader so as plenty of
RSS readers out there the idea behind
people issues is it you know you've got
people and their blogs so people are
kind of above each of the blocks so
right now I've got these people with
their pictures and I can go look at
their data and but if I scroll down I
can also look at kind of a by date
aggregation of all their posts so those
are all from Robert Scoble but there's
John Battelle Steve Rubell Phil Quinn
Lee
so kind of real quickly you can create
people and get a group RSS reader for
for all those people okay so once you've
kind of added a person to the system put
them in a bunch of lists then you can
start person marking ok and a person
mark is like a bookmark in delicious but
the idea is you can also associate the
bookmark with a person ok so if I went
to Google
and I said let's let's search for Ellen
spertus so Gail
Go Go sporadic and slow today okay
okay and I can go say let's let's let's
find a page 44 l and I and I've already
got Ellen's blog and whatnot in here but
but here's a page i might like and i
think this is a this is a page about
Ellen's work with encouraging women in
the computer science and so I've got
this other this other bookmarklet appear
or people mark lit and what i can do is
okay let's add this document to our
system and it you know just like with
delicious it throws in the URL and the
title and then i added a couple extra
things for semantics you can kind of say
that the type of the the object and then
you can also you know say what the
association is and usually the
association is going to be about or
authored by in this case i think it's an
article and it's about ellen the
authored by okay thank you and you can
type in any kind of association you want
or choose one that's that's that's been
in there already let's see so now i can
add this person mark to the system and
then it brings Ellen up and if i look at
the person marks she's got a few things
in here so so it's kind of like okay
we've got this person and we've got this
RSS reader to look at all their blogs
and they're delicious posts but let's
also we've got this other part of the
web which is not a blog but it's just
web pages and they're all scattered
about Ellen let's take all peoples
googling work about Ellen and let them
share it and say these are the these are
the documents that matter and so let's
person mark them under her and then what
you kind of end up having is in some
sense it's two things one is you know
this is what Ellen has has written about
or posted and person marks our stuff
about Ellen that's not exactly true
because person marks are either stuff
about Ellen that people have put in or
stuff written by Ellen that people put
in and it might be yelling herself to
put it in so
the division is here's kind of post
stuff blogs and bookmarks and here's web
stuff that's not one of those but we
still want to collect it under her so
you kind of get a combination of
delicious and blog reader in some sense
connected under under a person is the
idea
okay so just one one thing so you know I
think if you if you could consider this
place which is the aggregate virtual
person right and you know right now
that's Wikipedia but if you have that
then you've got a URL hopefully a simple
URL which you can use in blogs to refer
the person so instead of Alvin all these
blog entries or web pages with Ellen
spertus text you can have a link which
takes you to Ellen's Burdick's with all
her information so for instance here's
here's one of my blogs and you can see
all the people i refer to go to people
issue sites and you can check out more
about them so Ellen Miller's is from the
sunlight foundation and she happens to
be a person I've been put into a people
issues for politics and so I can click
and get there there right away so kind
of we're getting this the sense of
here's a web with links to people as
opposed to just text names you know
Google's good for search engines are
good with the text names getting you to
the real place but this is a little more
direct association
okay so a couple things about delicious
the key I think about delicious is they
made it under some kind of threshold you
know people have been working on trying
to get users to add semantics of the web
for a long time and what they did with
with their bookmarklet and now they have
you know some extensions in Firefox and
ie they made it a one-click process okay
and the funny thing is when you're
browsing and searching you have very
limited in endurance for stopping right
it's kind of like when you reading a
book and you read a great passage you
want to you know write it down and
remember it later but you never do
alright people don't like to stop their
process so you know making it really
easy to do is is key and you know with
people issues with those bookmark it's
the same idea you're not going to stop
and go to Wikipedia and add some stuff
into week two pedia but you might click
that link and say it save this under
Dave wolver right okay so delicious
versus people Isha's you know in both
systems you can tag documents and you
know both systems kind of record a
tagger URL Association but with people
Isha's you can create people you can
create person URL associations and that
could be any kind of Association like
about or author that's what i call
person marking a document you can do
person feeds and then of course person
person lips and you know kind of in
vogue right now is is people tags
there's just like tag alag there's a
bunch of systems starting to do this
really what I've got you know I call
them list but really they're their tags
they're just not single word tags they
can be whatever you want to want to call
them and there are also objects you can
you can add information about the list
so they're not raw tagged but they're in
the sense of the same as the same as tax
so yet two people Marcus tomorrow web
resources being offered by about or
concern in some matter with a particular
person okay so what else do we need to
do well you're starting to see this in
some social networking systems but
even with delicious it's it's noisy the
whole world posts there right and I
think people are trend is let's let's
start breaking this down and let's let
people build smaller communities which
you have the same software so with
people issues you can create these
domains with separate home pages IBM's
working on this in they set up something
called fringe contacts with which is a
people tagging system one idea which I
haven't done is allow users to define
domains by domains I mean pretty much a
whole new site so user could come to
people issues and say you know what I
want to cite for my conference on
building set it up and would
automatically set it up right now I have
to go in the database and make three
changes and I can add a new domain I'll
show you a couple of those later one
system that does this is called people
aggregator and people aggregator is a
social networking meta site okay and
they basically let a user go and say set
me up this new social network site about
you know for these people and go get the
data from these other social network
sites so people aggregator is kind of a
let's let people set up domains within
social networking and people is just is
trying to the same thing
okay so quick scenario at usf you got a
bunch of professors that love to go to
parties and talk about themselves okay
but they don't like to keep their
webpage up-to-date and they don't have a
web presence at all usually you know as
you get younger and younger it gets
better and better ok so the Dean sends
out emails every once and while say no
you know this person's doing some cool
stuff development and media team are
completely ignorant they have no idea
what the faculty is up to it's only the
deans emails or top that where they get
their information from there's nowhere
to go to see what the faculty at USF for
doing and that's what the development
people of course need to get to get
grants you know people will come and say
you have an expert in this area you know
the data they don't know so we're going
to build a people issues for USF
no that's sorry that's just my Dean
let's see so here's that here's the home
page 44 people issues are for the people
of USF it's it's the same software but
this is a completely separate site than
the techie site I was showing you
earlier and basically you just set up
these domains and this one's for USF and
you know you can see you're going to
have your typical hierarchical or an
organizational structure with the
departments but then you're also going
to have topics and you're also going to
have smaller community groups you know
one big problem with universities is
you've got these people in these
departments that are working together
but there's no organization for it
nobody knows they're working together so
like inner inner department research is
kind of hard to do and it gets lost so
the idea here is let's let people make
lists of any kind and we can kind of
keep track of all these communities that
exist within the within the university
well I won't go through the website but
you guys are probably seen websites like
this if you go to usf CA com or EV you
it takes you nine links to find a
professor okay and even myself who have
been there a number of times it took me
like 10 minutes yesterday to find my web
page from the USF site and there's no
where to go to find who's doing some
kind of topic there's just nothing there
once you get to a professor site you
know it says what university they went
to that's about it maybe a link
somewhere else it's just horrible i
think a lot of organizations are the
same okay for a corporation oops
so I made one for Google and this is
this is you know kind of interesting you
know corporations may not be so happy
about such a such a thing you know their
employees are you know their value okay
so this this is a question of
transparency versus privacy and the fact
that we're allowing people that to add
persons and data about others and not
just themselves you know kind of opens
up this big this big question now
certainly it would be a value to people
to be able to go to a site which is a
directory of all google or yahoo
employees including what they're working
on and what kind of relationships people
would love to do this but there's
nothing out there that allows you to do
it now obviously you know there could be
problems with lawsuits and that kind of
thing but it's an interesting question
the other thing I look at is kind of
academics research in general you know
there is nowhere to go right now to say
what's the landscape like in computer
science what professors are working on
what in computer science there's nothing
basically you have search engines and
you just do all your work yourself I
would love to know for instance you know
who's studying folksonomies in academia
you know what are the AI groups at
Stanford MIT and cow I can go find that
stuff right and go to their websites and
figure it out but it's going to take me
a long time and I'm going to keep that
information to myself maybe I'll email
to somebody you know if you had a
collaborative site where people could
put this information in you can create a
very valuable resource the other thing
is you know what are the most recent
blog entries by computer scientists you
know who has blogs and really no one no
one knows this you can go to technorati
or some of the some of the blog search
engines and find this out just another
thing about the research process here's
how I do research now I go to sites here
or Google Scholar scholar google and I
find the paper I used to go to the damn
library and find a paper and was even
worse I'm pretty old but now I'm go find
papers but when I go to those places I
get the paper
I get the author names and that's it
there's no link to get the authors those
authors are just just text right so I
would love to have people as part of
google scholar because all I do always
is find the paper or if it's not
available I go to the author's site so I
can get the pre print the PDF that
they're allowed to put on their website
but what I want to do is go find other
projects they're working on other people
they're working with and do that stuff I
do that all the time but there's no tool
that kind of help me with it I already
talking about a conference directory but
it's kind of an example of an ephemeral
directory and the other one we're
working on is this this this idea you
know ever since Dean started his
campaign you know so many years ago
there's a bunch of political websites
and every politician now has a blog or a
web page and there's information
obviously about politicians from news
reports but it's scattered it's all over
the web there's no way to find out for
instance you know all the people running
for governor what they're up to okay so
I built this political site
it's called open campaigns calm and you
know one of the interesting ones is I
put in you know the governor governor
candidates and you can go there and you
can get kind of by date listing of
Arnold and Phil's blog posts what's
happening but it's very interesting to
be able to build these lists of
candidates for some election and be able
to see what they're talking about in one
place instead of having to go find it
your yourself and it's real quick and
easy to build these okay so just real
quickly I'll talk about some related
systems but here's kind of the landscape
of information and user-generated
information you've got people you can
tag people in some sites but people are
pretty wary of this ok tagalog is one of
them dzieki allows you to do this couple
other ones you got traditional profile
information that kind of all social
networking systems are starting to
provide people are starting to be able
to create lists on the web Jedi was with
a system that was one of the early
systems to do this Amazon's got their
listmania okay but this is a big change
allowing users to create lists as
opposed to the list being predefined
you've got posts and bookmarks and then
you know I've been talking about the
fact that there's these web pages out
there that are authored by and about
people and those are kind of in this
area where you you know we don't know
what people they're about and then
delicious allows to tag web pages and
you know social networking systems allow
us to you know make people people
associations so that's kind of the whole
landscape and people are starting to add
stuff to various different kinds of
systems so zekis are real real nice when
Zika calm is the link and they give you
profile information feeds you can create
groups dzieki is like like my people
issues system but it's a it's not a
prototype it works okay and
the key difference though is you can
only specify stuff about yourself okay
so they took the the social network
model and said let's keep that and you
know there's advantages to that your
information is a little bit more you can
accept it more readily but you know
there's a lot of people out there that
are not users of ziki right and you'd
like to do research on it and they also
don't combine with the social
bookmarking plaxo anybody heard of
plaques oh okay plaxo is is kind of
address books on the web you can you can
put real basic profile information the
nice thing is you know every user
changes their own so instead of an
address book on your book on your
desktop it's all centralized and if they
change their information you know about
it immediately as opposed to everybody
having all this old information about
all their contacts pretty cool thing but
traditional information tag lag is the
people tagging system I've mentioned a
couple times kind of a weird thing but I
think they do this for also to add
credence to to the users you can only
tag people if you know their email kind
of like LinkedIn you can only link in
with someone if you know their email or
if you pay 20 bucks a month or something
I think they think rich people are more
reputable okay so what about people
tagging you know a lot of people are
like well you know I don't want to do
this you know you people think of the
ugly list right you could go to people
issues right now create lists called
ugly and start putting people in there
right so there's this idea of someone
could spam or just flame and it's right
out there for people see and you know
you can tag documents and the documents
not going to cry right so when you're
tagging people it's it's a little touchy
it's a little scary you got this idea of
lawsuits and people are also touch about
kind of privacy issues Big Brother
issues you know I'm you know we're
building this directory of people you
know scary right
but you know one of the keys here is
there's a lot of people out there people
are doing research on them all the time
and most those people are not users all
right some of them are dead all right
there's all kinds of people we'd like to
do research on and you know restricting
yourself to only allowing people to talk
about themselves is a huge restriction
you know we don't do it in the world
right I can say you know Milan Kundera
wrote The Unbearable Lightness of being
and that's not controversial that's a
simple statement and that's kind of what
we're trying to do with people issues
right this document was written by this
person you know it's pretty basic
information the other thing is you know
people really want to track their own
identity but it's hard to do I don't
know how many of you guys go if you've
got systems out there or you've got
blogs out there you want to see who's
talking about you or who's written an
article about you and so you're
continually looking at different search
engines trying to find that stuff the
idea here is let's get all in one place
and you can kind of keep track of
yourself okay so mitigating factors one
I think the big place this stuff is
going to work is within the enterprise
right let's keep it within a domain the
people of USF only USF people could add
information right they can add
information about any person but your
user set is restricted and that takes
away a lot of the problems right there
right because they you know they have a
job they don't want to don't want to
lose it so I think the enterprise is
where you're really going to see a lot
of movement that's what iBM is pushing
for with their people tagging system I
talked about restricted specification
we're not talking about in people issues
I'd only allow people to put comments in
you can't even say this person I don't
like him there is no there's no field
for that there's just links right here's
their blog here's their delicious name
you know basic stuff that is kind of
non-controversial of course I could link
a web page to Joe that's about you know
Nazi Germany or something
and you know that would be that would be
a bad thing but it's you know it's much
less likely if you kind of restrict what
they can do now the other the other
thing is you know but I don't know how
to do this but you know pretty much the
web is anonymous right now and people
like that expect it I think we're going
to start seeing in your already seen
this trend of real identities so the
users are the real self and have their
real names in there and that changes the
whole dynamic of what's going on and
you're starting to see this pop up in a
lot of systems okay so the key system
wikipedia they want to distinguish it
from people issues well Wikipedia is not
hard to add information but it's it's
basically you know adding HTML you have
to go to Wikipedia open up a form and
enter some text okay not that big a deal
but you're not going to do this during
the browsing process right the idea with
people issues is no let's just let them
do one click and connect this link to a
person I think that's the key one the
other one is you know structured data
versus HTML so you could think of a
system that allows users to enter a
bunch of structured data and if you have
a web service on top of that also and
you've got data that software agents can
really use right people ish asst is all
HTML so it's real difficult for agents
to get the data and do anything with it
okay you could think of Wikipedia adding
micro formats and and kind of adding
some semantics and structure within
those web pages but right now it's not
there the other thing is perspectives
and with Wikipedia users are
collaborating on this one web page about
a person you know the idea with just
putting in links is you know every user
you could look at Ellen spertus as
specified by computer science professors
right because it's just links and you
know the editor of each link it's not
HTML that's getting over written and
rewritten right so you've got this idea
of I can browse as some user some expert
or I can browse
some list of people and I can get a
different perspective on a person when I
browse through there and this is a huge
huge difference you'll because of you
know a big problem with public sites is
anybody can add information and really
what you want is this web which is
engineered through different
perspectives to give you a different
look but I would love to be able to just
see the web as the bookmarks of all
Google employees right that would give
you a much better experience probably if
you think google employees are smart
than the general web and that's the idea
here I don't think you can really do
that you know Wikipedia is not going to
allow that because it's unstructured
unstructured data just one other system
common gate so one problem with the way
people issues is set up is when you go
to one of these lists if it's a topic
you see all the people that are involved
with that topic the problem is those
people are not really single empties
right everybody's got multiple
personalities so if i go to social
networking I'm going to see Ellen and
I'm going to see her post but some of
them aren't going to be about social
networking okay so you know one idea is
let's you need to break up topics and
people and give kind of a you know a way
to get between both now common gate is a
system that does that you basically go
there and you post a blog entry and you
say okay I want it to be in these topics
okay it also gets filed under you and
any of the groups you're in but you
basically got a way to say okay let's go
to that topic and see all the entries
for that and then let's go see this
person and see all their entries so it
does a little better job but you know
it's a closed system it doesn't work
with existing blogs it's like my space
you create a blog within the system you
know so it's not going to work with the
existing landscape but pretty cool idea
just some other related systems people
feeds zimbio group es Magnolia yeah
who's my web you know you know of course
is
can you can share your bookmarks with
trusted buddies basically and there's
millions of others this you know
definitely as you guys know you know the
social networking arena is full there's
all kinds of systems coming out and you
know I think you're also seeing a lot of
people systems okay a couple couple
issues one is is the UI challenge and I
think you know this is not real exciting
stuff but this is a key to actually
getting people to add semantics to the
web you've got to make it real easy
could it be integrated with search Ellen
and I we're talking a little bit about
you know as Google search results come
up it'd be nice if you'll say check
check check boom right but you have to
be you know part of the search engine
for that all the browser plugins that
are coming out now are huge people are
starting to use those and make it real
easy to do one click saves right anyway
Jedi this is this is Jedi actually on
the side here they've got to plug in and
they've got this thing called you know
drop anything here to start a jetpack a
jetpack is a list of stuff you know so
my idea is would be nice is be able to
choose a person within your within the
extension have that person sitting there
and then you go to google and do the
search like I did before it gets tracked
stuff over so immediately you can create
these document person associations in a
very easy and quick manner I don't have
that right now because all i have is the
bookmarklet you know it's not integrated
with the browser so i think you need you
need the extension to do it okay search
and these are questions i don't i
definitely don't know the answer for you
know what should be indexed for a person
so what I've got now is their blogs
they're delicious posts and all these
web documents that people have added to
them that's a lot of data you know do I
want to index all the keywords in all
those documents you know for a person I
don't know do I want to do a little
extra analysis and only come up with the
the top most characteristic words so
it's it's a tough question
I don't know how it's going to be
answered now you know in regular search
you've got a single document that you're
indexing now here we've got a bunch of
documents which are about a person what
do we use for our search person drank a
lot of people working on reputation
schemes to it's a good interesting
research question the other thing is I
want you to think about this personal
web neighborhood right so okay we've got
this virtual identity of a person it's
all these links what about the
neighborhood of that area right all
those documents point to the web so if
you could go to some expert and say I
want to search within his neighborhood
or her neighborhood right it's going to
give you a subset of the web which is
kind of their perspective on it and be
able to search only within that as
opposed to search within the whole the
whole world so first of course you need
this kind of virtual identity to be
created and they need to build a crawler
or personal crawler to kind of go and
build that index pretty interesting
thing I'll say a little bit about person
multiple personalities but i think i
mentioned it before you might want to
think of a person as in things and then
those in things can have posts and
information about them really on the web
at least we are more than one person
each of us so you might want to think
about personalities within within each
person you know break a person's brain
down into its parts okay you know one
other way to look at what's going on
today is is you know power is going from
from the programmer or the DBA to the to
the users I'm not even that's where the
users but to non-programmers so you can
think of allowing administrators to add
structure and information to a site you
know that the big problem is any change
like I work with a lot of government
agencies any change in their software
costs a lot of money and they can't do
it they don't have the money it just
stops
a single tiny little change so if you
can set it up where people can create
lists and create some some organization
without going to a programmer it's it's
huge so you know tagging is a big first
step their lists on the web but i think
you know kind of a generalization of
what people issues does is you know
letting people create objects not the
data in the objects but the data
structure so I've created a people
object and you know I've set the fields
for those people as a fixed set of
fields blog post delicious name image
etc you know but you could think of
allowing a non programmer to say you
know here's a book and a book is defined
by an amazon link and you know library
link and a title ISBN number but allow
the the non programmer to say I want an
object like that give me a form it
allows me to put it on it it's kind of
the next step after Ruby on Rails
anybody use Ruby on Rails you know Ruby
on Rails makes it real easy for a
programmer to create a website and this
would be the step of put it into the end
user hands it's not a big leap anyway
okay I'm yeah I'm done I think a couple
more minutes no yeah anyway related
projects I think I think adding people
to google scholar google would be an
excellent idea I don't know about orkut
and those sort of things but I think in
scholar would be a fantastic addition
anyway the takeaway is people as a
top-level organizing thing people marks
people list does that be the same as a
user list and then finally you know what
can we do with a virtual person once we
have that information how can we use it
and finally I think the key is is let's
get let's reengineer the web through
different perspectives and you know
they'll give a much smaller and better
view for people to use the web anyway
