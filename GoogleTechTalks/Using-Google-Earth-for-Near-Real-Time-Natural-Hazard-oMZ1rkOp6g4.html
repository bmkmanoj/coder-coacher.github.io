today we'll talk a little bit about the
problem we're trying to solve why it is
important and worth of our time what
kind of data analysis and visualization
were interested in I will give you a
demo Google Earth I hope you will just
go flawless maybe little glitches here
and there is still an experimental
project and then I will talk a little
bit about Sanjay some suggestions that I
have for future version of Google Earth
I want to say up front this research is
being carried primarily in the
laboratory for atmospheric another
modeling this is a primary place where I
work this is part of the Caesar the
center for observing a space research
part of George Mason University we're
also collaborating with a unit that's
the United Nation environmental program
and finally we also have collaboration
with NASA and i will show you some of
the nice kml that are being done by our
students who also work in NASA so first
of all what are we trying to do we want
to a monitor in study and also forecast
a different type of hazards what we mean
is some of the most obvious such as
earthquakes volcanoes hurricane floods
but also things like atmospheric
releases climate change global warming
heat waves and so on why do we want to
do it well we want to organize and
distribute the data in the scientific
findings they make them universally
accessible and useful and I know you're
pretty familiar with those kind of
warnings either I just gotta phrased a
little bit and what I want to show here
that what we are trying to do george
mason and in the research community it's
very much related to what you're trying
to do a google so there could be some
very good overlapping and a common
projects together um why is it important
why is it worth our time first of all
you know that every time there is an
earthquake or
hurricanes many people could die we can
also have billions of dollars in
damaging properties but then also we can
have some economic effect but just
yesterday I was talking to leave us
there are some very fixed route for the
shipping of goods from Asia let's say
China making to Europe and some of those
shipping routes there in very scenic
regions so it will be enough that an
earthquake strike this region cut the
sea routes and then you will have
immediate economic global wide economic
effects we can also destroy natural
landmarks we need to protect also the
environment create problem for very
large areas this is particularly true in
our time things like a nuclear power
plants or hide arms nuclear storage
facilities the poses at a risk that is
unprecedented never in our human history
we were so much at risk from natural
hazards and finally this is a concept
started in the Cold War but it's true
nowadays as well is the disability shin
of the military power natural hazard may
trigger some local and regional
conflicts finally this is very important
for the sustainability of our
civilization we need to protect our
water resources and food supplies which
are the primary source for our living as
you can imagine we didn't start today to
look at natural hazard and all those
problems people have worked for we can
claim even thousands of years we have
some reports of our ancient Greece and
ancient Roman so we're trying to study
scientifically so not too
just saying typically earthquakes and
other events such as volcanic eruptions
so why are we at an advantage right now
and the answer is observation satellite
observation never we had so such an
Bonanza data about the earth and we need
to use such information to study the
complementary nature of different
parameters once when all those hazar was
studying only from a ground-based point
of view we had very sporadic data and
this data were primarily not complete it
was only giving small little information
about the global picture whereas right
now with space-based remote sensing we
can have high temporal resolution so we
can get data every hours or every day
and with very high spatial coverage and
you have seen it from ally with Google
Earth you can go to a street level but
also the spectral level so we can see
not only the visible but also with other
spectral bands this is our case this is
our approach we start from remote
sensing those are the observation they
come from the satellite we feed them
into numerical modeling and those are
what you see for example for weather
forecast so those are models it take the
observation and then they help us
forecast what's going to be what's going
to happen in the future then we have
some data mining in debt analysis and
here we talk primarily about some
spatial statistics machine learning
classification clustering and so on then
we have our data visualization for which
we use also Google Earth and the
distribution and this is not the end as
you can see this is a look why because
once we are done with our visualization
and the distribution of data this is a
motivation to go back and look at the
planet or for a different point of view
very quickly I would like to tell you a
little bit of a remote sensing I will
not go into all the details of the
satellites but I want to make a big
distinction probably what your most used
with art was one meter or so even less
resolution data that you can get into
google earth that is only some of what
you can get from a satellite what is
also very interesting some form of lower
resolution data they go from 30 meters
to 1 kilometer but with different
spectral bands not only the visible such
data allow us to study the for example
the hurt from a time thermal point of
view we can extract thermal information
however as you can see it's very hard to
get everything at high resolution every
time you work with the remote sensing
data you have to balance you know you
can get high temporal resolution but
there probably is not spatial high
spatial resolution but not temporal
inspector the reason because there is
only as much the an antenna that you can
fly in space and as much computing that
you can have in space you certainly
cannot fly Cray supercomputer in space
to analyze your data so we have a
trade-off and this is why we have
several satellites and right now we have
literally hundreds of satellites both
research satellites military satellite
and commercial satellite which every day
studied the earth the different spectra
bank and they give us very useful
information also what we try to do is a
quantitative study so we don't just look
at the picture we really try to look at
time series for each point on the earth
we try to look at a temporal coverage so
in order to say well how did a sea
surface temperature change in the Gulf
of Mexico for the past 10 years and then
by looking at this data we can make
inference about climate change global
get so on we have our own antenna and
I'm actually in charge of it it's an
l-band antenna we get six satellites
every day fiber from NOAA which is the
National Journal oceanographic and
atmospheric administration then we also
get the chinese feng gain one series you
probably heard about the feng jian 1c
serious about a month and a half ago was
very famous because it was destroyed
using a ballistic missile from China we
used to get the data so i can actually
if you won't show you some of the data
that we used to receive from that
satellite our coverage is regional we
cannot feed it please I don't think so
actually the satellite was the main
instrument failed quite a while ago what
he was just sending telemetry
information something saying hey I'm
here I'm still alive but that was about
it we was not sending any useful data we
were still checking every now and then
because you never know sometimes
instruments just by miracle start
working again am what I want to say that
we have our we don't have a global
coverage is Indian Tina we are somewhat
of a regional coverage and I will show
it to you we cover most of the United
States part of Canada part of Mexico
which make us some in a very good
position to study primarily hurricanes
we get very good coverage for it the
title of my talk stresses about near
real time so why is near real-time
important and why is it difficult when
you get data from the satellite it's not
just ready to be loaded into google
earth or another program so you actually
get some binary data those are just bits
of information with our packet together
and transmitted using god this helped
and or expand signals it's very hard
first of all we need to acquire the date
and in order to acquire the data well
you know where you are in
on the surface of the earth then you can
compute where the satellite is in the
orbit and then you just take your
antenna you point it to the satellite
and then you know you start getting all
the data until the orbit is over so
there is for some challenging in knowing
where the satellite is try to compute
for the exact position because first the
earth is not a sphere second of all you
know that there is some rug raphy so
makes it even more complicated
furthermore the hurt in spinning and
finally the satellite is not only to the
same altitude because its altitude its
relative to gravity over the earth and
such gravity may change over time and
may have certain anomalies so first
challenges computer the satellite is and
get a date second of all we need to
calibrate we have different instrument
in those instruments tend to degrade
over time and the reason is the space is
very hostile environment electronics is
subject to cosmic rays and even though
they're shielded there's still a certain
degradation that happens over time we
need to compensate for this finally we
have cloud contamination if you're
looking at the surface of the earth in
the visible you may have cloud so even
though you get good data you're able to
calibrate and you look at it and it's
useless for you so you need to wait for
the next satellite class then do
rectification that's what I was talking
about before that you need to map with
the satellite saw on the surface and you
have to take into consideration things
like geography and the fact that your
toe screening and so on yes
or what you need to do oh yes you need
to take the data received from the
satellite in map on the earth on the
surface of the earth you need to take
into consideration things like mountain
valleys and you also have to take into
consideration the fact that the earth
was rotating while the satellite was
viewing so you have very complex
transformation that you need to apply to
your data you also need probably to
clear some data you may have some
missing data you don't put it out here
well after we have done this now we have
usable data now what do we do with it
probably we want to put it into a model
if we want with our problem is weather
forecasting we want to take data that we
have received with a satellite feed it
into the model and there is quite some
work that you need to do for this and
you need a supercomputer you cannot run
it off your laptop or off your computer
then you need to index the data this is
something I think you're very interested
out and probably there are some issues
that you may want to consider how do you
index data the changes over time that
has a spatial component it may be as
also attempt I'm sorry spectral
component the same data may come in the
visible what you see with the I you may
have some thermal channels and other
channels like in the ultraviolet so how
do you indexed in this data how do you
make it accessible for others finally
how do you distribute it each satellite
or which is huge I mean we are talking
about terabytes of data that we received
every time we have an orbital satellite
we can have several terabytes a day so
how do we store it how do we subset it
because probably people they don't want
the oh lordy they're just interested in
a small segment and finally security
security and integrity of the data even
though most of this data you can find it
over the Internet this doesn't mean that
the security is not important in fact
some of these data is the official data
used by let's say National Hurricane
Center to run their own model so if this
data is compromised then you will get
wrong model from a different agency and
arguably I think he will make it it
makes it very hard the fact that
the same data that you distribute to
everyone for the net is the same data
that government agencies are using for
their own applications so as we see it's
very very hard to do everything in real
time now what I want to show you is the
visualization this is what you can tell
it's me and it's my office I think last
time I visit Google you know it was very
envious of you having two monitors so
necessary so I actually yeah I went back
and those are 12 30 inch monitor from
the Apple high resolution and we build
the structure together with the four
research assistants and we get very good
resolution we can get to see almost the
old world a full resolution daily just
as you can see we put google earth
that's the probability could work and it
was quite an interesting project you
know to have so many monitors we have
right now three computers that are
controlling them so we have a
distributed system distributor graphic
system to get an image subset it and
then display across multiple monitors
and now i'm using this for teaching
actually i think he comes in the next
slide okay so would i what do i use
google earth for first of all it's a
visualization tool so what what i do to
visualize in to distribute the data that
we get from our satellite pain in real
time oh sorry this is so i meant to say
for a natural hazard and this is
something that we're doing in
collaboration with unit it's a project
started at a United Nation and we also
have some collaboration with google I
think last December also if you came
with us we met in a mountain view to
start this project going and the goal is
to release in me real time information
about all types of hazards we're not
talking about natural has are also
environmental hazard so things of course
as earthquakes volcanoes but then also
air quality and different weather
information severe weather and so on so
that's the first project I'm using for
teaching two courses i chose the numbers
of those courses i thought it was funny
but i'm not associated with boiling it
anyway the first one is remote sensing
or natural hazard which i'm teaching
this semester and second one is
satellite data acquisition in which we
cover the whole process from how do we
get the data from the satellite to how
do we post all the images online we use
kml to distribute our own satellite data
and i will leave those links we have
about 24 images every day so it's about
one every hour in which we get data from
our satellite and within five minutes
that the satellite receivers the data we
post it online and you can see it and
it's a quite not too many people are
posting satellite images within few
minutes that they are acquired we also
use google or for quick prototyping
sometimes we get some data primarily
surface temperature we use a lot it's a
2004 and 2005 and we quickly want to see
if there is some changes some notable
changes between the two
not just a basic one that's the basic
what is it just you want you're going
out
the proto are you got abusive their
future
powerful pushing to attend
ensures that wedding crow I will discuss
some features that i would like to see
either them hopefully in the free
version but also on the pro version will
be very nice okay so let me give a
little demo we will see about those
monitoring of our various hazard I will
show you how you can display real-time
or near real-time remote sensing data in
Google Earth then we'll show things as a
sea surface temperature and Katrina if
it works because I had some problem with
it before so let's quit this and where
is crushed wonderful ok
all the work we've done crash so I'm
going to load them in online it's going
to take a little bit of time
now
do you have any questions I mean
meanwhile I do this please we can talk
it doesn't require much
and I'm going to show the reflectance so
what I'm trying to do right now to give
you an image of out the heart looks like
view from space pretty much in real time
you said you say the pipeline is
supposed to be about five minutes five
you actually tell is their way of saying
exactly wanted to go
together only
not yet but we can certainly do it some
very nice suggestion for the future um
let me just show you I'm gonna make this
a little bit transparent
okay so let's zoom in
and
share
and show first
okay so here we're looking at dirt you
can spin it what we have we have clouds
those clouds are free as all this three
hours old usually they're updated about
every three hours we have day night
night time so you can tell which part of
the word the sun is shining which part
is a dark you cannot really see it i
will show later about some texture
mapping we should probably I will you
can see like this we have texture
mapping from city lights so those little
white dots that you see are the city
lights you can see some very nice
features are for example denial this is
it's just so prominent in the Europe you
can tell the major cities you know in am
from Italy you can see very well Rome
Naples and so on so the first thing we
know which part it's a fun or not and
then you see a lot of little icons to
thread ones or forest fires so we're
currently that our forest fire now when
we say currently actually we say for the
last 24 hours I cannot really say about
time I prefer last 24 hours over some
fires those little circle that you will
see here there are earthquakes so there
are ways for the past six hours and the
red and yellow here your volcanic
eruption red it's a current volcanic
eruption where is the yellow it's
something that shows an activity is not
a full eruption but I'm either it was a
fool eruption is cooling down or it will
erupt
fires yes satellite days so the way it
works is a satellite the actually two
satellites acquaint era from NASA we
have an instrument called modest what is
instrument does yes several channels and
he looks at several different channel
primarily the thermal channel now if he
sees that there is an area that is
highly vegetated with a very high
temperature then you will assign a
certain probability that there is a
current fire then you can go on and do a
more realistic analysis in which you
actually look at the plume so you can
actually see the smoke this one in
particular just done with temperature so
there is a threshold if surface
temperature is above this threshold then
means that there is a fire I should
mention that the data the satellite
sorry the resolution of the data is
about one kilometer therefore those are
rather large fires this means they are
effect one kilometer square then we have
things like hurricanes right now this is
quite season for us but in the southern
hemisphere is very active those are
hurricanes once again for the past few
days the ones that have a wide a ending
means it's a forecast that's what's the
numerical model is telling us or the
work with a sorry the hurricane is going
to be in the next 24 hours the one it is
just read is just the track and as I
said those occurred within the last few
days saito remember exactly how many
bits a threshold that we can change so
this is just to give a little bit of
information about well that's how the
earth is and what we are looking at
now let me show you something this is
the climatological data view from space
from februari something that I never
really liked about Google Earth was the
way it does the texture mapping and this
is how of here the hurt really is and
this is what you probably are more fun
sorry remove December so this is how
what you're probably more familiar with
that is the basic entrance to google art
this is how it I think it should be so
and you can get in order to show this
data this is a monthly composite so what
it what we did we took all orbit for one
entire month and then we put it together
the reason is that cloud contamination
is that you know if you just look at one
day as we saw before there is a lot of
clouds you don't really get to see how
is the surface how the surface looks
like if you do a monthly composite then
you will work well and in reality it
doesn't change much you know it in a
magazine if you can say the data for
proving over month and then a bunch of
ground-based observations would it be
possible to it
it's a very time
matching detail a very hard problem for
different reasons one of course is the
resolution second one is probably the
instruments are somewhat different even
if the instrument is are the same when
you have an instrument on a satellite is
to go through the atmosphere and the
atmosphere will somehow change your
readings you have to compensate maybe
for pollution or water vapor and so on
so let's say that is very hard to
combine satellite data ground data it
can be done quite effectively for
surface temperature so you know for
example sea surface temperature you can
have a lot of Bowie and then you have a
satellite data then you know you can
especially match it and this is done but
for the visible not really um what we
can try to see now I don't know if this
works I tried before and it was a little
faulting it's a sea surface temperature
this is a very important parameter which
is investigated all the time you know
when we talk about hazard because it
tells us a lot about the planet you tell
us about changes whether the planet is
heating up or cooling down what we have
here we have monthly data once again for
2005 2005 that is very important here
because of all the hurricane activity
that we witness in the Atlantic region
so
it's thinking okay right here so when we
can go ahead and study the difference
between man-to-man tour at least compare
things like January with August and you
will see how there is a very strong
seasonal seasonal component which can be
studied very effectively such component
of course affects global climate it
affects also the circulation and so on
um one point I would like to make is
let's talk about hurricanes why do you
think hurricanes occur do you have any
ideas why well this is yes
a stroke but why I mean why you know
nature pretty much everything as a
purpose why does the art of oregon's and
not only the art you know we have
observed oregon's also on other planets
well the truth is that hurricane is just
in a way in actually a very efficient
way for the earth to redistribute energy
it takes excessive energy the equatorial
regions and any Muslim at higher
latitudes so what we see that if there
is an excessive energy in the guitar in
gear at the equator then as a result we
will see more hurricanes and this is
something that we can study very well
with those satellites so it's a little
it's thinking but what this one is is an
image good this is actually is December
and it's color-coded where you see ready
means warm water where you see the blue
and the purple is very cold water and
you can see some features as the current
of the goal for example of the Labrador
Current coming down and you see if I can
zoom in it those are very
okay probably they were two men in
memory
okay so we can go ahead and compare
let's say December that it's rather cool
with August you can see what a very
large difference in temperature is
occurring well this large change in
temperature is what is causing those
oregon's to occur and by studying the
spatial distribution of those some
anomalies we were able to determine why
Hurricane Katrina intensified so quickly
so let's say that the state of the art
right now we can predict fairly
accurately what is the track of a
hurricane but we cannot focus very well
its intensity so this is one of the
unknown and by studying the spatial
distributions of those anomaly then we
may able to give better approximations
and let me see if I can zoom in this is
for our august 2005 where we add both
Katrina after a short laurita and you
can see those patches of very hot water
in the Gulf of Mexico those are in part
responsible for the very rapid
intensification so as you can see just
by using google earth we can actually
study some very very important you know
i'm going to wrap up and tell you a
little bit about what I think it should
be done
ok
ok
it's a little slow
and got this spoon you got the spinning
pizza there through the bone yeah well
it's nighttime right there it is okay
please okay so first of all some of the
pro in the calm first of all the number
of downloads very large it's very easy
to use it's a nice interface open API
it's free unless you get for the pro
version then you know we all love Google
of course some of the call well you can
only do some qualitative analysis
remember before I was talking about how
important is to be able to study done
time series that's something that we
cannot currently do with Google Earth we
can only display the image another raw
data something that would be very nice
now that I showed you the surface
temperature for example just to
concentrate in certain value let's say
let's display only what is between 28
degree Celsius and above there will be
very nice to have another slide Bart
over there and just to concentrate on a
certain range of data of course you
cannot do it if you're just fitting a
JPEG because you don't have the kind of
information but you could do it if
you're starting from the raw data and
then build the color data according to
certain a certain a legend that you
define some of the limited API there are
things like time series analysis that
would be nice to do that we can all do
right now and of course it was not
intended for scientific as a scientific
tool chromoly before the general
audience so what is my suggestion first
of all allow google earth to redraw data
if you can redraw data then you can
start tackling a lot of problems than
none right now you can't and it's a
fairly easy thing to do we can do some
scientific experiment so right now
Googler to be instead of just a tool for
the general mass to look at yer to
become something that we can use for
doing science we can get rid of a
terrible problem about
data formats remember before I said it
we have literally hundreds satellites
well almost each satellite use its own
format so by putting everything into one
interface and distribute all the raw
data into some common data format will
get rid of this earth that by itself
would be a huge contribution and what do
you think personally the googler could
become the de facto standard for GIS do
no sure heard about GIS I really think
that he could all you need to do as I
was saying to reach raw data and to
allow easy things like time series
analysis and one supporting evidence I
have for this at every time we go to
conference wings like a GU the american
geophysical union conference which takes
place in San Francisco every year with
more and more people that are using
google earth to do some basic GIS and
this will be extended to allow some time
series analysis I said or work with raw
data I really thing that nobody would
use different programs which is the best
another big advantage would be to
provide near real-time information about
the earth why is this important well
once again for our joint mission to
organize the world information make it
easily accessible in useful for everyone
more broadly how can google hurt how can
google help earth science is we so
Google Earth monotony you have very
large computational powers this is
something that we're constantly
struggling especially in the University
index is searching and distribution of
data with spatial temporal and spectral
component this is something that it's
really at its infancy there is some work
done but there is a lot of possibility I
think for our company specializes in
searches like yours something else
Google base it's a very good
architecture to distribute data probably
could beat a door specifically for our
science data in a finally google news
this is in the form of the hazards to
alert different people about hazards and
this is the end of my talk I mean so
Google Earth is wonderful we're eating
toxic we're using it to do like things
like watching
but where did you complain
you have all this data right but he was
pretty hard we have read all that works
out to be by background on computer
scientist ogos
there is some commercial software to
solo jes software and this is what are
primarily using the scientific community
very few people use Google Earth in the
scientific community at this point think
you know one of the biggest contribution
of Google Earth was really to make it
easy for everyone to look a remote
sensing data I think is one of the
largest contribution right now you know
you have like little kids like 80 years
old nine years old that you know they
can go online and look at their own
house and lot this is something
incredible I mean when we started even
just four or five years ago and you want
it to look some data about the earth it
was quite complicated you know to get
the data to visualize the data put
layers on it and so on see is it right
now
quality
what
but right
Oh
for example I showed you different
layers for monthly data for the sea
surface temperature what you could do
just draw a little rectangle on it and
say well show me the time series and
then the system will just show you the
graph and then from the graph you could
see whether it is increasing if it is
decreasing so do some something that you
can say well you know in the past 10
years the sea surface temperature
increase by 1 degree you know like
really put some numbers not just
visualizing oh you know this area looks
higher than the other this is very
important for our site what's another
another example could be verizon or
spatial distribution you could compare
two different parts of the earth which I
want to see what are the times in the
northern hemisphere with respect to the
southern hemisphere so you can do some
also spatial comparison but usually
every time we talk about quantitative
analysis we really mean to put some
numbers to our findings so time series
analysis the first day comes into my
mind certainly this class classification
what you could do you could say well you
know find me all areas on the on the
planet where there is snow right now the
system will automatically like create a
mask so analyze the different spectral
recognize what is a snow and then put a
mask on google earth or a ver or a
pollutant pollutant release this is very
important for volcanic eruption when
your volcanic eruption it's very
important for navigation you have an
airplane you fly through the plume then
you will crash so you know you could
automatically say okay volcanic eruption
find me the plume and then you know you
will map it three dimension spatial
height there are many those are the
first thing come to my mind
awesome
yeah I can see if it works that's
actually something very interesting land
parameters population density let's see
if you load it so what we do we overlay
the population density so that we can
have some very quick estimate then we
say okay not quake occurred in this area
how many people are directly affected
it's right here let me remove the sea
surface temperature in this population
density for a old old word you can see
like places like India and I Gangotri
Beijing in China is much higher so yes
that's something that we actually doing
is a very very important aspect of the
research of course we can only see the
in just an image which will be very nice
to be able like to click here and say
okay how many people are like how many
millions thats daily probably is going
to be close to 20 million people
if you look at something like this
really see where
physically in an area
the folks there
ok
and then you share a time component you
can actually see the progress over time
thank you very much
