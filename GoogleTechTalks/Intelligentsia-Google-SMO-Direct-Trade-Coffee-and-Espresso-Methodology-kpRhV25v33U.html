coffee
I do espresso blending and coffee
purchasing there and the man who's gonna
be doing the bulk of the shearing today
is this gentleman right here
Jeff watts he's the vice president of
green coffee pioneer and Trailblazer in
the industry most notably in creating
the direct trade criteria which defines
so much of the coffee buying that
happens in the world today and yeah just
gonna talk to us about coffee
intelligentsia what makes coffee great
stuff like that so without further ado
here he is thank you
welcome everybody so I'm gonna tell you
first just a little bit an introduction
about our company why we're here how we
got to be doing what we're doing we're
called intelligentsia started in Chicago
in 1995 at a time when coffee as we know
it specialty coffee is we know it was
still really in a very embryonic infant
stage it's come a long way in 15 years
and and we're very proud to have been a
big part of helping it get to where it
is there's still a long ways to go
before coffee reaches its reaches its
true place among the great culinary
products in the world like wines and
cheeses coffee is is every bit as
complex and nuanced as any of the best
wines in the world but it still has a
long way to go until the public or the
mainstream recognizes it as a beverage
that is worthy of their their dollars
their time their their pondering their
contemplation it's still a beverage
that's consumed as much for the caffeine
in many cases as for the taste and it's
our goal to try to change all that and
restore coffee to its rightful place
once upon a time it was considered the
beverage of kings and and princes in the
arab world it was
it was regarded like Dold it was a real
treasure and in fact there's been people
who have fought over over control of
coffee and access to it because it's it
was considered such a such a gift to
mankind and there's a great book if you
ever want to read it called The Devil's
cup which actually talks about coffees
history I'm not gonna get into it today
because we've got other stuff to talk
about but it's got a fascinating history
and and oddly enough it was it was born
in the Great Rift Valley in southern
Ethiopia and in the same place that that
many believe humans were born so it's a
know and relatively recently compared to
other other forms of life so it's
something that maybe was was meant to be
with us anyway intelligentsia now is in
LA and some of you drink it some of you
were drinking it this morning
hope you're diggin it I'm gonna tell you
a little bit about why it tastes the way
it does and and talk a little bit about
its impact in the global economy first
of all what when we talk about quality
and coffee what are we talking about
we're talking about the sensory pleasure
that it delivers we're talking about the
aromas the flavors the acids in the
coffee that that are carriers for so
many different complex flavor nuances
acidity in coffee is not to be confused
with pH is in the sense of a an orange
or whatever coffees actually got a
relatively low pH compared to two other
or low acid level compared to other
beverages and fruit juices the acids in
the coffee are some of the same acids
that you find in fruits like malic acid
that you find in apples or citric acid
that you find in citrus fruits or
tartaric acid that you find in grapes
now those are the same same compounds
that are in coffee
these organic acids that contribute to
the vibrancy and the and the tremendous
nuance that you can find in a great
coffee in fact there are believed to be
over 800 individual compounds that
contribute
- aroma and flavor and coffee as
compared to maybe 200 in wine so it's
you could say it's it's perhaps four
times as complex as wine in a sense how
do we measure quality well we measure it
first and foremost with our tongues our
palates and our and our olfactory glands
Coffee is something that is it's among
the most aromatic beverages on the
planet and what's very unfortunate is
historically most consumers have not had
access to truly extraordinary coffee
what they drink has been commodity
coffee which is not not produced to be
great it's produced to be cheap and that
that explains about 99% of the world's
coffee production it's it's treated as a
commodity like rice or like wheat or
corn it's grown to be to be cheap and
that doesn't serve anybody doesn't serve
consumers who deserve and should crave
pleasure when they drink coffee not just
caffeine and it certainly doesn't serve
producers who historically have not made
much money in coffee
at least not in the last few decades as
a result of worldwide demand and the you
know and and the global thirst for cheap
coffee that's got to change because you
know it's it's not sustainable the way
that coffee had has been produced in the
past and unless we're able to change
that the world is in for worse and worse
and worse coffee and the millions and
millions of producers who depend on
coffee for their livelihoods have very
little hope so anyway I'm I'm here to
tell you that good things are on the way
coffee world is changing extremely fast
you know it's it's not quite on the
level of the changes that Google's
bringing about you know coffee takes
years to change whereas things you guys
are doing often takes days or weeks
why does it matter yes you know in an
economic sense coffee is one of the most
important products in the world the
number of people and economies who
depend on coffee for their their cash
income is is enormous there are over 70
countries in the world that produce
coffee many of them count on coffee as
one of the largest contributors to their
GDP and many many millions of families
worldwide are our growing coffee is
their sole source of cash income so it
matters a lot how we grow it and how we
consume it I'm gonna take you first
through a few little introduction I'll
try to be fast I didn't start my timer
here we go I got a free 15 minutes you
know see how I did that there's there's
many things that affect coffee quality
it's it's actually very hard to produce
high quality which aside from some of
the economic considerations is another
reason why most of the coffee that you
typically find in the world is terrible
tasting it's bitter sour just not
something nice it's there's a reason why
most people put a lot of sugar and cream
in their coffee it's because what
they're being served is it's gross the
quality of the tree let's start with
this coffee itself is it's the seed of a
fruit grows on a tree and there are many
many different botanic varieties of
coffee just like you have wine grapes
you've got Chardonnay and Sauvignon
Blanc and Merlot there's there's
hundreds of different coffee varieties
although only a couple dozen are in
active commercial cultivation the
environment the microclimate where the
coffee is growing has a huge effect the
same way it doesn't wine there's certain
Appalachians and coffee in areas that
have exactly the right climate
conditions to produce high-quality
the the way the farmer takes care of the
coffee the the way they provide
nutrients to it the way they manage the
shading and a pruning of the trees all
of this has
impact the way it's harvested is huge
the way it's processed and we'll get
into what processing means in a little
bit the way the logistics involved with
the import/export and movement of coffee
are huge we were just talking about that
earlier coffee is typically shipped
around the world on boats and it has to
spend time in places like Mombasa or dar
Salam that are very very hot and humid
and it's not the right place not a great
place for coffee to be it doesn't like
to be exposed to heat and humidity so
there's things that we have to do to
protect it on its journey roasting is an
incredibly complex chemical process I'll
get into a little bit of that later but
you can really you can very easily ruin
a coffee if you don't roast it right
it's not it's not possible to take a low
quality green coffee and turn it into a
beautiful delicious coffee through some
special magical roasting technique but
it is very easy to take a great coffee
and completely ruin it and then lastly
the way it's prepared you guys are gonna
have a chance to learn from some of our
our burstows later about extraction and
why extraction grind size water
temperature contact time dwell time flow
rate all these things have a big impact
on what sort of compounds insolubles
you're removing from the coffee grounds
and that end up in your drink and you
want to apply skill and craftsmanship to
bring the right compounds the delicious
ones out of the coffee and leave some of
the solubles that are not as good in the
grounds and there's quite a bit of
technique involved with that what's
interesting here these first three that
we're talking about the way the genetics
of the tree and the environments quality
can get better based on those those
factors in the last the last three it's
really our job as Roasters and as
baristas to preserve what's what's
intrinsic to the coffee we're not
necessarily adding
quality we're just making sure that it's
delivered all the way to your mouth
these things take these first steps I
mean they we're talking about centuries
and centuries of evolution now that
affects the coffee tree we're talking
about years when when we're talking
about cultivating coffee from the moment
that you plant a coffee seed it's about
four years until it starts to bear fruit
so it's quite a long process harvesting
happens over over periods of weeks or
months processing in days roasting in
minutes it takes about 11 to 14 minutes
to roast a coffee and the extraction
happens in a matter of seconds and so
you know when you look at this you
understand that all of this all of these
things have happened to make coffee
great and at the last moment and the
person who has it in their hands and is
brewing it can ruin it in Roone years
and years and years of development in
seconds it's why it's important to learn
bursts of skills I won't dwell on this
this is a little chart and I encourage
you if you're interested to look up
history of coffee it's as I said it was
born in in Ethiopia that area is where
coffee the only place on the world where
this particular Arabica species is
native everywhere it's grown today it's
been brought there and it was brought
originally to the Arab world and then
Dutch traders brought it to Indonesia
and it was cultivated there and then
eventually it made its way to the
Americas and now most of the coffee in
the world's produced in the Americas but
it was not native there this is a chart
that shows it's it's a lineage and how
it got tore is coffee
traditionally grows well under shade it
likes shaded environments it likes bio
diverse environments that's another
reason why encouraging great
high-quality coffee production is
important because it acts as a buffer to
deforestation
and development city development and and
shopping complexes and whatnot coffee
great coffee really needs this kind of
environment to thrive and for that
reason you know the more we drink and
and pay for great coffee the more we're
contributing to this kind of sustainable
farming where you've got habitats that
are extremely bio diverse and provide a
ton of habitat for migratory birds and
in all kinds of other wildlife this is
an example of a managed shade farm in
Nicaragua this is an example of an
environmental disaster and this is a
farm in Colombia and when I talk about
terrible coffees I'm typically talking
about stuff like this
which is grown on almost on an
industrial scale now you can see they've
cleared every last bit of forest there
you can stand on the top of this hill
and look around you 360 degrees and all
you see is coffee that is not
sustainable they need to put a ton of
synthetic fertilizer and and pesticide
in this too to allow it to grow like
this that the planting density is so
intense that it you know it's really
robbing the soil of its life and this is
not the kind of coffee that we want to
encourage this however is this here's my
friend Raul from what Tamala some of you
will probably in another two months
drink a coffee called la soledad from
what Amala from a patent and oh yeah
that's his coffee that's the la soledad
farm it's very well shaded there's good
space between the trees there's natural
forests throughout the farm it's a
beautiful place variety so when we
talked about about botanics
genetics we're talking about the type of
coffee tree and as I said it's just like
wine grapes you've got different types
kept why here's one here you see a
couple others cateura
geisha
you can see this one has purple leaves
it's called pepper essence that's one of
the first things that helps define what
a coffee's potential is and what its
character is gonna be like here you see
just a list these are just kind of a few
of the coffee varieties that are in
active widespread commercial cultivation
but there are probably thousands of
native varieties that are not still
unexplored that are in the wild forests
in western Ethiopia what's my favorite
one
well geisha isn't incredible it's
actually an Ethiopian transplant that
you know just started really being
cultivated in in the Americas in a
recent decade and it's I mean it's it's
so floral it's like jasmine and coffee
blossom and lime blossom and and
Mandarin and and lemongrass all rolled
into one
it's just an amazing amazing coffee but
typical and Borbon are considered
heirloom varieties they're they're not
hybrids a lot of what's being grown
today is hybrid coffee that's been
essentially bred in a laboratory and
bred to be resistant to different
plagues to be sun tolerant so there
there are varieties being grown there
where we're specifically crafted to be
able to withstand full Sun which is like
what you saw in that picture before
that's called about it at Columbia and
it's not very good it was bred to be
strong resistant highly productive Sun
tolerant drought resistant but it was
not bred to be great tasting SLE 28
another great one that's a Kenyan right
it's grown in Kenya this is a coffee
tree in full bloom coffee the seed once
it once the fruit begins to set takes
about nine months same as a human
pregnancy cycle to mature and become a
ripe cherry but the first step of that
is this flowering that happens after the
first rains of the year
arrived and it's you wouldn't believe if
you ever with a chance to be in a coffee
field when it's in full bloom the whole
area smells like sweet jasmine and
honeysuckle it's incredible incredible
stuff maybe you guys can find a way to
to bottle it someday for us so we can
you can carry it around with us now
these are the flowers wonderful stuff
this is these Brown things are were the
white flowers they only last a couple
days they fall off and every node where
there was a flower
will become a fruit here's a little
quick demonstration how did I make that
go so it goes from a little pinhead it
begins to expand those things growing in
the middle there are the seeds so the
seeds are forming eventually and this is
all happening again over about nine
months eventually they they harden and
they become more dense the endosperm
grows inside look at that anyway I don't
know how to speed that up but and then
let then you have to wait for the coffee
to ripen if you pick it while it's still
green it's like eating a banana that's
it's green it's it's dry astringent
doesn't that much sweetness doesn't have
much character it's extremely important
to allow coffee to fully mature and
ripen otherwise you know you lose a ton
of quality so let's move on there's a
picture of some beautiful red cherries
you can also see a few green ones in
that picture
that's why harvesting takes up to three
months is they have to return to the
field over and over and over again
because the cherries don't always ripen
at the same rate on the branch so you
have to just go out pick only the ripe
cherries leave the ones that are under
ripe or semi ripe on the tree for
another few weeks or months before
they're ready that
step of course introduces quite a bit of
added cost in the in the production of
these coffees because labor is typically
one of the largest costs in coffee
it grows in these forests in mountainous
areas and the tropics and you can't
outside of a few places in the world
where it grows on flatter plateaus you
really can't harvest it mechanically and
especially if you want to get perfect
ripeness it has to be selectively picked
which means it's a lot of people
spending a lot of time picking cherries
over a period of three months and if you
want to that's usually the farmers
biggest choices should the farmer does
the farmer pay more people to be out in
the field more time picking less cherry
less volume per day and that's sort of
the the economic the balance where they
have to find it's one of the reasons we
pay more for our coffees because we want
to give producers the resources and the
motivation to selectively pick Wow well
you know a whole tree a whole tree of
these cherries will only produce about a
kilo of coffee so now you're drinking
multiple trees then you can eliminate
20% because not all coffee is is great
even from the same tree in the same
branch it's amazing I calculated once I
drink somewhere between 30 and 40 trees
worth of coffee per year there's another
variety this is a yellow yellow Borbon
it's called here you can see it's a
great example a lot of what is practiced
in in farm on farms is called strip
picking where they just basically go in
here take everything off the branch
because it's cheap it's easy it's quick
but that results in a huge huge quality
loss
they they do some separation but a lot
of times it just gets mixed all together
and sold is on thing what the goal is to
labor is very high compared to other
producing countries so they strip pick
but then they kind of have this backside
intensive mechanized way of separating
under-ripe sand ripes if that's what
they want to do a lot of them will just
strip pick and then they really don't
care they don't need to sort it it's
gonna be sold on the open market or for
internal consumption at a decent price
anyway so ok so that what you're looking
there where is pointing that's what you
want you want actually those three three
or four there I'm gonna on the right
side those other ones are called team
donates in Spanish they're semi ripe
they'll introduce a stringency sourness
dryness thinness of body and the cup
there you don't want those in your
coffee but most of the coffee you drink
it's full of them
this is a very common there's actually
well above average in terms of quality
picking but you know far below what we
require for our coffees but in terms of
world standards this is this will be
considered way above average this is a
great picture because you can see here
very clearly that coffee on the right
would be a typical sort of commercial
level picking and the one on the left is
from a farm called malacara in El
Salvador that we work with the
difference is pretty profound and pretty
clear and it shows up very expressively
in the cup I could drink a cup of coffee
and tell you how well it was picked just
based on how it tastes this is the
target is what we're after but as I
mentioned to get this requires a lot
more labour and a lot more cost for the
farmer so to produce a better coffee
means spending more on its production
costs as a farm in El Salvador it's
doing a very good job yeah these are
there this is a Canales family in
Nicaragua there's another coffee that
you'll you'll have a chance to to drink
in a in about three months two to three
months it's called lost delirious
amazing farm in Segovia in western Nicky
and you can see here now these guys are
doing tremendous job one thing is you
were mentioning there is sometimes a
step in between picking and fermentation
where they'll sit down and sort manually
the coffees and pull out the greens or
the over ripes
you can see that picture there that's in
Colombia this is in Rwanda and that of
course also adds further cost because
you're paying people to just sit and
handpick the coffee so here we go we've
already told you this you don't need to
hear it again the long buddy okay so as
I mentioned you know coffees the seed of
the of the fruit so you see there a
cherry that's been split open each one
has two seeds that typically
accomplished with a manual de pulp or
with a mechanical do pulper there are
other ways to process coffee there's
actually three ways that are prevalent
one is called unwashed which happens a
lot in Yemen in western Ethiopia in in
parts of Brazil most of Brazil in Uganda
and in many other countries especially
where water resources are scarce but
coffee cherries picked and it's
essentially just dried picked put on the
patio and dried and shrivels up into a
little pod that that tends to emphasize
sweetness and body in the coffee but
it's also a highly volatile process it
tends to yield some unpleasant flavors
alongside with the good ones because
there's internal fermentation happening
in that in that cherry pod and it's very
hard to get a uniform result and it you
need really specific weather conditions
to to do it right it's not one of my
preferred methods but it can be it can
yield great coffees it's just very
difficult and risky for farmers there's
something in between washed and unwashed
called
or pulp natural this is where their
coffees pulped so that seeds are removed
from the cherry skin and then it's dried
like that so stride with with Musil edge
honey surrounding it but it's it doesn't
have its skin and that's a little bit
more easy to control than the fully
unwashed process and it can yield really
nice coffees especially for espresso a
lot of people use them cluding ourselves
for espresso and then there's washed
fully washed where the coffee is d
pulped and then it's fermented and I'll
show you some pictures of that in a
second and then it's washed again with
clean water and the result is a very
clean coffee this process tends to
really highlight the delicate qualities
and tastes in the coffee it tends to
emphasize acidity and brightness and
sweetness as well it's it's really it's
my preferred wave to do things most of
the coffee we buy is fully washed all
right don't need to dwell on that now
that's I just threw this in there
because it's a cool picture this is
Yemen and you see people drying coffee
up on up on their rooftops that's a very
traditional way to do things
we'll go ahead
yeah we have that info and our we have
it on our labels we have it on our
website so we have it on the info sheets
that you can find that accompanies
coffee but yeah we we we talk about when
we're selling a coffee we talk about its
altitude where it was grown we talked
about the variety the Botanic variety
the coffee we talked about the way it
was processed and also the the dates
when it was picked and as you'll see in
a minute that does have an impact that
is something important
here's Brazil is a very large operation
some coffee drying on the patio he was a
picture of honey coffee you can see
there's a sticky Musil edge on the
outside of the the parchment yeah
there's a good picture of it
it's a slimy me so it's actually really
really sweet so very tasty so here's the
wash process you cannot of ways to
remove the skin usually it's done with a
machine or a deep hole / it squeezes the
seeds out it's important to do it just
right and have it there kept the Machine
calibrated right because otherwise if it
pushes too much it can scrape the seed
inside and expose it to bacteria which
can cause off flavors or taints down the
road here's a very common - simple hand
Hand Crank be pulper this is this is
what to use most often in small-scale
production
small farmer small holder production
here's a disc pulper in Burundi another
one this is a is the traditional pulpers
that kind of use mostly in Latin America
now you can see what's coming out are
the are the seeds those cherries you see
are not full cherries they're just skins
and there's holes on this thing that'll
allow the seed to fall through but the
skins to go elsewhere skins are often
used then for compost
to create fertilizer that'll go back
into the farm
it really depends on their size you know
really small-scale farmers like in
Ethiopia typically don't have poppers
they'll bring their cherry to a central
facility to get pulped but most
producers in Latin America have some
have their own poppers and any large
size farm will have their own pulpers
okay we got this
there you go another picture of that
fermentation it's a very critical step
in the process after the pulping coffee
is put into a tank and it's allowed to
ferment for anywhere from 12 to 270
hours in some cases depending on the
climate and the intended result what
happens in that fermentation tank is
that there's enzymes that are breaking
down the Meuse illage and and basically
cleaning off the coffee that process is
critical because if it's not done well
enough you'll have remaining Musil aged
that can then be food for bacteria later
on when the coffee is drying and if you
do it too much you begin to create
alcohol create ethanol same same thing
that happens when you're making wine and
that can get really disgusting here's
some coffee sitting in you can ferment
coffee under water you can ferment it
with no water now you can use a hybrid
of the two
all right let's move along
here's a tank this is a very very
typical scene you see all this coffee
sitting there fermenting in the tank and
it'll be stirred should be stirred while
it's fermenting otherwise you get uneven
non uniform fermentation which again
there's another labor cost here's some
guys having fun in the fermentation tank
there's a you know most most tanks
around the world or our cement
sometimes would sometimes plastic bags
or buckets more and more people are
moving producers that are interested in
quality are moving towards ceramic tile
inside the tanks which makes them easier
to clean we most of the farms we work
with or now we've gotten them to convert
to this sort of a system there's also a
machine called a B Musa lodger which is
a way it sort of scrubs the coffee it's
a way to reduce the time needed for the
fermentation process and it's it's
actually very important technology
because it's helping to reduce the need
for water and in some areas most areas
these days water is a very precious and
the diminishing resource and so anything
that can reduce the amount of water
needed is as a benefit mm-hmm yes we
participate heavily in in working with
the farmers to introduce better
practices and we've invested a lot of
money over the years and that sort of
training in some cases pre financing in
some cases we've actually donated some
equipment let's see
am i doing on time here twenty six
that's what my 15 three minutes that I
stole all right let me speed up here I
want to leave some time for questions
and and some time for Kyle to talk to
you about espresso so there's some nice
pictures these are different washing
scenarios and I'm gonna just skip
through some stuff here we'll have time
at lunch to and doing question answers
if you want to if you want to talk more
about some of this stuff here's some
coffee drying drying is very important
how you dry it length of time that you
dry it has an impact on the coffee
flavor coffee taste preservation of
acidity all these things
these are raised beds is a very
traditional African way of drying and
it's actually in my opinion the best way
because it allows air to come up from
underneath these screens and you
actually get a more uniform drying
slower drying - and often you see the
shade Nets over the coffee they're
intentionally slowing down the the rate
of drying in order to to get a more
vibrant more lively cup and to protect
the coffee from overheating
it's another cost you know every time
you try to extend the length of time it
takes to do something it's another cost
these are some pyramids it's a drying
technique that's being experimented with
let's move along okay most coffee is in
the u.s. that your drink is washed but
not if you're buying really low grade
stuff which I hope you're not here's a
here's a very typical scene in Sumatra
and you can see this coffees really
getting uh exposed to a lot of stuff
car exhaust open sewers kids running
around on it chickens dogs and cats
sleeping on it and that kind of stuff
shows up in the cup you don't want that
this is coffee getting ruined because
it's being overexposed to heat and some
clean parchment here you see this is an
example of a good drying technique we've
built we did a project in Nicaragua to
provide a group of cooperative small
producers with these with all the
materials they needed to build these
things they help protect the coffee from
getting wet while it's drying and they
encourage a uniform slow drying I also
protect filtering the Sun a little bit
more pictures of that this is a floating
technique put the cherries in the tank
before you do pulp boom and the ones
that are are very light or don't have a
lot of density will float and you can
take them out and that's one step to
help improve the quality but again now
you've just lost volume so the more you
try to improve the quality
the more you're taking stuff out so
you're losing volume as a producer it's
another cost rwanda this is a picture of
rwanda well let me talk to you about
them just sick
let me bust through all this stuff here
sorry that we don't have more time I'd
love to what 15 more minutes
alright that's including him because he
needs to talk to oh we can go over by 15
minutes
sweet as long as you guys are having fun
you're not getting bored are you okay
that's good this we do a lot of we're
active in the scientific community to
research community we cooperate a lot
with with the grandmas and with
academics that are studying the impacts
of different fermentation methods drying
methods and whatnot this was a study
that we funded in Rwanda to improve the
cup quality see what the effects of
different fermentation styles but having
cup quality so here's an example you see
this pile of coffee that's all the clean
stuff that's been pulled out then all
those little piles are different defects
that have been taken out broken or
chipped beans that we got cracked during
the the milling the dry milling or being
sour beans or more beans that have have
burn have sunburn on them all kinds of
different defects are pulled out and
again that's that's losing volume so
it's you know if you want a farmer to
take all that stuff out you've got a Pam
to do it these are some women in Rwanda
hand sorting coffee so can you imagine
you know the best coffees in the world
they're sorted literally beam by beam it
takes a woman or a man about one full
day to sort through like 60 70 kilos of
coffee that's an extremely
labor-intensive process
avy beans in a 12 ounce cup of coffee
know one of the the important principles
in our approach to buying coffee which
we refer to as direct trade is that we
engage very closely with everybody
involved in the production of the coffee
from the workers on the farm farmers
themselves workers in the mills and we
we we spend a lot of time training and
teaching people about ways that they can
improve their coffee and thus improve
its at its quality and by doing so
improve its value so they can get more
money for their coffees this is an
electronic sorting machine like a little
laser beam reads the color of the coffee
and it's set for a certain parameter so
if it has a slightly different color it
gets you ejected from the stream there's
a close-up picture that that little
blurry line is actually coffee beans
traveling at high velocity through the
scanner this is an example of a cupping
cupping is the protocol that we use in
the industry to evaluate coffee quality
we cup sometimes as many is there's 80
coffees in a day yeah we cup thousands
of coffees in a year and that's it's one
of the principles that we apply to to
our buying practices you know most
coffee is sold sort of as a unit that
bulk unit so if you typically buy a
coffee you get a sample and it
represents you know 250 bags worth or
40,000 pounds of coffee we instead of
accepting that we break it down into
individual Lots or batches meaning that
the coffee we cup units as small as
sometimes 50 pounds at a time in order
to put together 40,000 pound container
with a coffee so it's a very intensive
process on our end of going through with
a fine-tooth comb all of the coffee
samples from a particular harvest day by
day by day by day and only pulling out
the very best ones to bring to the US
good enough this is a roasting machine
is very typical roasting machine
typically it's this is what's called a
drum roaster there's a big drum inside
there
that's revolving and you're roasting the
coffee at temperatures of up to about
430 degrees and then you're cooling them
off in this tray a lot of chemistry
involved with coffee but I'm not going
to get into it but one thing that is
this first line here sucrose you all
know what sucrose is responsible for
sweetness and coffee among other things
and when you roast coffee very light you
still preserve some of the sucrose when
you roast it really dark you destroy it
that's the reason why one of the reasons
why dark coffe darkly roasted coffees
are are not as sweet as lighter roasted
coffees and sweetness is a critical
critical critical part of quality like
imagine if you have a lemon you know you
just take a bite out of it it's not
always that pleasant but you sweeten it
a little bit and to balance the the
acids and it's beautiful a really well
grown well picked well processed coffee
has a lot of natural sweetness so you
don't need to put sugar in it to make it
sweet it's already sweet by itself so I
always recommend if you try a coffee
before you do anything to it first taste
it and see if it's sweet if it's sweet
you probably don't want to put extra
sugar in it a lot of people do it out of
habit just throw stuff in there but you
know find coffees like a fine single
malt scotch or something can you imagine
ordering a beautiful scotch and then
throwing some milk and sugar in it you
wouldn't want to do that these are some
things that happen with roasting when I
have time so I want stick on them a few
things I want to make clear some terms
that you might hear in the coffee world
where you surf in the net
direct trade it's a term that we
introduced about maybe 2003
and it was simply at the time it was a
set of principles that describe the way
the approach we took to buying and
roasting and selling coffee and it
specifically referred to the fact that
we we don't use all these intermediaries
with our coffee we go straight we travel
I travel about eight months of the year
to go spend time on the farms work
directly with the farmers negotiate
directly with the farmers one of the
problems historically in the industry is
a lack of transparency there often are
the coffee can often change hands many
many many times before it actually gets
to a roaster and every time you know
somebody's taking a little bit out and
what happens in those cases is the the
farmers usually the one left with the
shortest stick and that's not a recipe
for sustainability it's not a recipe for
quality because if the farmer is not
making enough money to invest their own
resources and making a copy better you
know you end up with with crappy coffee
micro lot we use that to refer to a
single batch of coffee that was picked
harvested fermented de pulped and
fermented on the same day so as I said
you know a coffee harvest might last for
three months so over those three months
you'll have nine be individual micro
lots and will cup each one separately
rape them evaluate their individual
qualities even from the same farm same
trees same climate you'll get a range of
quality because of the different
environmental conditions climate
conditions during the specific day or
week that it was picked and processed
the specific altitude on the farm and
the length of time it spends on the
branch typically the the coffees picked
in the very beginning of the harvest
don't have as much quality as the ones
picked at the peak because they've been
on the branch for less time had less
time to develop and mature in season
this is important thing coffee's not
like Cheerios or Twinkies it's not
something that you can you can just sit
on a show
for a year and expect to taste the same
as it did when you first put it there
coffee is very perishable it's a fruit
as the seed of a fruit organic product
it it it degrades over time and there's
a reason why we talk a lot about in
season we want to encourage people to
pay attention to win the coffee's
harvested that's why we put it on our
bags so they could know how fresh the
coffee is generally we say you should
always try to consume a coffee within a
green coffee that we're not talking
about roasted coffees talked about they
could be raw green coffee it has about a
nine month lifespan before it really
falls off the cliff and ideally you're
drinking it within a few months of
harvest so you don't want to drink a
Costa Rican coffee in January for
example because it was harvested if
you're drinking in January it probably
means it was harvested a full year ago
and it's already lost a lot of quality
that's the steam go ahead post roast
becomes even more perishable then yeah
we you know about seven days after that
roast date is when you can first start
to detect signs of diminished quality
the things the first thing to go is
aroma and the second thing to go tends
to be the acidity so you know most
coffees if they're stored well you can
you know you can still drink them and
and get 99% of what you should be
getting for up to two weeks but ideally
we recommend you know buy as much as you
need for a week and that's it and then
go get some freshly roasted stuff post
grinding oh you know that now you're
talking about minutes literally
maybe grind it exposing it a lot of
surface area to to oxygen and the
oxidant oxygenation process goes fast
you could grind the coffee and I mean
you could try this at home grind it
smell it wait five minutes smell it
again wait 10 minutes and smell it again
you'll see it
a lot of a lot of the aromas go away
very quickly so buying pre-ground coffee
is a horrible horrible idea
because you've already lost about half
of the quality just because it's been
pre ground let's move on just a couple
things some of the goals of direct trade
as we as as we conceive it are to engage
with producers to actually participate
in process control and introducing
better technique and a methodology at
farms and transparency and traceability
it's critical critical critical if a
farmer is not you know we look at
farmers as our our partners in coffee
not as vendors or suppliers and we need
them to do great work in order for us to
have great coffees to sell and they need
us to be out here educating consumers
and advancing the value of coffee the
perceived value of coffee getting people
to understand what it's really worth
so that they can in turn get paid what
they should be getting paid we use we're
also very much interested in looking at
how the system is working on a farm one
of the biggest sources of pollution in
coffee farming is wastewater which is
oftentimes just dumped into river
systems dumped into soil so the farms we
work with we make sure that they're
segregating the water after the
fermentation and they they're treating
it with lime and putting it in
sedimentation tanks and and filtering it
so that what they're releasing back near
the environment is clean and actually
then they can take the other stuff they
pulled out and put it into their compost
and reuse it as fertilizer and of course
the the one of the main and primary
goals of direct trade is to get better
coffee and that's what got us started in
this in the first place when we when we
began in 1995 we were buying coffee the
same way everybody else does we call up
the importer there's there's dozens of
importers traders some are
multinationals some are more local but
they buy and sell coffee
buy it from exporters sell it to
Roasters and we'd call them up and say
hey man what kind of what a mile as you
got this week yeah I've got these three
Guatemala's say okay I'll take that one
and you know it's very limiting you say
your choices are limited whatever
somebody else happen to buy and then
there's selling offering to you you
don't have any any ability to affect the
way it was produced so we got very
frustrated with that that's what drove
us to go to origin and start working
with farmers is to actually play an
active role in making quality better
some components tiered pricing systems
that that really are specifically tied
to the quality so as the quality gets
better the price can rise in sync with
that use of transparency contracts where
the farmer gets to see exactly what
everybody else is making and get to see
what the exporters making what the
Millers making and they can see that
they're getting the lion's share of the
coffee we trace our coffee all the way
to the farm gate whereas most coffee is
not not traceable like that you know
most coffee you'd buy off the shelf you
have no idea what the producer made and
the roaster who sold it to you has no
idea what the farmer actually made we do
other stuff let's go I'm uh I don't want
to steal Kyle's time I think I already
have a little bit it is expensive to do
direct trade I mean we have a whole
staff of people just involved with
quality control we have a big staff of
very well trained Roasters and then we
have our buying team which includes Kyle
myself and to others who spend at you
know most of us spend at least a third
of our year traveling around visiting
all these farms and I'm working with the
farmers I do a lot of education Rwanda
is just this is one of the last things
I'll leave you with the the profound
effect that introducing coffee quality
can have on a large number of people
Rwanda before 2001 was not producing a
single bean of specialty grade coffee
there's there
in coffee but it was it was terrible
quality it was being sold as as like
blender coffee at a extremely low price
below the actual cost of production and
being mixed into blends by you know your
favorite multinational Roasters and you
know nobody was benefiting from coffee
at the time but there was a big project
funded by USAID the Borlaug Institute
Texas A&amp;amp;M and we were we participated a
lot in this over a period of five years
to go into Rwanda teach farmers how to
wash their coffees introduce modern
technique quality quality based
technique and methodologies give
producers the infrastructure built all
these washing stations in Rwanda or
gonna help organize farmers into
cooperative groups and put in place all
the systems needed to produce a great
coffee today Rwandan coffee is is a hot
hot coffee in the world of specialty in
just a few you know the space of maybe
five or six years it went from being
junk with no value to being a highly
coveted specialty coffee meaning that
the the price the producers were getting
per pound effectively more than
quintupled just because of this work and
the GDP of Rwanda as a nation it has
grown like I think more than more than
20 percent in the last the last decade
and a large chunk of their income is
coffee related so I mean you can see
that that that devoting time and making
commitments to quality and coffee not it
doesn't just get us as consumers a
better tasting drink it actually
provides a meaningful livelihood to to
huge numbers of people across the world
here's an example of a transparency
contract I won't spend a lot of time
because we're out of time
this is an example of how we break
coffees down into qualities normally all
these coffees here all these different
producers all their coffee just be mixed
and sold as one thing we break it down
farmer by farmer and then by each farmer
we break apart all their individual Lots
it means a lot of cupping a lot of
tasting a lot of sorting but the result
is a incredibly tasty coffee there's
some farmers in Papua New Guinea this is
a you know something when we talk about
seasonality you can kind of look at
where a coffee-producing countries
located relatively to the equator and
get an idea of when their harvest season
is the the places down here tend to
harvest like in May June July and the
place is up here tend to harvest more in
November December January
so generally northern hemisphere coffees
you want to drink them in the spring and
summer and fall southern hemisphere
coffees in the winter and the early
spring and I think that's just about it
relationships important cleaning your
water it's important making sure farmers
get paid right it's very important
Coffee is really as I said it's one of
the most complex beverages known to man
producing coffees a great coffee truly
great coffee is very very hard to do
there's so many things that can go wrong
and usually do but still people are
reluctant to pay for coffee we have a
consuming culture that is has been
weaned on diner
you know 50-cent bottomless refill diner
coffee they don't know that coffee can
be a culinary delight they don't know
anything about how it was produced and
they don't know that you know by
drinking that kind of coffee you're
supporting a very unsustainable method
of coffee production and people often go
into the 7-eleven and buy a red bull or
a or a can of coke and pay $2 or $3 not
blink but he asked him to pay $3
a cup of coffee and they look at you
like you're crazy and you know despite
as you've seen all the work that has to
go into the coffee coffee is also an
incredibly healthful drink more and more
now if you start to Google coffee and
health you'll start to find studies that
are demonstrating coffee is powerful
antioxidants more antioxidants than tea
it's got polyphenols that are
anti-cancer have anti-cancer process
characteristics they there's a some
recent studies that show coffee is
probably the most effective known
preventive for Alzheimer's disease for
Parkinson's disease men who drink at
least four cups of coffee a day have a
30% lower chance of getting prostate
cancer you know coffee is actually a
it's kind of a miracle health drink and
I was just at an ASIC scientific
conference in Indonesia last year where
they spent a whole day talking about
coffee and health presenting the latest
research and the the closing statement
by the doctor who was presenting was
that coffee within the next decade will
come to know coffee not just as a health
drink but probably the health drink
thank you very much hi everybody I'm
Kyle my talk is gonna be far less in
depth than Jeff's because actually the
the major principles of what I'm gonna
talk about are gonna continue with some
hands-on training after lunch you guys
gonna get your paws on those delicious
new GS threes that you have which is as
good as any machine sitting on any
intelligentsia bar you're incredibly
lucky to have that but I just wanted to
talk a little bit about espresso and
sort of how intelligentsia fits into the
context of espresso how we approach it
what we think is important and all of
that I think it's important to know that
espresso coffee in some form that we
understand it today
has existed for about a hundred and ten
years it really in 1901 is when
mechanized espresso machines were born
and for all of the hundred years that
followed basically the approach to
espresso has stayed largely the same
which is to create something that always
tastes the same it always tastes like
chocolate pretty much or sort of heavy
dark intense punch in the mouth kind of
experience and this is understandable
because espresso coffee for much of yeah
what's the difference between espresso
our egg Euler copy what makes espresso
espresso and yeah so espresso is is two
things espresso is a process for brewing
coffee and it's also a beverage so and
and a liquid espresso is usually defined
as around an ounce per single shot
concentrated but you want to know about
espresso blends know about the beans
what makes it bean an espresso bean its
coffee is it different from regular
you know okay so I can use like
intelligence your regular drip coffee
for espresso yeah but so this will be
good for the QA I think but yeah so we
blend espresso to a certain profile so
we use coffees like for the black cat
classic which i think is a coffee that
you guys are gonna use a lot around here
for that we blend to sort of low acidity
and it's a combination of the coffee's
that we buy and how we profile the roast
so we buy coffees the the black cat the
majority of it is is coffees from Brazil
and Brazil Brazilian coffees are
typically processed either in the
natural way or the unwashed way the Jeff
about or the pulps natural horror honey
process that Jeff talked about and what
this yields is an extremely sort of low
acidity hi sweetness heavy body which is
very suitable for what people expect
from an espresso so blackhat is is
pretty much always 80% coffees like that
from Brazil and 20% something washed
something a little bit more acidic to
bring some you know balance and and you
know interesting complexity into the mix
but like a chocolate-covered espresso
bean is a probably a dark roasted coffee
bean covered with this with chocolate
espresso beans are that's just that's a
something that somebody made up some
time but there's it's not like a
different kind of plant or something
like that yeah good question very good
question but in the in the last 10 years
in coinciding with the sort of
prominence of direct trade really
espresso and and and I'm I'm gonna make
a bold statement and I'm sorry if
there's people watching in other
countries I'm gonna say that this has
been led in the u.s. largely but
approaching espresso not just as this
sort of condensed liqueur that is always
supposed to taste the same but actually
as a sort of way of brewing any coffee
that you want to brew that reveals sort
of different sides of it and you know it
was that premise that espresso is is
flexible and interesting and dynamic
that led Intelligencia to sort of give
birth to this project called the black
cap project and the black cap project
essentially applies a lot of the direct
trade purchasing criteria principles of
collaboration things like that to -
espresso which had never really been
done before still is not really widely
practiced
so we have at any given time in our
lineup between three and six different
espressos with various single origins so
you know you can have a Kenya that is
specifically sort of roasted for an
espresso or a seasonal blend that uses
in season coffees that are sort of
directly traded for for espresso and
yeah I'm already out of time
no I can keep going okay cool well I
kind of came around to my conclusion but
I guess do you guys have any questions
about espresso or about black hat or
anything like that
yes when you're putting together blends
other than sort of the the body the the
sort of typical Brazilian thing right
but what do you guys look for and how
strange
have you gotten with that well you know
if we're putting together sort of an
outlier blend one that we have right now
is called the honey badger and the honey
badger was constructed because we had
this really exciting Kenya and I really
liked it as espresso but I recognized
fully that the Kenya on its own was not
balanced but it needed something else so
you know much like a sort of you know
wines from certain Appalachians that
carry certain designations there's an
expectation that you know one primary
varietal be blended with a little bit of
something something else to give it some
balance so this Kenya which is from the
Kengo Cho factory washing station it it
was searingly bright on its own like
tooth enamel removing brightness and so
that wasn't appealing but what sort of
you know some of the interesting acidity
was so we brought in some more sort of
base heavy
chocolatey coffees to complement it and
just
just you know bring it back from
searingly bright into the realm of you
know very very interesting but also very
intense so and then we named it after a
really mean animal because it's intense
yeah good right here what's your process
for decaffeinated coffee and does it
lose a lot of the flavor and what do you
guys do decaffeinated coffee loses yeah
you lose a lot in that process and I've
actually never seen it with my own eyes
but we typically use the water process
and Jeff can probably the most
traditional and most common pressed
process used for decaffeination uses a
it's called a solvent based these
chemical solutions of things with with
nasty sounding names like methylene
chloride which bond with the caffeine
they take the coffee beans they steam
them to open them up they throw them
into a solution of methylene chloride
which bonds with the caffeine molecules
and then they they rinse it out anytime
flush it out and then read rai the
coffee and it's and it's the caffeine is
removed but that leaves a it alters the
chemistry of the coffee a little bit and
there's a certain taste associated with
that another one is sometimes called the
natural process it's also a solvent
called ethyl acetate which is something
you find in bananas it's a
naturally-occurring a compound which is
why they call it the natural process but
it also does give you some sort of
additional taste and then there's the
water process which is increasingly
becoming more more common that's what we
usually use and in that process there's
it's basically osmosis the they take a
pool of water they they soak some coffee
beans in there and just naturally over
time molecules and compounds migrate out
of the coffee and into the water flow
our compounds and caffeine they repeat
the process several times and then they
filter that solution through carbon
filters that are cut to be the same
shape and size of the caffeine molecules
so when they go through there the carbon
filters capture the caffeine and then
they run that solution through those
filters enough times to where they the
solution then at the end has no caffeine
but it's saturated with these flavor
compounds so then they'll take they'll
throw away the coffee they use in that
batch of flavor charged solution is what
they use to decaffeinate the next batch
of coffee they'll throw it in there
caffeine migrates out but the the flavor
compounds can't migrate out because it's
already the water is already saturated
with them and then they'll read rye the
coffee and they can use they recapture
that caffeine and sell it to sort of
soft drink companies and whatnot but you
know you can use you can get really nice
tasting B caps the problem the reason
that there's so many bad ones is usually
people use the leftover coffees like the
lower grades that didn't have a lot of
export value those are what gets sent to
Germany and decaffeinated and so usually
you're not used most companies aren't
using their best coffees for decaf but
we take the same coffees that we buy for
regular will will take them send them to
be decaffeinated and you can get a great
tasting decaf but it will be a little
bit less intense than the caffeinated
version are there other any general
coffee questions or questions about
anything I've talked about Ã©lisa Ã©lisa
where do we send them to be
decaffeinated was the question to Mexico
maximum there's a couple plants that
there's a place in in Veracruz Mexico
that we use to do most of our
decaffeination we've also done it in
Vancouver there's a company up there
called Swiss water that has a
decaffeination plant there's one in
Quebec called Cusack
there's now one in Texas actually but
typically we do it in Mexico yes sir
yeah yeah right
I'll repeat the questions how do you
know which single origin coffee is to
try for as espresso well I think it's
it's sort of trial and error to begin
with a lot of people sort of develop
their own preferences there are lots of
baristas just like you know in beer you
know there's there's like these people
who are just incredibly into hops and
like no amount of hops could be too much
hops for these people and and there
certainly are plenty of baristas at home
or or and in the profession that you
know love acidity like there could not
be too much acidity so a high grown high
acidity you know single origin wash
coffee that's lightly roasted from like
Kenya or Yirgacheffe a which is Ethiopia
or something like that might be exactly
what the doctor ordered for this type of
person whereas for the home user or for
somebody who's just doesn't prefer that
you know they might prefer like
generally like if if you get a clean
Brazil that's gonna be an extremely
balanced sort of low acidity profile
nicaragua's Bolivia's Rwanda I think
I'll make wonderful espressos and a lot
of Roasters now and increasingly so
they're actually identifying coffees
specifically as a single origin espresso
and labeling it as such and and roasting
it to sort of enhance that and we do we
do that as it comes along
as we
and those coffees that we feel need a
little bit of encouragement in the
roaster to to you know potentially be a
great single version espresso but for
you at home it's kind of like experiment
and decide what you like I guess or here
I guess yeah so watching a couple of
verses outside and there was a guy
basically measuring the grounds to the
very gram and measuring the amount of
the length of the bloom time to the very
second how much time do you have or how
much flexibility after innovation and
experimentation and does that only come
in early on in the development of the
growing process are you talking about
you saying about in the brewing or just
overall and the whole thing just overall
with that amount of quality control it
seems like everything is very strictly I
guess regulated or done well it is you
know so in in that case like when you're
actually brewing coffee you know it's
like if you land on something that you
like because we we don't get to QC every
cup before we hand it out to a customer
so we implement like some kind of metric
so that we can continue to repeat you
know the thing that we like but as far
as like in the entire seed to cup chain
of coffee it's so expansive we are
essentially and I think Jeff would agree
with me we are in diapers like we don't
even know what the potential is and and
something else that's that's pretty
amazing is a couple years ago we started
to host this event called the
extraordinary coffee workshop and at
first we hosted it in Columbia and last
year we Club hosted it in El Salvador
and we brought together direct trade
partner farmers from all over the world
Kenya you know El Salvador Brazil
Bolivia all over the world into one
place to talk about what they do and you
know all of them at some point had a
moment where they were looking at
somebody else say you really honestly do
that whatever it was because there's
colloquial sort of ways to produce
coffee and
haven't made it outside of these little
tiny towns I mean when Jeff described
the wash process and pulp natural and
natural that was like you know very very
general but everywhere you go you
encounter and it's like very different
methods and there's always something
sort of new or interesting happening in
producing in coffee brewing I mean even
sort of the wide adoption of those
Japanese ceramic cones that we were
using out there is that's an incredibly
recent phenomenon and machines are
changing all the time and baristas are
talking online all the time and and it's
actually kind of like breakneck speed
how quick things are changing so at
least that's what it feels being in the
industry because we have to keep
redesigning our coffee bars every six
months so the short answer is that yeah
there's a tremendous amount of room for
for innovation still I mean we're still
a long way to go to get all this figured
out well the thing about coffee which is
kind of sad despite being such an
important global commodity and despite
being such an amazingly complex beverage
the amount of research that's been put
into coffee is tiny compared to like
corn or something and part of that is
because coffees not grown in in
developed countries typically you know
so us research dollars or European
research dollars aren't really going in
the coffee they're gone into soybeans
and corn and wheat and whatever there's
a big need for more research and coffee
and there's so many variables I mean so
many little tiny variables including
like what kind of microorganisms and
bacteria are in the air in the place
where the coffee is being fermented they
get into the water in effect the effect
the fermentation process you know
something a lot of things you can
control and then a lot of things that
you can't you know like the weather you
can't control that really so or at least
not yet maybe Google will figure that
one out
but there's yeah there's there's a lot
of work to be done
definitely I have a question about
acidity you talked about sweating
but I have a preference for highly
acidic coffees both his preso and drip I
was wondering if you can talk maybe like
how do you get this does that come with
the bean is that does that get lost in
the roasting process what country's
acidity comes from yeah definitely
acidity is something that's present in
the green coffee and there are there are
dozens of acids that contribute to the
overall profile the most dominant tend
to be there's one called chlorogenic
acid which actually this explains why if
you take a cup of coffee or pot of
coffee and really leave it sitting for
like 20 minutes
it gets more sour that's because the
chlorogenic acid breaks down at room
temperature in terms and acquainting
acid which is a sour it's what you find
in tonic water it's a sour acid so
that's one of the reasons why you never
want to leave your coffee sitting on
heat because that accelerates that
process and after five minutes you'll
degrade the chlorogenic acid and turn it
into sour Clinic acid but citric acid is
one of the most important and as I
mentioned before
malic acid acetic acid tartaric acid
lactic acid all of these contribute to
coffee and the the amount the quantity
of acid that's in the coffee depends on
a lot of things it depends on the the
Botanic variety of the coffee the
genetics of the coffee tree some
varieties produce more acidic seeds
other varieties do not the other thing
that affects that is the climate so
generally when you have climates or
growing conditions where there's a big
range of temperatures between the
nighttime and daytime temperatures we
have warm days and very cool nights
that's the perfect environment to
develop more acids because it affects
the metabolism of the of the tree and it
also means that the cherries take longer
to mature so they spend more time
connected to the tree and they're
developing more organic acids that whole
time that they're on that tree so
generally speaking
he's grown at higher altitudes where
it's cooler at night we'll have a longer
maturation cycle and they'll have more
acids than a coffee that's grown at the
low elevation the other piece is
processing there's certain the washed
process tends to really really emphasize
the acidity and really bring it out
preserve it whereas the natural process
where the coffee is dried inside the
seed tends to diminish the acids that
are present in the raw green coffee bean
and then roasting you can destroy a lot
of acids if we roast extremely dark you
you degrade the acids too and then also
with brewing if you brew with water it's
too cold you want to extract enough of
the acid so you need to have the water
at the right temperature so basically
the answer is all of those things
contribute the the the genetics of the
tree the climate in which it's grown the
way in which it's processed the way in
which it's roasted and the way in which
is brewed all have an impact then and
determining determining how much acidity
will be left in your cup and you know if
you hear an acidity lover which I am too
Kenyan coffees are typically some of the
brightest out there really high grown
Central American coffees tend to have a
lot of acidity Indonesian coffees tend
to have less acidity because of the way
they're processed more than anything
Brazilian coffees tend to have less
acidity so yeah yes sir on that note
what do you what's your opinion of cold
brewing because you said that you know
oh the after you grind you know holdout
asking everything will take place in a
matter of seconds even so you know if
you leave that brewing for 12 hours of
time what's your pain oh I'm not
personally the question was are you got
it cuz he had the mic right you got the
question personally I'm not a fan of
cold brewing for those reasons because
disagree but he likes it
many people like it some don't you know
it's one of the things that's great
about coffee is there's not you know
there's there's room for personal
preference and personal tastes you know
some people love acidic coffee some
people love softer milder coffees but
yeah I mean personally I'm not a fan of
cold brewed coffee and my friend here
kayo likes it a lot
I think the cold brew coffee emphasizes
sweetness and acidity pretty effectively
actually and Wow he said he said yeah we
were gonna do a column where cuz he Jeff
doesn't like espresso either so that
gives you some context no I actually
love cold brew and you know I think that
the the cold and long extraction is kind
of interesting I don't think that you
lose anything necessarily because it's
suspended in water and there's not like
you're not getting like this any sort of
abnormal amount of you know gases sort
of driving out that would normally give
you aroma or something so it's it's it's
good it's I mean it's actually actively
extracting the whole time just very
slowly as opposed to just ground coffee
that's sitting there losing all of its
aroma a friend of mine sort of you know
gave me a really good way to communicate
that he's like you know when you first
grind coffee and it smells so awesome
and you're like oh it smells so good
well that's like actually the aromatics
just fleeing you know at breakneck pace
like grunt like brew now so yeah anyways
so you talked before about Rwanda or I
guess in general these these processes
are very difficult it requires a lot
more attention and so it's a lot more
difficult to I guess for you guys to
scale so I'm wondering from but you also
said that Rwanda had increased their GDP
based on a lot of these changes so I'm
wondering from your end are can you guys
scale this and also from the farmers and
are there other companies like
intelligentsia that are stepping in
there saying hey we want more coffee
we'll pay you
more money you know pushing farmers to
actually start caring about these things
yeah there's I mean there's a quiet
revolution happening right now in the
world of coffee and and it's happening
fast I mean ten years ago there were not
many companies at all doing what we're
doing in fact I would I would venture
Dussehra there were zero today there
there are quite a few more and a lot
that are just starting and in the new
generation of coffee companies have been
introduced to coffee in the last 10
years and and they've learned you know
from from some of the companies like
ourselves that are have been ever been
at this for a long time and so the new
generation of Coffee Roasters are are
coming up in this new environment where
they do care about the conditions on the
farms and they do understand that
quality is is the target that it that's
the thing that can differentiate coffees
and make them more valuable so yeah it's
it's it's definitely catching on but
there's still a long way to go I mean
it's still a niche at this moment you
know there's there's a handful of
companies worldwide that are extremely
active but but it's still a small
minority right now I think in in another
10 years it'll it'll be even more a
larger percentage in terms of scaling I
would say there is a limit I mean we
couldn't scale infinitely I think you
reach the size of a company like
Starbucks or something the volume that
you're doing it's so large that you know
you lose a little bit of control just by
necessity because the the volume you
have to go through is so vast that you
you know it's harder to pay attention to
the smallest details and then he laughs
cuz you're you're cupping a coffee to
select it you know and and that coffee
is is you know whole container 40,000
40,000 pounds of coffee might be
consumed in a single day or in a matter
of hours in the within a company that
size
so it's very hard to pay attention to
those details for us you know I feel
like we could easily be about five times
our size and still without losing a
thing but it means continuing to invest
in more infrastructure for farmers you
know they can continue to scale but it's
a slow process they can't do it
overnight and there's a limited amount
of land area that's that's optimal for
high quality coffee and it's actually
shrinking you know that land area is
shrinking due to climate change or due
to to higher average temperatures and
some of these growing areas it's also
shrinking due to commercial development
like places like Costa Rica which used
to grow a lot of coffee you know their
production is is decreasing every year
because the land that was being used for
coffee growth is now being converted
into real estate development and and
commercial other commercial uses so yeah
I mean there's a limit it's not infinite
but there are I mean there's countries
like Peru that still have a huge amount
of perfect growing conditions to where
coffee can be planted in the future so
my question so where you when you're on
the road and you can make your own cup
of coffee and you feel like having a
coffee where do you go no you can always
make your own cup of coffee you take it
with you bring the kit you bring a
little kit with you and you make hand
grinder Hario v60 cone you know a little
carafe and you know if you could fit it
like a kettle like a pouring kettle ya
can't access clean water or it can't
access any any electricity to heat
anything now sometimes just bring a
little bag of beans and just eat them
like like granola or something yeah I
mean and another really important thing
I mean generally the consuming habits in
producing countries is really really
a not-so-great like in terms of the
quality that is considered acceptable
and coffee is actually exactly the
opposite from tea in that regard tea
producing nations consume their best
stuff export their worst coffee
producing nations export their best
stuff and consume their worst internal
consumption is actually like something
like if if Jeff is you know cupping
coffees with a few producers and you
know talking about it
you know you might point to a coffee and
say like you know internal internal
consumption and you know that would be
something that was just abysmal e bad so
unfortunately that's and and but in
Brazil actually I think in and probably
a few other countries there's a big push
to make you know what's available inside
the country great so that people will
get excited about it and want to produce
more great coffees I think so
actually the barista competitions that
are taking place now every year more
countries start participating you could
get Google WBC world Barista
Championship and learn a lot about it
that's actually become a huge vehicle
for promoting understanding about better
consuming habits and and what better
coffee what quality means in coffee in
countries that are producing it
they actually have back there mr. Mike
Phillips he's the current reigning world
Barista Champion he well and he won in
London and Percy Percy was a finalist in
the Guatemala Guatemala and Kyle who won
the US National Championship a couple of
years ago but yeah it's one of the Nick
it is one of the saddest saddest Nick
has really nice hair saddest things that
you'll see is you know you go to a place
like like what the mala Colombia you
know you're sitting there in this
pristine area beautiful natural forests
and you've got some of the most
incredible coffees in the world growing
around you and and then what people are
drinking that are living right there
they're drinking packets of soluble
Nazca
that's okay scratch your head and say
man you know you're surrounded by some
of the most astonishing coffees in the
world and you're drinking like the the
worst they can get your hands up yeah
and the vast majority of producers have
never tasted their own coffee vast
majority that means we'll have to pay
more for it'll be competing with us
fight which is already happening if the
the if you look up the global coffee
prices you'll see that we just hit a
34-year record high and it's part of the
reason is is decreasing production part
of the reason is countries like Asia or
continents like Asia and countries like
China and India starting to consume more
coffee
and places like Brazil consuming their
own coffee means there's less to go
around and and coffee is now getting
more and more expensive which is another
reason why it's critical that we're able
to teach people you know what the real
value of coffee is why they should be
willing to pay more for it than they're
used to and and what they're getting out
of it when they when they pay more
another question can you get can you
give a quick overview on what we should
what we should be doing at home
to make a solid cup of drip coffee I
mean I know this this v60 thing I mean
his orders are yes I know the process is
probably very complex but its reversed
at a high level I don't know how you
guys feel about iPhones because I know
you have your own thing but we have an
iPhone application that hopefully will
launch on Android pretty soon that deep
breaks down step by step like a number
of different brewing processes I think
you know a couple of keys are to pay
close attention to the ratio of water
and coffee make sure you have a burr
grinder make sure that is like that is
the essential piece of coffee equipment
componentry don't go for the DeLonghi
thirty dollar burr grinder go for the
capresso $100 burr grinder don't go for
the 300 dollar electric trip brewer that
says good morning and tells you what the
weather is and makes reminds you to get
to your flight you know use the little
ceramic Hari o cone I think you know if
you spend one hundred and fifty dollars
on gear you will have like a great setup
but pay attention to coffee and water
ratios use a burr grinder right before
you brew it and fresh clean awesome
water that is not too hard yeah that's
that's the second time that's been asked
today
well freezing coffee does slow down the
sort of staling reactions that are
happening you want to make sure that not
only is it air tight but that you've
evacuated most of the air out of
whatever the bag is that you're using
and and then yeah you can hold the
coffee for like for longer but it's not
gonna it's not just gonna hold it's not
actually frozen in its current state it
continues to degrade I think you know we
we just we don't really think of coffee
that way we think of it as being a thing
that you get every week and then you
drink it like throughout the course of
the week and then you get more and you
drink it throughout the course of the
week and you know by and large you know
our experiences empirically are that you
know we like fresh roasted coffee and
you know straight out straight out of
the bag
fresh ground tastes good and it's also
exciting to go from one thing to the
next as you know lineups change so yeah
you can slow down the staling process by
freezing coffee but I think people
forget about it and I mean I was talking
about you know every Christmas when I
returned home to my mother's house I
find last Christmases you know gifted
coffee and that's just too long for
something to be frozen so hey last
question I think we got a wrap right
where we can talk over lunch all right
well for the worldwide viewers of Google
thanks for watching thanks for paying
attention I hope I hope you you are
ready to devote yourselves now to
quality and coffee and and I thank you
very much for your map programs because
I just moved to LA and without them I'd
be so lost I couldn't get anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
