Google um and I love the ferment here
they sense that everything is experiment
because um certainly in the realms that
we're all in everything henceforth is an
experiment when I'm going to be teaching
students at Pace University it's all
going to be kool earning because you
know what am I going to teach them about
something I don't understand except I
understand that the value of
experimentation and and and I'll get to
this in a second the value of getting
out of the nerd loop as Randy Olson my
friend and the author of don't be such a
scientist broke not recent not that long
ago the nerd loopy this is not the nerd
leave I'm excited by what I see here the
nerve loop is everybody says talking to
each other about how to talk instead of
just getting out in the world actually
experimenting so conveying the climate
story I'm going to try to race through
this because it has been a long day and
hopefully the content will be somewhat
engaging despite that the great news
about climate is climate matters you
know people care about the seasons the
issues that are the confront us every
day in the news headlines related to
climate change it mattered in Russia
mattered in Pakistan and of course it
mattered in Joplin Missouri the patterns
of extreme weather particularly are
enormously important to people and
energy matters with IDs on the side
there is my recently toured the Indian
Point nuclear power plant and that I was
inside the building where they have the
spent fuel you're looking at the spent
fuel storage there and there's a lot
much longer version of this video I have
yet to try to edit and put online but by
going into Indian Point you're the belly
of the beast right during the the
Fukushima issue I was really looking
carefully at how our understanding of
nuclear power is changing advocates who
once hated the idea of storing nuclear
waste on site now we're looking at cask
dry casks is a really you know
reasonable alternative certainly to this
and you know trying to convey that story
in a way that gets past hour these
blockades like no nukes or no fracking
and trying to get a real about it you
know even if you turn off indian point
tomorrow it will be there for decades so
there you kno no new nukes is a separate
question from no nukes at all so what I
try to do on my blog every day and then
my broader writing is to clarify you
know what are we talking about we really
talking about no nukes are we talking
about no new nukes so the idea is to get
inside the story to kind of convey to
fresh ways and also to to break down
some of the barriers that have us so
polarized over these issues that matter
and energy of course matter is to two or
three billion people around the planet
have no access to any kind of electrical
grid they cook on fuels that cause them
premature mortality and morbidity every
day rajendra pachauri sent me this
picture years ago to illustrate what the
consequences are of indoor cooking with
noah with no vented stove and so but
we're all kind of feeling like this guy
this was a television reporter in
Copenhagen 2009 at the very end of that
meeting we were all like oh my god this
is a room with like 3000 journalists at
my friend John Broder who's covered many
many presidential campaigns said he had
never been at all the conventions he'd
never been in a room with so many
journalists in such a sort of horrific
nightmarish situation so we're all
feeling a little bit like this right now
and whatever your role is in this
climate question and there are ways
forward and I'm convinced that the web
despite the bubble pop bubble pop bubble
pop mode of how information tends to
flow and despite the the power gives two
small components of the discourse to
dominate the discourse I still think in
the end it will give great opportunities
to move forward and the reality the
reason this guy is looking like this is
because you've probably heard about
wicked problems as a category problem
that have many dimensions they're all
interrelated and there's no simple way
to dissect it well some people Kelly
Levin I think she was gonna be here oh
you're here does right it's been a long
day she wrote this paper Co wrote a
paper 2007 on the super wicked climate
problem it's easy to google for there's
nothing easier to google for the super
wicked and climate that really laid out
a category some of the aspects of this
problem that make it nearly insoluble
and then I wrote a piece long ago about
I spoke at a meeting at Yale and about
that really this is beyond super wicked
and the reason there is despite that
piece focused most mostly your paper
focus
only on the diplomatic issues and the
equity issues and how do you measure a
ton but that it didn't really dive into
the cognitive issues and this is what I
called on a blog post a couple years ago
an inconvenient mind meaning when you
really look at the climate problem a big
chunk of it is in here not out there
it's all those things you heard today
the the finite basket of War II that cut
the confirmation by a single action bias
we're just so I don't when T years of
writing about global warming is a bio
geophysical problem with some technical
solution questions or economic ones I
realized that the cognitive step is the
dominant issue but even there I think
communication gives us opportunities to
move forward constructively and of
course the other super wicked nature of
this thing is that the climate problem
isn't the problem not at all it's the
symptom the symptom is of this this
super wicked thing are our growth spurt
in the last 200 years it's just a
stunning thing for many species this is
a one-time event you know it's like when
or like when Aborigines got to Australia
40,000 years ago boom you know they took
away all those megafauna and there's
this amazing thing that happens when a
species kind of develops a capacity to
move into new environments and we
explosively grew and now the question is
where to my mind and I've written this a
few times we're kind of like this this
is a gov bacteria on a petri dish and so
we've been kind of in bacteria mode and
the question is this is what's really
challenging we now unlike bacteria and a
new rich environment we've been told is
a there's an edge to our petri dish like
this and how do we integrate that
knowledge and we're a very young species
with a very young mind with all these
layers the primitive brain and all is
aspects to our brain that don't fit well
with this kind of message and so and
this is a London I kind of looked like
to look at bacteria on a gar and then
look at a Don Pettit satellite view of a
city and you can look at that and many
people have written about cities as
being sort of or the human imprint on
the planet is being cancerous like a
malignant tumor and there have been
papers about this the relationship
between how we're growing how cancer
grows of course cities are probably our
salvation in the end the you know
concentrating our
are our communities using resources more
efficiently as you do in cities
advancing progress faster people move to
cities they have more access to health
care in schools so it looks kind of just
like a gar but I think it illustrates
the potential for us to to do wonderful
things don pettit of course and i think
another thing this illustrates is the
power of imagery don pettit is one of
the most the cool i know i guess i've
gotten to know like four astronauts
which is really one of the great things
about being a science writer you get to
meet cool people and don pettit is like
the ultimate guy he went to Antarctica
searching for meteorites in the ice and
and he made a an ice digeridoo for no
particular reason he was on that space
station for six months so he took
glorious photographs to the earth he did
an amazing video compilation of photos
from space of the aurora borealis I
blogged on that if you search for for
aurora borealis and and and revkin
you'll find this stunning video that
gives you a very special view of our
planet and and he know he didn't have to
do that he could you know although
actually NASA encourages that's the only
agency that in its in its Charter says
thou shalt communicate vine findings
1958 the space witter was called the
Space Act so so NASA is a very special
place and it has a culture of
communication now but scientists overall
you know getting back to the edge of the
petri dish scientists essentially like
Martin Perry there in two thousand seven
at the rollout of the grand IPCC report
which as I said earlier unfortunately is
done is kind of the handing down of
knowledge from the great on high you
know here it is this perfect body of
knowledge about climate and and it's
like the chiding parent remember in
rebel without a cause but there's a
great scene when mister mister Magoo
what's his name the actor Bacchus Jim
Backus is you know trying to get his son
to avoid going out and being reckless
and dying young and you know the Sun
doesn't want to hear anything about it
we're basically the scientists for the
last 20 years telling us there are
global limits are kind of like Jim
Backus telling James Dean we go home son
if you don't change your ways and and
they don't kind of understand it seems
so far there hasn't maybe because the
physical scientists have been the main
story tellers so far
they haven't really absorbed the the
reality that teenagers don't listen to
grown-ups very much so you know you want
to create a safe space for them to work
out their their their problems before
they mature so and then there's these
other problems that lead to this this
bollocks that were in one of course is
that way back in the 20th century
pollution was easy it was really easy it
was in your face it was in your nose in
your lungs it's stung your eyes the
Hudson River I just yesterday was at the
strawberry festival there with pete
seeger celebrating the Bert rebirth of
this river and the waterfronts along it
and but 50 years ago there was you know
crap it flowing by people I interviewed
in the mid 90s for a story on the
revival of the Hudson said when they
were kids they had a special swimming
stroke in the Hudson River which is like
this to clear all that debris is your as
you're swimming so here the atmosphere
you know you could kind of in the early
70s this late 60s you could look at this
and say we need to clean this up there
was bipartisanship there was a remember
Republican President Richard Nixon give
an amazing state of the union address
with a section on the environment it's
worth reviewing now and the the EPA was
created under Nixon and we kind of got
busy the Clean Air Act actually kind of
clean the air there's still problems of
course and the Clean Water Act worked
the sewage bondax we cut got going but
it was all because it was right there
was in your face it was a now thing and
a here thing and unfortunately co2 is
not like that as you all know so I did a
post a couple years ago I said well
suppose co2 were pink like if the
atmosphere was pinka fiying slowly over
time with that with that building sense
of something changing with that changes
but then of course I again I talked to
cognitive scientists about this thing
and they say well the rate of pink
ification is so slow that even that
wouldn't really get us where you need to
go because there's the shifting
baselines Robert Brule BR you ll e at
Drexel University has really done a big
body of work on but how we become a nerd
we basically grow up in the environment
that surround us our kids right now are
growing up the norm for the Arctic being
that it's melting and polar bears are
having a hard time when I when I was a
kid my son's age I had these books that
my dad had about
Admiral Perry going to the North Pole
this forbidding frozen ice locked place
so for me it's like a lot of things
going on for my son's it's like home
polar bears are having a hard time so
it's like how do you kind of move
forward with that and our response I
kind of love this interaction some of
you if you've heard me before that
probably heard me talk about this this
was the Supreme Court argument over
whether co2 should be regulated as a
pollutant and here we had James Milky
who was representing the state of
Massachusetts and the other parties
trying to get this to happen and there
was this technical question that came up
about the troposphere and and and
Justice Scalia it always had to be kind
of corrected about something he said
respectfully your honor it's not the
stratosphere it's the troposphere
Justice Scalia says troposphere or
whatever I told you before I'm not a
scientist laughter that that's why I
don't want to have to deal with global
warming to tell you the truth now you
could look at that say oh it's just some
conservative Supreme Court justice but I
think some chunk of us societally
globally actually even the data when you
look at Chinese attitudes is we don't
want to deal with this for many many
different reasons all of which make it
beyond super wicked so this is the down
part I'm taking you down right and and
then of course you know as you know
there's a lot of people out there who
figured out a long time ago that there's
ways to gain the system that and the
system is so set up for stasis it's not
like people who want to maintain the
status quo on fossil fuels have a lot of
work to do we like fossil fuels I you
know I live in a house that's heated by
oil I Drive a Prius and a minivan you
know when they make a hybrid minivan I'd
love to buy one but they haven't done
that yet so uh you know where we
basically our society is still a fossil
fueled phenomenon and so maintaining
that is really easy changing that is
really hard so any idea that it almost
didn't matter who is spending a little
bit more money you've probably heard
that debate recently because it's not
like they had the same task one task is
enormous and the other task is really
simple and so it in the times for years
we were writing about industries efforts
to you know foment doubt would you know
how hard is that and and then of course
and around that time as well
I got some documents from a helpful
public servant that showed that the Bush
administration had industry people in it
who were actually editing words to
change the the nature of scientific
reports being produced by the government
of global warming and here was this
weight bright line that they cut out
because it was partially for because it
was too speculative and the line was
warming will also cause reductions in
mountain glaciers so opening your
refrigerator door will make the food
warm up is too speculative yeah you know
and that all is like an aggravating it
was great to for me to reveal it it was
very traditional journalistic process
and people got bought you know basically
had to quit the White House and it was
felt all really good and here Jim Hansen
was being muzzled and I unmuzzled him
and well I you know he unmuzzled he
never was muscle the bottom line there
but that all feels like well if we could
just get rid of all that stuff then
magically we'd move forward on global
warming on making this issue addressing
it what I've learned more recently again
is unfortunately that's not the case
it's not that simple and then on the
other side my strong sense is many very
well-meaning scientists and
environmental groups and and campaigners
for for action on energy got so this
gets to what someone maybe was Crisfield
said earlier today about the need to to
fight fire with fire you know people
were pushing distorting overstating so
you had to be as loud as they were and
as aggressive as they were so one of the
environmental groups came up with this
picture of drowning polgar that went all
around the web and caught a lot of
people's attention the problem is the
skeptics immediately noted correctly
that the reason the polar bear was
floundering and looking really upset was
because the helicopter for the
photographer was in was about 30 feet
overhead buffeting him with the winds
look at that picture he's like what the
you know so so did that accomplish
anything it may be you know we've got
three people worried about polar bears
more than they might have been and it
created a ammunition for for naysayers
and then even institutions as well mean
well-meaning and I think overall really
constructive the National Science
Foundation in 2008
this big paper in nature or science alan
pounds paper on golden the frogs
extinctions being the sort of the
indicator of global warming and the
press release warmer temperatures
enhance growth conditions of fatal
fungus climate change drives widespread
and phibian extinctions and it was very
definitive and all the nuance was out
and it turns out even then it was highly
contentious herpetologists and
climatologists for having this big fight
over what was causing the die-off of
these frogs it was the Chitra's fungus
or was it warm temperatures in Costa
Rica and the the fungal people have one
out that battle now but even then it was
much more nuanced than the way it was
being conveyed and you know I tried to
write that in a nuanced way as a result
my story ended up buried inside the New
York Times and another story in another
major paper was a front-page piece
global warming claims first victims and
those tendencies they feel so you know
great and everyone accomplishes the
thing and and the complexity that
emerges and that again fuels those who
have that really easy task of saying
they're overstating or whatever so it's
a really challenging situation now the
other reality is this is interesting to
me this every time there is a momentous
weather event you're going to get this
sense of you know this is global warming
because we're all kind of focused on
this right now this was 1927 flood in
Vermont in november from a a.m. late
season tropical storm epic flood and
it's scoured the all the valleys in
there and it laid down this layer of
gravel in the beds of all the lakes
around from southern vermont and a three
or four researchers in 2002 did a lot of
lake bed coring around the Northeast New
York New York and Vermont and elsewhere
and found that that layer from this epic
flood the flood of record for the
Northeast that's there never experienced
when as bad as this ever in the paleo
record of lake bed sediments there if
there are layers of gravel there 10
times thicker than the one from the
flood that we think of as the most epic
flood in the history of the New England
so there's there's this we have to
realize that we have to kind of I think
be
you know as honest as possible about
what's known not known about the extent
of climate extremes in the normal world
and the extent that human influences may
may trance transform make things worse
or maybe in other places not make things
worse we don't really you know it's
important to be honest and clear about
those the nature of those issues how in
here to this was another example where
there was a letter published in science
from a couple hundred National Academy
of Sciences members expressing deep
concern about global warming and pushing
back against climate gate and a art
director unbeknownst to the authors of
the letter chose this image to
illustrate the image was almost I think
as large as the letter the like half of
a page in the journal Science and it
took like a nanosecond for some skeptic
to to google that just to search back
through the the credit on the photo to
the photo agency to determine that this
was actually not even a photograph it
was called a photo illustrations three
different photos a photo of a bear a
photo of an ice floe in a photo of open
water and so and that ended up being
kind of the story instead of the letter
so details matter unfortunately so here
we are you know you got this wacky
landscape now of there was a time when
this all let me see oh yeah there was a
time when things were all so easy back
in the 20th century we had pollution
that we could understand and we had a
monk ulor men mostly who every evening
would tell us with a that comforting
assurance that that's the way it is
Tuesday November ninth 1969 and and we
all dined on this kind of common
intellectual mac and cheese comfort food
every night and and we had that sense of
common common issue a common story and
now of course with the web on any issue
just about but certainly on climate
we're all dining on comfort food still
but now it's like the world's biggest
buffet it's like a Google cafeteria you
know uh the sushi you know i'll have the
pizza and and so everybody with an
ideological predisposition goes out
there and finds the stuff that fits
their predisposition so
you think oh man that but but think
about this though which is better in the
long run this where there was
oversimplification gross
oversimplification sometimes and I'm not
just talking about CBS News the New York
Times front page is very similar sense
of a handoff we know something here it
is goodbye and this is a more dynamic
ecosystem I think despite that the
problems that have come with this I
think in the long run as I said earlier
I think it holds some real promise to
make progress and still the right for
the moment it still access for the most
part in our discourse on these issues
and kind of a batting of fight between
the loudest voices and you end up with
that torquing toward oversimplification
toward kind of trying to get the message
across in ways that are framed largely
politically and I think it's really
unfortunate it's been kind of a sad
thing to watch this is so funny my it
didn't turn off Twitter Elizabeth
Rosenthal one of the best reporters at
the New York Times just came on skype oh
you saw that earlier I could skype them
in right now by the way I did a piece in
2006 called yelling fire on a hot planet
which I encourage you to google for as
well which laid out in 2006 some of the
issues that have come and I'm not going
to say that I was forecasting correctly
but I'll just say that there were issues
looming then that have played out since
then that are worth reviewing so where
do we go from here I here's where I
think there's really good there's real
prospects for good stuff to happen as
Randy Olson said we do have to get out
of the nerd loop and if you google for
that phrase you'll find his his epic
essay on the set or my blog post and
there's ways forward the thing called
journalism that I still am partly
involved with is as I say many times is
a shrinking fast shrinking wedge of this
explosively growing pie of
communications options so the idea that
an institution a university a company
was just going to put out a press
release and wait for a reporter to call
that's so that's so 20th century and and
you could say that's a real problem if
you're locked into the old mode of how
ideas
move in and get shaped and how progress
gets made there are ways for all right
one was a couple years ago on dot earth
this scientist Andy bun anyone know him
Western Washington University pelo
climate guy anyway he was going to
Siberia with a bunch of students and
other researchers to do a float down a
one of those amazing Siberian rivers and
do paleo climate work along the way do I
want to come and I was like well even if
I could afford to the little grainy
things in the in the image there are the
bugs they're not remember there's no
dust on the negative anymore I didn't
really want to go to Siberia so actually
if it's left to go to see the crater
particularly anyway so I say well you're
going you have like a camera and some
audio gear can you record some of your
impressions of what's going on take a
bunch of pictures send them to me and
I'll I'll curate I'll put together a
story not really a story a report from
the field a postcard as we called it
from the Pleistocene from your work and
it was kind of a collaborative thing was
a new thing it's not journalism it's not
public relations it's just communication
it's a scientist sending me stuff to
work with long distance and and I think
it was it was enough of a success that
we now have a blog in the science
section called scientist at work which
is basically made this a model for a
normal an ongoing blog bunch of
universities have done this now the
American Geophysical Union has a cluster
of science blogs this is great stuff
that's happening getting it seen is the
next question which relates to what you
heard from a lot of the Google Earth
earlier today about searchability and
all that stuff and I mean we're all
still learning on that front and then
there you know there's all kinds of ways
to tell stories Richard alley Penn State
amazing scientists he helped drill those
cores in the Greenland ice sheet and
reveal abrupt change and he's been a
lead author in the IPCC reports and and
he sings I'm not going to play his songs
he does this Johnny Cash thing that's
well it's an acquired taste but it's
wonderful ah he's also a Republican as
he told me recently so that's that gets
back to what someone else was saying
earlier collect him if you're collecting
Republicans and he and heat but he's
experimenting he's definitely outside
the nerd loopy and I did another busy if
you google for singing climb
autologous and you'll find the YouTube
video of him doing this and for dancing
climatologist to see his dance in which
he illustrates the Milankovitch cycle of
ice ages by doing like dhavan it just
and is his bald spot as the North Pole
and his nose as the equator and it talks
about 40,000 years is fantastic stuff to
watch and he's out there pushing the
limits not everybody's going to be him
and one of the big challenges of course
is young scientists that it's much it's
easier for him with tenure and an
established career to kind of be goofy
but it's not so easy if you're a young
emerging researcher to be goofy so
finding ways to experiment but about
having institutions that encourage that
and are willing to put up with some
failure once in a while is really
important so here's the other reason I'm
excited about the web which is of course
that as you heard lots of instances of
this today you have the ability to show
not just show but show demonstrate using
every kind of medium except maybe smell
you can kind of tell the story with
whatever tool is best so if you wanted
to talk about the volume of the
atmosphere at sea level pressure you
could say well you could say it in words
like we had that exercise before or you
could say it in pictures like that one
that's what the atmosphere that's the
full volume of the atmosphere if all the
air were at sea level pressure is and if
it's put into the volume of a sphere
it's small you know and there have been
other experiments Al Gore did the
varnish on the globe and I'm not saying
this is better than the varnish on the
globe I'm just saying it's an
interesting experiment Adam Neiman who
who created this in 2003 his british
science illustrator think of his work is
really valuable i'm going to show you
another example in a second so i spoke
at Rutgers not long ago and they have
this cool clicker thing any of you teach
in a school where that you can click
very interesting so you're engaging the
students and questions I ask them this
question of all the world's liquid water
was shown as a spherical volume how big
would it be compared to the plan big
enough to obscure the u.s. on the globe
South America hide the northeastern
states Texas any any votes you're pretty
close so that's all the liquid water
over there that little green bubble it's
all the oceans remember the oceans I
sailed across the Indian Ocean once and
it seems limitless it's two and a half
miles deep my god it was I was a
thousand miles from land almost in every
direction at one point on that trip and
it's just like infinity incarnate and
then but then when you realize two miles
deep okay this month this many square
miles this many cubic miles and you
realize that actually it's pretty small
so again this this work is a valuable it
can you imagine if every kid's geography
or geology text book starts with this
image and it would I think it could
create a fundamentally new way of
conveying in a non-judgmental way
there's nothing about that that image
that says oh you know something scary
are weird it's just a wet a new way of
visualizing information that's you know
what hold on i'm going to i thought i'd
turn that off but i'll have to turn it
off now Paul is everything for something
let's see here we could say hi to rusty
Schweickart an astronaut is on all the
time he's a great guy so um all right
here we go back and then there's this
other stuff you know cognitive that the
biology the biochemistry of of the brain
is revealing all kinds of things that's
seeing seeing this is NIH work seeing
seeing words is different than hearing
where it's is different than thinking
about words and so that says you can
feed all of those processes at once
depending on how you tell your story and
so I'm glad that when i went to the
North Pole in 2003 I didn't just go with
a pad
you can feel this the chunk that
we're on she's starting to fail before
probably hairline cracks up the towards
the DLC so does that mean we back
at ya you always jump over crap ever
this is a two mile deep ocean also and
that noise you hear in the background
that's not a truck or a helicopter
that's the ice the ice that is moving
400 yards an hour and these big flow is
our kind of stretching into each other
and right near our camp the helicopter
is your heart right near this Ridge so
how much am I gonna just go to the North
Pole and tell that story in text and
maybe a photo no no why would I do that
listen to this that the powers just it's
unstoppable this this no mechanical
system you could really designed to live
through a thing like this the forces are
just stunning and it's the risk it's the
risk we take and I grabbed it listen to
this is the noises are unreal I didn't
have any video training when I went
there I just grabbed one of our cameras
that the times was getting involved in
documentary and doing film at that time
I grabbed two cameras a bunch of battery
packs and just pretty practice for day
went so so again having that you know
making sure you're going to tell the
story but the means that makes the story
most meaningful is very important to me
and I've been trying ever since then it
was really that trip that pushed me more
and more into multimedia now here here's
another thing you can do with imagery
you can make the invisible visible
remember the pink ification issue I'll
just going to back up so you see this
again what I'm about to show you is a
video using an infrared camera of leaks
of from natural gas from methane the
methane that's the main constituent of
natural gas is is basically opaque to
infrared radiation it's a greenhouse gas
remember infrared the heat stuff doesn't
go through it so so when you have leaks
and pipelines in fact I think I don't
understand why no one has gone around
fracking country with an infrared camera
just to show that this is what this tank
this is an oil tank in Colorado that's
what it looks like in on a bright sunny
day in Colorado and and then this is
it'll it'll start again this is what it
looks like with an infrared camera so if
that was like if that were visible you
can be sure that communities in that air
I would be going with you know the
driving down the highway in thinking
that the oil tank is on fire it's just
the this is leakage of a commodity it's
the only greenhouse gas that's a
commodity now why in the world would you
have it flowing freely into the
atmosphere where becomes a powerful
greenhouse gas so again you know finding
those ways to tell the story even as a
reporter's I don't understand why this
isn't being used more we did a page one
piece about methane about companies that
were doing the right thing the best
practices people that you don't hear
about much who who are stanching these
leaks actively and making money doing it
now here's another way of visualizing
the invisible too much of the discourse
around issues like climate this came
over warming this came up this today as
well I think the dis the divisions over
this issue very often are because people
haven't actually defined what they're
talking about and I years ago I started
thinking about the shape of an idea how
can you kind of convey the maturity the
level of confidence in an idea in a
different way there's been all kinds of
experiments along the lines so I thought
well just in terms of a bell curve and
there's all kinds of problems with this
but so here's an experiment you know
more co2 warmer world is a very sharply
delineated curve with very small tails
if any there are always will be some
people out there who say no new green
high co2 really doesn't work and you
know they're not really a serious part
of the discourse but even Michael
Crichton agreed that co2 is a greenhouse
gas more of it will make the world
warmer he just had issues about the raid
and and how dangerous that was now
here's where things get sticky you know
the things that matter most of people
aren't that you know more co2 makes the
world warmer the things that matter most
of people are what's it going to do is
sea level how fast what's it going to do
to hurricanes extreme events and one of
the biggest arreaza unresolved questions
is the sensitivity of the climate system
to a big increase in co2 that's still a
flat pretty much a flat line warming
from CC 0 to you know it's between three
and eight degrees some 1.45 4.5 with a
higher probability of the but it's a big
range and it's been like that for
30-plus years so making sure that we
understand there's some aspects of this
issue that will actually the word there
really is real
and no chance virtually no chance at
that one you're not going to see that
curve change it probably in my lifetime
maybe maybe someone will have a
breakthrough but I don't see any
evidence of a learning curve there in
fact on some of these you get what's
called negative learning the more we
study hurricanes the more nuanced the
picture has become what hurricanes will
do in a warming world and so you can
have curves I think it's just helpful to
start to discuss when you're having a
someone comes up to you says I don't
believe in global warming my first
question always is let's talk not you
know get out get on my iPhone well I
have a droid yeah man Android person so
so it's helpful to sort of say well what
is it you disagree with and quite often
of course it's not even about the
science it's about the policy you know
what do we do about it and the end
whoops and there you get into this
reality and this is again this very
sobering work on on the psychology and
the sociology tells you some important
things and I'm going to try to speed to
a conclusion here so we have time for
some questions I did this piece of a few
months ago when I started to dive in
more deeply on the work of Dan Kahane
kan at Yale he's um he's at the law
school but he runs this thing called
cultural cognition net it's an ongoing
research project looking at why people
hold the beliefs that they do and it's
extremely important work right now
because it it basically illustrates
vividly with experimentation with you
know empirical work that information
doesn't matter quite often that the way
information is presented the person
presenting the information if it comes
through a trusted friend if it's if it's
an article and a they've done this this
thing where they they'll make a mock
like a mock Newsweek story about global
warming and they'll have a picture of a
guide with a string tie or whatever in
in a pocket protector or a picture of
someone in Birken stocks and flannel and
the perceptions reaction of the person
reading the piece are very significantly
determined by the context you know is it
someone they who looks like they're kind
of person that kind of thing very
important work and so I did this piece
when I realized you could actually go
out there depending on your
predisposition you could find a Nobel
you can find a Nobel prize-winning
physicist not just a Nobel Prize winner
but Nobel prize-winning physicist who
probably matches your your view of
global warming there's um there's Burton
Richter who wrote a really good book
about energy and innovation and strongly
feels that we need to get busy on
decarbonizing the energy system there's
I varga a ver up here from Rensselaer
emeritus now who was extreme enraged
when the american physical society or
some group called global warming
incontrovertible that's set him off it
made his head explode and and he said
the only religious beliefs are
incontrovertible and and Laughlin and
then it's of course do you chew again
they all reflect kind of the broad range
of how we all have feel about these
issues so that says to me you know even
if you're really smart even if you know
basic physics you're not going to find a
lot of doesn't mean that that that's the
thing that matters now energy the energy
story is a very different story than the
climate story and this leads to another
I think significant opportunity the
sixth America's I'm sure many of you
know about this ongoing study by Tonya
lacera wits and others based at Yale
primarily where they basically turn it
looked at people and done very deep
surveys of how we think hold you know
what we think about global warming and
these related issues and and what what
correlations there are with other things
and here there are basically six
America's they've come out with there's
dismissive is doubtful has disengaged
cautious concerned and alarm this was
the older data set this was from 2000
this was a survey in late two thousand
eight and released in 2009 this was the
big question here was support for cap
and trade so this was to me very anyone
who thought that somehow we lost the
cap-and-trade fight more recently wasn't
paying attention to Tony lacera widzisz
work at the end of 2008-2009 because
this says to me right away this is never
going to happen if you have people who
are alarmed about global warming barely
nudging about the midline on whether
they support a cap-and-trade bill then
then what's with that it says to me that
that's not going to happen now here
support for providing rebates or
purchases of solar panels and
fuel-efficient vehicles
look at that even the dismissive there
are the midline now The Economist's I
show this to say oh yeah but that's just
because one is taking away money and one
is giving away money you know it's a yet
to give back it's a benefit but it's not
that simple here support for requiring
automakers to increase fuel efficiency
to 45 miles a gallon that's a big
mandate that's not giving away money
those cars are going to cost more
they're going to impede your freedom to
have your big vehicle but even there the
dismissive czar almost at the midline so
what does it say to me you know climate
climate fight the climate climate
constrain those greenhouse gases or
support energy innovation it says to me
that there was a lot of wasted effort
force it for a long time that and again
partially I think because people weren't
paying attention to a lot of this work
the work of people like Matt nisbet and
unless our wits and kahein and others is
really valuable especially studies like
this that are an ongoing project the
bubbles have changed shape this one got
bigger recently after Climategate now
they're kind of modulating I have
thoughts about that as well now once one
thing I'm just going to throw in just
because I care about it a lot another
image this is my close encounters of the
third kind you know the mud pile that
all those people were had in their head
they were thinking the aliens were
coming well my my my vision my visual
mantra is this this is my progress this
shows me that we you know you had all
this talk about this even the stimulus
package you know we're now engaged on
the energy quest that and but you look
at this this is 50 years of scientific
inquiry in America Sputnik at the left
oh my god the Russians got into space so
yellow is the space race we had a space
race it was ten several tens of billions
a year in constant dollars and we got to
the moon and we comp list a lot of stuff
and it changed the economy in many ways
and then we started the war in cancer
that's the blue at the top and that got
up to about 35 40 billion a year in
constant dollars and then look at the
energy though energy is green that
little green ribbon that looks like an
anaconda that swallowed a tennis ball is
our interest in energy and and notice
you know everyone blames Ronald Reagan
for unplugging the solar program and yes
he did but then look who plugged it back
in Republicans Democrats came and went
and there was we were likened as I've
said we're in a bipartisan slumber party
on
animation in this country and the the
little blip of the stimulus package is
meaningless in the long run especially
because it's over it's already over and
you talk to anybody in that arena and
they'll tell you that you know if you
want a young person to getting engaged
and excited about building a career in
this arena what you need is sustained
support not this kind of thing I'm going
to fly forward here so again you know
and I did a post on this vile guy if I
had a choice between two bumper stickers
for my Prius and one was fight the
climate crisis the other was joined the
energy quest and I know they're both
wonky but look where walks okay you know
that's what we are I would choose energy
quest and there's another reason I would
do that and it relates to the global
side of this issue there are again to me
the energy challenge the world faces is
a halfsies thing then the the rich half
is how do we use it more efficiently and
how do we get the carbon out of our
energy norms the poor half is that
there's nearly three billion people on
the planet who have no energy options
that are reasonable and their kids who
have to do their homework in this in
Guinea by going out of their slums where
there's no electricity to the parking
lot at the airport where there's street
lights and it this picture to me
represents a like a triple scandal these
are kids who want to become part of the
innovative educated progressive life on
the planet earth that every human
aspires to and they have to migrate to
like moths to streetlights to do their
homework and that there's no reason that
needs to be part of our landscape right
now it was just at a meeting in Toronto
looking for ways to fast forward energy
access through 2030 and and it's again
it's just as vital by far to me as the
climate challenge and and there's great
great promise both through IT and and et
electronic electrical technology this
was a Libby Rosenthal whose little skype
thing you saw a minute ago she went to
Kenya rural Kenya in December to a
village where a woman was tired of
having to go into town to charge her
cell phone at a ridiculously high rate
per kilowatt hour for wat our I guess
and so she bought she saved up money and
bought one of those like $60
photovoltaic panels to put on the roof
of her thatched Hut and it changed their
lives
the light her kids are doing better in
school she said we'll do work at night
there's a little more security there's
all kinds of experiments under way and
doing this a guy at columbia university
has these little it's called shared
solar little mini grid things that where
people can do micro payments for just
enough electricity to run the lights in
their house in Tunisia and and the
outsize impact of those kilowatt-hours
those wat minutes is priceless compared
to putting a forty forty thousand dollar
solar panel on roof in California if I
could invest that same 40 grand in a
hundred of these little things or 200
knowing the outside impact I would I
think it's a no-brainer and here just
finally you know I'm a communicator so I
see this change in how we communicate
and I go oh my god if I can time because
I've got a few more minutes but I don't
you some of you is probably seeing this
graph is itu int the International
Telecommunications Union charts cell
phone use it's pretty easy to read two
thousand the rich countries are blue
year 2000 there were seven order million
cell phones on the planet 2005 2.2
billion and by 2005 already more than
half we're in developing countries now
it's three-quarters of the world's 5 5.5
billion cell phones are in developing
countries so think of the kid you know
there you heard about Khan Academy you
know obviously digital divide still
exists that these are not smart phones
yet but they will be very soon so this
kid can be like you know listening takan
do his little lectures any day now and
that that says to me and with Google's
work on translation interfaces and that
kind of thing also says to me that were
poised for just explosive explosive
potential for communicating sharing and
shaping ideas on a global level from the
hut and Kenya to right here and you know
when I write all the time about in the
classroom I would just want to close out
in academia my new home where I went to
become effective after 25 years of
journalism feeling marginally effective
you know i have written ken 140
characters matter i did this post on
Twitter and I say yes absolutely there's
a woman at university of connecticut who
teaches bird biology Miriam Rebecca
and she if several years now one of the
assignments for her students is you have
to get a twitter account and then while
you're out on this semester you have to
tweet every time you witness bird
behavior something bird doing something
quirky so they're tweeting bird behavior
now they're all done for the semester
but the hashtag was bird class so if you
I don't know if you'll be able to find
it you probably could google for it
easier then then searching through
twitter with the hashtag twins later i
don't know i'm not going to click on it
but wince later as a way to tweet in
multiple languages you can do as you
type it converts into chinese and it
goes out in two languages the all kinds
of tools like that are facilitating our
ability to become much more effective at
what we do and when i talk to kids about
this stuff i say this is not just about
output it's about collaboration one of
my assignments for my students graduate
environment science students at pace and
communication is to go out on the web
and i want you to find someone working
on the same problem you're working on
for your master's thesis but in another
country and say we just started this as
an experiment they haven't you know
through social networks through Facebook
through whatever find somebody doing
what you do and trade ideas and and I
think we've just begun to sort of test
the potential for doing that kind of
thing and I match.com which you've heard
me yell about here too and there's some
wonderful experiments under way NYU has
explained or dotnet in journalism
explainer a shorthand for after a big
earthquake or what happened in the
nuclear plant you do the explanatory
graphic or the explanatory story that
accompanies the news and they did this
really creative video on fracking that
feels like it's anti-fracking but
actually it's just a bunch of
information package in a way that says
we need more information about this
technology before it goes forward in a
big way and then there are these they're
all kinds of schools are actually doing
stuff where you're learning and actually
producing output at the same time Harvey
Mudd College has done regional
landscaping clinics you know
ecologically appropriate landscaping and
there's many many possibilities like
that their students these were in
California somewhere and I can't
remember where and I'm going to skip
clicking on it but they did a really
great video on GM engineering that's
hilarious it's kind of like would a
Charlie Chaplin desk it's wonderful
finally
finally and we talked about this a lot
here science is story making sure that
young people somehow we working in a
patient methodical way towards shifting
are enormous for how we teach and having
making sure teachers and students have
access to two scenarios to learning
modes that can get them to have that aha
moment and here's one
that's my wife in the bathroom so what
that is is I'm sure you you've probably
heard or maybe you did when you were a
kid there's a sort of competition where
you get a certain amount of balsa wood
you get that you build a bridge in the
team and you add wait until it breaks
and and then you do an analysis of what
happened you know what went wrong and
how you build it differently and what my
wife when she was a science teacher
until two years ago in Mike topchic
thanks to Mike they built into this
fairly conventional sister fit component
where they had the kids had a budget
they had to buy their their balsa wood
with a imaginary dollars so that and
they were graded on performance both
performance and economy so there the
cost-benefit ratio is something they
learned in look at it did you get that
like whoa moment there and I mean this
is engaging d they will not forget that
I don't know if they've done a follow-up
study to see how many of these kids
aren't went on to become engineers or at
least be literate about you know
cost-benefit breaking things to learn is
something I wrote about on my blog
learning by breaking things you know we
have to get over the fact that failure
is is a wonderful thing if it's there's
constructive failure how do you teach
that finding ways to make that happen
and in the way we communicate it as well
I think there's great potential and so
you know and then stepping back is
useful stepping back periodically and
being it's okay to be emotional about
the power of the things we've learned
about the world through science now
there's a line between having a
religious reaction you know this is the
Carl Sagan this is the pixel that's
earth that that that deep shot of from
void one of the voyagers just before
left the solar system there there's
power in this stuff and a couple years
ago when we had the 40th anniversary of
Earth rise I had found that the japanese
space agency had done this amazing video
of that was a video version of the
Earthrise photograph I'm sure you all
know the photo from Apollo 8 and the
video version they had a spacecraft that
went around the back end of the moon and
did a HD video so and I got in touch
with in
shaken who wrote that I consider the
definitive book on the Apollo program he
happen to be a college classmate of mine
and he had the this really beautifully
rendered version of the audio
conversation they had in the spaceship
in the craft and so I put it all
together with some music from one of my
bandmates and and this is what came out
the other end
Oh
I'll take that my schedule don't take
that that's not scheduled that's really
this is what I don't know why this
wasn't moment I don't watch the
magnitudes anymore does anyone but I
don't recall is this imagery of being
out and around in 2007 when these images
were taken and the Earthrise is really
spectacular but they were at sentencing
seconds or so
this is on YouTube of course youtube com
/ Rifkin
you
so again you know the sky's the limit
literally I think there's but of course
it takes collaboration and an ability to
sort of jump out of foxholes so thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
