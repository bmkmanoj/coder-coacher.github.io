coming so people have been asking for
this tech talk long before Nikolas even
joined the company so here it is this
talk will be on google video so try not
to reveal any confidential information
in the Q&amp;amp;A afterwards else good hey
let's go okay um yes so I basically got
pressured into doing this by some of the
team's I don't normally talk to people
in public or about anything I do but it
seemed a lot of the stuff seemed
relevant to google so I thought we were
while and interesting to people in the
world at large to start off with I just
wanted to give sort of the basics of
quicksilver sort of introduced it people
who haven't used it before it's kind of
unapproachable because the interface is
basically nothing it just tells you to
search and there's almost no indication
of what else you could do at a basic
level which most people use it before is
a launcher so I can type things like
iTunes and I can jump back and forth
through my apps pretty easily this thing
that almost over to got a grasp of
additionally it is sort of like a it's a
mixture of the command line and the
finder and lets you get at information
you normally wouldn't be able to see so
if you are well if you go to the
Applications folder you can use it sort
of as a navigational tool so you can
navigate into things you could actually
navigate further down in them to sort of
look and see what's inside of it so I go
my address book and I can see if
contacts there if I chose to like go to
iTunes and navigate it to that sort of
see the content that itunes has sort of
sorted by the things you'd expect to see
in itunes itself this sort of acts sort
of like a file browser like the finder
but it's sort of without having to force
you into the finder or into itunes as
you choose do you do it additionally
there's a sort of extra field so what
I'm in itunes if I pick a an album for
example I can choose to play it I don't
actually know you can do the audio from
the
no I could use to play albums i will
show you that is playing it'll start
playing in the background and that's
sort of the basic thing you'd expect to
do when you had a song the the right
hand half of quicksilver really is based
on what are the other things you could
do with this item so I found this album
I can choose to play in the party
shuffle or I could choose to play next
so rather than remove the track that I'm
currently playing I could say instead I
want you to put this afterwards instead
of Q these things up and eventually this
build a playlist without having to
interrupt people so these two things
basically make up all of what quizlet
Quicksilver can do you find something
you want and you choose what you want to
do with it additionally the third one
you might see sometimes like if i choose
to mail something somebody i can choose
the people i want to mail it to and
really this is sort of building a
grammar like structure where we have a
noun we have a verb and potentially an
indirect object for that verb and with
these sort of basic building blocks you
can do almost anything and can change
things together so
so these are the basic sort of things
you'll see Quicksilver do the first one
that's sort of search just refining
stuff across your computer sort of what
items match this but the more powerful
aspect of it is summoning something
which is a little bit like search but
more I know exactly what I'm looking
forward give it to me now when I say
iTunes I'm speaking about a specific
object I'm not looking for itunes in the
content of some file and in this case
just simply getting me to that object as
fast as possible is the goal sometimes
you don't know about the where the
object itself is but you know how it
sits in relation to other objects in the
itunes case you know where your tracks
are based on what albums they're in or
what John rather in and you will jump to
it album you'll jump to a genre and then
you can use browsing sort of pivot down
to find the item you want this works
especially well in cases of people and
we'll talk a little bit more about this
later the last thing is acting which
isn't really sort of a way of navigating
but in acting upon something you can
cause new things to be created so if I
take a file and I compress it I create a
new object and basically navigate from
the original object to this compressed
version of it and using these sort of
four things you can get around and do
almost anything you try to do in an
application but faster so to start off
with I wanted to talk a little bit about
the philosophy philosophy behind quick
slow earth this isn't really stuff
that's actually implemented but Moore
the general guidelines that I followed
or thought of as I was going along these
three basic makeup the basics of it for
a sort of fast universal access is
probably the thing that most people see
and it's more it's mostly about finding
anything on your computer or on the web
just instantly it's the major point is
to be able to search anything not just
files are not just web pages and Google
and spotlight are very good at spa are
searching those specific things but not
across both additionally people are also
really important and being able to
search for people and use them as ways
of finding things is important it's
and additionally the the place these
things live shouldn't matter my data
lives in the cloud it also lives on my
computer and being able to search across
the web and across the content in my
computer makes it more valuable Google
Desktop sort of moving towards this by
letting you look at your gmail and also
look at your files but really these
things have to be added on like a
case-by-case basis it's really hard to
sort of let you search across multiple
things quiksilver makes a point of
indexing a variety of web services
usually ones that are focused on content
so things like backpack or stick it
where people will store to do
information or just contact information
they want to look up and even at the
sort of basic level being able to say I
want to search for this this page I know
of that is my content and just jump to
it makes them a lot more usable the
second part of ignoring boundaries
between things is ignoring the
boundaries of the file system we talked
a little bit about itunes as sort of a
container for stuff if you actually look
at itunes in the file system it's full
of garbage like the application packages
itself isn't really meaningful and in
the finder you wouldn't even be able to
get to into this but it would be
interesting if we can see what happens
when you sort of drilled further down
into things quiksilver sort of absurd
abstract the fossils out and says
instead of showing you what the real
contents or I'm going to show you what I
believe the content should be and it's
done on a case-by-case basis for apps so
Safari shows you book more exciting
shows you music I photo shows you albums
almost all media apps are sort of filled
with content and representing them as
their content and not just for the dead
end is the best uh-huh if you walked
watched aiza raskins talk about away
with applications you're going to
recognize a lot of stuff because our
goals are pretty consistent with each
other if you look at a lot of tools
nowadays they're all focused on going
places so spotlight google desktop
google com they're really about finding
something and getting there and getting
there is half the battle and it's a huge
help to be able to sort of find this
thing instantly and not have to worry
about where did I put it but once you
get there you still have to fight with
the UI or whatever app you're going into
and you end up taking all these steps to
actually accomplish what you want after
having
fountains the thing you're looking for
and what might be more ideal is to
simply do the thing you were trying to
do initially without actually having to
go in cases a Photoshop and things are
more complicated it makes sense to go
into an application and sort of work in
it for a little while but if I'm simply
trying to jot off an email or sort of
adds me to my to-do list I shouldn't
have to interrupt what I'm doing if you
look a little bit there's a lot of tools
that work on making it easier to do
things that you do frequently so
something like Automator lets you build
up chains of actions to specify oh I'm
going to compress this file upload it to
my web server and then send it to my
friend and if you do that often it's
sort of worthwhile pipes as well lets
you mishmash data and into a form that
you can sort of look at it but always
require up for an effort and you
basically have to do planning to sort of
say I'm going to do this frequently make
it easier put no more on the fly ones
with things like the services menu which
is probably a bad example because it's
so hard to use I will put this in to
basically let you manipulate any content
you have so so I can use the services
menu basically look look up in
dictionary and it takes the context into
account takes me in a dictionary and
execute that service one of the first
things I did in Quicksilver was take
that whole body of information and
include it so this that same action
appears here and I can use it as sort of
a starting point to add functionality
eventually I had to sort of dig deeper
they sort of add more data but at a
basic level the OS provides these things
already some other stuff that takes
context into account is the Enzo
launcher for windows it's actually quite
good at looking at what you are
currently doing and taking that into
account rather than saying rather than
having to explicitly asked it to define
a given word you can just go state
define and it says what are you trying
to define oh this is the selection I'm
going to define this for you and if you
wanted to you could override it and
write something else but taking this
taking the current context into account
makes these things much more flexible
in addition to taking the context into
account it's also nice to not have to
worry about not work error it's nice to
not have to leave the context to
accomplish something so Sam giving this
presentation to you and I realize that I
have to get milk or something and I'm
going to add this to my to-do list which
is sort of a simple thing that like it
will do with Quicksilver that'll simply
add the text in but I wanted to I could
go to it and I don't you know what's in
this file click been doing it all day so
it adds get milk but the idea is that I
don't actually have to leave the
presentation I don't want you to leave
the presentation to do this I can do it
in context I don't have to worry about
it and I wanted to email it to somebody
I could do that and just stay here and
I'm done it'll go off eventually um the
last thing is this actor that effort or
act without doing is based on a Taoist
philosophy in it I sort of wanted to
take the opportunity to babble on about
it for a bit just because it was such a
guiding principle and the way the app
was built we were basically translators
act translates as actor about doing we
way is non action and the idea is not
you don't actually do these things but
rather you work with a natural flow of
things so that it is an effortless form
of action you're sort of in harmony with
the way the system works and in the end
you don't leave a trace and basically
things will you can resolve things and
get back to what you're doing without
having to do any interruption now I
wanted to talk a little bit about
implementation so that was sort of the
overall goals this is more what what and
how these things were actually done
going back to Sodor these high-level
goals each one of them sort of dictated
how the system was built as far as how
fast you can go really the the limit on
search is eventually not going to be
optimization it's more the user input so
Quicksilver to the point it's not
researching a lot which makes it faster
but it's at the point where the user
inputs the thing that's slowing it down
the most I can't give you the
application you want because you haven't
typed enough letters we'd understand
what it
and the only real way to optimize this
decrease input or eventually just read
the user's mind and there's not really a
clear way to do this it's simply a
matter of allowing them to feel
comfortable with what they're typing and
understand that that's going to take
them to the right place if they have to
worry about is this the right thing it's
going to slow them down this is
originally or most of this sort of
benefit comes from abbreviation matching
at least in Quicksilver and this is
based on something that launch bar did a
while back but not requiring people to
type the full eita spaces or even prefix
match and slows it down so so I can type
a Pho and I'll get adobe photoshop even
though those letters are spread about
different words and rankings think
writing these things correctly is sort
of a fuzzy affair that I don't really
understand how it actually works it's
all been tweaked and basically will
learn from the user over time but every
time I type a pho I'm going to get
photoshop and if I ever change my idea
what that abbreviation means I can
choose a different one and the system
will learn it the whole point is for it
to be flexible enough that it doesn't
get too stuck and what it's been doing
before but still will learn new things
the second thing is being able to start
your second thing is universal access so
how much stuff can you get at and
Quicksilver really has to get into a
tons of applications to spread around
your harddrive including things that are
even on the web and it Musa basically
get at the data as well as the
functionality of them so eventually it's
been growing for a long time sort of
what are what is what is the content of
this app how can I add it to Quicksilver
what's actually useful to search and
almost anything is valuable label is
valuable to be able to search things
like airport networks and network
locations I sort of added on a whim
because I thought it would be nice to be
able to just type it in and that's not
something you traditionally search for
but having it mixed into this catalog is
valuable additionally once you start to
get into these things to get at their
data you can also learn how to control
them and directly manipulate the data
rather than simply getting at it and
piping the data back and forth between
different apps so the initial version
clicks over we're all building this in
and it basically started to get really
really big very quickly because every
new app involved a ton more code and
understanding all this these different
interfaces and it was all done the sort
of shell scripts for Apple scripts and
each one of them those scripts had to be
dumped in eventually I realized we had
to move to a plug-in architecture and
best sort of weight is now where each of
these things deals with a specific app
and they can provide sort of the basic
objects within that app but also the
actions the app provides and I learned
later that people don't do very well
will plug in and having to worry about
install them and figure out which ones
they have but as an architecture works
very nicely and really each of these
plugins just provides these different
objects and builds this huge searchable
index of items and the the index doesn't
know what these items are it just knows
that they are things they have certain
types and the the plugins themselves
provide actions that will look at these
items and say oh I can handle a URL and
I can email it to somebody else and in
effect create new objects by applying
actions to them one of the nice thing
about the way the system was built is
that the actions themselves are objects
that are in this database that it treats
downs and verbs are sort of the same way
so i can add shell scripts and i can add
other things to make the system more
powerful it it allows people sort of
collaborate together so a lot of the
activity on forums was based around how
can I sort of mix and match these things
or added additional functionality and so
the last thing that isn't it's part of
the implementation that doesn't it sort
of helped and it's sort of a strange
thing is that the idea of magic and
mystery and I read a blog post by Mike
Cunha ski that's sort of about magic and
user interfaces and eventually
technology is going to be so advanced
that it doesn't really help people to
understand how it works and simply being
surprised and delighted when it always
provides the right answer is that like
the correct approach and a lot of
Christopher was based on the idea of
just sort of make it seem like it just
works and even made even forcing this
air of mystery when it wasn't worthwhile
okay it probably would've been bad for a
commercial app to have a web page that
was quite so plain and
unapproachable but I liked it because it
sort of added to this feeling in it the
the alchemy theme was sort of designed
around getting people to think of this
as a mysterious and they could learn and
would have to play with but it might not
be reliable but it might be kind of
interesting I don't know it's an
interesting way to go and I probably
couldn't have pulled it off I was trying
to sell it so as far as magic and goes
these two apps abracadabra and
consolation are extensions to
Quicksilver that i did with help from
other students at CMU when i was there
last year and i wanted to show them off
just because they're fun to show off
because the regular interface is not
particularly interesting anyway so
abracadabra basically is a simple
gesture system um get rid of these
things um it's not particularly
intelligent it watches what you draw and
we'll try to match it to some
pre-programmed pattern i'm using it
right now to switch back and forth from
the finder and then back into keynote um
but additionally it was built sort of to
work with constellation they are both
focused on mouse face interaction which
Quicksilver was sort of ignoring and I
really like the idea of being able to
browse the stuff in Quicksilver so
constellation was more about how can I
show the actual things and let people
sort of navigate through them and find
things visually and then decide what
they want and this has all the same
functionality the Quicksilver does where
it exposes the action that exposes the
hierarchy it's just you don't have to
know what you're looking for ahead of
time you can just sort of explore it
sorry
wasn't such a rush to get the stuff out
of the way okay
so consolation in abracadabra were sort
of ways that I was able to play with a
quick support system and when I want to
talk about a little bit was what other
things am I trying to do now in building
those two building consolation I had to
build it into Quicksilver because all
these plugins and stuff are bound into
the application and there's no way to
actually get at that functionality
outside which is a bit of a pain because
constellation is not really bad
associated with Quicksilver are the two
entirely different apps and forcing them
together was just a requirement if doing
it quickly one of these I'm interested
in doing is building a new framework
called alchemy that Quicksilver is
basically going to sit upon and it will
allow it to have access to all these
plugins but still allow other
applications to coexist with it where
these plugins simply abstract data and
the things you can do with data in a way
that other apps can load them and it
will take advantage of things that
already exist so building conduits to
Automator and the things it does and
building conduits to spotlight and the
data it has access to and it's more
about sort of letting things together in
a consistent way that one interface or
multiple interfaces can access
Quicksilver itself is sort of been back
burner just because I'm more interested
in working on this underlying framework
and seeing what new things will come of
it and then applying them back to the
original even so there's some stuff that
I'm sort of interested in pursuing with
Quicksilver stuff like hybrid search
Quicksilver is really bad at search and
content or rather it doesn't do it at
all you can do it with spotlight but
it's a hack and one of the things was
interested doing is saying what happens
why just search everything at once and
get all the results back and I will show
you the ones that I think are the most
likely hits ignoring where they're
actually coming from so they could come
from google com they can come from
spotlight GD it just pulls them together
the other thing is contextual search
when I'm in an application there's
probably different things that I'm
interested in searching that aren't in
sort of the global index when I'm
programming I might be interested in all
the source code files that are currently
open and being able to search the
methods of them whereas normally that
would be clutter in the index if I was
trying to find those additionally sort
of letting he will do a search for
actions right now you can't search for
actions you have to find it now and then
you can act on it but what if you could
just find an action and then specify an
out if you want if not just take the
current context as representing the
current now
so I would be able to do stuff like
define and it would just say Oh define
what not bad yeah so the last question
is sort of what how does this apply to
google what things could Google do and
what things are Google what things are
Google doing already sort of accomplish
this the main thing that google has an
advantage of is the interconnectedness
of its apps it's already starting to
connect it snaps together you can see
this in reader where it's able to do
things like email directly into gmail
from reader as well as we share things
and there there are few other places
you'll see this but each time we do this
it's very hard coded it's like it's an
implementation in these in that app and
will be more interesting to say is what
if i don't use gmail what if i use apple
mail and i want my web apps to be able
to communicate back to that and they
don't really care anymore what they're
emailing it there just knowing that this
is a conduit with which i can send stuff
and part of this is making the data that
the apps contain available to other apps
and microformats can do this to some
extent but google is interesting
opportunity because they have control of
such a large suite of apps already that
they could build a system that would be
extensible around this one other thing
that Google can look at is the number of
search boxes that are on my machine all
of these search different stuff but some
of them have similar behavior spotlight
and the Google search box in the
browsers basically are both Universal
searches they're all about find me
something that matches this and they
could be easily easily be unified into
one type of search box there's also
contextual search boxes in each
application which are are limited to the
content of that application and really
do warrant standing alone as something
else that you can look at but they could
be tied into the universal search the
Third Kind and these is there a bit of
an exception where they are simple
filter boxes within the OA it within the
UI but they can be much more tailored
towards a specific type of search or
activity this skip over slide this quick
contacts picker in gmail is nice because
it basically lets you search context but
it also lets you act on them
and it's it's results are very tailored
to this and the actions that it shows a
great tailored to this but it allows a
huge amount of functionality in a very
very small space other search boxes that
Google's sort of doing nice things with
is the docs one which has some amount of
that basically the summon ability where
you can go to a search box you can type
some string and jump directly to the
thing you're thinking about okay
potentially with docs you are you know
roughly what the name of the thing is
you're not trying to do sort of a
complex deep search on it you just want
to jump to it and this ability to jump
to things it's mean that could be
carried across in the universal search
or in the individual app search boxes
all right weird I thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
