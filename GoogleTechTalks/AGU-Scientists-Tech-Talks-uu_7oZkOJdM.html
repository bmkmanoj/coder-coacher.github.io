works for the UN US Environmental
Protection Agency and he's going to be
talking about how they have been using
google earth to visualize real-time air
quality data thanks John as John said
I'm Phil Dickerson with the
Environmental Protection Agency office
of air quality planning standards
located in Research Triangle Park North
Carolina and I'm going to be telling you
a little bit about what we're doing with
virtual globes and real-time air quality
data so first of all a little bit
background about air quality obviously
air pollution affects everyone unlike
some of the other environments at EPA is
concerned with everybody has to breathe
the air poor air quality can aggravate
lung disease including asthma heart
disease including congestive heart
failure and those kind of effects result
in more premature deaths more admissions
to hospitals more trips to the emergency
room more visits to doctors offices more
school and work absences for folks that
are affected by those symptoms and more
days with symptoms so basically very
quickly what EPA does in the realm of
air quality data the Clean Air Act
actually requires monitoring and
reporting of air quality data a bevy of
state and local agencies collect that
data and reported to EPA there's not an
actual regulatory requirement for
real-time reporting which will come into
play when I talk about the air now
program EPA manages the air quality
system AQS which is actually the largest
database of air quality measurements in
the world it goes back to as early as
the 1950s that AQS data as I mentioned
is supplied by the state local tribal
and federal agencies and it's used to
determine compliance with the national
ambient air quality standards so if
you've ever heard the phrases
non-attainment area that's what we're
judging based on this AQS data the
reason i point that out is because the
air now program actually provides
real-time air quality data and forecasts
for the public so about ten years ago
EPA found that our region one office in
the Northeast was gathering up real-time
air quality data three
times each day and creating maps for the
public so in 1997 we got some funding to
try to expand that effort nationwide I
bring this up in contrast to the air
quality system which we use for our
regulatory purposes this is actually
reported in real time which again is not
required by regulation and we have
mostly a focus upon the public this also
leverages existing monitoring activities
the state and locals are getting EPA
grants to do this monitoring and we're
just building upon that monitoring
network that already exists we have a
very diverse stakeholder community we
have federal state provincial tribal and
local air agencies and there are over
120 of those agencies that are
submitting their data voluntarily to the
air now program we also have scientific
and health research organizations that
are actually using that real-time data
to study health effects on humans we
also have a lot of media and public
outreach groups our data actually goes
to CNN USA Today The Weather Channel
media outlets like that we do a lot of
Education the outreach through the air
now program ozone in particular was
difficult to visualize since it's an
odorless colorless gas and we actually
gave the public a tool that they could
kind of see how ozone formed in the
atmosphere and watch it move about we
also have international interest in
activities we're actually piloting a
version of the air now system in
Shanghai China right now the Chinese saw
the success the US had were there now
and they wanted to duplicate the system
so we're actually designing an entirely
new system that will use in Shanghai and
in the u.s. next year this bottom flow
diagram is a very brief description of
how the air now system actually works we
have those hundred and twenty plus state
and local air agencies they submit their
data to the air now data management
center which is actually not far from
here up in Petaluma California they
submit observations every hour 24 by 7
and they also submit forecasts to this
data management center we take that and
then turn around and create a national
data set and a national set of maps and
forecasts we then form the function of
distributing that data and forecasts to
the media and also to the public via
our Erin al gov website and we hope that
information gets into the hands of
decision makers and the public so that
they can avoid exposure to unhealthy
levels of air quality on the right hand
side you'll see in 1997 this represents
that first regional effort EPA took that
over and the 2007 view shows that we've
expanded it to all 50 states and even
the provinces of Canada the bottom
graphic shows a special purpose map that
we drew for the Alaska fires a couple
years ago any time there's an emergency
or a special event will contribute by
creating real-time data products for
that particular event it's a little bit
more about air now as you've probably
figured out by now we do a lot of
coordination between the state and local
agencies and the media we provide
centralization for all this air quality
data that's collected at various levels
across the country we convert all the
raw data to the air quality index which
is our public tool for reporting air
quality it's a five color system that
also contains health effects information
so that the public can actually figure
out what the air quality is and what
they can do about it and we do a lot of
Education and lots of distribution over
on the right hand side you see some of
the many ways we distribute this air
quality data that first one there is
actually what I'm going to show in a
minute which is one of our KML products
and then we have contour maps of ozone
which you see right beside the Google
Earth window there we also get our data
onto CNN we have a system that allows
you to subscribe to get real-time air
quality alerts on your cell phone or
pager and we also get coverage on the
weather channel USA Today and various
other media outlets a little bit more
about some of the products we do in the
air now system as I've mentioned we have
real-time hourly data we have forecast
coming in for over 300 cities we produce
a national outlook which is kind of like
the weather map you see on TV at night
that predicts where air quality problems
will occur in the next day or two we do
news stories for particular wide
regional events or in special cases like
wildfires we have webcams so that people
can visually get an idea of what the air
quality looks like and we do yearly air
comparisons to show how this you
your compares to last year or the last
five years so what we're doing with KML
we actually have a dynamically created
KML file or several files that we create
we've got the most current air quality
index and we update that every hour as
the new data comes in we have today's
and tomorrow's forecast air quality
index and those are all updated on an
hourly basis based on the latest data
that comes in the KMS also give more
information via pop-up boxes they give
you the ozone and particulate matter aqi
concentrations for a location and give
you links to more information in case
you have other questions outside of my
program EPA is also doing some other air
quality applications we have a KML file
for emissions data it has a really neat
feature where basically the height of
the balloon shows the total emissions
for a facility and I'll show that in
just a moment we also allow people to
see where the actual air quality
monitors are located via kml that's a
very neat function because in the past
people might find the address of a
monitor they might be able to plot it on
a map but with Google Earth you can now
actually see what's around that monitor
and detect if there are schools or
parking lots or if it's near a busy
intersection things like that so we've
come to the part I'm going to try to do
some live demonstrations which is kind
of the technology equivalent of a bungee
jump but we'll hope it works first the
location of air quality monitors this
takes you to an EPA webpage and we
monitor for a variety of different
pollutants so you can pull up these
different layers depending on the
pollutant you're interested in I'm going
to click on the ozone layer no that was
interesting choice the ozone layer this
is actually ground-based ozone so don't
get that confused so what we're doing
here is we're pulling up a live KML file
of the actual ozone monitoring locations
and you can zoom in on this having a
little trouble with my mouse here we go
if you zoom in here
whoops okay you can actually see the
monitoring locations and if you click on
one you can get more information about
that particular monitor so you'll see
here this particular monitor I choses in
salt lake near Salt Lake City in Utah
you can get a lot of different
information about the monitor itself
that comes out of our air quality system
and you can even download some of the
historical data for that particular site
obviously you can zoom in closer and see
what kind of terrain the monitor has
around it and get a lot of different
visual information so I'm going to jump
back out whoops don't mean to do that
okay
this next one is actually a KML file
that references three other KML files
which give you information on current
air quality and forecast
ok so again we're loading google earth
here we're grabbing three files that are
generated every hour by the air now
system one has the latest conditions at
every major metropolitan area the other
has a forecast for today and a forecast
for tomorrow and I'm just going to zoom
in on one here so we'll see there's one
in the Denver area when you mouse over
it you see the current aqi is 94 which
is a yellow aqi if you click on it you
get a pop-up box and you'll see here
immediately the PM 2.5 AQ is 94 the
ozone aqi is 32 EPA regulations require
that the city's report which evers
highest so that's where the 94 is coming
from and then over on the side you'll
see the radio buttons you can switch to
today's forecast as another view and it
will take it a minute to load these you
can see the forecast for Denver for
today is that it will reach a 50 and if
you click on that again you'll see that
the 50 it looks like ozone and PM are
going to be 50 interesting so that's the
forecast for today similarly if you
click on the next radio button you can
get tomorrow's forecast
and you see it's 54 tomorrow as well one
thing I forgot to point out just so you
know there's no tricks up my sleeve if
you'll notice here this data was at
three o'clock mountain standard time so
it is almost real-time there and lastly
another group in my office does national
emissions inventory which is a
collection of all the facility emissions
data they've also done a KML file with
that data and on this one when you bring
this up it'll show you the locations of
actual plants across the country that's
why there's so many of those little
balloons and if you zoom into one you'll
see the balloon gives you more
information on that facility it also
gives you a graph of the different
emissions coming out of that facility
and their relative contribution of the
total and my favorite feature of this
particular map is if you rotate the map
like so the height of the balloon
actually is the total emissions of those
sources so when you look across the
landscape you can see the highest
balloons or the facilities that are
emitting the highest amount for that
particular area so if we click on one of
those you'll see its emissions are
fairly high compared to some of its
neighbors okay
and that is about all I have I'll
encourage it and visit our to visit our
website Aaron alcove where you can find
a lot more information on air quality
including information about the air
quality index you can get data forecasts
news items publications and a lot more
and at this point I'll take questions
yes ah yes the question was how do we do
forecasts and how good are they the
forecasts are actually done again by the
state and local agencies and they use a
variety of different methods some of
them are statistical some of them are
numeric models and every now and then
they actually use some human intuition
which you could also call a guess and so
the different methods have different
degrees of accuracy and it also depends
a lot on the weather because air quality
is very much affected by the meteorology
so as far as accuracy kind of a rule of
thumb is it's somewhere in the range of
70 to 75 percent on average but it
varies a lot depending on the area and
and the technique I'm another thing I
should add is our friends at NOAA have a
national air quality forecast model for
ozone right now so if you go to Noah's
website you can actually see their
numerical model of the entire country
for ozone and they're doing a
experimental domain for particular
matter there's a lot of different
products out there that figure into the
forecasts okay any other questions thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
