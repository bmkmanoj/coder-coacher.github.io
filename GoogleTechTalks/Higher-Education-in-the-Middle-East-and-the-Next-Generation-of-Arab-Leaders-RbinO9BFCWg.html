big background about the American
University American University in Cairo
was founded 90 years ago and is one of
the leading liberal arts universities in
the Middle East and Arab world auc is a
key contributor to social political
political and cultural life in the
Middle East today gives me great great
pleasure to welcome President David
Arnold the AUC president for the past
five years during his presidency auc has
launched a new graduate school of
business new master's degree programs in
science and engineering expanded
continuing education and extended
scholarships opportunities and
opportunities for needy and deserving
students in Egypt and the entire region
he has also overseen construction the
construction project of a ucs new 400
million dollar project over 260 acre in
New Cairo and it's a five-year project
which will be completed this summer so
please join me in welcoming president
david arnold good afternoon thank you so
much ahmud for that very warm
introduction vomit has been working very
hard to help us organize this first-ever
visit by the team from the American
University in Cairo and I've learned on
this visit that every member of the
Google team has a 20-percent project and
i think a UC has been amans twenty
percent project at least for the last
couple weeks as he's helped us make the
best possible use out of this very
precious time I'm grateful for the
opportunity to give a tech talk I'm not
a techie so this will be a very
non-technical tech talk and I'm
especially honored to be the warm-up
speaker for Condoleezza Rice who
there is coming later and so that's a
very unique privilege what I plan to do
is take about 20 minutes just to share
with you kind of an overview of the
changing landscape that's taking place
in higher education in the Middle East
today I want to talk a little bit about
how a you see our university fits into
that landscape and share also some of
the insights that I've gained over the
past five years during my time as
president of a UC particularly around
the question of the training and
preparation of future generations of
leaders for Egypt and the Arab world I
hope to leave all of you with the sense
that higher education in the Middle East
is not only crucial for the region's
future growth and development it really
is key in terms of global peace and
stability and it is therefore deserving
of active encouragement and support from
all of us from leading US corporations
foundations individuals and
international donors so I'm going to
conclude my remarks by explaining why
despite all of the issues and challenges
that we see in the Middle East today
personally I remain an optimist about
the future of the region and what we can
hope and expect from the next generation
of Arab leaders all of that in 20
minutes and then I hope that we'll have
time for lots of questions let me start
with the changing landscape because the
field of higher education in the Middle
East is in a very dynamic phase there's
a lot going on and I'm sure many of you
have read news reports about the number
of major US research universities that
are establishing degree programs and
campuses in a number of the Gulf states
institutions like Carnegie Mellon
Cornell georgetown texas A&amp;amp;M and most
recently new york university which has
announced plans to build a new campus in
abu dhabi sounds like we have a
technical
computer has annoyed swipe your finger
there we go great all of these new
branch campuses and these us
institutions are coming to the Middle
East at the invitation of and with large
subsidies from a small group of
enlightened Arab leaders and there's an
even larger institution that has
recently been announced and is in the
process of being established in Saudi
Arabia the King Abdullah University of
Science and Technology this is an
incredible bold initiative to create
what I characterizes MIT on the Red Sea
it is to establish a science and
engineering postgraduate research
institution a city for 20,000 people
with a major research university at its
heart with the hope that that by
investing in high-end science and
technology and training next generation
that there will be economic benefits and
development spin-offs taking place as a
result of that investment you may have
heard of cows Taz it's called in the
region it's developing research
partnerships with institutions like
Stanford and Berkeley and a number of
other leading US universities and has
recently joined forces with our
University and a number of research
collaborative enterprises so taken
together all of these elements really
are shifting and changing the Middle
Eastern landscape of higher education
especially among high end
english-language institutions and the
regional leaders that are backing these
new initiatives know very well that the
oil economy will not last forever and
that ultimately the future wealth of the
region depends on the minds of educated
citizen
so these investments that are now going
into establishing a number of new higher
education institutions and branch
campuses really reflect long-term
investment an effort to create and to
support both a knowledge-based economy
and what might be referred to as a
knowledge society in the Arab world and
i think that investment is really the
key and the best hope that we have for
creating a brighter and more prosperous
future for this very very critically
important region now some people find it
surprising that in the midst of
everything else that's taking place in
the Middle East today that somehow
American universities institutions like
our university auc our sister
institutions the American University in
Beirut lebanese american university
american university in sharjah that with
the state of public sentiment toward US
policies perhaps at an all-time low the
demand for the kind of an american-style
higher education that these institutions
provide is if anything at an all-time
high at auc we've seen applications both
from egypt and from other students
throughout the region growing steadily
and now hitting record highs so why is
this happening and what is it what is it
that we are doing that prompts this kind
of response even in a period when
American policies are held and perhaps
the lowest regard in recent history as
the leader of an American University
that has almost a century of experience
now in Egypt I've had a first-hand
opportunity to see the the effect that
american-style higher education has in
stimulating social cultural and
intellectual capital of the region
indeed AUC and our sister institutions
have really helped to shape the region
and very important and positive ways
for nearly a century and unfortunately
these are not the stories that you see
being covered in the press here in the
united states in the West in fact most
of the news that we see from the region
tends to be bad news it's about
terrorism or you know conflict but there
are some good news stories out there and
I want to take a minute to talk about
what is it that accounts for these good
news stories that these institutions of
American higher education represent I
think there are three main factors or
themes that emerged that explain the
success of these institutions and their
durability over the decades first each
of these universities has demonstrated
an ability to educate successive
generations of leaders women and men
that go on to be extremely successful
leaders in both public and private
sectors and who are able to compete very
successfully in the global economy we
find some of them here at Google and
other places and some of the major
high-tech companies we find them in a
number of international organizations UN
agencies all around the world second
well these universities including a UC
have found ways to extend the resources
of their institutions to the societies
that we call home encouraging public
service by our students and faculty and
also contributing to the growth of
strong civil society institutions third
in a period of unprecedented political
conflict and cultural clashes between
east and west we've been able to serve
as an intellectual forum and is a
two-way bridge for the free exchange of
ideas and understanding across cultures
so I want to be clear that as I speak
today about the next generation of young
arab leaders i'm talking about more than
just political leadership because
because i think all of us recognize that
lasting social and
development in the region requires
leaders of many different kinds it needs
business leaders and professional
managers and entrepreneurs who can
create jobs and contribute to economic
growth requires well trained lawyers who
understand the importance of fair
impartial and transparent legal systems
it requires journalists who are able to
link the immediacy of new media to the
values of reform-minded advocacy
teachers who returned to the villages
and urban schools to prepare the next
generation social entrepreneurs to
create NGOs and institutions of civil
society and importantly philanthropist
who are willing to invest in social
progress all of these fields need the
kind of human talent and human resources
that leading universities are capable of
producing now and progress also depends
on the creativity of people like you who
are writing the code that leads to the
products and services of the future and
allows the rest of us to find the
world's information organized at our
fingertips so we need leaders in each of
these sectors and it's the job of the
University to produce these leaders and
to equip them with the skills to succeed
auc I'm proud to say has been educating
precisely these kinds of leaders for
Egypt and the region since our founding
in 1919 and one of the lessons that
we've learned over the past 90 years is
the incredible power of Education to be
a positive agent for social and economic
progress the author hg wells once wrote
that quote human history becomes more
and more a race between education and
catastrophe in those words I think today
serve as a haunting but needed call to
action because to win that race it's
really up to universities to impart the
critical thinking and lifelong learning
skills that are the hallmarks of a
liberal arts education
the need for truly independent minds who
are able to learn question formulate
their own conclusions has rarely been
more important than it is today in Cairo
today a UC students our students are
using the world's most advanced software
and hardware working alongside
well-trained professors and different
fields to create nanotechnology
applications to pursue advanced
biotechnology and the ethics and laws
associated with this emerging field
they're producing environmentally
friendly products from recycled
materials our students are also
researching innovative solutions in
petroleum and alternative energy and
they're doing exciting advanced work in
computer science and electronics
engineering but what's most important is
that as they're learning the the
technical aspects of each of these
disciplines they're doing so in the
framework of a rigorous us-style liberal
arts curriculum and as I witnessed the
contributions and the achievements of
our graduates in a variety of fields I'm
increasingly convinced of the power of
liberal arts education in preparing
young Arabs to be positive change agents
in their societies and in the world our
alumni are leaders in virtually every
aspect of science and engineering law
diplomacy banking media philanthropy and
civil society as well as in the fields
of government and politics we should
mention that some of that is in
opposition politics and while some of
these AUC graduates and alumni are
indeed critical of US policies in the
region their aspirations are similar to
those of young adults everywhere they
want a secure and safe society economic
opportunity for themselves and their
families and honest effect and effective
governing institutions with the tools of
a liberal arts education they're working
consistently toward achieving these
goals some of our alumni are
entrepreneurs like whale Amin
co-founder and CEO of IT works one of
the region's largest software
development firms akhil Bashir who's
chairman of telecom Egypt Karim Ramadan
who I'm sorry to say is the Microsoft
regional director and manager and senior
executives at places like Vodafone GE
Citigroup schlumberger Reuters and
al-jazeera these are in addition to some
of our better known alumni essentials
such as Queen Rania Suzanne Mubarak and
Suzanne's son Gamal Mubarak so we have
lots of people and lots of different
fields doing lots of different things
the second key area where institutions
like a you see are making a difference
is in our ability to extend the
university's resource resources and the
energy of our students into the
communities that are beyond our gates
and to educate our students on the value
and importance of civic engagement we
want our students not only to do well in
whatever field they choose but also to
do good as contributing members of
society more than eighty percent of a
ucs 5,000 degree seeking students are
Egyptian and we've always had an
institutional responsibility to serve
the Egyptian and Arab community and an
obligation to teach our students about
the value and importance of doing the
same this is one element of the
university's original Presbyterian roots
that has not changed with time if
anything our commitment to public
service and community service has grown
stronger over the years and the decades
I could go on at great length about a
uci's vibrant network of student
volunteer and community service clubs
they work with street children and Cairo
they organized book donations for
village libraries they promote
environmental awareness they raise money
for cancer research and treatment they
sponsor core scores of community service
projects in fact more than half of our
students are involved actively and
participate in these activities while
they're at auc and some of them have
gone
on influenced by their experience at the
University to create national NGOs
focused on development social change and
transformation but it's not just our
students and our alumni who are engaged
on these issues we've recently created a
new center for philanthropy and civic
engagement name for our former President
John gearhart which is using University
resources to encourage Arab business
leaders and private citizens to address
socio-economic issues by investing in
communities and creating new civil
society and philanthropic institutions
so universities can play an important
role in helping to stimulate and support
a movement towards strategic
philanthropy that helps promote and
spark social and societal change
certainly given the enormous
accumulation of wealth that's taking
place in the Arab world today combined
with the strong charitable traditions of
the Islamic world we see an enormous
potential for the future in the growth
and development of Arab philanthropy and
our goal is a university and through the
work of the gear heart center is to
document support and facilitate the
emergence of these new forces for social
change within the region more than 50
years ago recognizing some of the
long-term national problems that Egypt
was facing a cauc created a Social
Research Center which has really used
the tools of modern social science
research field based research to tackle
sensitive and urgent research agendas in
Egypt and across the region some of the
early work by the Social Research Center
for example focused on some of the
Nubian villages in Upper Egypt that were
inundated when the construction of the
Aswan Dam and indeed most of the
surviving work of cultural studies and
social understanding the social
structure of those villages was a
product of the very early phase of our
the work of our Social Research Center
today SRC researchers are working with
local NGOs and in partnership with the
Ministry of Social Solidarity in one of
Kairos porous slums I know Sarah where
they're focused on an innovative pilot
project that will alleviate poverty
through a combined effort of targeted
cash transfers and family support
services and as we're reading this the
distressing stories about bread lines
and food riots this kind of innovative
approach has tremendous possibilities in
terms of providing a model for a
meaningful long-term reform of the
social welfare policies and social
safety net programs of the Egyptian
government and it's a wonderful example
I think of how a university using the
tools of modern social science research
can help shape public policy encourage
reforms develop partnerships with local
NGOs all in a way that leads to tangible
improvements in people's lives finally
we're making a difference in the
community through our extensive
continuing education and outreach
programs part-time educational programs
that advance the workforce and provide
professional development are quite
common in the US you think about the
history of the land grant institutions
and extensive extension education
programs going back to the 19th century
it's very much a part of the tradition
of American higher education but in
Egypt in the Arab world these programs
are not common and yet the vocational
and technical skills that are needed to
compete in a global economy have never
been more urgently needed a UC has a
long history of offering adult and
continuing education programs dating
back to the 1920s and today our
continuing education school that reaches
more than 45,000 adult part-time
learners offering courses in information
technology English language basic
business and management skills a variety
of different very practically
oriented courses that give people the
skills needed to get better jobs and to
have better lives for themselves and for
their families the number of students
coming for these kind of short courses
and technical training programs has
actually grown by more than fifty
percent during the time that I've been
president and our plan to move our
academic programs into a wonderful new
campus this coming summer will actually
free up space in our downtown campus so
that we can further expand and
strengthen of these courses going
forward and when you consider the
enormous challenge of youth unemployment
and workforce development in the Middle
East it's very easy to realize and
recognize that higher education
institutions have not only an obligation
but I would say a moral duty to extend
their reach beyond the privileged elite
who can afford the time and the money
that it takes to earn a full-time degree
so it's important that universities
develop and offer these kinds of
practically oriented short courses and
adult education programs and auc is very
proud to be an example for the region of
how this can be done the third and final
area that I want to talk about speaks to
the crucial role that AUC and other
similar institutions play as a bridge a
cultural bridge and educational bridge a
link between the Arab world and the
United States AUC is long played this
role in a way that allows ideas to be
shared in both directions and this
bridge between I divergent ideas is not
just a metaphor it's an everyday reality
on our campus and in our classrooms over
the past few years a UC has tripled the
number of its international students
both degree-seeking students and study
abroad students attracting more than
1,500 students from more than 70
different countries of this past year
nearly twenty percent of our student
body is composed of an
national students and more than thirty
percent of our faculty members come from
the United States as a result the
exchange of viewpoints on everything
from regional politics the impact of
religion and culture on development the
most appropriate path for developing
countries to achieve economic progress
all of these issues are fiercely debated
and are part of the daily academic
discourse that we welcome and embrace at
auc and this is not a new role for us
it's indeed one that that the university
has become very familiar with and my job
is increasingly to explain to the
outside world that all viewpoints are
welcome in the academic environment of
the University I was reminded of the
history the long proud tradition of a UC
presidents having to do this by a story
that dates back to the 1930s when there
was there were riots at auc over a
lecture that was given on the question
of whether women should have equal
rights to men so I'm following in a
well-established tradition of a UC
presidents having to stand and defend
controversial topics in an Egyptian
context but we have this is an
institution that prides itself on being
an open forum for reasoned debate on
complex and frequently controversial
issues two years ago in fact we had
secretary Condoleezza Rice speak at auc
on us support for democracy in the
Middle East I gather she's at Google
today and she may have a warmer
reception here than she had and kyra
when she came to speak on that topic but
other speakers have included more
recently President Jimmy Carter who
sparked controversy when he spoke at auc
in a word hall after having met with
Hamas leaders in Cairo at different
times we've had the Agra Khan we've had
former UN Secretary Kofi Annan french
Foreign Minister Bernard Kushner the
grand Sheikh of Allah's are a Catholic
theologian Hans coup
Nobel laureates writers intellectuals
from around the world who speak to the
middle east and to the the world from a
you see and while we don't go out of our
way to seek comfort controversy we're
also not a shy and retiring about it
either so our cultural bridge runs both
ways not only do we provide a space for
Americans to come and learn firsthand
about this vitally important region are
our part of the world we work very hard
to create the chance for young Egyptians
to learn about discuss and critique
Western ideas cultural values and
institutional forms while we've long
hosted study abroad students at our
Cairo campus and as I mentioned we're
seeing more and more American students
and students from other countries
wanting to learn about and gain a deeper
understanding of the Middle East we're
also actively encouraging our Egyptian
and Arab undergraduates to travel and
study in the US and in other countries
for at least a semester in order to
broaden their their education for us
this dialogue between East and West
between the Arab world and America is a
part of our daily operation it's
embedded in our DNA and as a liberal
arts institution with deep roots in
Egypt in the Middle East we feel that
we're at the Nexus of this critical
dialogue our arabic language institute
is in huge demand as more and more
students seek to gain both linguistic
and cultural proficiency our university
press the AUC press is one of the
leading translators and publishers of
Arabic literature for Western audiences
and our faculty includes some of the
world's great experts and scholars in
fields such as Middle East history
Islamic art and architecture era of
literature Egyptology and even Coptic
studies these are fields of knowledge
that are essential for gaining a deeper
understanding of this complex historic
and strategically important
the world the students who go abroad
from a UC to study and other places and
other cultures are in fact living proof
that engaging with ideas other than our
own almost always reduces what may seem
like an unbridgeable gap and enables
understanding and even respect for
alternative points of view institutions
like a UC are also crossing borden
borders through science and technology
alliances for example our Science and
Technology Research Center partners with
Cambridge University Center for
nanoscience in some of the
nanotechnology work that we're doing and
other research and science partnerships
include major research universities in
the US and Europe and recently as I
mentioned the King Abdullah University
of Science and Technology in Saudi
Arabia I should note that cows recently
recruited scholarship students to form
the first class of its entering graduate
students who will be invited to begin
their studies that cast in September of
2009 they recruited a hundred and
eighty-five scholars that were selected
from more than 5,000 applications
worldwide I'm proud to say that 32 of
those were from Egypt and 29 of those
are a UC students so we're pretty we're
very proud of the fact that our students
seem to do quite well in terms of this
kind of global competition and I think
part of the reason for that is that we
really have placed very high emphasis on
not just the technical training and
education that our students receive but
the teaching them not what to think but
how to think how to reason how to arrive
at logical conclusions and to express
themselves on complex issues and
questions our university is proud to
have a faculty-student ratio that is
about 12.5 to one which is an envia
below we have about 400 faculty members
full-time faculty members and other 200
adjunct faculty members and about 5,000
students nothing is done by
road we challenge students to think to
debate to discuss and they also
challenged us which i think is healthy
and we challenge ourselves as was
mentioned earlier over the past five
years we've been in the process of
building an entire new 21st century
state-of-the-art campus we've invested
four hundred million dollars in the
future of Egypt the future of the Middle
East and the future of our University
this new campus which will be completed
the summer will enable us to accomplish
great things in our next hundred years
the summer we will be moving all of our
academic programs our research
facilities and our library to the
state-of-the-art new campus and we'll be
opening the doors to the first students
to study in this new campus in September
of this year if it's possible to imagine
it's a green campus in the middle of the
desert it's not green because of
artificial turf or excessive use of
water it was designed with environmental
conservation principles as part of the
core value of the University and its
really a model in terms of making the
most efficient use of scarce water
resources and scarce energy resources I
hope that we'll have time to show you
some images of the campus because it is
actually quite inspiring in terms of the
combination of the best technology of
the 21st century together with wonderful
architectural motifs from that are that
would feel very comfortable in Egypt and
in the region it will be the site for
145 new science and engineering labs an
academic conference center and second to
none a 700,000 volume great University
Library at its core and it's also a
campus like this campus that is designed
to promote and encourage human
interaction because it's through that
interaction between and among students
and faculty that the
work of the university is advanced and
accomplished so in my conversations here
at Google today I'd like to invite all
of you to come and visit the new campus
of a UC to get acquainted with our
University and what it has to offer and
we're very pleased to have the
opportunity to begin some exploratory
conversations with a number of
colleagues here at Google about ways in
which we might be able to collaborate
and work together to advance our shared
values and shared goals let me conclude
today by emphasizing the fact that since
that tragic September day in 2001 I
think we've all learned that desperation
despair and closed minds anywhere can be
a threat to civilization everywhere we
all should know by now that development
and economic progress go hand-in-hand
with education and that one cannot exist
without the other and I hope we've also
come to understand that soft power is
often more effective than other forms of
engagement in dealing with the very real
problems at hand Egypt today stands at a
crossroads it's a critically important
nation perhaps the most important nation
and a critically important part of the
world it's also a nation that is the
facing enormous challenges and problems
intractable poverty unacceptably high
unemployment widespread illiteracy
growers growing religious fundamentalism
and tremendous environmental challenges
across the wider Middle East and North
Africa region the demographers tell us
that there will be more than 800 million
new entrance to the labor pool in the
next 20 years 80 I'm sorry 80 million 80
million new folks coming into the labor
market who need the skills that are
necessary to compete and a
knowledge-driven global economy so the
stakes are high perhaps higher than
they've ever been before
and we understand how demographic shifts
and conflict politics can further under
undermine the region's socio-economic
balance we see the stress on a vibrant
middle class and the ever widening gap
between rich and poor well we come away
convinced that we must use education to
address these imbalances and to help a
new generation of leaders build the
necessary institutions of civil society
and while the outlook may sometimes seem
grim educators by definition tend to be
optimist because if we didn't believe
that the world could be a better place
why would we bother to invest in the
next generation and as I look at the
faces of the young AUC graduates who
march confidently across the stage at
commencement time to receive their
diplomas I cannot help but to be an
optimist to be helpful about a future in
which radicalism is trumped by education
and the prosperity that comes with it a
future in which tolerance and reason
prevail progress is sustained through
responsible growth and development and
where the moderate center holds but
optimism alone is never enough to
maintain the broader institutions of
civil society if human history is indeed
a race between education and catastrophe
then ultimately the next generation of
leaders will have to ensure that
education wins that race in their
villages in their cities and in their
countries the Middle East is to reap the
benefits of the global economy if it is
to unlock its full potential if it is to
bridge the development gap an engaged
educational community is one key the one
absolutely essential ingredient for real
progress to take place in closing I want
to say that I simply do not accept the
theory of the clash of civilizations in
fact I see just the opposite lesson both
in history and in my own and a you seize
experience in the region
bridges can be built people of good will
want to come together to build a better
world and universities are the place
where this human Enterprise this
creative and constructive process can
and must begin thank you very much and I
look forward to your questions the floor
is open here and around the world I
guess I've been asked if people do have
questions if they could use the
microphone so that they can be picked up
and recorded for posterity okay um my
question is so after five years being
the president of the AUC in American
University in Cairo and being in the
region in general how do you see our
envision the future of Education in then
in in the region so that's number one
and number two specifically to Egypt
with the proliferation now of private
universities that that open and so yeah
I mean like specifically how do you
envision the future of Education there
well first of all I welcome the opening
of new universities both branch campuses
of existing institutions and the
creation of new private institutions in
the region my own view is the
competition is a good thing that the
more choices that people have that
families have the better the key
question and the one that I think is
going to require a lot of effort by both
those of us in the field of higher
education and by the ministries and the
responsible government authorities is
really quality control because a large
number of the new private universities
that are being created are really
proprietary institutions they're
basically a higher education for fun and
profit and I'm someone that's convinced
that you really cannot provide high
quality higher education
do it in a way that makes a lot of money
you don't invest in research you don't
invest in libraries you don't make the
kinds of social commitments that are
necessary to provide a rich beneficial
experience for students if your main aim
is to maximize profits so I am very
skeptical about some of the newer
institutions that we find popping up
that really are degree mills that really
are just you know collecting tuitions
and issuing diplomas without having a
strong commitment to quality and quality
control and the education they provide I
think there is an enormous challenge
ahead in terms of the reform of national
universities Cairo University for
example has 250,000 students alexandria
university is 185 or 190 thousand
students today and all of us realize
that managing trying to provide a
quality experience for that many
students even if you have well trained
faculty is an extraordinarily difficult
thing to do so I think there's a lot of
work to be done in terms of higher
education reform not just in Egypt but
throughout the region I'm pleased to see
that progress is being made that there
are now more and more countries that are
looking at quality control mechanisms
accreditation mechanisms educational
reform policies and that they're also
paying attention to what they need to do
at the primary and secondary level so
that the students by the time they reach
University have the skills that are
required to be able to succeed at an
international standard so as I said I'm
an optimist by Nature I'd like to think
that over the next 5 10 15 years we're
going to see tangible improvements in
the quality of education certainly the
rhetoric is there the key issue is
really the resources to support that set
of goals and the kind of enlightened
policy and management practices that are
necessary to improve the quality of
education that's being offered
I have another question it may be very
specific but as an Egyptian I always
wondered why a UC doesn't have a medical
school in Egypt specifically now that I
mean we know that we have high talented
doctors I mean like a cairo university
or Alexander is alexander university
they the graduates are that they are
highly talented people however they
don't have similar like us high
standards for being for being an a
doctor and the old like face a I mean
hard time in order to get the the US
certification or I mean to practice here
so why wouldn't there be something like
I would say a medical school or at least
a program that can teach this us
standards for the doctors thanks thank
you it's a it's a it's a good question
it's one that I'm frequently asked
particularly because our sister
institution the American University in
Beirut has a long-standing well
established medical school auc follows
an american-style curriculum and as you
know in Egypt medicine is not something
that is pursued after you've finished
your undergraduate a schooling it's
something you go right into we do offer
a pre-med program so students can do the
equivalent of what they would do if they
were going to a u.s. Medical School and
indeed some of our graduates coming out
of our biology major or other science
majors are going on than to do medicine
as a postgraduate degree including at
the newest Medical School in the region
the Cornell while medical school and
Doha some of our some of their first
students coming directly into the
medical program at Cornell we're in fact
coming out of our pre-med program at a
you see there's a resource oh there's
part of part of the answer that is
related to curriculum and
you know an American what an
american-style University can do and
where we fit in the educational ecology
of Egypt there's also a very serious
resource question the Cornell while
medical school in in Doha as being
helped by the the qatar foundation to
build a Research Hospital it's at eight
hundred and ninety million dollar
project 350 bed so that's about three
million dollars of bed one of my trusty
said he'd really love to feel what it's
like to sleep in a three-million-dollar
bed I'm not sure I go through that but
you know do high-end medical training
and education is a very
resource-intensive proposition and to be
quite honest we're putting our resources
right now into building a 400 million
dollar new campus that's a big
undertaking for a small University like
ours so Troy vaya one step at a time we
will get there I have a question about
relationships of American universities
and the government's in Egypt on Middle
East like you said get your education
for critical thinking and at the same
time I felt like several people who I
stood for blogging to critically maybe
for the government on all kind of
freedom of speech teachers so do have
any limitations imposed by the
government any other problems that's
that's a great question we operate in
Egypt under the terms of a bi-national
protocol there's actually both a
cultural agreement between the US
government and the Egyptian government
and a protocol agreement between the
University our board of trustees and the
Ministry of Higher Education those
frameworks really provide a lot of
independence in terms of the academic
life of our institution controversial
issues and topics can be openly debated
and discussed in our campus in a way
that if you
openly debated and discussed those
issues among large groups of people
outside of our campus you might well get
well people might be upset with you so
there is a well-established kind of
place and space that is actually very
well respected I'm pleased to say by the
Egyptian authorities they actually work
very hard to to ensure the security
outside of our campus but to make sure
that we have the maximum amount of
freedom and flexibility inside our
campus having said that some of our
professors like Professor saadeddine
Ibrahim have been active as critics and
political appoint opponents and voices
for democracy for human rights in some
cases their activities outside the
university in support of NGO work or
election monitoring or those sorts of
things have landed them up in detention
and in trouble and in fact professor
saadeddine Ibrahim right now is outside
of Egypt and as not does not feel you
know able to return because of the legal
threats that would exist against them so
it's a very it is certainly the overall
political environment does create an
atmosphere that does not encourage the
cut that kind of broader more open
discussion but within the confines of
the university there is quite a wide
scope for intellectual debate discussion
on important political and policy
questions we do face some government
regulations and censorship in terms of
imported books and publications some of
those are not always the most thoughtful
for example a textbook that was entitled
the fundamentals of maintenance which
was for a course in mechanical
engineering was held up by the customs
authorities in Santa al-azhar to have a
review to make sure that
it wasn't dealing with a different kind
of fundamentalism so there are you know
bureaucratic routines that we go through
that have to be worked worked out but
this is part of operating again with the
as guests of the Egyptian people and
with the support and encouragement of
the Egyptian government so I guess
during my last couple of years at auc I
noticed a great scholarship program that
we introduced to those that are very
very needy from different parts of Egypt
and the region and I just wanted to
maybe get or maybe educate more the
audience about how this program is going
and what kind of future it offers for
these people that wouldn't have had such
opportunities and how you see it also
going with the new campus and all the
new resources that we have there right
thank you very much for asking about the
scholarship programs more than sixty
percent of our students receive some
form of financial aid or scholarship
either needs based financial aid or
merit scholarships but we also offer
every year twenty scholarships for top
students coming out of Egypt's
government schools these are public
school scholarships and those students
we've been doing this for a number of
years and over the years more than
seventy percent of the students that are
awarded these public school scholarships
end up graduating with honors or high
honors and many of them go on to
graduate school and do great things
about five years ago we started a new
program that reaches out to students
from across Egypt and selects one female
and one male student from each of
Egypt's 27 governor it's and brings them
to a UC these are students that have
studied in the government schools that
would never have the resources or the
opportunity to study at auc and thanks
to generous support from USAID we're
able to bring them to a UC frequently
they require at least one semester of
intensive English language and then they
go into a full four-year undergraduate
program with a variety of leadership
development workshop
copsa mid-year conference a number of
other enrichment activities that enable
them to really acquire the skills to be
future leaders in whatever field they
choose to pursue we now have 200 of
these students we've been bringing 50
for each year for the last four years
we're going to bring the fifth cohort to
a you see this coming of this coming
September they'll be studying on the new
campus but these are extraordinary
students were proud that for one-third
of them we have the funds to bring them
for a semester in the US and that is a
life-changing experience for them I mean
it just shatters all of the stereotypes
we had a chance to meet with about a
dozen of these students who are studying
at in New York at SUNY New Paltz last
week when the Board of Trustees was in
New York and they've had a phenomenal
experience even though they were
probably never colder in their whole
life than they were in January and
upstate New York it was a it's been a
great experience and we'd love to see
more and more of our Egyptian students
have a similar kind of cultural
experience and educational experience of
studying here in the US our aim
ultimately is to have at least ten
percent of each incoming class the
students who are coming from the
government schools who are on full
scholarship and who are not the usual
suspects of students coming from more
elite segments of Egyptian society
other questions if not I think we're at
the end of our time I'm very grateful
for all of you coming i hope we'll have
a chance to chat informally after this
and again we'd like to invite all of you
to come and visit a you see it's a
phenomenal remarkable institution in a
wonderful place and we'd be very
delighted to welcome you and to have a
chance to show you some of the the
things that we're trying to achieve with
the new campus thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
