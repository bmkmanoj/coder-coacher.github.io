hindin I'm very pleased to be have been
asked to come and speak here today I've
I got to you know sort of a long road
for me i had the well it's a mixture of
seeing seeing the potential and being in
the right place at the right time i
worked for BBN when BBN was doing
building the ARPANET and got to work
with vent as he was the program manager
and you know got to work on some of the
early internet stuff and we we at BBN or
at least the little group I had we built
the what was essentially the first
operational routers and we also had the
contract to actually run operate the
internet so I was maybe the first or one
of the first internet operators and it's
been really a wonderful for me is
personally it's been really wonderful to
have had the opportunity to sort of work
on the first the beginning of the
internet and continue through a number
of companies and standards and stuff to
you know to get to we are here and once
when I first saw her that vent was going
to google i think i sent you sort of
like every six month an email which says
so what's google doing with ipv6 and and
so here we are so this is really quite
good so I'm going to Steven worthless
there we go so I'm going to talk today
about do a little introduction but I
think this is important then sort of
with my nokia hat on talk talk about why
why I think it's especially important
for mobile devices you know ones with
batteries do a very brief overview of
nokia nokia support for v6 and then and
then some thoughts on you know v6 and
google you know and it's a little i
realize not living here it's a little
presumptuous of me to suggest what you
might do but you know I've been in the
valley since 92 and it's been sort of
interesting to see Google
be founded and see more and more of
these buildings you know around here
start to have google signs on them so
scene you've seen you from the outside
now i am used your stuff quite a lot and
I like you know like apps that you've
built for our devices like google maps
that I think work quite well so it's
basically a lot of collaboration going
on so you know as a several the previous
speakers have said it's really a
question of when v6 is going to happen
not not you know or when addresses are
going to run out you know five five six
years ago it was you know projections
were much further out and a set of
events that I don't think anyone is
completely clear on but the allocation
rates really have gone up and you know
it's you know we're approaching zero and
address the floor address exhaustion was
the main reason that v6 was first you
know the activity in the ITF to develop
me sick started you know it clearly took
longer than we expected cider helped a
lot in the in the short term because the
class B's we're running out very quickly
and then I think Nats have prolonged it
even more but you know now we're said
you know we're seeing the time we got by
doing those things I think is good run
out and you know if Nats by themselves
could completely solve this then you
know we wouldn't be seeing the before
addresses continued to be used and so I
think it's it's really time for everyone
involved that too you know for action
you know time for debating it you know
whether it's the right protocol it's
guilty not perfect you know I think
Steve gearing and I were the Chilean of
chairs and authors of some of the core
rfcs and I don't think either of us
would say that it came out the way we
would have liked you know the ITF is a
big consensus organization and you know
you know I have my own list which I
won't share it with you today of the way
I think it would have been bad
but you know that sort of pointless you
know that's that's back in the past we
all have ways we think it could have
been better but we have it today and it
does work and we should deploy it so
yeah I guess the other thing to talk
about here is so what happens when we
don't do this and we're clearly going to
get multiple layers of gnats and there's
you know I think we're going to
basically lose the architectural
principles that made the internet
possible and I'm not just you know this
is sometimes talk to about the
end-to-end model but I actually you know
the the internet got designed for sort
of you know this architecture that was
switched by ARPA you know which in
theory was for military usage but I
actually think that the the properties
of ipv4 are the Datagram protocol
actually made possible to build a
commercial Internet I'm not sure that we
were thinking I mean at least I wasn't
thinking about that maybe that was right
so but but I think a lot of the
properties of the architecture made it
possible you know made it possible make
it easy to connect you know it wasn't
like the phone network that required
lots of central coordination and so that
worried about losing this architecture
is that we're going to an architecture
that doesn't scale and and go the same
way as what we have now and it's sort of
you know it's a it's a more subtle thing
this you know it's easy to do the band
aids but it's you know I don't you know
I don't think we would have gotten what
we have today and I don't know where it
will go it's going to be a lot nastier
the other thing that's going to happen
is there's going to be a market for
public before addresses and this is
probably starting to happen a little bit
today but this is going to clearly be a
we're going we'd end up in a world where
people with money have addresses and
people without money won't and I worried
that that's you know it'll be a free
market of addresses but I worry that
that's going to clearly cause regulation
because it's it's going to be a world
that's cool
you know excludes large parts of the
world and there's a lot of political
power that won't accept that and I
prefer not to live in an Internet that
you know no disrespect to anyone from I
can but if you think I can as bad wait
till the UN gets it so you know I think
we're much better i think that the the
innovation we can do by having it not be
regulated is much better and i guess the
other way to look at this is you know if
we don't do v6 we don't keep this
internet product you know Datagram
protocol going the way it was envisioned
i think will largely have you know eaten
the goose that laid the golden egg the
internet has been this wonderful
mechanism for wealth creation and
innovation and communication between
people and you know there's a lot of
short-term activity that goes on because
I you know I won't only want to solve my
local problem but I think it's time we
all step back and solve the global
problem so I'll go into why this is
important for mobile devices you know
this going to be as protect projected to
be over three billion cell phones you
know by the end of this year there's a
real push in the in a lot of these
devices for always on applications ones
that want to keep connections up and to
do this you really end up with a choice
between v4 with NAT with frequent keep
allies or v6 and long live connections
and so I believe that and a lot of my
colleagues at nokia believe that v6 is
actually really important for to help
save battery life and if you're building
devices without power cords this is
really important and a lot of the
usability is how long the device stays
on and the problem we have today is that
to be if you're using v4 there behind
Nats the always-on applications are
always used doing keeper lives and the
trouble is you know so different
different Nats have different time
periods the timing out the state and
cannot ranges from
40 seconds 25 minutes we've actually
done some measurement of this trouble is
you don't know what natural ways you for
the minimum so you end up with about a
30 second keep-alive period and that
basically runs down the battery you know
the thing you learn fairly early when
you're doing networking on mobile
devices is that using the transmitter is
expensive you know well turning on the
radio is expensive but that actually
it's so cheaper to receive than to
transmit and so having to wake up and
send a keepalive is expensive especially
if there's not no data being transferred
so it's you know you can do the you know
one every 30 seconds three billion
phones that's a lot of packets and you
know this happens because here there
stayed in the middle of the net you can
even read the slides you know needs to
be refreshed and you know it's it's
really better to avoid this but to make
this worse there's starting to be lots
of applications to do this and and
they're not you know all the
applications want to do this themselves
because they don't know what else is
running there's not a central it's not
like it's happening at the IP layer in
in the device you know so different
applications are all doing this so you
sort of get the you got a multiplication
factor here so it gets even worse there
so yeah so so we think there's sort of a
from a mobile device point of view
there's really a key the battery life
thing is reason enough to do this plus
they're the you know all the other
issues just like having stable addresses
but just just to keep the battery life
and the phones from having to be
recharged frequently as a real wind so
we have implementations of v6 in a whole
range of our devices we got at this
fairly early some of the pictures up
here you can't buy anymore some are new
some are all you know this is newer
the symbian OS that most of our devices
run you know has v4 and v6 I think we
actually wrote the original v6
implementation and gave it back to
symbian and then we have you know
application support on this the you know
though you know why we have been fairly
active the them you know clearly the
market for v6 has been slow and you know
we I think we need to do a lot more to
to make sure all of our new applications
work would be six that they work with v6
only there's a bunch of other things you
know we've you know we have it in the in
the stack but we need to do more to make
it work seamlessly we've done summit we
have done some applications that work v6
only we did a mobile TV application on
the 1092 that work quite well with v6 we
also have a security group a group that
build security products over in Mountain
View that's actually where I I work and
we've had b6 in those products for for a
long time um you know they may be the
first commercial v6 security products
and the I think that one main point here
is that why this is important for even
for people who aren't running v6 is the
you know the bad guys so actually
discovered v6 is a nice covert channel
and because a lot of commercial security
devices you know cv6 and don't look at
it don't look at what's in it they use
it as a back channel so you know you may
not be using v6 as a service but
somebody else might be using it on your
network and it's a you know maybe a nice
mechanism to control bots it's you know
the guys who do this are really good
early adopters right it's a good in the
bad news
so yes yeah I guess there's been spammed
now with v6 and so you know is that a
good thing or a bad thing I think it's a
good thing for v6 but listen for
everything else is about the same you
know wonder if there'll be more spam or
less pan with basics I think it will be
the same so I had a few thoughts about
v6 and Google you know I apologize in
advance it you know these are things you
have to decide but you know there's some
you know from from the standing on the
outside of this you know I've been
involved in v6 since the beginning and
have you know some view for how well
this is going you know I think all of us
working on it have slightly different to
use you know Randy has one view minds we
agree on a lot of things don't agree on
everything and so you know I've some
views of what what I think is important
so I mean I guess the first question is
why you know why would Google be
interested in this it's stuck you know
Google is doing pretty well I think your
stock is doing well you're building lots
of cool applications that work over the
network you know the v4 internet seems
to work you know why would you bother
doing this what's I guess the the thing
that always comes up in you know in
commercial companies is what's the
business case for this you know we want
to solve our problems and our customers
problems not everybody else's problems
this was so much easier when we did the
NCP TCP transition where there was one
guy one organization in charge and we
can actually turn the old one off and
you know get a transition day and a
couple test days and you know I don't
that's that's not the internet we live
in though it would make this easier but
so you know I think one idea here is
that these things will make connections
to your customers better and i think you
know if we end up with the world of
multiple layers of nat it's not clear
there's going to be one internet it's
not clear everyone connected to it will
actually have access to services
everywhere else you know they're going
to be it's going to be really messy and
separate and so it's going to be harder
for you to talk to your customers and I
you know so if you think about b6 it's
sort of b6 will enable you know stable
bindings with say six billion future
google customers always on customers you
know you it's going to be really hard to
do that with with v4 it's just going to
get very messy you know I'm not saying
it's impossible but it's just going to
be messy and expensive and you're going
to have to deploy way more
infrastructure and servers to do this
you know I've heard you know read stuff
about Google getting involved in mobile
devices and you know I've seen that
you've bid on the 700 megahertz spectrum
and so the problem you know the problems
we've noticed the Nokia about battery
life will be ones that you will also
have to deal with and I assume you have
the vision of you know supporting lots
and lots of mobile wireless users and
you know the v6 is a much better
platform for that I think you can build
new applications that enable you know
take advantage of the features that v6
provides you know it's it's sort of
restores this end-to-end model and the
the other thing which you know I was
thinking about last night when I was
finishing up these slides is you know
we've gotten to the world where like
everything is going through an
intermediary or you know if you're doing
I am your packets are probably going
through IM server somewhere and beast
you know if you can actually if you have
connectivity between the two end points
directly you can use the server to do
the rendezvous but the actual packets
can then go through go directly and
again I'm wildly speculating here but
you know I read about you guys building
really large hosting centers you know in
places where there's bandwidth and lots
of cheap electricity
and my guess is that you know even even
with your resources you're going to find
this gets to be hard to scale so if you
can move some of these applications to
ones where the all the traffic isn't
going through the servers but can go
directly between the endpoints I think
that's going to be a win and the you
know the scaling of your server
deployment will be better and you know
so yeah sort of a leading to this I mean
I think you may find that there's
significant advantage in using v6
internally you know I say move away from
V for addressing constraints you know
the you know so I remember what v4 was
like when we you know first used it and
addresses were plentiful and so forth
and now we have this world where we you
know it's just the story of the footing
the frog in the water in the pot of
water and you turn you know if you drop
it in the boiling water it jumps out and
if you heat it up slowly it cooks well
you know the v4 world in some sense
we've been cooking for a long time we've
gotten used to the added complexity you
know the notion that you're limited to
them by the number of host addresses on
your subnet you know this is an idea
that you know people just gotten sort of
used to they've gotten used to very
careful management of address allocation
so much that some people think it's the
only way to do it and I think there's a
lot of things that we've gotten used to
in the v4 world that don't have to be
that way they're actually expensive and
complicated you know people corporations
trying to do secure you know VPNs from
one net10 space to another net Teton
sendspace somewhere else this is really
hard stuff to get work get working in
debug when it doesn't work you know so
we've moved you know we we have you know
the water is a lot hotter than it used
to be and we've sort of gotten used to
it but you know we do this does give us
a chance to fix some of these things and
so I think you know if you can get to a
v6 only internal architecture for you
our users internal users and your I
assume content distribution in your
servers I think you may email it it's
actually a lot simpler and cheaper and
so some specific things that I think
Google can do you know is start
providing some public content / v6 you
know the one of the we're doing you know
in the v6 deployment we're doing pretty
well in a bunch of areas you know it's
it's in a lot of operating systems it's
in a lot of routers you know all these
things need to get better it's in some
some it's in a range of thing but what
weather is the real lack of is content
you know in some sense the only real v6
content is the you know the dancing calm
a turtle you know that's how you know v6
is working i can see the turtle dance
and but there's not a lot else and so I
believe you guys have a lot of content
so Billy something you can do here so I
think this would be very helpful to do
obviously you know I'm not recommending
that you make WWE google com have quad a
records because I think there's going to
be a lot of devices out there they get
lower service but I think you can
probably come up with some things that
you can do that don't break it for the
general user but do do make it
accessible I think you can look into
building new applications that take
advantage of the v6 end-to-end
properties you know who clearly do some
sort of high quality video conferencing
where the you know the direct
connections are very important you
clearly would don't want to go through a
server I think there's a lot of you know
things in the presence collaboration
user to user space that might be very
interesting if you were to offer some be
six versions of existing applications
and services I think it would help
generate ipv6 demand and essentially
especially if it was something you
couldn't get to with v4 if you did
something special for v6 it would
actually provide a carrot to user so
encourage people to connect to have b6
so they could get to this content or
services I mean so far I think there's
been a little back connection about
people thinking about offering free porn
but you know I'm not going to put that
on my slides though that you know it's
one of the internet secrets is like so
what really generated all that traffic
but I hope that's not the thing that
drives v6 but you know I'll take it if
we have it but so but I think you can
probably think of some things that you
you're doing that you could make it
accessible with v6 that would allow you
know encourage users to actually want to
get v6 service make sure it's working on
their devices you know not in a way that
breaks stuff but just you know for the
people who are interested they'll
they'll be more motivated because right
now you know the dancing turtle isn't
enough though it's a wonderful dancing
turtle so just in summary you know visa
vie for addresses are going to be
exhausted soon you know it's not really
when the matters now but it's soon
enough that we have to do something
about and it's you know but soon there's
still time to stick to make this not
completely crazy but if we wait too much
longer it's going to get much harder i
think v6 is really important for mobile
devices with always on services the the
things you have to do to work around
Nats and and that and it just boggles my
mind to think about if I have multiple
layers of gnats how I deal with how you
build applications that work in those
environments reliably in ways that
provide good communication and I I the
reason I was excited to come here as I
think Google can have a very important
role in building the ipv6 internet so
thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
