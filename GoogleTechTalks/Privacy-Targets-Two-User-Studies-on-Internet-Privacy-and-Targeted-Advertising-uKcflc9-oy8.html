McDonald she is a PhD candidate in
engineering and public policy at
Carnegie Mellon University and there
she's a member of the scilab usable
privacy and security research laboratory
some of you may have heard of it it's
called his commonly referred to as cups
her interests and the intersection of
internet technology policy economics and
law Alicia's research includes the
efficacy of industry self-regulation
behavioral economics and mental models
of privacy network traffic analysis to
combat spyware automotive privacy and
RFID technology in addition to
experience working for software startups
Alicia holds a master's in public policy
and management and a BA in a
professional writing both from Carnegie
Mellon her findings have been featured
in media outlets such as a Washington
Post our technical free press media
minute and have contributed to testimony
before the Federal Trade Commission so
without further ado I'd like to welcome
Alicia thank you so much to Jenni for
setting this up and for that great
introduction it's been a long time to
get this together and I really
appreciate the opportunity to talk to
all of you today so today first I'm
going to go over a couple of things by
way of background so we're all talking
about the same things and then I'll go
very quickly through three different
studies the first one has to do with
behavioral advertising it's a small
study of 14 people we did in-depth
interviews with them the second study
follows that up with a larger online
study and then the third study looks at
types of advertising beyond behavioral
advertising so together these are three
papers about 66 pages maybe a little bit
longer I'll just be hitting the
highlights
when these papers are published they'll
be up on the website at cops cs CMU edu
and i'll finish the talk if we have time
today we may run out of time but if we
have time I'll talk about some
implications for technologists in people
in education and in public policy so
advertisers have a common problem one of
the first owners of department stores
complained that half of the money he
spent on advertising was completely
wasted his problem was he didn't
which half so as mass media with radio
and television rolled out across the
country advertisers were able to reach
the entire country instantaneously all
at once and they had the problem that
very few products have universal appeal
so if they could they wanted to tailor
the ads that they purchased to just be
to the people who are interested in
those products or services that they
were selling and the Internet has some
unique properties that allow it as a
mass media to help further that goal of
tailoring so today we'll be talking
about five different types of internet
advertising so contextual the basic idea
here is that if you're selling a product
for quilting put it on a quilting
website not a golfing website if you're
selling golf tees don't advertise to
quilters for behavioral the basic idea
is that somebody goes to a bunch of
different websites they may have
different search terms all of that
information is aggregated together then
there's a behavioral profile based on
that raw data so share for somebody
searching for different hobbies and
retirements we might have a category of
likely over 50 years old and then
advertisers use those categories for
example perhaps retirement planners
would be interested in people likely
over 50 years old suit target or ad
sales people and then affiliate
marketing is interesting because this is
a term that has sort of two different
meanings the first meaning has been
affiliates of other companies this might
be sort of a multi-level marketing kind
of a deal some people have suggested
that be renamed performance marketing
and there are people who think of the
affiliates in affiliate marketing more
as sort of a friend to friend marketing
but rather than try to decide between
these two definitions we have a great
example of both Facebook's beacon
program which did have both of those
elements so that's kind of the model
that I'm using when I talk about
affiliate marketing today and if
affiliate is difficult I'm not even
going to try to define the cloud there
are plenty of articles that fail to do
that but the basic idea for
based advertising is that you have some
files perhaps email photos things along
those lines that are hosted elsewhere in
cloud computing and then advertising is
based on the content of those files and
displayed and finally deep packet
inspection based the idea here is you
have a server maybe it's your ISP and
you have a file say email and you're
sending it around so that file is broken
into smaller pieces called packets and
the inspection of the packets the
content in the packets while they're in
transit is the hallmark here and so
again it's advertising based on the
content of files that people are sending
or transferring around so of these five
different types one of these things is
not like the others for contextual if
you're an advertiser what you need to
know about is the website you're
choosing to put your ads on for the
other four types what you need to know
about is the person you are advertising
to in fact it doesn't matter at all
which website the ads are hosted on you
just care about the characteristics of
the person you're targeting so then to
do that you need user data and where
there's user data there are privacy
issues and that brings me to what we're
talking about today so their privacy
issues around the data that's being
collected around the inferences that are
being drawn about all of that data
that's being collected and then
sometimes also about the categories
people are being placed in there's
another wrinkle to this too which is
that some of this data is inherently non
anonymized in its raw form and we saw
this with the example of AOL releasing
their search terms
people ego surf they search for their
own names they search for their social
security numbers they search for their
home address IP addresses are classified
legally as personally identifiable
information in some countries there's a
great paper that came out recently from
Peter at iff about browser
fingerprinting 80% of web browsers are
unique based on characteristics of the
web browsers and a clever advertiser
looked at typing patterns to
differentiate people on
killer computer this is back to the
concept of a typing fist from telegraph
operators they could tell who the other
telegraph operators were just based on
the way that dots and dashes were put
across the line so if you imagine that
now with typing those patterns are
uniquely identifiable especially if
you're just down to a couple of users on
a given machine so these are things that
inherently have some aspects that are
personally identifiable but there are
useful bits of data so we have this
tension where advertisers want as much
data as possible so that they can target
their ads and then there are a lot of
concerns users have about how that data
is collected the inference is drawn and
the categories they're placed into so
I'm gonna give you just sort of three
things to think about while I go through
these different papers I'll be referring
to so the first one to kind of keep in
mind is a sort of little mini preview is
that people genuinely have different
privacy preferences now if they didn't
this would be simple we could say these
things are private these things are
public we're gonna have a complete
division we'll pass a law we're done
everybody go home it would just be
implementation and an engineering
problem from then on but it's more
complicated than that a second thing to
kind of watch for is the interaction
with people's mental models of online
things so a mental model is just the
internal representation that people have
of how something works so for example if
my mental model is that anytime I see a
link at the bottom that says privacy
policy if I believe that means that my
privacy is protected by law and there's
a study that shows that's the case then
why would I even click the link and look
at all of that legalese I'm already
protected right so that's the type of
thing that can happen where somebody's
mental model of understanding how the
world works is off and it affects their
privacy decision-making and the third
sort of thing to keep in mind is this
concept of Industry self-regulation that
we have in the United States rather than
a lot of laws a lot of regulation from a
group like the Federal Trade Commission
instead industry is to set up guidelines
and be sort of self policing this
requires that users
enough to be able to enact any
preferences that they have about privacy
now the good news is this enables people
to make different decisions especially
as we saw in the first they have
different preferences but the bad news
is there's a really high knowledge bar
so kind of look at where that knowledge
bar needs to be for them to make the
decisions versus what you see through
these studies so the first one was these
in-depth interviews and we talked to 14
people with semi structured interviews I
had a list of questions I asked
everybody Plus follow up in depth based
on things that they told me and these
were people recruited in Pittsburgh they
were all over 18 the sample was skewed
young half of them were under age 30 and
there came from diverse backgrounds so
just some highlights of the results we
asked about identification of internet
advertising the first asked about Google
search all 14 of the participants use
Google search it is their favorite
search bar none they all understand that
there are ads with the results on Google
search even without a screenshot in
front of them they were able to say
where the ads were they're down the side
there across the top and they were also
able to talk about sponsored ads as
meaning that it's something for pay now
they're sort of knowledge horizon was
that they didn't understand how it is
that ads are paid for but that's not bad
they understand the concept in contrast
we showed a screenshot of the New York
Times and they were not able to identify
even with a screenshot in front of them
what the ads were there were some real
differences of opinion
now some people just skipped everything
that wasn't a picture now clearly people
understand that text links can be ads or
else they wouldn't have understood that
with Google so that's not the failing
but they thought anything that was just
a text link could not be an ad there
were other people who saw ads is
innately third party so for example
subscribe to the New York Times was not
considered an ad and then there was at
the far extreme one individual who
thought every single thing on the page
was an ad including the editorial
content she said well that's got to be
some PR firm right
a press release so this is an
advertisement too so we have genuine
disagreements from people as to what is
an ad now why does this matter we're
asking people to manage data flows from
advertisements but people don't even
agree on the baseline of what our ads so
if you try to explain to people what's
the difference between a first priority
and a third party they're not even sure
that their ads they're necessarily which
makes things very complicated so there
was more confusion about the technology
behind a lot of advertising a third of
the people I talked to and I asked them
just point-blank what's a cookie
answered I'm not sure they could
generally give some characteristics of
how cookies are used but they didn't
really understand what they were or how
they worked and only one person
mentioned that there might be unique
identifiers three people did mention
that it has something to do with
advertising but a fair number of people
gave answers that were actually wrong
only a little bit more than a third were
able to give an answer that did not have
some component that was just flat-out
wrong
so that's challenge I mean it's 2010 and
your users don't know what cookies are
very few people had ever heard of third
party cookies the problem here was not
the phrase third party which surprised
me they understand what a third party is
they just don't know what a cookie is if
they understand what a cookie is a third
party cookie will come for free and no
one had heard of flash cookies or LSS
and we asked a whole bunch of other
concepts as well nobody had heard of
them so we had some real confusion here
one person explained that with deleting
cookies hyperlinks in different colors
go away
that's what does it clears the
navigation history so we had this real
confusion between cookies and history
possibly cookies and browser cache
people told us that if you delete
cookies than pages take longer to load
it's probably that they've blown away
all of the images in their cache and
that's what's taking longer and this
could perhaps be due to web browser user
interfaces so for example this may be a
little bit
difficult to read for the remote sites
but if you look at the UI to clear
cookies in different browsers you have
to go under settings that say history
you have a default that clears all
things together so if people just click
yes or okay they're going to be clearing
out a bunch of different things at the
same time and the exception to this is
there's one browser opera which does
have cookies by themselves and actually
even tries to give a little bit of
definition cookies are small files
stored on your computer they allow
websites to remember you between visits
and the default is accept cookies only
from the site I visit so they avoid
third party versus first party
distinction by the way they phrase it
it's a nice attempt it's not clear it
does enough but they at least try to
distinguish these different topics so
the decisions web browser manufacturers
are making may be affecting how people
think things work online we asked people
about the risks and benefits and their
concerns around Internet ads and found
sort of three general categories one
people think that internet ads are
necessary they understand free content
is supported by them too and the most
common adjective used was they find them
annoying that's mostly about pop-ups
that's mostly about spam which people
think of as Internet advertising in fact
Google search was praised universally
for not being invasive annoying singing
dancing primary colors so that that got
a lot of good and the final category was
concerning which usually had to do with
privacy there was a wide range
particularly on targeted ads so some
people liked the idea that they get more
interesting ads that are relevant to
them personally and some people feel
like the ads are preying on the
vulnerable and those two concepts came
across so for advertising views most
people were pragmatic it's not that they
sat there saying ads are terrible
instead they don't
like ads but they're kind of resigned to
it a phrase that was used a lot was as
or a fact of life
one person used a lovely analogy of
internet ads or like somebody walking
slowly on the sidewalk in front of you
there's just nothing you can do about it
so you know just go with it
but while they accept the concept that
ads support free sites they don't think
that their data is part of that deal
they think the ads themselves are but
not the data and so here we come back to
this concept of mental models in the
offline world where people are used to
advertising for the past hundred years
they're not used to their data going out
they're just used to passively receiving
ads and so here they don't understand
the data flows behind it and it's not
something that they've had to think
about until very recently so there are a
couple of analogies that were drawn one
was just shopping offline and somebody
explained okay well you're in public yes
but just because you're in public
shopping there's still privacy issues
with companies knowing where you spend
your money in time another analogy was
two phone calls and somebody gave his
view that using the sort of data that's
used for behavioral advertising has to
be illegal because recording phone calls
can be illegal and there are certain
cultural norms and expectations to
privacy so these models that they have
of how things work in the offline world
carry over to the online world so just a
little bit of discussion here people
don't understand what's going on
currently opinions range from
enthusiastic support for relevant ads to
real concern and people are frustrated
with the tactics of advertising that
they see especially pop-ups even without
understanding the data that's being
collected and the other thing I should
have noted at the very beginning is that
we didn't prompt anybody about privacy
all of these studies were were
advertised about being about advertising
it was never come talk about privacy so
when people mention privacy and they all
did within the first five minutes this
was something unprompted that they were
raising on their own and privacy is
central to how they view advertising
online so the second study was a fall
up on this and we had 314 subjects for
an online study recruited from
Mechanical Turk and again these people
were not primed for privacy
once again this is skewed younger sixty
four percent of the sample ages eighteen
to thirty four and again skewed a little
bit female so some quick high-level
findings from this so in economics
there's the view that you can tell how
much people value something by how much
they will pay for it in fact you could
that's sort of the definition of value
what we've heard from people in the
fourteen person in-person study was that
being asked to pay for privacy was
extortion they were really against the
concept of paying for privacy which they
saw as a right so that sort of flies in
the face of the standard economics
framing for how you value things so we
looked at kind of a classical economics
approach in in behavioral economics to
how to kind of get a sense of how people
value things and contrasted two things
that should give the same answer the
first was would you pay an additional
dollar per month to your ISP to avoid
having your favorite news site collect
your data for behavioral advertisements
and the second which is just the same
thing but flipped around would you
accept a discount of one dollar per
month off your ISP bill to allow your
favorite news site to collect your data
for behavioral advertisements this is
very bounded you should get the same
answer to both questions but we didn't
and this is known as a willingness to
pay which is the first case of how much
you'd pay versus a willingness to accept
the second case of how much discount
would you accept gap so 11 percent would
pay a dollar a month to avoid having
their data collected and 31 percent said
they would accept a dollar a month in
order to be paid to disclose this
information so a couple of different
things here first of all this suggests
that there may be an endowment effect
going on here an endowment effect is
again in economics term
the canonical example for that was if
you have a coffee mug and you give it to
somebody and you say how much is this
mug worth once it's theirs they value it
for more money if the coffee mug is on
the table and you say how much is this
mug worth they don't value it for as
much right if you were endowed with it
if it's yours you demand more money so
there's a question as to whether privacy
also falls into this as well and this
suggests that it might and it would be
interesting to do more research here so
we followed up those questions on
willingness to pay and willingness to
accept with a couple of questions first
of all these were all on a Likert scale
so we asked people do you strongly
disagree which was coded as one disagree
etc all the way to strongly agree coded
as seven so that's what the mean licker
is there so the most popular response
was that privacy as a right and it is
wrong to be asked to pay to keep
companies from invading my privacy with
69% of people either strongly agreeing
or agreeing with that statement and only
3% disagreeing company is asking me not
to pay them companies asking me to pay
for them not to collect data is
extortion also scored very high with 61%
strongly agreeing we're agreeing with
that at the complete contrast at the
bottom I hate ads and would pay to avoid
them very few people actually agreed
with that only 11% people were more
neutral you can see but there's a very
pragmatic approach here right but notice
in the middle it's not worth paying to
avoid targeted ads most people agree
with that and the most concerning one I
think on this is advertisers will
collect data whether I pay or not so
there is no point in paying that's a
real lack of trust
55% either strongly agree or agree with
that statement so that's kind of an
issue if you're trying to build trust
with your users that Trust is not there
to start with so then we asked about two
different scenarios of things that are
basically happening online today in the
first case we asked them to amass
visit the New York Times and they see
ads for Continental Airlines and said
that ad does not come to you directly
from the airline instead there is an ad
company that determines what ad to show
you personally based on the history of
prior websites you have visited your
friends might see different ads if they
visited the New York Times and then ask
them to answer if this is something that
could happen or will not happen so the
majority of people said that yes this is
happening now
either a lot or a little over 80 percent
believe that only 11 percent said it's
not happening now but it could happen in
the future and only 2 percent said that
this would never happen so the basic
concept of behavioral advertising is at
least understood in contrast we asked
imagine you're online and your email
provider displays ads to you the ads are
based on what you write in email you
send as well as email you receive people
do not think that this is going on right
now right so just a footnote to this as
you're laughing I went back and I looked
at what email providers people used for
this study and 90% of them have some
type of hosted email provider hotmail
Gmail right and they think that this is
not happening
so it's not that they've just never seen
it before
they really legitimately think this
isn't happening right now
25% say yes this is happening a lot now
14 a little now 28% say it could happen
in the future but it's not happening now
the interesting thing 16 percent believe
this could never happen that it is
currently banned by law right and we're
back to those mental models well you
can't open my physical mail how could
you open my email people think it's
illegal and then 13 percent say this
could never happen because the consumer
backlash would be so intense and so ok
it's not barred by law but it still
would just never occur so there's some
real surprise going on out there as
people start to figure out what's
happening so we followed up these are
the same scenarios the types really
small but it's still up there and asked
how would you feel about this practice
if it happened for the behavioral people
know what's going on
but they think it's creepy and that was
one of the adjectives from the small
study of 14 people 46 people find it
creepy 38 percent say they wouldn't even
notice the ads they just ignore them 30
percent say no one should use data from
internet history that's a really broad
statement right almost a third of people
agree with that as a normative statement
and then 18 percent say they'd be glad
to have relevant advertisements about
things they're interested in instead of
random that's pretty low so in contrast
we look at email no one should use data
from email because it is private like
postal mail sixty-two percent it is
creepy to have advertisements based on
my emails sixty-two percent wouldn't
even notice the advertisements that's
the same thing before for behavioral
they said 38 percent here it's 18
percent would just ignore them well
maybe more than 18 percent have been
ignoring the ads but that's the
self-reported right only 18 percent say
they wouldn't notice them and that it
wouldn't bother them as a result only
nine percent say it's okay as long as
the email service is free they are not
agreeing with the concept that data is
part of the deal it's okay to have ads
for free services but not data and
finally glad to have relevant
advertisements about things I'm
interested in instead of random
advertisements only four percent so we
also looked at people's mental models of
how cookie data flows and presented four
different models of how pieces of a
webpage come together yeah
sure so the question is could asking no
one should use data from email because
it's private like postal mail instead
bias people for the earlier questions so
that they're more likely to say no you
shouldn't do this is that a fair
representation or or later questions I'd
actually be more worried about later
questions than earlier that is
absolutely something to think about and
for some of these we had to be careful
about the order we put the questions in
so there are some things that we do at
the very beginning before they've seen
the rest of the study so I had less
trouble less concern about that with the
small study of 14 people where I could
be more careful that that wasn't what
was going on but that's always going to
be a concern with studies like this it
may give a small biased effect I don't
think it's a large one it's part of why
I don't think it's a large one is
because I did the smaller so it started
with fourteen but that's sort of a
judgment call so yeah with any study
like this order of questions is going to
matter short us yeah I'm giving you
highlights of this if you want to see
the papers please feel free as they come
up I'm gonna actually postpone all other
questions to the end because we're
already running really tight on time
having started late but absolutely
that's that's a good methodological
question so we showed four different
possible mental models of how cookies
work and asked two different questions
one was which diagram do you think best
illustrates how cookies usually work and
the other was which if any could not
happen so I'm going to show you what
these four look like one by one the
first one had some text with it you can
see that there are arrows going back and
forth with cookies between a server some
ads and a news article the description
was the x web server sets and reads
cookies for all elements on the web page
including cookies associated with
specific ads so 22% think that this is
how the internet works today and this is
pretty close to how the internet used to
work that's not a crazy answer it's just
things are more complicated today than
this
and 9% say that this would not happen
which is wrong this is this is how
things used to be the second one was
multiple web servers set and read
cookies from The Times web page so we
have the time server and advertising
server and then a particular ad a soda
company server all setting and reading
cookies from the same page
20% think that this is what's happening
today and only 18% think that this can't
happen so for the technical people in
the room you guys know that this isn't
something that's going to happen without
some hacker aid right this is not how
the web works so for the third one the
description was only the time server can
set and read cookies on the times web
page so this has no cookies being set by
any advertisers and 18% think that
that's what's happening today 15% say
that this could not happen and the final
one which is the one that looks closest
to sort of the complexity level of what
we're seeing the market right now is
different servers set and read cookies
from different parts of the times web
page 40% which is the largest group say
that this is what happens today and 10%
say that this is impossible so the thing
to note is that of the ones now we had
basically three that were all around 20%
22 8 20 and 18 and a small bump toward
what's happening right now 48 percent
think that all of these images are
possible basically people just don't
have a clue how this works and they were
looking at all four of these images at
the same time to be able to kind of
spend time and go over them so on a
different topic we asked them about the
network advertising initiatives opt out
cookies so this is a mechanism of
Industry self-regulation if people don't
want behavioral advertising they can opt
out of the
from various ad networks and I'll read a
paragraph or two from the description
that people were able to read it was to
opt out of an nai members behavioral
advertising program simply check the box
that corresponds to the company from
which you wish to opt out alternatively
you can check the box labeled select all
and each member's opt out box will be
checked for you next click the submit
button the tool will automatically
replace the specified advertising cookie
cookies and verify your opt-out status
in bold opting out of a network does not
mean you will no longer receive online
advertising it does mean that the
network from which you opted out will no
longer deliver ads tailored to your web
preferences and usage patterns we ask
people if you visited this website what
would you think it is 34 percent said
it's a website that lets you tell
companies not to collect data about you
well that's not quite the case so it
actually depends on the company for
example Google will replace your cookies
with a cookie content that just says
opt-out so the same data is being
collected but it's aggregated now with
every other person who has a cookie that
says opt-out yahoo in contrast collects
exactly the same data nothing changes so
it really depends on which company so 25
percent said it's a website that lets
you tell companies you do not want to
see ads from them but you will still see
as many ads overall no it doesn't change
which companies you see ads from that's
not the point eighteen percent say a
website that lets you see fewer online
ads no that's not what it does either it
doesn't change the quantity of ads and
the correct choice 11 percent said a
website that allows companies to profile
you but not to show you ads based on
those profiles and that's what's going
on and then the final to a scam website
to collect your private information and
a scam website to find out which
websites you visited these are again
based on things that we heard from the
small interviews of 14 people together
that 11% is equal to the 11% who
correctly understood what's going on
with the
that page so a little bit of discussion
on this second one unwillingness to pay
for privacy is not the same thing as not
valuing privacy and that's a lot of
negatives in one sentence right but
that's probably the most precise way
that I can get across that concept that
there are people who think that paying
for privacy is wrong even though they
value their privacy highly so current
data practices are not understood and
the hosted email advertising example
being really strong there and they're
not accepted the mental models of data
flows with the different pictures of
cookies people don't really understand
what's going on there and the NAI opt to
nai opt out cookies description could
use a rewrite but it's going to be
difficult to explain I would have a hard
time writing that up in under a few
pages right it's complicated because the
underlying data is also complicated
different companies do different things
so the third and final study I'll be
talking about today looks at multiple
types of advertising this is a similar
structure to the second one it was an
online survey recruited from Mechanical
Turk with 300 subjects and for this one
there was a between subjects design so
half of the subjects saw one variant and
the other half saw a slightly different
variant and I'll describe that a little
bit more in a moment so when we wanted
to talk about these five different types
of advertising that I started out
discussing at the very beginning of this
talk we did a lot of pilot tests and
people have no idea what a phrase like
affiliate marketing means just no clue
right even contextual advertising they
just they don't understand what this is
so we needed to somehow convey that to
them to understand their preferences and
we found that giving definitions wasn't
enough so we needed to give examples but
that's a problem right
I mean we're coming back to that
question that was asked before of how do
you avoid biasing people so
what we came up with was we were going
to give two very different streams of
examples one example is around scuba
somebody has taken up a new hobby that's
something that's not really very privacy
sensitive for most people and the other
examples are on cancer and that's
something that we looked for that would
have privacy implications but also no
sense of blame no sense of this can't
happen to me that people would just
discount the example so that's why we
picked cancer did I just get past two
 no good
so we asked about these five different
types of advertising and gave them eight
different adjectives and again the
Likert scores for how much they agree or
disagree that these adjectives fit these
types of advertising the eight
adjectives came from news articles and
also those included PR releases about
different news services that are on the
web so those eight adjectives were in
order of popularity invasive pushy
creepy concerning helpful reasonable
desirable and entertaining and sort of
the big picture here the four positive
and the four negative we're very similar
so I've just grouped those here you can
see that the contextual has the highest
of the positives and they drop as you go
from contextual behavioral affiliate
Cloudant dpi and the negatives are the
lowest for contextual and they increase
for behavioral affiliate cloud and dpi
there are a couple of statistically
significant differences between the
scuba and cancer conditions you can read
the paper for the full details but
they're actually very few they were very
similar so another question we asked is
whether they would prefer to have random
ads or if they would prefer that
particular type of targeted ad and for
contextual as you would sort of expect
most people would rather that their ads
have something to do with the site that
they're visiting and a slight majority
would prefer contextual to random but as
you start to get to the other types of
ads
people would prefer random ads to
behavioral and there's a statistically
significant difference between
contextual and behavioral there and
affiliate cloud and dpi based 75 percent
would prefer to have random ads to that
type of targeting and there are no
statistical statistically significant
differences between affiliate cloud and
dpi but that group is statistically
significant significantly different from
behavioral and contextual so to sort of
wrap up these three together generally
people just don't understand how the
internet works how ads work or how data
flows the naii opt-out description of
opt-out cookies is not working as it's
written right now and current practices
that are in use today are causing
surprise when we describe them to people
in the 14 person study I would describe
things to people and say how would you
feel about and they would look at me and
say well that would never happen and I
would say okay well if it happened how
would you feel about it and they'd argue
with me
right and these were things that are all
going on right now today people are okay
with the concept of ads for free sites
but don't think that data is part of the
deal and if given a choice they would
prefer to have random ads to targeted
ads at the current time that may change
as people start to understand both the
benefit of targeted ads and also the
risks of some of the data flows that
they're not aware with but right now
2010 that's their preference when
they're giving self-reported data which
is another important caveat all of this
is self-reported but a small subset
really do welcome targeted ads
enthusiastically so they want to see
things that are relevant to them they
want new products they want new services
things they would never find on their
own they think this is exciting it would
be great if we could find a way to serve
those people a larger subset but still
comparatively small subset reject the
concept of targeting ads completely they
see it as an invasion of privacy they
think it's a bad thing the majority of
people simply don't see a benefit to
targeted ads
why would they want better ads ads are
slow people on the sidewalk in front of
it right there's something that happens
to you that you cope with the idea of
making them better isn't something that
they're really interested in they just
want to ignore them and get on with
their life so we're running low on time
I'm going to run through these pretty
quickly just a couple of points for
technologists privacy is central to user
experience we're hearing about privacy
just talking about ads very very quickly
in these interviews so design for it
when you design products technologists
have a vast and fast reach that can
change how people interact with things
very quickly and it's a very powerful
role to have but engineers may know too
much to empathize with new users kind of
that keeping a beginner brain can be
really difficult and engineers may also
under appreciate that they're
dramatically changing how people
interact with this new media some some
decisions about a user interface for a
web browser it's just okay here's one
more feature that has to get in by code
complete but it's actually changing how
people are able to make decisions about
their private data in a whole new scale
right so that's sort of the type of
thing to think about as you're dealing
with these privacy issues testing is
important testing the NII description
would have gone a long way testing
browser interfaces for not just can
people use them can they click the
buttons but how does the whole
interaction work do they understand what
they're doing and why and what the
implications are there's sort of an
extra level of testing beyond you click
the button and the button worked and
finally just keep in mind that mental
models of offline systems are going to
bleed into whatever online system you're
designing so sometimes you can take
advantage of that and that's a really
powerful thing to be able to tap into
but be careful where they differ that's
where people get surprised and that's
where suddenly there can be a huge
backlash and you have no idea where it
came from for educators the polite way
of putting this is that
findings remain stable over time right
20 years ago people didn't know what
cookies are ten years ago people didn't
know what cookies are five years from
now will people actually understand
cookies and to some extent doesn't
matter right I mean how much do you know
about how your car works but if you
don't know it needs the oil changed it's
a problem where it matters is where
there are decisions you have to make
where you interact with things so those
are the things where educators need to
look at really training people about how
things work and there's a lot of work to
be done here another point is that even
the so-called digital natives the
generation after mine don't understand
what's going on for privacy and they
want to so we had a free-form comment
block at the end of these online studies
and we had a bunch of comments like this
I would love to learn more information
about how to protect my privacy
especially with all of the horror
stories of stolen identities I need to
know more about how my computer works I
should have put some of the others up
here but they wouldn't fit there were
people complaining about I don't
understand what you were even asking in
this study and we were going to people a
Mechanical Turk these are more
tech-savvy than average right so there's
a real caution there people desperately
want information about how this works
last for policy makers this notion that
there's substantial surprise over
current practices is important as policy
makers move away from the concept of
Fair Information practices to underlie
what works or doesn't work for privacy
surprise is becoming one of the things
that they look at to determine if
something is working well or not for
users well we've got a lot of surprise
that's going on here we have this issue
that only a minority of people want
targeted ads but they're so enthusiastic
about it is there some way that we can
serve them while serving everybody else
as well I talked a little bit about this
economic notion of the difference
between willingness to pay and
willingness to accept for the dollar
discount versus dollar premium for
privacy that may also affect how people
look at opt-in and opt-out now we know
most people
except defaults right that's real but on
top of that if you for example force
people to make a decision but you have a
preference selected that may also affect
how much they value their privacy based
as whether they see the privacy as
theirs or the data as someone else's
that would be a great thing to start to
look into more for future work we have
this issue where users may not be able
to identify ads so in the industry
self-regulation approach for behavioral
advertising the NAI and others have
suggested that widget makers be treated
as first parties for data and a widget
maker puts up say today's weather in a
little box in the upper corner in your
website the idea is that users are
supposed to know that that widget did
not come from the New York Times it came
from the widget maker and that the data
flow goes to the widget maker and
therefore it is a first-party data
relationship with the widget maker
that's not going to work not in real
life
I think there's some real problems there
that should be tested more thoroughly
than my absolute statement there but
there's some real concerns I have as to
how people could possibly understand
especially when widgets are designed to
be brandable and integrate with sites
and all of those good things that we
want from widgets and the final question
here is does self-regulation make sense
as an approach when users don't have the
knowledge to be able to make decisions
at this moment so thank you very much
I'd be happy to take questions
so to repeat the question the question
was I had asked if people think a
practice is either happening a lot or a
little right now or is not happening in
particular because it's illegal how many
people would answer well it's happening
but it is illegal that's a great
question I didn't ask it so the the
implication of the question and the
follow-up was like for example spam but
that's kind of interesting because if
you look at the can spam Act a lot of
things that you might think are illegal
turn out to be legal so it gets murky
there too for some really good study of
what people do and don't believe for
laws there are some things that have
come out of Annenberg and Berkeley and
you can look they're specifically a
study done about Californians and their
view of laws and privacy Chris Hufnagel
and Jennifer King from Berkeley and it's
it's a really nicely done study there
are a bunch of other people on that I'm
going to be embarrassed that I didn't
just name them all I think it's a seven
name author of string or something like
that but there's some really good work
that I didn't replicate that you could
look at that would probably start to
answer that question better than I did
yes
it's a great question so the question
was our users differentiating between
behavioral data collected about them by
the actions they take online sort of as
a side effect versus that they're
providing they go to Facebook and they
provide their gender their age the city
they live in so I didn't look at that in
particular but I can talk about
something related that I think ties in
which is users believe if they aren't
logged into a site they're completely
anonymous and that data is not being
collected so they think that if they're
logged into Google or Facebook which
were the examples they gave me that yes
that information they provided actually
Yahoo was the third when they gave me
that information they provided when they
signed up is of course available to
those services and I understand that
because they provided it but they think
that if they are not currently logged in
and visiting that site that they're
completely anonymous there's nothing
being tracked about them at all
so I think the reason I didn't hear that
distinction is because they don't even
understand it exists so the follow-up
was it's not that the data is being
tracked it's that it wouldn't be used
they don't even think it's being tracked
so how can it be used if it's not like
they don't they don't even question it
right they on the internet nobody can
tell you're a dog right people really
are back in that mindset that if they
aren't logged into a service they're
completely anonymous now there are
plenty of people who know otherwise and
I get in trouble when I use a broad
brush like that right there's going to
be a subsection of users who understand
what an IP address is even but the vast
majority people think that they are
perfectly anonymous online yes
sure timeframe of when the surveys were
done so they're actually out of time
frame from what I presented the oldest
one the one with 14 people who came into
the lab that occurred about a year ago
was last summer and that happened before
a lot of privacy things that are in the
news right now right so I've watched
concern increase over time and I haven't
been able to quantify it which is a
shame that would have been lovely if I
could then the middle one which was the
cancer versus scuba study that's
probably about six months old and then
the follow-up which was the follow-up to
the small study that's maybe three
months old if even that one kind of yeah
so we are over time I'm happy to
continue talking to anybody who has
further questions we can go back by the
ping-pong tables and I'll stay as late
as anybody would want but I know there's
probably another talk that's going to
come in and I should let the room be
free so thank you guys so much for your
time and attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
