happy to introduce professor clayton you
Lewis from University of Colorado in
Boulder Clayton is in the computer
science department there and has been
working in in the space of usability and
accessibility with the special focus on
users with cognitive disabilities I
really like the type of work Clayton
does because it sort of focuses on the
user which sort of really align with the
way we think of it at Google independent
of accessibility we typically focus on
the user and the nice thing about some
of the projects the Clayton's been doing
with some students is to look at
platforms like Android and ask the
question what kind of new solutions to
these devices enable for a user with
special needs and notice that that's
subtly different from asking the vanilla
accessibility question of you know is
there a screen reader on this thing that
works you know does this application
work with the screen reader it's the
broader question which is if you have a
computer in your pocket and you have a
special need what can you do with that
computer in order to meet that special
need so with that I won't take any more
of Clayton's time and you mean let's
maximize the time you have for a stock I
take it directly thank you mama and
thanks for the invitation let's keep
this really informal it's a small enough
audience that we can definitely do that
and it's possible that some of the stuff
I might race past would be things that
you'd like to hear more about so so
please interrupt with questions or
comments whenever that that ceases you
so I'll start with a little bit about
cognitive disabilities for some of you
it may be a new area it's it's a very
diverse area there are lots of ways that
people can face challenges in cognitive
functioning probably the best known
example of a cognitive disability is
down syndrome which is in the category
called developmental disabilities so
it's a chromosomal abnormality their
number of things like that people are
less aware that brain injury is a major
contributor so there are a lot of people
who have
cognitive limitations coming from auto
accidents or from or from sports
injuries stroke as a contributor
Alzheimer disease is getting a lot of
publicity because of the aging of the
population and then actually perhaps the
least thought about category which is
there and is numerically meaningful is
mental illness so some mental illnesses
have as a side effect impact on
cognitive functioning and the data
aren't really good in this area but an
estimate that is kind of a consensus
figure is that they're about 20 million
people in the US it's kind of anybody's
guess what the numbers would be on a
world basis the data really aren't
aren't there but you know maybe 400
million might not be a bad guess
actually other world figures there are a
lot of people that that suffer from
condition and sort of definitionally
suffering from it means that it has an
impact on something you want to do in
your daily life or your work life or
whatever it might be technology is
relevant to people with cognitive
disabilities in a whole lot of ways I've
listed some of these here communication
aids task prompting I'll say something
about that a good many people with
cognitive disabilities are capable of
performing some range of tasks but they
have trouble with what we systems people
would call dispatching so figuring out
what to do when is often a challenge for
people so using technology to prompt
people to tell them when they need to be
doing something is is a common interest
mobility aids many people with cognitive
disabilities can't drive so they are
using public transportation and public
transportation is is challenging for
them if you imagine yourself trying to
use the bus system in Jakarta that's
maybe roughly what using public
transportation on a daily basis is like
for someone with a cognitive disability
there's everything goes perfectly then
your trip will be successful but
unfortunately a lot of things that could
go wrong and using technology help with
that as many people are interested in
service-oriented architectures this is
the the onstar kind of model there's
interest in harnessing port
óleo services through a technology
technological infrastructure to give
people access to assistance and
information as they might need it text
simplification we actually have a not
the focus of this talk but my colleague
jim martin and i have a small grant from
google that we're very grateful for
that's allowing us to do some work
looking at automatic ways of simplifying
text user interface harmonization
relates to the fact that for people with
cognitive disabilities having to deal
with novel interfaces is an additional
challenge so finding ways to present
interfaces using known and familiar
kinds of elements is important and there
are a lot of other things too these are
these are just a few representative
examples so as Robin mentioned we've
been focusing since November quite a lot
of effort on the Android platform which
we're very excited about and I've listed
here some of the potential advantages of
Android for people with cognitive
disabilities and you'll perceive that
many of these advantages apply to lots
of other people as well starting with
low cost and portability but I'll just
note that the economics of disability to
call it that are not good so the
employment rate for people with
disabilities is low income levels are
low and so there's a lot of technology
that you could say is in principle
available to people but in practice it's
not so cost itself is something that's
really important and of course
portability is important as well another
thing that we've zeroed in on in a
number of the projects that I'll be
describing is remote configuration and
management and this is especially
important with respect to user
independence and user independence is in
turn especially important for people
with cognitive disabilities so if you if
you talk to people with cognitive
disabilities this this is really at the
top of the list what they are interested
in is technology that will allow them to
live more independently they really do
not like being in the situation as they
all too often are of having to rely on
other people to do things so being able
to manage things and provide supports
remotely is a key benefit
location aware of services such as the
vukai android platform makes available
is also something that has value a
couple of things i'm mentioning their
safety monitoring so i mentioned
problems with public transportation
sadly it's an everyday occurrence that
someone with a cognitive disability
becomes lost in the public
transportation system and and this has a
number of sort of bad follow-on effects
again very sadly in our society people
with cognitive Allah tease are very
vulnerable to being exploited in a whole
variety of awful ways and so being lost
is not just a matter of an inconvenience
it has a safety aspect to it so the
prospect of technology that helps people
to discover when they're not where they
need to be allow them to communicate
with people when they're in that
situation allow other people potentially
to detect that on their behalf all these
things are of interest and then
location-based prompting that relates to
the dispatching thing so there's
interest in making it possible for
someone to be reminded of what they need
to do when they arrive at work for
example some of you might know you might
not that many people with cognitive
abilities would work in a setting where
they have someone playing role called
job coach and the job coach has the job
of reminding someone as needed of when
they need to do things if you think back
to that independence point that I made
if someone can be reminded without
having to have a person remind them
that's something that's a real real plus
so these are some potential benefits of
Android we also think the openness of
Android itself and also the open service
concept that Google's been promoting
around Android we think these things are
also really important and that's why
these are equally important as the
technical features in the fact that
we're putting a focus in this area so
allowing people to choose their handset
and choose the configuration of their
software with without having to bow down
to the carrier's is really key in in
this area because the what people need
is really diverse so making it possible
for people to
have a wide have wide flexibility in
what they're going to have is really
important and that's something else that
we think is strategically important is
that there's there's some precedent in
in other areas of inclusive technology
and I mentioned here anome and the Orca
system these are these are open source
accessibility kinds of projects and they
provide some precedent for the notion
that open source really can harness some
some resources in this area that the
commercial model has more trouble
mobilizing I'm personally very
interested in in harnessing the efforts
of students I'm at a university but
probably all of you know that all over
the world there are students who need to
be doing and are doing significant
project work in their in their curricula
and so tapping that resource is
something which I think has a as a lot
of strategic potential and I think the
openness of Android makes it a good
candidate for mobilizing a lot of useful
effort so I wanted to describe our early
Android experience we organized a class
that ran the spring semester actually
one thing that was very interesting to
me was that we didn't get the class
organized until after people had already
registered for their spring classes but
nevertheless we had no trouble getting
as many students as we wanted into that
class so the platform is very attractive
to students and the idea of developing
applications relevant to people with
cognitive abilities was something that
was attractive to students so we did a
variety i guess i've listed five
projects i'll go in detail on a few of
them if you're curious about others i
can tell you more about them but just
going through the high level headings so
there was a project the focus which was
location-aware prompting something i
mentioned a minute ago another one that
i'll tell you a little bit more about us
remotely manage scheduling and and
prompting i'll come back and say more
about that then a third project provides
naming practice for people with aphasia
so faiza is a language disorder
commonly associated with stroke and one
of the effects of it is that you may
lose the ability to name familiar
objects you can recognize the objects
but you can't come up with the names for
them it's a real bad condition there's
not a real good prognosis usually for
this but something that is of some value
is up getting naming practice basically
a flashcard kind of a thing not a very
sophisticated application but Android
makes it possible to do this in a
portable platform whereas today people
have to go to a therapist office for
this but another key point in the
Android prototype is that there's the
potential for remote management by a
clinician and I'll describe more of that
more there was another project which was
a public transportation navigation aid
and then an API project which was kind
of down a level an API for doing multi
media buttons so making it easier for
somebody to create buttons with pictures
on them sounds associated with them and
the like so it's kind of a overview of
the project I'll give you some of the
details here so we submitted actually
all of these projects to the developer
challenge none of these projects one but
I'm happy to say that actually one of
the students in the class was a winner
and I don't know how many of you
followed that developer challenge but
those are pretty good odds so one of our
students was one of 50 winners out of
more than 1,700 applications but he was
a winner for an individual project that
he did not not the project that he
participated in the class but what I'm
showing here is a comic strip that the
students use to kind of convey to
someone quickly what the point of this
particular application is so this is the
the comic strip for the aphasia naming
program and and what it develops is that
there's a person who needs to do the
naming practice he's working with a
therapist the therapist can configure
the naming practice on the client's
Android by by essentially uploading
particular decks of these kind of flash
card like things and and one of the
things that's of interest here is
you can actually do this without
requiring speech recognition you might
think well how's how are you going to
score the you know whether someone is
naming the thing correctly well turns
out people can self score adequately on
this kind of thing they can tell whether
they've succeeded in getting the thing
right or not another thing that goes
beyond just the simple flashcard idea
that's described in the comic strip or
at least alluded to here is that there
are our kind of clues that form part of
the therapeutic practice so you may not
be able at all to come up with the name
of something just given the picture but
if you're given the first syllable that
may enable you to kind of get over the
hump and come up with the word and so
the practice is a little more than just
running through a deck and seeing how
many things you can name it has to do
with what clues are needed to allow you
to name the thing and then fading those
clues so there are a few levels of
management that the clinician would go
through using something like this and
key advantage of Android for this is
that that management can take place
remotely so instead of having to go into
the therapists or clinicians office and
have all this stuff done the clinician
can can monitor what your success rate
is for that matter can monitor whether
you're practicing the amount that you're
supposed to be so that they can offer
some encouragement if if you're not
doing that but then they can adjust the
various parameters of the practice
process including swapping and new
practice materials so this is one in
particular that we put in the low
hanging fruit category I should have
mentioned my colleague Gail Rams burger
who's in a physiologist that really
worked with the students to develop this
one and I'll say more about this later
but we're hoping this summer to kind of
really finish this off and get it ready
for deployment as soon as the Android
phones start appearing we think this is
a pretty certain winner the other
project that I'll take you through in a
little bit of detail is the remotely
manageable prompting and reminder system
and this is the comic strip for that one
that shows
Ron and Ron's caregiver Norma so there's
been actually quite a bit of progress
recently a lot of interest that's
developed in the kind of world of
cognitive disabilities in using
hand-held scheduling technology so it's
been kind of an interesting evolution
with interesting things about how people
have kind of come around to recognizing
the value of that sort of thing it's
it's not widely used now it's something
that really needs to be promoted and
that's one of the reasons we're
interested in this we think that if
Android is successful in delivering and
all the things we talked about before
that'll make it much easier for people
to kind of promote this practice for
people who need it but as with the
naming practice thing it's really key
that you have the potential for doing
remote management so what the students
set up with something that integrates
with google calendar so caregiver goes
to google calendar they can do that from
wherever they are on the web obviously
that's just a web application so Norma
can go on and set up whatever she wants
to for Ron's schedule so she can she can
manage the schedule for Ron either you
know sort of standing things or
reminders for ad hoc things or whatever
is is needed there and and then the
reminder material gets pushed to Ron's
phone so as I mentioned before this
really hits the theme of independence
because this kind of thing that mentions
not being done very much today but the
extent it is being done it's it's really
done based on sort of face-to-face
handoff kind of contact so Norma has to
get physical possession of a bronze
device to work with it and that's a drag
from all kinds of viewpoints so make it
possible for Norma to just work through
a web interface and Ron not having to do
the handoff with with Norma's
potentially a big win in this in this
space and you see a little bit more of
the
of the prototype in this comic strip
starting with working through google
calendar and then this particular thing
can deliver pictorial prompts to run on
the android and also ken there's a
facility for for Ron working on its
Android actually check something off as
having been accomplished and that sort
of thing so this is another application
that we have we have high hopes for so
challenges and opportunities there are
some things that we would like to see
happen and actually I'm I'm going to be
going to the google i/o sessions over
the next couple of days and hope to be
getting touch with people in the android
world to understand some of these things
better but i'll just describe some of
the things we see as opportunities here
so this first point has to do with with
routing sound over the phone side of the
device and this is not something that
was needed in any of the applications
the students actually developed but we
do have another project we've been
working on which is to allow a person
who who uses a computer application to
speak to be able to carry on their side
of a telephone conversation so the this
is kind of a merger between a smartphone
and something called an AAC which is I'm
edit of and alternative communication
device actually how many people have
seen Stephen Hawking and his speaking
device so most people have so Hawking
has a motor disorder ALS but there are
many people with cognitive disabilities
who also have difficulty speaking and
some of these people use devices where
they basically press pictorial buttons
to either make complete utterances like
greetings or in some cases they're able
to kind of assemble a more complex
utterance out of parts using pictorial
selection well we've been working
actually with support from Nokia and
from a small assistive technology come
called saltillo to make it possible for
someone using one of these devices to
place a phone call and our current
implementation has occludes that
involves wires and a bunch of other
things he would like not to have and one
might think at first blush that
something like Android that has
certainly the processor that could run
this you know press the button to speak
kind of a thing and also as a phone on
it would be a natural for this but at
least as far as we've been able to
penetrate on Android but also on other
phones that we've looked at there's
really a separation between the phone
side of the house to call it that and
the computer side of the house which
actually doesn't make it easy to do this
I'd like to understand why that is and
what the prognosis might be for doing
better on that another thing that that
we are interested in and this is not
something I think which really has any
sort of hardware dependency if indeed
some of the phone issues turn out to
have those dependencies is really more
of a kind of software architecture
dependency but something that I think is
strategic it's also something really in
common with much of what we're talking
about its strategic for all kinds of of
people and and that is support for a
really simple selection and
configuration of functional features so
if you talk to people in the cell phone
world about cell phone marketing there
are any number of studies that make two
points very clearly so one point is that
everybody says they wish they had a
simpler phone okay so it's easy to
document that it's equally easy to
document that no one will buy a
simplified phone okay so this is a huge
dilemma for four people in the business
but it seems if there is a way that
where at least one could have some
optimism about breaking that dilemma and
that would go like this suppose when you
buy your phone it comes with a basic set
of features which in fact there's reason
to think most people would be really
happy with but on the box there the
seven thousand other features that it
would be trivial for you to put on your
phone the difference is they're not
there
begin with okay so if you don't actually
want the 7000 features you're not having
your life cluttered up by them but
you're not either having to say well
I've given up on these seven thousand
features but to make that work it has to
be really easy to add any feature that
you want of the 7000 here to your phone
so this is a this is a sort of standard
consumer kind of play this is a little
more of a serious issue you could argue
if you're somebody with cognitive
limitations because one of the ways to
think about that situation is that
things which are kind of an annoyance
maybe for the people in this room that
can be kind of much more than annoyance
and really getting to the disaster stage
for someone for whom dealing with
complexity can be an additional
challenge so the stakes are higher in
being able to to choose or have
configured for you depending on the
situation a set of features that's
really well tailored to your needs so to
us this is a this a strategic area to to
push as Android develops is to you know
do do where we can working with other
people to get it so that as and road
emerges it really has this flavor that
it's really easy to add stuff so one
scenario that would be great if it could
be realized is that ramen and I are
people with cognitive disabilities and
one of the things that may be a part of
our lives is that we meet once a year at
a summer camp so there's a whole lot
behind what I just said but about you
know social arrangements for people with
God knows abilities rest of it anyway
the reality is or a positive reality
actually is that that many people with
disabilities do meet friends on an
occasional basis and wouldn't it be
great if when I'm eat ramen at our the
session we have together at camp the
ramen shows me this great thing that
he's got on his phone and then that
there's something really easy we can do
at the level of knocking our phones
together and when we do that then I've
got what ramen had on his phone of
course there doesn't have to be any
phone to phone transfer involved in that
it just has to be an informational
transaction where
you know the fact that there's a
particular feature that's on Robins
phone that I want that you know that
that gets in installed so making these
things possible is something that's the
strategic another piece of this is it
would be good to have profile based
configuration for this stuff a little
more background probably i as a person
with cognitive disabilities might have
some challenges dealing with a complex
configuration process but also the
people who support me a caseworker works
with me a family member who works with
me those people also are not likely to
be technically highly sophisticated so a
configuration process that requires
technical sophistication is is not
really on and one of the directions that
people have identified have been working
towards in this space is making it
possible for people to have a profile
description that gets created that could
require some level of relatively
specialized consultation but once that
profile is available then the selection
and configuration of new features might
be made easier by by use of that profile
information there's something that's
been developing called the access for
all schema that is emerging in the web
space that is an approach to this kind
of thing and extending this kind of idea
of the mobile space we think is likely
to be imported as well so these are
developments we're interested in and
hope to be able to work with others
others on so we've also got from these
projects that students worked on we've
got a good deal of kind of feedback
experience on the Android platform as it
now exists and I've put up a few
examples there so they're issues around
making it possible for one application
to control other Apple
patience so when you think about some of
these remote configuration and
management kinds of things these are the
sorts of things you'd like to be able to
do and in the platform as it is now it
doesn't appear easy to do that extra I'm
curious how many of you have messed
around at all with the Android platform
any of you okay so some of these things
you may recognize so there's this SQL
Lite or however it's pronounced that's
on there it's the kind of database kind
of things and our students we're very
much aware of the light part of that and
you know expressed a good level of
frustration that there were things that
they're used to finding it easy to do
with databases that you can't really do
with the thing that's on there a number
of the applications that i described
involve pushing things onto the phone
and the students were ingenious and
finding ways to make that work but they
felt that these things were awkward and
that it would be good if there were more
direct ways of doing some of them those
that's sort of some of the the grumbling
on the other hand there were a few
people in the class that have experience
doing phone development on other
platforms a particular win siiii and
simeon and they were very emphatic that
they felt the development for android
was was easier than what they were used
to in those other platform so it's
definitely good news another thing I'll
mention that came out very well and and
we believe you know not really by
accident integration with with existing
Google services turned out to work
really well so I mentioned the google
calendar thing i didn't mention it but
to other projects which i didn't really
give you a description of the location
of where prompting one and the
transportation aid made heavy use of
other google services and that that went
really well a kind of a matic comment
about this feedback and one of the
reasons why the feedback really needs a
lot of processing and digestion it's
really hard to separate the state of the
emulator to call it that from what the
asymptotic state of android would be
okay so some of that stuff's obvious
right so there there are things which
are in the plan which aren't on the
emulator so that's going to clear enough
but but then there's stuff that isn't on
the emulator but you don't really know
whether the intention is
that it would never be part of Android
or whether it's just sort of been left
out temporarily or whatever it so so
sort of knowing the significance of
various limitations is a little hard at
this point and so being involved in a in
a conversation with with others about
this kind of feedback would be very
useful so my last sort of bullet there
is you know where to go with this kind
of information as the android community
develops another comment there so the
commitment of for Android is that it
would be an open-source kind of thing
but it really isn't yet stuff isn't open
and it's a little unclear to us at least
you know what the thinking is about
really developing that that community
but as that community develops presuming
that it does work something we hope to
to participate in so in terms of
immediate follow-up this summer with
support from the National Science
Foundation and through our participation
in something called the Alliance for
advancing African American researchers
in computing I'll have three
undergraduates from Jackson State
University working with me in boulder
and and the intent is to pick up
especially the more promising of the
projects that I described to you which
would will be the naming aid working
with my colleague gale ranch burger the
physiologist and then the the google
calendar integration to really do what
we can to kind of get those things fully
ready to go that's something we're going
to be we're going to be working on this
summer there's also another student
staying at Jackson State who's a master
student who's who's planning to work
with us on this as telling ramen one of
the things that's potential for her as a
project is working on text to speech so
Texas beach is one of those kind of
areas of ambiguity the way things are
now so on the one hand it seems clear to
us that there's a lot of really good
things you could do with text-to-speech
if you had it a B it's in the plan
see it's not really happening you know
so so where that really stands and and
you know whether it would be useful for
somebody sort of in the outer circle to
do some work there and sort of explore
it is something that's that's a interest
to us ramen and I were discussing over
lunch that one of the things about
student projects in a space like this is
that since the main objectives of these
projects are educational for the
students then as long as everybody goes
into it with with kind of you know clear
idea of what they're setting out to do
it can it can work for students to sort
of do some what might turn out in the
end to be throwaway effort if it
accomplishes something in making clear
what can be done what some of the
opportunities might be smoking out some
of the issues on the light so this
potential project the summer by the
master students is there a way sort of
under the shadow of well is it going to
turn out that you know the the adults
are going to you just do Texas beach
well okay if they do great but maybe
there's room for a student project to do
some path breaking you know bearing in
mind that the point of the project and
the student is really the educational
contribution that that could make so I'm
excited about the interaction with with
with Jackson State as a way of
continuing this actually it's not on the
slide that I'll mention something else
that this is feeding into we're like
many other places led by Georgia Tech
we're doing some serious restructuring
of our computer science program and
introducing a track structure and part
of this track that I'm associated
primarily with which we've labeled
digital and social systems is a new
class that I have high hopes for which
we're calling the DSS professional
development class and the idea of this
class is to make room in the curriculum
for stuff that is really important for
students to do but traditionally isn't
in the curriculum so I became aware over
the last few years of an interesting
category of student who would be in
class and
and had many signs of being a very
capable and committed student but at
other slides of being a serious slacker
so sort of contradiction there and and
in talking with these students about the
circumstances I learned actually in two
different cases something like this
basically the same story they're saying
well in one case I'm and saying well you
know I'm really putting a lot of time
into my participation in the pearl 3
development and so every week I'm kind
of deciding ok so do I put more time
into pearl 3 or do I do what Clayton
wants me to do in the game 'let design
for education course and frankly I
decided that what I'm doing for pearl 3
is more important well and in those
conversations I ended up feeling yeah
you're right that is more important so
its rationale for you to kind of do the
minimum in some of these demands but
then stepping back from that I realized
that we were putting our students in in
a wrong position that is we were forcing
them to choose between the sort of
traditional stick-in-the-mud stuff
that's in the traditional curriculum and
really being involved and figuring out
what's happening the world and becoming
known and so on so like the guy who who
was working on pearl 3 is actually
taking time out to the program he's
going over to Brussels and work on a
really cool you know invent the next
programming language will revolutionize
the world kind of project so you know a
really great opportunity that he got
really through the visibility that he
gained through his open source activity
so the idea of this professional
development class is to recognize that
things like participate in open source
are things that we should be encouraging
our students to do and supporting them
in doing not telling them oh you've got
to choose between doing these things and
doing the stuff the traditional classes
ask you to do there's there's a long
list of other stuff the course has a
portfolio sort of structure to it and
the notion isn't that that everybody
does everything that's kind of called
out in the portfolio but that everybody
at least becomes aware of these things
as things that might represent
opportunities for them because that's
another reflection that comes from kind
of stepping back so our kind of
let it happen on the margins kind of
approach had the effect that many of our
students weren't doing these things
because they didn't think they needed to
because they weren't part of the
curriculum which is another sort of male
communication built around this kind of
traditional thing anyway I'm hoping that
after the summer carrying on our Android
activity will happen for some students
at least in the context of this course
because participating in open-source
activities is one of the things that
that course rain work is is intended to
encourage so for as long as Android is
ticking over which I hope will be for
the indefinite future we we intend to
follow up our our participation so some
acknowledgments here so the Coleman
Institute at the University of Colorado
Coleman Institute for cognitive
disabilities has been supporting my
involvement also in addition to
participating this Institute that we
have I'm also a member of something
called the mouth full rehabilitation
engineering research center for advanced
and cognitive technologies some of you
may sit know that these are ERC's of
which they're roughly 20 are pretty big
roughly 5 million dollar research
centers funded by the national institute
for disabilities and rehabilitation
research and and re RC act is the only
one ever of these centers that has a
focus specifically on the needs of
people with cognitive disabilities and
that center also has been supporting
some of my work and I've listed here the
students who have who participated in
the Android course the column on the
left is the undergrads and the column on
the right is the the grad so there are a
few more undergrad while one more
undergrad than than grads so we had a
good cast of characters for this then
this is the the contact slide so that's
my email clayton doubt lewis at colorado
edu and i want to say a few words about
a couple of google groups that are here
in case some of you might have an
interest so
actually starting with the second one
I've listed their inclusive developments
for for Android so I've not been
publicizing this site and I don't intend
to but for those that are interested in
in working on inclusive technology for
Android in the spirit of exchanging
information and mutual assistance and
the like I'd say there may be something
like 15 people so far that I've invited
into this it's not been very active so
far but my intention is especially as
now that we've got more experience under
our belt and there may be other people
who have been participating to have some
project work but the idea is I'm hoping
that as I said we can do some mutual
assistance there but as I said I haven't
publicized that you know the spirit is
that we want the work to kind of speak
for itself and if this community kind of
helps us get some good work done great
but it's really the work that we want to
have come out from the group rather than
the group itself but anyway if any of
you are interested in potentially
participating in that if you drop me a
note I'm happy to make that possible and
then I wanted to mention something else
not directly related to Android another
activity that I'm involved in in case
maybe again some of you might have an
interest in this and there's a little
bit of a story behind this which some of
you may be aware of but others may not
so probably you all know about the web
content accessibility guidelines coming
from w3c the wit keg one point 0
guidelines have been out for several
years and just now the wicked 2 point 0
revised guidelines are issuing and from
the perspective of people with cognitive
disabilities there's been kind of a big
deal going on there there's so there's
there's been a collision of good
intentions one could say so one good
intention has been well let's let's try
to promote the idea that if they're
things people could do to make put
they put on the web more readily usable
by people with cognitive limitations so
that's a good intention so but another
good intention was this let's increase
the compliance with these guidelines by
making them more objective so the people
who run the guidelines production
process felt that compliance with the
one point out guidelines was poor
because there was no controversy that it
was poor but there was a belief there is
a belief that one contributing factor to
compliance being poor was that some of
the one point 0 guidelines were
wishy-washy and hard to pin down and so
people would say well I'm not going to I
can't argue that my company should
comply to these guidelines because
they're too vague and you can't tell
whether you comply it anyway well right
in the middle of that vagueness was a
guideline I'm not going to quote the
exact words but as a guideline which
said use the simplest and clearest
language appropriate to commute your
communicative aims well that's
wishy-washy a little bit of an aside
there some of you might be thinking well
come on i think i could write a
guideline for simple and plain language
i'd use one of these grade-level formula
well if you're if you be tempted to
think that way that's that's really not
as it turns out a very productive way to
think about it I how many of you may
know Ginni reddish but Ginny is a person
that's done a lot of work in this area
and has written about it it makes very
persuasive arguments of which i'll just
mention two so one is if you look at the
kinds of stuff that people really put on
the web on the one hand and you look at
these readability measures on the other
hand they just don't fit so the
readability measures are based on the
notion that what you're looking at is
running text well very little of what's
on the web is running text what's on the
web is bulleted lists and stuff like
that so the formula just don't get off
the ground for that kind of material
second point is a little more technical
and also interesting these these
readability measures work pretty well if
you have naturally occurring tech
and you want to estimate relative
readability a relative comprehensibility
that the readability these readability
measures actually do pretty well in that
setting they don't work however in the
setting where you say okay I've got my
naturally occurring text and it doesn't
score very well I need to increase my
score the kinds of things that you do to
increase your score probably actually
make the passage less comprehensible so
the things you do to increase your score
things like take a complex sentence and
chop it up into its constituent short
sentences well when you do that you toss
the semantics that really said what
these sentences had to do with each
other which is in the conjunctions and
stuff like that so so these readability
scores don't work as a way of sort of
operationalizing the notion of of you
know simple and clear language so in the
wicked to guidelines that guideline is
gone so one of the consequences of that
is the following that I could have a
site which offers some important
services some important information and
I could deliberately odd fuh skate it
and under the new guidelines it's
basically nothing to say about that
because you know using simple language
is sort of gone from the scene well a
number of people with cognitive
disabilities and their advocates weighed
in in this revision process and
complained and actually lodged a formal
complaint which is kind of a big deal in
this in this world and and there were
some sort of changes of language and a
few other things but basically when the
dust settled the the the use of simple
and clear language is kind of gone from
the the scene and I've been charged with
working with people who are interested
to draft a kind of a supplement to the
guidelines which would say okay if
you're interested in making what you put
on the web easier for a pee
understand these are the things you
ought to do so I've got another google
group that's directed at this drafting
process and there's a cast of characters
there but if any of you are interested
in this especially if any of you would
say yeah I'm I've got some experience in
this area I would be interested in
helping to draft that again if you send
me an email note I'd be I'd be delighted
to invite you into that into that group
so I will stop there nobody interrupted
me which is not a good sign but maybe
you've been holding questions or
comments until now in which case now's
your chance yeah so you spoke a little
bit about the adaptive applications that
could be on a system to allow you to
configure what protocols but what about
the interface I mean what about
combining the work of christov and
Cameron birds last name from University
of Washington did the adaptive
interfaces find that's kind of technique
to yes reg Android great idea yeah I
didn't mean to say so actually the video
people reminded me repeat the question
so question is I talked about adaptive
selection of applications what about
adaptation of the interface and I didn't
mean to to separate those two those
things you know clearly need to to to go
together so you know strategically a
trend that's that's happening for lots
of reasons most not having to do
particularly with inclusion separating
semantics from presentation is sort of
preceding a pace and and that opens up
lots of room for doing good things in
the way of allowing people to express
and have honored their information
presentation preferences of which there
are a lot and and alluded to Chris of
God doses work and those that don't know
that that's really great work at
University of Washington for dealing
with you know fairly mundane kinds of
preferences having to do with I've got a
little teeny screen that's where I want
stuff presented please recast
information to make it work there and
God just as we're
also brings in things like you can
express preferences having to do with
the degree of motor control that you
have so that things like pointing
targets can be adapted the like so
there's there's some great stuff there
but yeah I agree and here are you Josh
do I recognize you good yeah so josh is
absolutely right I mean I and I didn't
intend to say well there's applications
and interface has happened separately
it's really the whole ball of wax so
that somebody could you know again
notionally create a profile in which
they can express these kinds of
preferences I'll mention another one
which which serve didn't come up along
the way but but but it's really
important so many people with with
cognitive abilities including people
with aphasia but other conditions as
well just just have trouble with with
reading actually I don't know you know
here at Google maybe you some of you
anyways spend time kind of watching
people using the web and using search
results but it's it's very striking if
you do that especially if you do it with
with someone who does have some
cognitive challenges or reading
challenges which can have a variety of
origins it really brings out how reliant
we are as users of the web on very rapid
filtering of text and if you sit with
somebody for whom rapid filtering of
text is not on it you really get a
completely different look at the at the
experience and it makes you think about
all kinds of things which would
otherwise maybe you don't think about
like gee what about and actually some of
these things overlap with with things
that people use screen readers want to
have the ability to have a view of
something which looks only at headings
for example these things are really
important so this is another dimension
of user preference so if somebody could
say look you know when stuffs presented
to me I really want to see a view in
which what I'm just seeing is the major
headings and I want to have the ability
then to expand a major heading if I want
to but I don't want to have to pick out
the major headings it from a background
of miscellaneous text actually a point
that
some of you may have thought about
because it often comes up here there's
the question arises sometimes so could
you have a way of presenting information
that would sort of be good for everybody
and the answer is no you know people
just have different information needs
and so rather than thinking in terms of
some single presentation to work for
everybody what you need to be thinking
about is really making presentation
flexible so that people can express what
their needs are and and use the
technology to to honor those things and
it's a one dimension of that is so for
someone who is a typical reader having a
cluttered screen contrary to a lot of
design advice under you know sort of
under many circumstances having a
cluttered screen is actively good for
good readers because it saves having to
a lot of guessing about where the
information is that you want to have the
more stuff you can put on that one
screen the more likely it is that you
can find the thing that you're looking
for right there with having to go to
other screens which in turn involves
having guessing what other screen you
want to go to so for people who are good
readers packing is much stuff on the
screen as possible that's a win but for
lots of other people for all kinds of
reasons it isn't a win and so you really
need to move to a world where people can
specify okay I want to have this kind of
presentation and have content delivered
in a way that allows that that kind of
selection so yeah you is definitely
something that needs to be in the mix
for for adaptation and configuration
other questions comments thoughts from
anybody and yeah I'm needing to have a
user specify how he wants
at the time the work on CSS and
specifically CSS 10 was drawn in the
95-96 painting a lot of uh look scared
about this issue is spent in water fine
hammering on the senior CSS because it
is cascaded the publisher doesn't have
the final say on what it looks like yeah
the user needs to have the same yeah
what is unfortunate it's do things that
unfortunate what they've made no user
level tools for users to control the CFS
hey sad to say the super adaptive
technologies on accessibility community
haven't really pick up on the health of
CSF and the user level tour yeah and
none that'll make a lot of the things
that you're talking about for economy
you know for somebody who say wants to
be able to quickly see the headlines and
then send it can be it's fun things yeah
yes yeah I agree with that and actually
actually something I didn't include on
this contact slide but if any of you are
interested let me know about this as
well so I'm hoping to get some people
from google to participate in one or two
workshops that we're having this fall so
one is actually on mobile technology and
the idea is to do some strategic
thinking about what the opportunities
are and the other one focuses on the web
and one of the things that's emerging
for us is we try to plan that in terms
of you know who needs to do what to
really accomplish some good stuff here
it does seem as if the user agent side
of things is is kind of lagging at least
this is my sense of somebody that's not
on the inside maybe there's stuff going
on there that I'm not aware of but but I
agree with you that really needs to to
to see some emphasis and that reminds me
i was talking with with Charles about
some of his work and maybe everyone here
has seen that but in the world of screen
readers when you say screen reader
people think
oh you've got a user who's blind well
there are many people either are or
would like to be screen readers who are
not blind but they have other challenges
connected with with reading and and the
way they need to control the process is
quite different and some Charles's work
i think is showing some really good
directions there so yeah there's a lot
that that that can be done and needs to
be done on on that side of things the
thoughts from anybody
yeah so when I spective cell phone
technology that is rapidly changing its
physical interface on specifically
other similar phones which are using
touch interfaces yeah that poses a lot
of questions for users who have to then
deal with a interaction model which
isn't confined to a fixed set of buttons
so they always know that I have to
practice oh yeah do you have an opinion
yeah so the question has to do with the
impact of relatively new technologies
and particularly touchscreen multi-touch
kinds of things so I don't have the
model number and I may even be garbling
the higher order term but i think it's
it's docomo well if I'm right that ass
docomo anyway one of the major Japanese
vendors has a line of phones that's
that's aimed at users with challenges
including people who are aging and
little note on that talking with people
in the cell phone business it's really
interesting so on the one hand people
are drawn to the growing population of
aging users but on the other hand
actually more so most vendors are scared
at the prospect of being linked in the
general consumer consciousness with
aging users but any rate docomo i think
it is has been doing some development in
that area and one of the things I've
gotten I've not actually seen this but
I've been reading about it and heard one
presentation that referred to it
apparently they've got technology that
allows somehow the mechanical feel of
the touchscreen to be reconfigured so
that it plays like a touchscreen it's
reconfigurable you can format it as one
big button or three pretty big buttons
or nine smaller buttons and so on but
going along with that is apparently
tactile feedback now what the character
of that tactile feedback I don't know is
I don't know so I don't know whether you
can feel the outlines of the buttons or
whether it's the sort of force feedback
that's configured or what
but there is some you know there is some
some some progress there because I
always think that a good touch screen
interface may not work for you you work
much better than a user can see if there
is tactile feedback coming so much yeah
I went immediately as you look that
might be the case today with the iphone
that a touchscreen is necessarily bad
for abundance if you actually do it
right but and then users can see is also
going to need to use it happening in the
doctor yeah and you had some force
feedback I think it makes the whole
experience more realistic because in the
real world and push buttons will kill
its lifetime otherwise buttons won't be
monogamous yeah I agree no I didn't mean
to say that this these features wouldn't
be a benefit to to others but I've been
interested to see that coming along and
I should I should dig in and try to find
out more about it and particularly find
out whether there's it's it's tactile on
the set that there's something you
actually can feel without engaging the
buttons or or what something that you
know I mentioned the very briefly the
API for multimedia buttons and and one
of the things that was explored a little
bit in that project and then I'm aware
that there's a little bit of work on
this is speaking buttons so you can
imagine something where as you pass your
fingers over the touchscreen you
actually get some auditory feedback
which could give you an idea of what the
buttons are what functions might be
associated with them and the like but I
guess you know stepping up to a higher
level there's there's really a lot of
scope for innovation here and and one of
the things that's attractive about the
Android sort of vision is that the
things should be much more open and so
there should be the freedom for people
to sort of choose the kind of fun that
really works well for them instead of
you know dealing with some palette of
alternatives provided for them by the
providers but as you move into the
hardware stuff obviously there are a lot
of costs and other kinds of issues that
begin resurfacing but nevertheless i'm
looking forward to
you know increased innovation and that
in that space I think there are lots and
lots of interesting possibilities really
thoughts from anybody a lot of things
actually very nice to see what comes out
that's what you liked it he needs
innovation is diagnostic yeah yeah yeah
you know I've I actually haven't been
willing to enter into an exclusive
agreement so the iphone was not
something that i felt i could do but i
did get an ipod touch which is sure you
know shares many features with it and
it's it's it's quite interesting so you
know probably most of you have played
with it and you know that you know the
resolution control has some sort of nice
things about it on the other hand then
you've probably been struck as I have
that it's really not quite right you
know clever as it is because you expand
your view of one thing and then you go
look at something else and you're back
to microscopic again and then you again
have to say no you know if I'm going to
read this and other reasons for that
having to do with you know the
difference between scanning and reading
detail and so on but yeah there's
there's definitely a lot to a lot to
explore in that in that broad area
I think also anybody's mind well thank
you very much if any of you want to say
hello one-on-one i'd be happy to do that
but thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
