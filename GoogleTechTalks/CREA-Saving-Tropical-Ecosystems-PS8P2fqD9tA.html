to today's talk on CR EA saving tropical
ecosystems Michael Roy is sure to talk
about that his work that his
organization CRE is carrying out in
Panama to conserve endangered tropical
forests specifically the talk will deal
with a link between human poverty and
environmental degradation and how social
justice is key to the solution in his
presentation Michael will discuss how CR
EA is taking the leading role in
environmental conservation through the
implementation of innovative programs
and initiatives that the organization
undertakes Michael Roy is an
accomplished conservation geneticist
having obtained his PhD from London
University and they're on working in
academic institutions in the UK Denmark
and the u.s. before being made a tenured
senior lecturer of the zoology at at
Otago University in New Zealand he has
only taken biological research in a wide
variety of terrestrial and marine
organisms and has generated over 40
international research papers while
working on a sabbatical in Panama as a
conservation biologist with the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
in 2002 he came to the stark realization
that the knowledge gained by his written
research and of others was not being
conveyed to the people that most needed
it at that point he made the bold
decision to leave his successful career
as an academic and dedicate himself to a
grass roots organization that could
really be making a change that
organization became known as
conservation through research education
and action CIA in 2005 CR EA became 501
C 3 organization whose mission is to
conserve tropical rainforests through
the building of sustainable livelihoods
for rural communities based on the
principles of science and research and
education and social justice since then
Michael has been working full-time with
CR EA
thank you Michael thanks for mmm well
thank you and thank you for coming
thanks so much Rob for setting this up
and great introduction thank you very
much yes so in 2002 2003 I decided to
take a break from academia as Rob said
and dedicate myself to this organization
called CR EA or crea and developed the
organization of the last five or six
years 2005 we became a registered u.s.
nonprofit organization and our work so
far has been concentrated in Panama at
Central American country which I will
show you shortly yes and really a
mission is to really convey the
information that is out there that could
really help in our struggle to conserve
natural habitats throughout the world
not only tropical regions and get that
information to the people that really
need it these are not only policymakers
but these are also poor people that live
in rural areas in tropical areas and
developing areas that really are lacking
information to be able to change their
lives and change the environment in
which they live and I'll go through a
few slides here about the issue more
than anything and then at the end talk a
little bit about the work that we're
actually doing to address address the
problem I don't we know how to what to
present here whether it should just be
about creo itself or it should be about
the issue itself so I've kind of mixed
it up a little bit just to give you some
background about the issue itself and
the issue i will be talking about its
tropical deforestation with the emphasis
in Central America okay
this works
okay so and just looking at tropical
rainforests tropical rainforests are
type of forest to grow obviously in the
tropics and in a band across the globe
around here
make many years ago many hundreds of
years ago they were much larger in
extent than they are at present day
about fifty percent of all tropical rain
forests have been deforested in the last
200 years due to human activity and
tropical rainforests right now are being
depleted and ever increasing rates the
rate is not decreasing and this is
causing a lot of problems this is
causing other problems not it not only
in terms of the biodiversity loss that
we're finding tropical rainforests
Harbor a wealth of species more species
are found in tropical rainforests and in
any other type of ecosystem to rest real
ecosystem on the planet so over fifty
percent of all the organisms in a
terrestrial biosphere who live in
tropical forests okay so fifty percent
of all species so if we DeForest these
areas we're losing not only the forest
themselves but also the biodiversity
that lives within those forests now that
represents not only an ethical question
an ethical problem but it also
represents a problem of human survival
humans of what humans are really like it
or not we're embedded in a network where
we rely on the on the services of other
species those species could be
pollinators of our crops they could be
species that provide chemicals that
provide us medicines etc wood fibers etc
and so the loss of our forests is
actually a great we'll have a great
damage to our particular way of life as
well and so in its map you can see in
dark green areas of existing forest
light green areas of highly modified for
us these are forests that have been
maybe cut down at some point and allowed
to regrow and areas where there once was
forest and it is in gray but there is no
longer forest
so this is a an aerial map photograph of
Central America North America at the top
here in South America at the bottom this
is mas Central American isthmus was
formed about three million years ago and
the formation of this is Miss the land
bridge between North American South
America allowed species that had evolved
in North America and had evolved in
South America to migrate between the two
continents and this migration through
Central America allowed things like
giant ground sloths and those other
things that we've heard about we used to
exist in North America that actually
evolved in South America migrated up to
North America and those things that were
actually evolved in North America like
camels migrated south to South America
and now we have the llamas and other
camelids that live in South America that
are now extinct in North America and so
this little bridge here allowed a great
biological experiment to occur and
actually helped in increasing the
diversity in these two great continents
although many species went extinct your
next experiment there was a great
mixture of other species that did
survive today this corridor still
represents a major traffic traffic route
for species dispersal between the two
continents and we just have to look at
my gray tree birds to see how important
this particular migratory link is this
lambridge is Panamera's are as a country
it's here in the grand scheme of things
it's the southern end of a central
american lambridge has a population
about 3 million people this is South
it's a size of about South Carolina to
very small country and still has
and quite a lot of forest left in it
Central America itself has an incredible
amount of biodiversity on its own right
it has two areas that are known as
biodiversity hotspots there's the
Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot that
goes from the North down into the
central Panama and the truck or darienne
biodiversity hotspot which goes from
central Panama down into Ecuador these
hotspots around the globe represent
areas of extremely high biodiversity but
areas that are also under extreme threat
and these are seen as priority areas for
conservation and Central America has to
these hotspots
so here we have Panama and Panama
actually is the narrowest country of
Central America in fact the narrowest
point in Central America is just here
just east of Panama City which is here
in panama canal runs through this point
here that's the narrowest point and so
if you imagine Central America being
this highway where things are dispersing
up and down the most vulnerable point
the most fragile point is its narrowest
point where things can bottleneck if you
remove habitat in this area you could
have a devastating effect and what we're
doing now increase working in this area
to try and preserve the rain forests
that exist still exist in this area
although they're being divorced at an
ever-increasing rate this is a priority
zone for us
so Panama it's actually a tenth most
biodiverse country out of any country
relative to its size it has more verse
for us than any other Central American
country has more birds bird species than
the USA in Canada combined almost a
thousand species and it contains three
and a half cent of all flowering plants
on the planet and per area has 21 times
number of plant species in a small area
in the Panama Canal there are over 3,000
species of trees alone so you can just
imagine the immense wealth of
biodiversity that are in these areas
but unfortunately these rainforests in
Panama and in other tropical areas
around the globe are literally going up
in smoke this is a very very common
sight in Panama and actually the rest of
the tropical humid world the world's
tropical forests are shrinking by 50
million acres per year 50 million acres
per year and in fact if you look at the
rates of deforestation around the globe
Central America is actually losing the
most order has the highest rate of
deforestation relative to its science
and it lost nineteen percent of forest
cover between 1990 and 2005 okay it's an
immense amount of tropical rainforest
and imagine all the species that are
living in those rainforests in total
forest burning accounts for twenty
percent of all human induced carbon
emissions cases carbon dioxide is
released into the atmosphere twenty
percent of all our emissions come from
the burning of forests if you compare
that to all transportation
transportation which is cars and ships
and what have you planes that adds up in
total to fourteen percent so if we want
to do something about greenhouse gas
emissions and global warming we really
have to do something about forest
burning
and I talked a little bit more about
that in a little in just a couple of
slides it's predicted that about nine
species of rain forest species these are
become extinct every day because of
tropical deforestation line species per
day and these species could be species
that have the next cure for certain
types of cancer or other things that are
very very important to us in our
particular society but even without that
knowledge even without thinking that
they could be of use to us I think
there's a very strong ethical argument
that this is wrong but given all those
biodiversity and loss of life and all
those things it's important to realize
that there's a lot of people are also
rely on those tropical forests people
rely on tropical forests it's not that
tropical forest can be shoved aside and
said well it's something else we don't
really like we don't need them out there
to get get divorced well it's a shame
but well they're being DeForest it no
twenty-five percent of the world's
population rely on forest resources for
their livelihoods and of these almost
1.2 billion live in extreme poverty so
what we've seen here if you correlate
these two things deforestation and
poverty you see a direct correlation you
see that where there's higher
deforestation rates there's higher
poverty with this higher poverty that's
higher deforestation rates so if we want
to do something about deforestation you
really can't tackle the deforestation
problem as a single problem the problem
has to be tackled as one of tackling
poverty and deforestation in the same in
the same process
just a one-day one year 31st of Marchen
2003 there were 200 Human League wild
wild fires detectable from space in
Panama this is just one particular
snapshot of Panama in this particular
day two hundred and these are the red
dots here these are the ones that have
actually seen from space there are many
more but you just can't detect them and
in this satellite image you see a lot of
cloud cover of the white clouds but here
mixed in here there's a lot of smoke see
all the smoke coming out from criminal
fires in the whole of Central America in
2005 I believe there were 66,000
wildfires that raged through the burning
season through the summer season 66,000
in 11 year
so this is another slide of that
particular thing the red dots are the
fires and this is just the smoke plume
that comes out from those fires the
smoke plume has disastrous effects not
only is it releasing carbon dioxide is
releasing a lot of other dangerous
chemicals and I know living in Panama
City during the during the burning
season which goes from January through
to April the burning season even sitting
in my house in Panama City I get covered
in ash just if I sit still just due to
the burning that's going on outside in
rural areas it all floats up and well
the ash come falls down in Panama City
yes yes mostly and I come on to that but
yeah but yeah mostly and so there's a
lot of other side effects of the smokers
effects that's health effects as well as
the greenhouse gas emission effect
and I'll just spend a little time on on
global warming and as you probably are
all aware global temperatures have risen
drastically over the last few decades
and you can see over a records going
back about 100 150 years temperatures
suddenly peeking or rising up here we've
gone from about 280 parts per million of
carbon dioxide as a base level to about
385 parts per million at the present day
this figure rises by about two parts per
million every year it's thought that the
absolute maximum that the earth could
could could handle without going into
some kind of meltdown is about 550 parts
per million what we're hoping to do
through international mechanisms is to
keep it under 450 parts per million
hopefully at some point in a few years
time will we can stabilize it at 450
some argument of 450 is actually too
high before because that level of 450
could actually be too late to actually
produce some kind of cataclysmic effect
but anyway we're problems in terms of
our condo side release and global
warming
see also real problems with in terms of
biodiversity crisis and current
extinction rates as I said about nine
species go extinct every day through
tropical deforestation clan extinction
rates around the globe are about a
thousand times background so before
humans there was an extinction rate you
need extinctions to through an
evolutionary process so there was a
background evil extinction rate current
extinction rates are a thousand times
that background rate okay so that's all
human induced and there's it's
calculated approximately 14,000 species
go extinct every year 14,000 so it's a
hell lot of species and half of all
species are threatened with extinction
during this particular century half of
all species and it's calculated at about
seven million species will go extinct
this century if we don't do anything
some groups such as amphibians are
likely to be harder hit there are some
groups that are more fragile than other
groups this is kind of like the Canaries
in down the mine and filian's are one of
those indicator species and I'll show
you a slide later about how how they're
being affected and some large even large
charismatic what we don't hear in
newspapers or in the media very often is
certain species go extinct you don't
hear these these figures anyway I mean
who's to know that things going extinct
the last thing the general public we
heard about is the another dodo or
carrier pigeon or something and
but the in 2006 are quite a high-profile
species went extinct this was the
Chinese river dolphin it went extinct in
2006 so sometimes extinctions do come
out in the media but this is going on
every day and global warming add another
serious dimension to this crisis so
there's like a double whammy we're
cutting down the rainforests and causing
extinctions we come down the rain for us
emitting greenhouse gases that cause
extinctions okay so there's two things
that are happening future boo
deforestation that are causing these
mass extinctions
and to explain that a little bit many
many species in the tropics living very
very defined habitats very very defined
habitats more so than you find in
temperate areas okay so you might find
one species of frog for example that
lives literally inherit exercises from
the whole species is represented by this
particular patch okay and so if you
remove that patch of forest you've
remove the species and that's that's
very evident in tropical areas
especially high altitude neural
attitudinally high areas has even more
predominant and these species live at
the tops of mountains okay in these
tropical areas and they've adapted to a
certain temperature range okay and as
as temperatures increase these species
will have to migrate up the mountain to
find their new the new area that has
that temperature range are you with me
yeah and so there's only a limit to how
high they can go because the mountain is
only so high and so what's likely to
happen and we see it happening already
is that there's species migrations on an
altitude inul level so these species
actually moving up the hillside but
those ones are at the top of the hill at
the top of the mountain have nowhere to
go and so they fall off and then a they
go extinct it literally fall off and so
we find that in central Panama and
highlands of central Panama many species
are going extinct in highland areas and
we also find the same pattern happening
in India and also the rest of the world
so it's not just a Central American
phenomenon is happening everywhere so
global warming even though these areas
are not becoming deforested but not
deforested there may be in a national
park maybe really well preserved we're
finding these extinctions happening
because of global warming so this is the
amphibian thing so high Highland
amphibians Highland frogs through
Central America are becoming extinct at
a very very rapid rate and here we see
some some popular some species that have
been measured in terms of population
size over time and we see them crashing
and becoming extinct crashing going
extinct crashing going extinct kind of
trending to crashing
and the culprit of this is not global
warming per se but we found it to be a
fungus infection now we don't know if
this fungus infection has suddenly
become predominant because of
atmospheric or other pollutants or
global warming or some other impacts of
the forest but it is so predominant but
it's causing many species to become
extinct so we don't know the cause why
this fungus has suddenly been released
and said it becomes so lethal to these
particular species there's a worrying
trend that we're seeing declining forest
growth everyone has predicted and so far
there are conflicting models of forest
growth one model of forest growth
suggests that with the increase in
carbon dioxide you're actually finding
greater stress on forest trees and this
is causing slower growth and slower
sequestration rates oakham dioxide so
it's actually a positive feedback is
actually releasing carbon dioxide at the
same time you're weakening the strength
of those trees to actually sequester
carbon dioxide which is having a double
effect other data suggests that trees
some trees actually have a better
capacity for sequestration and so it was
a bit of conflicting evidence right now
and we wait to see which which one is
the right model but just to show you
that there is this particular problem
that were finding and it could it could
work out that this is actually what's
happening
and also with with global warming with
finding much higher much higher
temperatures of course but also more
droughts occurring in tropical forests I
mean it's it's hard to believe that
tropical forests could go through a
drought but trouble but droughts do
occur in these areas and more so over
the last decade or so the amazon has
gone through a number of droughts over
the last few years unheard of in
recorded history and these droughts
themselves cause fires to occur so there
could be fires that occurred naturally
and there's more naturally occurring
fires now occurring in these areas that
never had fire before and another
interesting thing that's been found is
that the release of smoke and its carbon
particles that are released into the
atmosphere these carbon particles
actually gone to two water molecules in
the atmosphere in clouds and actually
don't allow it to rain so they actually
bonded and then the smoke actually
carries the clouds away so it no longer
rains in that patch so the smoke
actually has a drying effects as well so
we're finding these local climatic
changes that are really severe and
causing these really severe local
drought conditions where there should be
tropical rainforests and just quickly no
matter what model you look at every
model suggests that there's going to be
much greater much higher temperatures in
the future these are different models of
climatic changes all of them showing
greater temperature higher temperature
and all of them showing here greater
drying as well in areas different areas
so I just quickly move on
and obviously global warming has many
other effects that are all related to
our survival as well droughts in
Australia the current shortage of food
crops may be attributed to global
warming storms etc and
so why is this happening why is triple
deforestation happening why is the major
cause of it we're finding that most of
the tropical deforestation we see that
occurs and subsequent burning of that
forest in Central America at least it
tends to be smallholders poor people in
in marginal areas that are burning these
forests to open up land for agricultural
expansion okay these are very very poor
people eking out a living the
subsistence farmers that are just trying
to make a little bit open up a little
bit more land to grow their crops that
is the major part of this whole thing in
Central America and what do these
farmers actually get out of it they get
out a very very little in terms of the
actual benefits the financial benefits
it's been found that they may get about
ten cents to about five dollars at
maximum per ton of carbon that they
release in terms of the produce that
they get at the end of the day okay so
they cut the forest they emit the con
backside their plunder their crops they
sell their crops if they possibly can
and this is what they'll make per ton
that they release at the end of the day
okay if you look at carbon markets now
carbon markets in terms of selling and
buying carbon credits are between five
to fifteen dollars a ton okay so really
these people are not making the most out
of their forests they can make much more
if they were involved in a carbon market
that's that's the that's the point of
this okay so really they divorced in the
forest for much lower gain than they
would do if they'd kept the forest yeah
at the heart of the problem is food
security and economic security for these
people they simply do not have enough
food security to be able to say that I
would try new techniques I will conserve
this forest I will develop a mechanism
of more sustainable agriculture over the
next 10 years they just simply do not
have the money to be able to do those
things so they lack food security
they're always looking for food to feed
themselves for the next day and economic
security they simply do not have enough
financial capacity to be able to bother
them to a new way of doing things so if
as creo is concerned we believe that by
investing these were poor rural
communities and providing them the
skills to be able to sustainably produce
food provide them access to markets and
resources we can address the two
problems of poverty and deforestation in
one go
and this is this is kind of this is a
slide just to show the elements of of
slash and burn where you have a forest
it gets cut down it gets burned and it
ends up looking a bit like this so the
farmer will cut the forest down burn it
plant a few crops then move on the next
year because the soil is so bad he can't
grow more crops he'll move on to the
next plot of land cut it down grow crops
in that cycle what he leaves behind is
usually just an area that can't use
anymore what happens is cattle ranch has
come in after him and start grazing cows
on on that land and so there's no hope
for regeneration of those previously
forested areas and so this is an area
that is now a cattle ranch where you see
the stumps and the old burn trees that
was for us maybe five years ago and
causing huge amounts of erosion on
hillsides and eventually areas that are
just you can't actually restore these
areas or they won't naturally restore
themselves and it leads to huge amounts
of poverty
so the cycle really is farmer it grows a
few crops he burns the forest kappa
ranch has come in grazing their cows no
hope for restoration causes
fragmentation of forest so these forests
are now not connected to each other
doesn't allow dispersal of populations
between those fragments eventual
eventually he'll burn all the forests
because he's looking for more and more
land so this is business as usual we
find it a lose-lose situation because
the farmer is constantly in poverty he's
constantly searching for food security
and at the same time the forest is being
burned by diverse is being lost
and I will go through this pretty
quickly once I have everything
so start with very poor people they have
poor health unable to work they have
many children usually these are
communities with no formal education
there's no real school around sir did
this before didn't it okay so I'll try
this work and then that leads to
communities with no formal education
which leads to a dependence on
traditions so slash-and-burn is the
system they're using it to depend on
these traditions these traditional
farming techniques are not adequate for
the current population size if everybody
is doing it and there's high density of
people if everyone is doing slash and
burn you don't get yet allow for
recuperation of the forest and this
leads to intense environmental
degradation and there's a lack of state
or international capacity understanding
or will to actually help these people to
bring these people out to give them a
safety net from which they can then move
to a more sustainable form of
agriculture so they're really left alone
to carry on doing what they're doing
already business as usual and so crazed
approach is to try and act within here
give them a platform give them a safety
net in which they can realize more
sustainable forms of Agriculture which
doesn't mean that they have to keep on
moving on through the forest slashing
and burning
and this is just one farmer that has
been slashing and burning through his
farm for a few decades and this is the
state of his farm he has a thousand
acres that he's actually plotted out and
it's his and this is the state of his
farm he has absolutely ruined it in
terms of anything he can't he can't
graze cows there anymore and he is so
poor that he doesn't even own chickens
so this is this is a real a real sad
story it's it has proven to be a very
much a lose-lose situation for him he's
now extreme poverty he doesn't have any
natural capsule any natural resources on
which to rely on and so this is a very
very bad case
I want to open up to the crest solution
is
the crowd solution provides a more
sustainable model the crowd solution is
one where the farmer has learned how to
produce food more sustainably this means
that they are staying on the same patch
of land for much longer than they
normally would okay normally standard
one patch of land for one or two years
before moving the crayon model has the
farmer staying on the same patch of land
for about 20 to 30 years okay if a
farmer doesn't need to move they have
food security they will no longer be
burning and cutting the forest okay
that's the essential part of the crayon
model with the crane model you'll find
much more many more elements of natural
resource protection protection of the
river for example as a very important
natural resource that the farmer relies
on protection of the wetland areas that
the farmer also relies on and protection
of these forested areas these natural
areas plus an area of reforestation of
degraded degraded lands to connect
reconnect these forested areas okay by
having this area these these huge areas
of what these areas with large amounts
of natural capital large amounts of
natural resources the follow will be
better off in the long run and so how do
we get to this particular solution how
do we do this or what we're doing is
we're helping these farmers we're
training these farmers in techniques
that will allow them to become more
sustainable we're training them in in
providing providing them information on
how they nurture the soil how they
maintain soil fertility how they stop
erosion for example of the hillsides and
also training them in terms of how that
how they use their natural resources
further for their own benefit
and also not only that but how to
monitor their natural environment the
national environment how how to monitor
the health of the national environment
so they benefit from it so we so we
train them in making natural pesticides
we train them in making erosion barriers
organic fertilizers etc if we can get
these farmers to to get much more
produce out of a much smaller patch of
land we will do something about the
deforestation rate so the crane model is
also known as the PRP approach is to
protect forests restore degraded lands
and to produce sustainably and it's
giving people livelihoods that promote
sustainability and the protect part is
to actually protect the standing forests
whose natural forests through some land
lease program or a land purchase program
we're actively involved in in in these
two programs where we're getting farmers
to set aside first like this on their
lands and saying please to protect these
areas will show you how to farm
sustainably here so you don't need to
burn these forests anymore and also we
have a small land purchase program as
well where we actually purchase
purchasing strategic areas that are
abandoned so before capital runs has
come in we try and go in and and protect
those areas and restoring degraded areas
like this that are between two patches
of forest so program we have is called
the partnership forest initiative this
initiative is actually one of our major
programs and will become one of our
major programs it's a program of
reforestation on farmers lands
reforestation the benefits financially
the farmer so that they go into some
sort of some kind of small agroforestry
business themselves in partnership with
crea and in partnership with a donor and
so we're providing livelihoods for these
people and the same time reforesting
their lands
and this is just one one farmer they
have their their map of the forestry
that they we asked the farmer themselves
what they would like and how they see
the forestry or their sustainable
agricultural systems working where they
would like to see the forestry put what
kind of trees they would like et cetera
and and together we develop a model for
each particular farm and this is 11
farmer family that develop their own
model and drew their own plan and this
guy is actually the artist is actually a
really good artist and so we work with
farmers it's very much not a top-down
approach we're not telling people what
to do we're asking people how we could
help them solve their problems and we
come up with a menu and say well how
about this and how about that does
anything you see here you know strike
your fancy do you like any of this stuff
and we come together with some agreement
about how we can proceed together for
the future this is a farmer that has
succeeded in just escaping that poverty
cycle through becoming more intensive in
terms of her agricultural production but
also much more sustainable she only owes
to owns 12 acres of land imagine
remember the other guy who had a
thousand acres she only has 12 acres but
she's rich enough to send her kids to
school and she owns a brick house she
only has 12 acres how does she do it
well he has a farm that looks like this
she has a farm that has lots of timber
trees in between the timber trees she's
growing coffee she's growing bananas
plantain she's growing coconut she's
growing a whole bunch of different stuff
the key here is that we get people to
grow things like this but in diversity
diversity is the key for these
particular to make a farm sustainable
diversity diversity not only helps in
terms of cycling of nutrients through
sort through the soil through the
atmosphere providing habitat for species
that are good species that may pollinate
your crops and those types of things but
it also helps in terms of to the markets
if something is selling very a very low
price maybe you can switch to something
else that you're growing cells at a
higher price
sold out at that particular day so it
gives you also financial buffering as
well and so she's actually doing
extremely well and she only has one cow
on one pig and the other one is to
produce sustainably and we're helping
people find new methods of Agriculture
that don't involve slashing and burning
and we're as I said we're helping people
willing to markets that will help them
realize financial gains that they've
made through the increased production
and the sustainable production of their
produce and these are some of the
farmers we're working with
and then we have a farmer to Farmer
training program sorry I didn't realize
it was going to do this
oh okay well there's some of these sizes
let them go if I want to find a training
program where we actually trained
farmers in communities to become
trainers themselves so we go in and we
helped train a few people but of some of
those people we select some that we find
that are particularly good communicators
are particularly energetic in terms of
you know their willingness to do this we
trained them to become trainers we give
them all the material we give them
lessons in how to present and they go
out to the rest of the community and
they teach the rest of the community
what they've just learned and so this is
a trainer trainer chain the trainer
program has been particularly effective
in the communities where we were working
and sorry I was rushing at the end there
I hurry us at the time is getting a
little short so you know thank you thank
you very much for your attention you
have any questions please go ahead
for the farmer Sanchez example
we apply or what would you do for that
situation and
for the corridor that being
are the animals actually
okay so the first question was in terms
of farmer Sanchez a thousand acres
whether that is a lost cause or or not I
guess that's the essential elements of
the question it in some certain sunk in
some way of thinking it is a lost cause
it will take a lot of investment to
restore that but it can be done whether
the whether it's worth in terms of you
know financially whether it's worth
investing money to try and restore that
I don't know but in terms of the actual
restoration that you'd need to do on
that farm it would it would take a lot
of work and a lot of money because it's
really really wait we're gone the crow
solution would probably it would work
there if we had enough investment to
implement it but in terms of the crow
solution we hope to get to farmers
before they get to that stage that's an
extreme stage the farmers we're working
with the none of the farmers are working
with have got sort of that particular
stage that was an extreme example we
hope to get to them before they get
there where it's much easier and much
lower investment for us to actually
recuperate their farms the second
question about the biological corridors
that we're trying to make between
forests and deuce deuce pieces actually
use them yes they do it depends on the
species you're talking about as soon as
you put some kind of habitat even if you
left it as grass people some species
will be using them but the more
diversity you place in that corridor the
more species will start using them and
for it to be an effective corridor for
larger species it would take maybe 10 or
so years for for larger mammals perhaps
to start using them
but it depends on the species again
really and where it is and so there's a
lot of variables in that question
I guess what is it
which
permaculture
we we teach a varied set of different
methods and really it's not just one
thing that we're trying to do it's a
matter of what fits in particular
environment you may find for some it's
who they're pretty well-developed
already and just need that extra push
you know a full organic type thing is is
the way to go because you know they know
the organic markets and they're ready to
go but they just need that extra push
but there are some others that are you
know most of the people were working
with illiterate are subsistence farmers
and they just need very basic
implementation of some sustainable
techniques initially to get them on the
road to further sustainability and
diversity
right exactly exactly yeah yeah what one
thing that we are really added about we
is soil nutrition because the thing that
is causing / bear in the first place
causing people to move from patch to
patch is the lap of neutrons in tropical
soils the inherent lack of deterrence in
tropical soils and the soles there are
not like the soils in Northern Europe
which I'm more used to which which tend
to be much more fertile in terms of
nutrient value that they have tropical
saw is very thin and quite nutrient-poor
that causes then it's become exhausted
very quickly through a cycle and if and
with the heavy rains and all those other
environmental factors nutrients and salt
in the soils get washed away very very
quickly and so Matt so the second year
when they try and raise a crop on that
land it fails and so they need to move
so solar nutrition is the key element in
the sustainability part of this to keep
the soil for nutrients to maintain that
nutrient balance the diversity in the
plants that you that you plant really
helps you have different plants playing
off either plant if nitrogen fixers and
you have other other types of plants
with other nutrient
needs etc what's the biggest area of
help that Korea needs as an organization
right now
we need help in terms of well to be
totally honest what we need right now is
is help in developing our organization
we have for the last five years being a
very much a grassroots organization
working with farmers on the ground
working with certain quite a few
communities in central Panama and we
would like to take that we've worked out
some of those essential models on the in
on the ground we would like to take that
and scale it but to take that and scale
it we need an organization that can
support us and crea as an organization
hasn't really built up it's a young
organization hasn't really built up that
platform yet to be able to launch us to
become more scalable and so I can see
that our immediate needs are to build
the organization in terms of the
personnel that we have in terms of the
financial capacity that we have in order
to be able to learn to us to become much
more scalable that's what I see as our
immediate needs yeah
which requires funding yeah you can
describe a little bit about how you use
Google Earth you mentioned earlier on
right so yeah well we are actually
involved with not only this but we are
actually doing and some academic stuff
as well I mean I'm an academic and I
research is really what I like doing and
so we're working with Warren Wilson
College in North Carolina we have a GIS
or geographic information system project
with that college and what we're trying
to do is really using a GIS platform in
this case Google Earth as our basic
mapping platform to monitor forest
health and forest function now forest
help enforce function is a very dynamic
thing it changes all the time but human
impacts surrounding forests can also
impact the forest interior and so what
we're trying to do is measure those
impacts inside those forests in terms of
climatic changes local climatic changes
or nutrient cycling or atmospheric
cycling of particular chemicals etc come
back side is one of some measure those
things in different areas of the forest
areas that are close to the actual
source of the impacts those areas that
are more internal inside the forest but
the way we're doing it is using sensors
wireless sensors that are placed in the
forest themselves these are little
sensors developed by sun microsystems
and these sensors are placed in the
forests that are detecting a certain
thing collecting data and those sensors
have the ability to send information
wirelessly to a central computer that is
on site somewhere and the computer
compiles all the information coming from
all the sensors around the forest
compiles our information and then
uploads that information to such a thing
as you know like a Google Earth platform
so that
ature or anybody that once that's
interested in the data that's coming out
of those forests can see it anywhere in
the world so you can click on Google
Earth and you can see that this is you
know current levels of whatever you're
looking at we're very much in the
development stage so it isn't on our
website yet with this is we started the
project in October last year and so
we're really developing the the likely
the wireless structure the hardware
software part of that and so it's it's
in the experimental phase right now but
we hope it will be up and running in a
year and obviously in the experimental
phase still but up and running on a
website yeah
now
yeah it's a really good question so the
Panama Canal has obviously formed a
barrier between what is West and East
Panama and certain species cannot cross
that and so yes you have formed this
this barrier other species do cross it
easily birds obviously cross it easily
some flying insects can cross it quite
easily but even large mammals cross it
at some points is quite narrow and it's
been shown that large cats for example
swim across it so it has formed a
barrier for some species the Panama
Canal also has introduced a lot of
species lot of Quantic species into it a
lot of freshwater species that are
invasive for come in through that so
there's an added problem as well it's
not just a barrier but it's actually a
channel for invasive species too yeah
you know the questions
okay well thank you very much thank you
