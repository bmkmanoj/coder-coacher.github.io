our talks we have an author of a book
practitioners guide to software testing
design inside Google we've been doing a
book club where we've been reading this
book for the last few weeks and we're
lucky enough to have the author here
today Lee Copeland no relation to me he
is also the program director for the
star conferences in addition he is the
managing editor of software quality
magazine our quality software magazine I
should correct and I'd like to invite
him up to do a talk today on proving
your worth so give a round of applause
to leak Oakland I'm not sure we're not
related somewhere back in the yeah it's
that intelligent thing well I'm honored
to be invited to come and and chat with
you and I'm going to talk today about
proving our worth quantifying the value
of testing so let me find out a little
bit first about who you are how many
consider yourselves primarily testers
that's basically what you do okay how
many do primarily do other things what
are some of those other things software
engineering other things please
automation okay other things manager
manager of testing testing okay so but
you're all you all have some interest in
involvement in testing okay so let's
let's talk about that this the idea for
this talk kind of sprang from an
experience I had recently I I've got a
new consulting client it will call him
mega Corp and they invited me in to do
an assessment of their testing process
this is one of the things that that we
do at the company I'm with software
quality engineering we come in and do
assessments of people's testing process
and then if they want us to we give
suggestions on what they might do both
in the short term and the long term to
to make their process better more
effective so I went to mega corp and
this is what I heard first of all I
interviewed Raj in the project manager
and he said this he said testers are
such a nuisance they waste time create
bugs get in the way of shipping our
products cost too much and basically
make the developers feel bad and this
was this was his view um I then went to
talk to weigh in who's the test manager
and she said this she said management
here just doesn't have a clue they don't
see any value in there in our work and
why can't they make up our minds one day
quality is the most important thing in
the next day shipping the product is so
as a consultant you know when you go in
and you hear this kind of news you do
one of two things you know it's either
going to be a long process or every once
in a while you just kind of want to
tiptoe away as quickly as you can and go
find another client but I heard this and
and I hear in my consulting work I hear
these bombardments a lot I hear these
accusations flying and and perhaps
you've heard them too hopefully not here
but you know that that place you used to
work you may have heard these kinds of
things and like I said I hope they're
not flying overhead your organization
but
for some people I visit we hear this
thing all the time there's the us versus
them you know an us versus them often
means good guys and bad guys and
depending on which group you're in you
know you're either the good guy or the
bad guy before we can talk about the
value of testing I want to talk for just
a second about what testing is all about
and this kind of interesting because I
got an email just early this morning
from somebody over in India who had read
an article that I've written on a sticky
mines calm shameless commercial message
here there's a website we produced
called sticky mines calm which are
trying to make the world's premier
website on software testing and software
engineering things so wanted to suggest
that to you but the email was I read
your article and and you talked about
testing use cases and and I don't think
you're talking about testing I think
you're talking about reviews and
inspections and so my response to him
was essentially to do a copy and paste
right from this presentation what do we
mean by testing well there are different
definitions glenford Myers who wrote one
of the first books on software testing
techniques i think it was nineteen
seventy eight or 79 said this he said
testing is the process of executing a
program or system with the intent of
finding errors that's what testing is no
more no less bill Hetzel who is another
one of the grandfather's of formal
testing in his book which was first
published in the nineteen eighty-three
said this testing is any activity aimed
at evaluating an attribute of a process
or a sisterhood all right do you feel a
difference between these which what's
the difference here what's the major
difference this is the
audience-participation part of the
program
so
right the first one is all about
executing test cases isn't it what about
things like reviews inspections
walkthroughs buddy checks the does that
fit in the first definition no does it
fit in the second definition yes it does
now in fact there is even a narrower
definition there's probably a Robert
bender who's written a book its testing
object-oriented something either
software systems ideas testing object
oriented systems if you've ever seen
this book you'll never forget it it's
over fourteen hundred pages long you can
physically hurt yourself by picking this
book up wrong I wrote a book review of
it some years ago and I actually took it
down to the grocery store and weighed it
you know in the produce section that it
weighs about four and a half pounds
which turns out to be twice the birth
weight of my my last child he was about
2.2 when he was born so it's a big buck
but bender says this he says testing is
running the test cases yes Bob you say
well what about designing the test cases
what about planning for testing what
about evaluating you know the expected
result versus the actual results is no
no that's not testing testing is just
running the test cases I don't know
about you that that strikes me as a
little narrow for a definition but one
of the difficulties that many
organizations have is we as testers
don't even know we can't even agree on
what the word testing means so I would
suggest that an important prerequisite
for figuring out the value of testing
and an organization's first of all
figure out what you're talking about
what is testing me now there's another
book again I want to shamelessly plug
here because it's a companion book to
mine it's called systematic software
testing but written by Rick Craig who's
one of our company consultants and
trainers Rick and Steve wrote this they
said testing is a concurrent life cycle
process of engineering using and
maintaining test where in order to
measure and improve the quality of the
software being
so again this is a broader definition
and I like the idea here of improving
testing without improving as an
interesting task and yes you can get
paid for that but ultimately if we don't
improve the product I don't feel much
use for for doing that so there are all
kinds of definitions of testing I happen
to like this one the best now note the
similarities in these though the process
of finding the process of evaluating the
process of measuring the process of
improving what's the big word in every
one of those that's the process that we
do and I think for over a quarter of a
century now we as testers have focused
on the wrong thing we have focused so
much on the internal processes how we do
testing how well how do you put together
test plan how do you design test cases
how do you how do you execute those how
do you automate some of that stuff that
we have generally ignored the real
purpose of testing we have focus so much
internally and focus so much inward and
and and a reputation kind of goes along
with that I mean what kind of things do
we report to our project manager to a
program manager to executive managers we
tell them about the process we say
things like we created this many test
cases today and we executed and we found
these many defects and and they don't
care because we're telling about the
innards of our process there's something
else we ought to focus on I think the
real propan is the purpose is this and
here's a drum roll you're going to have
a drum roll googled around last night
for all kinds of you know drum roll mp3
s just couldn't find the one that I want
so we're going to leave it at this this
drum roll
the purpose of testing is actually to
create information you say that again
the purpose of testing is to create
information and James Bach wrote this a
number of years ago he said the ultimate
reason testers exist is to provide
information that others on the project
can use to create things of value those
of you who work daily as testers have
you thought about your role in this way
or have you thought about your role as
my job is to write test case my jobs to
run test case my jobs to report on I
think those are all good I mean those
are all wonderful well of course we have
to do that but I think there's a higher
level of you and that what we're doing
here is we're trying to create
information that will be a value that
other people then can use to create
products that are a value to our clients
so that's kind of the big message for
today so let's go back to Raj and the
project manager here when he says
testers are such a nuisance maybe what
he's really trying to tell me is
something else maybe he doesn't know how
to articulate it very well maybe he
doesn't understand the exact words but
maybe he's trying to say this I'm not
getting enough valuable information to
justify the cost of testing does that
make sense and you understand that when
somebody says this what they really
might be trying to say is this I just
don't get any value of this there's all
this activity going on there's all this
expense there's all these people there's
always stuff and yet I don't I don't
receive anything or my product my
project doesn't seem to receive anything
of value from maybe that's what he's
really trying to tell us okay and again
he you know he just doesn't know how now
let's go back to rain the test manager
when she's saying this may be what she's
really trying to say is this my
management doesn't value the information
I'm providing to them again you see how
when she says these kind of things she
might be trying to say this
human beings are just notoriously good
at providing alternate meanings to words
you know somebody says something and we
we apply some let me give you an example
this this last spring I put up a fence
around my house so finally I can let the
kids and the dog kind of roam freely but
before that my wife would ask me a
question she would say where are the
children that's a simple question right
where are the children and if I didn't
know I would go up no I'm a bad parent I
don't know where my children are I'm
neglectful I shouldn't be that way and
then that would quickly turn to but my
wife already knows that why is she
bringing this up why is she accusing me
of being a bad parent and and this
happens in you know in microseconds we
go from her question too I am a bad
parent and my wife is letting me know
that now one day I got tired of this and
I said to her why do you constantly
attack me and she said what I said
you're always after me about she said I
asked you what are the XY coordinates of
you the children that's all I was asking
that's all I wanted to know and I was
adding all this stuff to it there are
often messages that we add two words and
there are some times when we just flat
out you know we don't get the message
that's in the words you know my daughter
is trying to dump the latest boyfriend
and words like I never want to see you
again do not call me again seem to just
you know so this is a problem at all all
human communication has we we missed
some stuff and we add some other stuff
to it but but perhaps these are what
these folks are really trying to say so
again I think the value of testing is
the value of the information that we
create for others now who determines
that value again this is the
audience-participation part who
determines the value of that information
that we provide to them whoever them is
say again the recipient absolutely it
would be a lot easier if we if we
determine the value then there is great
value to all those reports you know that
I send out on a daily and weekly basis
but in fact it's the recipient it's the
hearer it's the it's the receiver who
determines the value now as I was doing
some research on this talk i found a
came across a paper written by this
fellow a cameron har say who had a
really cool idea he said we should set
up information experiments we should
give certain manager certain kinds of
information and withhold that
information from other managers and then
we should vary those kinds of things
like you would in a scientific
experiment and figure out which
information is really useful in which
isn't now that's great I hear these
kinds of proposals all the time for
these kinds of experiments the amazing
thing to me is that the first name of
every person who ever proposes these
things is always the same the people who
proposed these things is always have the
same first name their first name is
Professor ok would you do this in your
organization with would you specifically
withhold information from your manager
would you specifically withhold
information from your team as an
experiment to see how well or how poorly
they perform based on so that's why I
say in the utopian world you know we
might do this but I just don't think it
makes any sense what we need to do is
give everyone as much valuable
information as we can have a good friend
over in in the UK named Lloyd Rodin
who's a
professional there and when I asked
Lloyd to take a look at my presentation
and he came back with this criticism he
said wait a minute yeah I like what you
say but doesn't testing have a value in
and of itself even if we don't create
any information if we find a defect and
we find that early and it gets fixed and
it never then escapes into production
haven't we added value we we save the
organization's of money right because we
don't have to find it and fix it and
deal with it later and and I agree that
yes we have created value but I want to
focus on this other thing because I
think most organizations least the ones
that I've seen have no mechanism for
quantifying the value the testing adds
what we have are what we call campfire
stories you got a testing camp in the
summer yeah go up sit around in the
mountains and you know the moons coming
up and you got the campfire and you're
singing Kumbaya you're telling testing
stories this is what i mean by camp
muted you don't go to testing okay what
this thing out a great deal do you go to
the star conferences ok by campfire
stories I mean stories anecdotes that we
tell and many organizations have what i
call campfire stories oh you remember
the bug when it was this if it was the
second tuesday at a month and the moon
was full and the amount was this and the
you know this didn't match that and dot
dot dot then the system failed what we
love to sit around the campfire and talk
about those stories in fact if you were
the solver of that if you were the
discoverer of that you know you get to
tell the story and everybody smiles at
you at the campfires the campfire
stories make it at the executive level
in organizations very rarely they like
data especially they like economic data
you know cost and
profit return on investment things like
that that's that's the language so so I
will admit that there's a value simply
to finding defects even if we created no
information but again most most
organizations wouldn't even have a clue
as to how to quantify that now who are
the clients than if we're testers who
are the who are the possible clients for
the information that we have and you
know here's a big list and I'm not
claiming this as a complete list at all
but I want to pick two or three off this
list and we'll talk about those before
we do that though I want to introduce
you to something called the GQ m model
how many of you heard of GQ m raise your
hands would ya ok just a couple it's a
very simple model of metrics and it's
just it it's so profound to me but it's
also obvious I you know just wonder why
I never thought of it but a guy named
Victor bacilli Vic as a professor of
computer science I think university of
maryland and bacilli came up with this
GQ m model some years ago and i find it
very very useful in any kind of
measurement situation G simply stands
for goal q is for question and M is for
metric and what bacilli suggests is that
before we start gathering information
before we start publishing information
and again we're talking about
information that we as testers would
create for our clients whether those are
developers development managers project
managers whatever that we first asked
what is our goal what is it that we're
trying to achieve we might maybe our
goal is a zero defect to software maybe
our goal is a fewer than so many dollars
or so many percent rework costs maybe
our goal is less than certain percentage
of soup ongoing support costs there may
be all kinds of quality goals in an
organization so the first thing we do is
ask what are what is our main goal or
what are the goals that were interested
in reporting about the second part then
is cute what questions would you have to
be able to answer in order to know that
you were meeting those goals
well if my quality goal were zero
defects then what would a question be
that I would be interested in having the
answer to how many defects sure sure
this is not really rocket science ok and
then and only then do we go out and
measure something but we start with G
and then we ask about Q and then finally
we get to em now we go out and measure
things why do we measure things to help
us answer those questions why do we have
those questions because we're trying to
understand if we're achieving that goal
or what would you guess most
organizations do when they put together
a metrics program what would you guess
that most testers do when they start
reporting you know measurements to their
clients where do they typically start in
GQ m what would you guess yeah
absolutely they just scamper around say
well what can we measure we could
measure this we can measure this we can
measure this they measure all kinds of
stuff and then comes a fateful day when
they have to figure out what it means
and often they can't many years ago I
was doing some consulting visited an
organization and they showed me their
metrics stuff I had measured all kinds
of things and they had this giant color
graphics monitor now this was long
before color monitors existed and it was
huge and it must have cost thousands of
dollars but they displayed their numbers
and they were in different colors and
they could rotate and scale and it was
you know I've been in this business a
long time not many things impress me
anymore but this knocked my socks off
this was really cool stuff and then I
said now what have you learned from this
data and there was this long pause and
they said maybe we should rotate the
data for you again and they did and then
I asked another question I said now what
about your process have you actually
changed because of what you learn from
this data at which point they rotated it
again for me faster this time
they had gathered you know gigabytes of
data and they had no clue what it meant
now I will admit that there are certain
times when this is a legitimate approach
if you go back to the history of the
early history of Western medicine people
like Galen and epocrates and so on these
guys thousands of years ago they
measured all kinds of things they
measured pulse rate respiration rate
temperature phlegm level by a level and
all kinds of other things now some of
those we now know are useful and if you
go to the doctor these days no matter
what your complaint is what's the first
thing they do blood pressure respiration
rate heart rate stuff like that right is
just because they're so useful in terms
of metrics we also know that there's a
lot of stuff that the ancient Greeks
used to measure this is bogus doesn't
mean anything at all so I would admit
that early in exploration it might make
sense to measure a lot of stuff simply
because you don't know what to measure
if you remember back in those days it
was it was actually illegal you know
punishable by death to open up a human
body to see what went on inside and so
they're just they're making this stuff
up your they're doing the best they can
but they're they're just kind of making
stuff up many organizations that I visit
with both the development side and the
testing site they don't know how their
mechanisms work inside either they don't
know what their processes are you know
requirements go in and code comes out
nobody's quite sure you know and so
nobody knows what to measure where code
comes in and some kind of testing
process is done and tested code comes
out again because nobody knows what's
going on inside that process inside that
body nobody quite knows what to measure
it's okay in an experimental way but
generally GQ m makes a lot more sense
now sometimes you go to a client you say
you know I'm a tester or I'm the manager
of a test group and say you're the
project manager and I want to report to
I want to let you know
of our progress i want to let you know
of our value what kind of information
would you like to have and what kind of
answer might get i can think of kind of
two basic answers answers might you get
from that question what kind of
information would you find valuable
number one is the answer you're giving
me right now I don't have a clue I don't
know and the other end sorry I hear a
lot is whatever you did last time years
ago I ran a big iron mainframe data
center and in those days we used to get
all our paper from trees in the Mojave
forest and we're just using well to
forest then we're just printing out you
know boxes of paper every minute and I
said I just know this stuff's not being
used so I send out a questionnaire do
you really need all these reports and
guess what answer came back from
everybody yes now I knew that was
baloney but I didn't have a better way
of measuring that so what I did one day
was we just turned off all the reports
doesn't send out any reports and waited
for the phone to ring somebody call up
say hey I didn't get my D report today
oh well we'll look into that and we
turned them back on and we reduced you
know paper consumption by eighty percent
for internal reports by that trick
sometimes people just can't give you a
good answer there's a trick that I often
use as a consultant and that is I have
effect I didn't bring it with me but I
have a magic wand I bought it last time
I was at Disney World it's got a one the
little star and it's got little pink
streamers it's really kind of cute and I
carried around in my bag with me on
consulting assignments and I give them
the magic wand and I say you can wave
this magic wand in any way you want it's
magic
now that you have this magic wand how
would you wave it what would you what
would you like to have okay I sometimes
tell them that testing is a magical
information machine it can give you all
kinds of information about the product
the quality of the product if you had
such an information machine what would
you ask it what kind of information
would you want I've always been amazed
over the years that these two tricks
giving somebody a magic wand or giving
them the magic information machine gets
the money stock people who five minutes
before didn't have a clue what they
wanted you give them this magic wander
somehow now empowered you know to think
oh if I had a magic wand I'd be
interested in these kinds of things so
it's a it's a trick that that I use and
you can use it to okay now in using g qm
we can do that too to understand the
kind of information that would be
valuable to our clients as from a
testing standpoint I think there are
also some attributes of valuable data
irrespective of what we're doing what
kind of things were measuring I just
want to share some of these with you
what would be valuable for almost all
information again you know you guys have
this wonderful search project a product
so I went to my google toolbar and I
typed look out Titanic and I found this
picture okay here's a look out from the
Titanic and i would suggest the first
attribute of any kind of valuable
information is that it must be accurate
that make sense that feel right so when
the lookout says there are no icebergs
in the vicinity captain that's just not
accurate data okay good data useful data
useful information is timely it's
pre-emptive in the sense that we can use
it for example when the lookout said has
the ship is sinking Oh captain there are
icebergs in the vicinity okay now is it
accurate absolutely accurate
but it's a little light right a little
late now good data good information is
also complete okay and so when the
lookout says there are no icebergs on
the portside captain again accurate sure
timely could be okay where was the boat
out of the ship actually hit starboard
side on the right side okay so it's got
to be complete information Lisa to make
sense how about these good information
is also relevant so when they look at it
says Oh captain look at the northern
lights aren't they beautiful tonight
accurate timely okay not particularly
relevant though to the task at hand now
good information is also unique and by
unique I mean it's just it's not
available from other sources it's not
something just everybody would know for
example when the lookout says it's cold
out here tonight captain the captain
already knows that oh it's accurate and
its timely notes all those other things
but you know it's not particularly
unique everybody knows that and the
final attribute of good information that
has to be actionable that is you've got
to be able to do something with it
because we know this information now
we're going to do something we're going
to change our process so we're going to
do more of this or less than that or
something it's got to be actionable so
when the lookout says captain icebergs
on the starboard side coming at us fast
that's actionable it's accurate it's
timely it's complete it's actionable you
can take some action okay so this is the
value of information most clients that I
visit with when testers report
information whether that's to their test
manager or to a project manager or some
executive management they give things
like stuff on the left here how many
test cases hebden where we planned how
many did we actually right how many of
you executed of those
how many of past how many have failed
how many are blocked for some reason we
can't continue with them we often talk
about well we found 83 severity one
defects and 42 severity to defects and
so on one of my favorite metrics is
something called DDP DDP is defect
detection percentage it's simply the
percentage of what percent of the
defects did we find inside in-house
versus what percent escaped out into the
field to our customers and of course you
would like you know probably 90 95 99
percent of defects to be found inside
and only a very few hopefully none but
probably a few will escape to the
customer and there are all kinds of
other tlas you know TLAs three-letter
acronyms okay branch coverage statement
coverage you read about that my book
these are the kind of things we
typically report if I were a test
manager and I had been a tester a week
ago I might be interested in these kind
of things but the higher up you go in an
organization what kind of information do
they really care about what would they
find valuable what would be useful what
would be timely what would be accurate
what we be actionable money money is a
big one isn't it I often tell people in
my classes I asked this question they
said what's the primary language that
managers speak I usually I usually kind
of fool it by saying well you know how
many of you speak more than three
languages or more than two languages and
then I I asked and what's the primary
language that managers speak and it's
money right they're interested in things
like because of these defects what would
be what would happen in terms of loss of
sales or loss of revenue or market share
the the classic example and I'm just
looking here I'm older than everybody
here in the audience and I'm probably
older than some of you put together
but years ago does this little software
company called Ashton taped remember
Ashton tape product called debase debase
was a marble it's it's equivalent to
Microsoft's what yeah access and and
they had eighty percent of the market
share and then d base for came out it
was the first Windows urgent and it was
terrible people fled they didn't just
leave that product they fled that
product they went from eighty percent
market share to twenty percent market
share in six months i sent a just is no
more their bones are bleaching out in
the desert somewhere okay these are
things that that our management cares
about loss of sales loss of revenue loss
of business reputation those kind of
things how about claims for compensation
because your program screwed up it cost
my company a lot of money and i already
have these lawyers on staff and so we're
going to we're going to sue you we want
money back for the the pain that you
caused us okay then the cost of what
they call restorative actions that's you
know that's getting it fixed and getting
the next version out there and all those
kinds of things okay these are the kinds
of this is the kind of information
that's far more interesting then the
kind of things that test the testers
typically create okay now the last
couple of minutes here what i'd like to
do is is we're going to kind of listen
through the wall here can't see it very
well i think they actually both have
glasses you know they're kind of
listening to see and they're going to
listen in on the developer developers
thinking this my goal is to get my coat
out on time without making any real
blunders in it I don't want the customer
finding them then I look foolish and for
the whole team especially my manager now
if you go talk to the developer they
might flower this up or sweeten this up
but you know that's really what's going
on their head and so you might say well
what would the developer be interested
in knowing that we as testers could
supply what kind of information could we
give them that might be valuable and I
just I've just listed a few here a
developer might be interested in well
how many defects have I created okay I
might like to know more about these
defects are they just are they scattered
randomly throughout the the code that I
wrote are they focused in one place are
they just you know sometimes you have a
bad hair day and then sometimes you have
a bad programming day you just you know
you just don't get it quite right are
they that or are there patterns am I
making the same mistake over and over
and over again patterns refer to things
that well each one appears differently
on the surface underneath it's really
the same problem just occurs it comes in
in different disguises okay so these are
the kind of things that a developer
might find useful and so what value
would they attach to this information
well again I'm just listening in on the
developers minder so as well quantifying
the value of this information is
difficult hmm if it if I made fewer
mistakes if it cost X dollars to find
and fix each one of my mistakes and I
made why fewer mistakes based on the
information my testers are giving I've
saved the company X Y dollars but you
know right now I don't know what X is
and I don't know what Y is and so I and
I don't know how to find out so here's a
person or a group that might really
value certain kinds of information that
we could give to them okay and they
wouldn't say things like you're creating
bugs or you're wasting my time or you're
making me feel bad they'd say thank you
for that information okay how about a
test manager well again we're listening
in on the test manager e says my goal is
to ensure that my testers find most of
the defects very few escaped into
production so what questions might this
test manager have well what percentage
are actually being found during system
testing
what percent are being found before
system testing what actually escapes out
into the field as a test manager I might
be interested in what techniques are
effective in finding bugs and what
techniques are not particularly
effective okay if all I know are there's
these three techniques and yet they're
not very good maybe I should go learn
some more techniques another thing I'd
be interested in if I were the test
managers the ones that did escape to the
field how did they sneak past us what
was it about our testing process that
allowed those guys to sneak out the door
another way to say that is where are the
holes in our testing net if you think
about testing is you know we got all
these fish you know the bugs and we're
throwing the big net out trying to catch
as many where are the holes in the net
and what kind of things allow escape and
then the value that the test manager
would have is is this I'd say well the
percentage of defects we find during
testing is very high compared to those
that escaped in a production makes me
look good let me see how this is going
to play out my management won't see any
real value in this information in fact
they'll probably use it against me
they'll quickly forget how many defects
we're finding and focus just on the ones
we missed and they'll say things like
well that was at a very critical defect
how did you miss that one I don't know
again I know this never happens here but
that place you used to work have you had
that experience doesn't matter how many
defects you find it's the ones that you
missed you know that are ones that are
then remembered ok and then statements
like this and these are direct quotes
from some of my other clients it's
apparent your team can only find the
unimportant bugs our knowledge users
find the real ones and so finally the
test manager says you know maybe I'd be
better off just not reporting this
information I'm doing some consulting
with an insurance company right now I
did some interviews the other day we
were talking about bug reporting and do
you have a defect tracking system and do
you report everything and they said oh
yeah we report everything except some of
the really big bugs we don't actually
put into the defect tracking system we
just put them on sticking
on the wall I said why is that they said
well that way management won't find out
about it and won't think we're doing a
bad job this from the development side
and then from the tester side it was and
if we don't report them then if we don't
find them then they don't count against
us okay so you know whenever you're a
recipient of information you might think
about you know how could I miss use this
information if you're the producer of
information you might want to think
about how could this information be
misused not that anybody here would do
that but you know it might happen
someplace okay one more we got the
project manager here says my goals are a
high quality product it gives our
customers good experience while solving
their problems and it doesn't create
major post-release support problems for
me okay so what would what would the
project manager be interested in well
how many defects have I found so far
what would the impact have been on the
organization had those gotten out to the
field see that's the value of testing
isn't it for every defect that we find
and prevent from going out we have like
my friend lloyd says we have saved the
company some money okay but the real
question I'd like to know is how many
more serious defects are in there that
we haven't found yet this has to do with
mine reading and looking into crystal
balls and those kinds of things and then
trying to guess how many and where they
might be and what the impact would be so
the value well if I could add up the
dollar impact of each of these defects
and then subtract the cost of finding
them that would be the value of the
information that testing created and I
can then go to my executive management
sake see this testing thing is valuable
it's worthwhile I put this amount of
money in I save this amount and it's a
much bigger number so this is how the
project manager would see things well
these are just three scenarios that I
picked to illustrate how the what the
value of testing might be again as a
tester if you continue to focus on
reporting the classical things
number of test cases design number
executed number of defects found all
that kind of stuff again you're doing a
good service but you're not providing
the kind of information that most of
your clients would see as valuable and
so that's what I want to suggest it and
if you're not providing valuable
information I think you can just expect
the the bombardment to continue here
people will continue to say well testing
is isn't a value you know it gets in the
way it slows us down those testers
create bugs and all of those strange
statements are actual quotations from
people that I've met with I've had
people tell me I've had development
managers tell me there wouldn't be any
bugs if it weren't for testers you know
i'm just going to shake your head and
look around and go oh yeah okay all
right well this is the end of my
presentation again a couple of shameless
commercial messages here again our
company software quality engineering
runs a couple of conferences every year
called star Eastern Star West which are
focused just on testing will have a
thousand people come we had a thousand
people at star East in May and Orlando
will have a thousand at at the
disneyland hotel in october you're going
to be there ok Harry's there to do a
thing on model-based testing somebody
once said the star conferences of the
semi-annual staff meeting of the world's
greatest testers and you know would
invite you to participate in that you
can I don't know how much time we have
because I turned off my clock any
questions comments please
place
let you put this in place or budgeting
this is this is so your question let me
understand your question is this is a
good scheme if you already have
something you know you have a project or
a product or something but what if what
if it's a brand new product what if
you're trying to budget how would you
use this is that your the testing
process you know that's a really tough
one estimating is one of the more
difficult things that we do I think in
that in the time that we have all I
could give you is this old axiom that
says the future is a lot like the past
only longer and so what i would do is
simply look at past performance and past
history and you know if this new thing
is about this big and we have things
that are about that big in the past you
know just just go back to your
experience the downside of that is that
many organizations don't have any
documented experience you know they
never sit down and keep track of and
write down this stuff so when a new
thing comes along they're trying to say
well you know how expensive or how big
or how many people hours or whatever
they just don't have a database to fall
back on that's about as you know
detailed and answers i could give you in
this time right but it's just you know
look at your past experience like i say
most organizations don't don't even
maintain that kind of data so you know
it's this kind of thing question when
the development manager says i love you
show me
what does each of my developers doing
how many and what what the issues are
I'd like to use that to wrangle okay
good question and you did ready here the
question so in the development manager
says now that you have all this
wonderful defect data and you're sharing
all this with me I'd like you to sort it
into little buckets by programmer and I
want to see how many defects each
programmer creates and of what kind they
are so that i can use them for now let's
make a list so that i could use them for
skill improvement that sound like a good
idea I mean if certain developers making
the same kind of mistakes over and over
and over again it's probably a skill
issue okay how about so that I can rank
order them it's kind of iffy how about
so that I can you know demote fire them
you know I can't give you a
one-size-fits-all answer to me it
depends on who that development manager
would be and what I think they're going
to use that information for let me ask
you this if you give if I give you a
really hard programming problem and in
and in this this module that you're
working on which is really difficult
nobody in the world ever done it before
you may create 10 defects and I give you
a very simple programming task to do and
in your module you create five defects
who is the better programmer who's the
worst program see the numbers don't make
any any sense without a context do they
you might say 10 that's fantastic why I
figured it'd be you know two three times
that many because what you're working on
is so complicated you made 50 that's
terrible ok so the raw numbers
themselves rarely tell us anything they
all have to be taken into context and
personally and it's just my personal you
know style I would try and understand
what use the person was going to make it
out and if
we're going to use that that data
essentially in a righteous manner you
know in a in a useful manner or if they
were going to use it in a punitive
manner that just didn't make any sense
to me so that's against the classic get
depends answering that consultants
always give we go to consultant school
to learn how to say that yes
going to be a verified information
minister
I think wise developers would be
interested in those kind of things this
question is wouldn't a developer be
interested in that kind of information
is that and and want to have a history
and want to then use that personally in
terms of I would think so but I've seen
hundreds who are not interested you know
every day is just kind of day by day and
the idea of learning from what I did
yesterday or for what I did on last week
of the last project years ago I used to
be director software development for big
multinational nonprofit in Salt Lake
City which is near where I live and I
wanted to to gather that kind of
information you know about defect rates
and stuff but I want to do it in a way
that could never be punitive you can
never punish anybody and so I call an
all-hands meeting and I always did this
on Friday afternoon you know given the
bad news on Friday afternoon I said
beginning Monday morning you were to
keep track of how many mistakes you make
can how many coding mistakes if you're a
code or how many testing mistakes or
whatever and each Friday there's a
little slip of paper and you're supposed
to write name and number of defects this
week and turn it into our secretary who
will gather all that up and you turn
that in on friday on Monday it will be
posted on a big whiteboard you know out
in the hall and we're going to rank
order them by person who made the most
defects last week and another column
person who made the most effects
year-to-date now you can imagine the
reception that I got with this first I
told him I had good news and bad news
which do you want first somebody said
the bad news and I I gave him the spiel
finally somebody said all right what's
the good news I said oh the good news is
you cannot use your real name each one
of you must make up a name known only to
you I am NOT measuring you if this is
not punitive this is not any attempt to
evaluate you what I'd like you to do is
see where you are with relationship to
your peers I'd like you to get a feel
for how we are as a group and how
you are individually and they looked at
me like well what's the you know what's
the catch i said there's no catch we ran
this little experiment for six months
and three marvelous things happen first
of all the air rates went down and I
don't think people were lying to me
there was no reason to lie I just think
that as people thought about it more
because they knew they had to fill out
that little form on Friday they were
just more careful and so everybody's
defect rate went down the second cool
thing that happened was that the span
went down that is between the highest
and the lowest you know that people are
making a few mistakes made fewer but the
people were making a lot of mistakes
made fewer and then and I thought those
two things were going to happen I mean
that's why I did this experiment the
third thing though was unanticipated
everyone said well I'd see these little
notes on the on the whiteboard fuzzy
pickle meet me at the water fountain at
three o'clock this afternoon signed the
marshmallow man I encourage people to
come up with really goofy names here and
if you looked you would see that the
person requesting the meeting was high
on the defect list and the person being
requested was lower down people were
basically getting together and saying
what do you know that I don't know what
techniques do you know that I what are
you doing that I'm not doing and people
started to help each other it got so
prevalent that I actually had to put in
my day planner you know stay away from
the water fountain at three o'clock I
didn't want to know who these people
were I went really out of my way to not
know so yeah I would think that a
reasonable developer would want to know
this what about a tester what a
reasonable tester what would they want
to know what kind of defects do I find
well what kind sneak by me what kind do
I just seem to miss all the time our
place are the places where I tend to
over test other places where I tend to
under test I would seem to me that a
good tester would want to know those
things about their own their own work
but again my experience my history is of
a large percentage eighty ninety percent
of people in our business whether there
are project managers or developers or
testers or whatever are simply not
interested in feedback that would help
them and I just I think that's a shame
excellent question um out of time all
right um I appreciate being with you and
hope this has been useful helpful
enjoyable interesting all those things
