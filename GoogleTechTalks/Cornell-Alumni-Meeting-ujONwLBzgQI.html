director Cornell Silicon Valley program
thank you for coming to Google and I
especially want to thank the hospitality
of all their staff all the alumni that
have worked what worked on the event
with us Hannah was here working on name
tags like two hours before the event and
brought a whole cast of alumni with her
to help and greet you all and their
event staff Holly back there somewhere
has been running around all day and
Sunita from google relations literally I
think move mountains to get us here
tonight I don't know if you noticed but
there's a lot of events going on here on
campus and so they have really bent over
backwards to be here so i just wanna
maybe we could give them a little bit of
a round of applause
ok so I'm going to introduce Bob
constable to you and many of you already
know Bob because he and I have been
partners now in the valley for I think
almost since the beginning of my job
maybe eight years and he's going to hear
many many times and is one of our most
beloved faculty speakers and constant
visitors to the valley I'm going to say
something for those of you and even
those of you who know him this remark is
probably going to surprise you bob has
been on the faculty 40 years 40 and
here's another interesting little
factoid Cornell was founded in 1865 but
did not actually teach class until 1868
and the faculty of computer and
information sciences was founded a
hundred years later in nineteen ninety l
excuse me 1965 yeah had their rights are
the four year thing is still still
tripping me at any rate it didn't open
for another three years and bob was
originally on that opening group so he
is the founding dean of the and the the
chair of cs and he has been the Dean now
for six years prob is that right so 99
okay I'm sorry I can't right here okay
and he is one of only two Dean's is
still active in research and one of the
biggest things that has happened
recently for him is that he has a new
five-year grant from the Air Force to
work on security protocols so I think
you're still going to be seeing him
active in the research community so Bob
I want to thank you again for bringing
out such a huge audience and we'll look
forward to hear
Thank You Shannon I'm sure I didn't
bring out the audience a meet did and
we'll introduce him in just a moment but
let me clarify that bit about the
history there I shouldn't have gone into
the history of Cornell to such detail
but I used to tell people okay look the
computer science department was founded
a hundred years after Cornell was but
the university didn't start working
until three years later nineteen
eighteen sixty eight and the computer
science department didn't start working
until they hired the assistant
professors so that and I was one of the
first assistant professors the founder
of the department is here tonight it's
yours heart medicine maybe you're as you
would stand up so so uris founded the
department there back in nineteen
sixty-five and has kept our department
in the top ranks you know where rated in
the top five in the country little tiny
department tucked away in ithaca new
york still competing in the big leagues
and one of the reasons we do that is the
quality of the students we've attracted
and what they do both graduates and
undergrads there better known to you out
here then the faculty and it's my
pleasure tonight to introduce to you and
work with you we're going to actually
have an interview here a meet single and
I and you all know Amit but for those of
you at Google who don't know there are
four Google fellows these this is the
highest ranking engineer at the company
and you get to be a Google fellow for
making contributions that are essential
and seminal to the founding of the
company of those four fellows two of
them are corn aliens one of them is
Sanjay Sanjay give a lot and the other
is a meet single ana meet yeah so that's
not bad
and you're going to hear from amid
tonight he got his PhD in 1997 he came
and we'll find out when I ask him
questions why he came to Cornell and
from where he came to Cornell he came to
work with gerard sultan who passed away
during the time i'm it was a student and
claire kardi who's here tonight was a
took the role of supervisor and we want
to thank Claire for that so Claire maybe
you could stand up for a minute and so
here's Clark rd who is where is the
Charles and Barbara wise director of the
information science program at Cornell
so after getting his PhD Amit spent four
years at bell labs and during that
entire four-year period they seem to
have been trying to recruit him to
google finally eight years ago in two
thousand he joined and became the one in
charge of the google search engine and
when I asked him about that why did you
take on this job he said I'd rather
write code then read it so we'll hear
about that in just a moment and it's
kind of awkward I mean Here I am
introducing him but I'm not going to
step off the stage so admits going to
come up and say something to you maybe
just high and then I'm going to start
asking questions and he'll take as long
as he wants to answer them any way you
want so amid come up and say I thank you
thank you Bob that was very kind of you
it's all lie of course but I don't mind
it well one of the first things I want
people to hear about is how from a
childhood in the 22,000 foot peaks of
the Himalayas you came to be the master
of the google search engine how did that
for him how did you start he's showing
his youth right here you got a 40 of
professors been around for 40 years he
said you could sit down all stem but so
amid tell us about that journey from the
Himalayas to running the search engine
group here you know so first of all
thanks Bob again and funny coincidence
the here you joined Cornell is the year
I joined this world oh I don't like a
steam that's developing here
there has to be an auspicious here
because you came to corner so yeah I was
as bob was saying I was raised in the
Himalayas the corner of the world where
India meets Nepal meets Tibet okay and
I've distinct childhood memories of
getting up in a town of what a few
thousand people at 7,000 feet above sea
level and looking out my window five
peaks in a row 22,000 feet to 20,000
feet and that's my earliest memory I was
just telling Bob earlier today like
people who grow up near the ocean how
water pumps them down same holds for me
with pine smell and mountains and so
that's what I was as a little boy
sliding on those pine needles despite my
parents saying not to do that and you
know had a wonderful childhood Dana in a
loving family and went to college in
India studying computer science which is
in a university which is now niit one of
these premier institutes in India that
you have heard about when I I was there
it wasn't here at niit and from there I
came to university of minnesota-duluth
of all places it has to be about cold
weather and mountains and so in duluth i
came and i studied with one of the
professors professor Donald crouch and
it's a funny story will go into it at
some later point so as to how i got into
I are but Don Crouch introduced me to IR
and I then he says you should go get a
PhD and I said come on man PhD is not
for me you know I'd much rather be
drinking and hanging out
and he said no no you should go get a
PhD I said where should I go he goes
well there's this great professor at
Cornell and you should go get a PhD with
jelly soliton and I said look he's the
father of the field I am studying men
that would be an incredible honor so he
said yeah now you should go and I said
okay whatever you say so I applied only
to Cornell to go to grad school and in
for those of you who went to grad school
you remember you had to write a
statement of purpose selling yourself
right the last sentence of my statement
of purpose said if I'm ever getting a
PhD it's with Jerry salt in at Cornell
or I am not getting one they took the
bait and Here I am so those were my
wonderful Colonel years ninety-two 296 I
finished Cornell and went to Bell Labs
and had great four years there as an
academic and right do you know in those
four years somewhere my good friend
Krishna bharath who works at Google and
is my office mate how 99 time frame he
came to Google and he met me in a
conference we were having beers and he
goes you know what you should come to
Google and Krishna was single then and
our second was second one was on the way
so I tell Krishna Krishna you're single
you got no responsibilities I got two
kids almost I work for a big company
AT&amp;amp;T
Google shmoogle you're all gonna die one
year later I was at Google and finally I
bought Krishna that coffee that I would
him so that's my story and now I came to
Google and I was an IR academic I'd been
doing ir for eight nine years and I are
is the field of information retrieval
which is the academic foundation of
modern search that Jerry Salton invented
as it exists today and I came here and I
said I have been teaching this stuff for
eight years I don't want to read any
code i want to write code like any
software engineer and I said why don't I
write what I have learned all these
years and so I wrote a new search system
which is google search system today of
course with an incredible team that we
are here today but that's how I get to
claim the credit for the good work that
my team has done okay and that's how i'm
here today so when my colleagues heard i
was going to get to ask questions they
said ask him how the search engine works
ask him how many / he's not going to
tell you much but ask him these things
like how many parameters so many knobs
are you twisting and adjusting and how
often do you do it so so you don't you
should feel free to ask me whatever
question you want right yeah and I very
well trained right okay so there's this
saying in my group right new person
joins in we take him out drinking we get
them for drinks okay for drinks minimum
drinking if they start talking about
previous jobs of their out of here okay
so that's how we maintain the secrecy of
what Google how Google search works is
by drinking
and you know they gave me the eight
drink test and I survived so you can ask
me whatever questions you want I will
tell you the drinking story but you know
do your main question of how many knobs
how many parameters there are in Google
search system google search system is
built upon the academic foundation of i
are and what we have done is we we use
hundreds of signals to find which 10
documents out of billions are relevant
for your query and there are literally
hundreds of signals there however the
beauty of ir and the beauty of the
system is that we have mixed those
signals in a principled way that human
beings inside google engineers still
understand how the system functions and
that's the beauty of it because if
people don't understand how your system
is functioning and we don't understand
whenever system goes wrong how it's
going wrong we would never be able to
improve and the beauty is in the
simplicity that we have taken hundreds
of pieces and assemble them in a way
that we can tell is structurally its
sound and just in case the building is a
little shaky which piece is making it
shaky and then we go fix or improve that
piece sometimes we we constantly add new
pieces to the building and make it
higher and higher which in our case is
better in better search so just last
year we launched 400 changes 400-plus
changes to our search system and you the
natural instinct people have when they
hear me say that is oh man this has to
be complex but if you design a system
well you can actually build a very
simple system make those many changes
and still understand it well I remember
when amid talked to a standing-room-only
audience that of Cornell undergrads
about that search engine the questions
went on
on because of the worry about how do you
prevent all these attacks and gaming the
system and that story got may be too
technical for me to pursue that now but
I'll tell you it's an amazing story of
how you stay ahead of thousands of
people probably hundreds of thousands
who are trying to game that search
engine for their own purposes but
another question I want to ask you is
from my own personal experience about
the Google spell checker I mean this
thing is like amazing to me and I'm
wondering is it really amazing is that
spell checker one of the best around or
might be fooled by buy something if this
be spell checker that we run is indeed
by far the best ever invented anywhere
by a large margin and that's about as
modest as I'm gonna get us even so but
indeed the fact is that this pelt system
knows that kofi annan spelled one way is
very different than coffee cup and if
you can say the same thing if you use
the same letters to spell out the first
word depending on the second word being
on an or cup it will correct it to the
right place that's just a simple example
it does many more wonderful things and
this then is the one fundamental
principle behind our spelling system is
simple algorithms lots of data really
powerful okay people sometimes pin don't
don't pay enough attention to how much
simplicity in algorithms can buy you so
what we have built this spell suggestion
system on is observing our users type
queries into google year after year
query after query and that amount of
data coupled with very simple algorithms
produces a spell system which is far
better than anything ever has that has
been produced and we are constantly
improving it so for example last year we
launched this spell system in 26 new
language
and I think the last few languages that
we launched this in was albanian
Afrikaans and so on and so forth so
that's the beauty of data when you build
simple things then you can very easily
take it out to the world without having
to do a lot of work and make it work in
each and every language and so on and so
forth so here's a question that a lot of
my colleagues wanted me to ask which is
about the way we teach programming so
are the university's connected to the
way you all a program should we be
stressing cloud computing more should we
worry about distributed computing as a
fundamental that we teach earlier what
do you think about us versus our
education versus your needs the answer
is obvious just tell your students not
to ever read code but just right cool I
have programs but you know in all
honesty it's been a while since I've
followed one of the university
curriculums I remember from 10-15 years
back the one difference that I found in
a university curriculum on programming
and our needs out here was in the real
world seldom do you walk I walk in and
say here go right thousands of lines of
program every new programmer who walks
into an existing company is looking at a
already existing big system sometimes
too big millions of lines of code okay
and most of our coursework and lab work
associated with coursework 432 433 is
one and so forth it still is in a mode
where students write standalone programs
of relatively small size small size is
not a bad thing it's just that they
never have a big context of a system and
that made it harder for me for the first
time when I started dealing with big
systems so as to all my practice of
programming was walk up to a computer
okay today I feel like writing a program
that will play chess so I wrote it
however there were no you
I was toying around I was playing with
it myself and in the real world there's
always a bigger context you seldom write
these small programs or small scripts to
do things you write it under a big
umbrella of an existing code base and I
wish there was much more of that during
my Cornell years and my earlier college
education that I was I benefited from
the fact that Jerry Salton and his
students had already built a big system
that was out there though not with so
many users but the smart search system
that Jerry Salton and his students wrote
when he was at Harvard in the early 60s
and brought to Cornell and it evolved in
Cornell for 30 years I being the student
of Jerry Salton I had to write code in
that context of a big system it was not
as big as Google's code base but it was
plenty big to at least for me to
understand the architecture problems and
the design concepts behind it and that
helped me a lot and I wish more and more
we did that with our students where we
have some existing thing that people
have to plug things into and understand
the whole context yeah that's very
interesting a question that moves up the
scale toward how research in this field
is going to develop you you yourself
said many times that many most
fundamental ideas in information
retrieval came out of universities you
were one of the you went to one of the
pioneering institutions in that area
nowadays how our university is going to
be able to play that kind of role that's
a question that i often get in every
academic conference i go to whenever i
talk to one of my faculty friends so as
to how can they now influence this big
fast-moving field that has taken on a
life of its own in the commercial world
and and that's a very good question
the simple answer that I have come up
with which is not a very intelligent
answer but the simple answer that I have
come up with is going to grad school or
going to school in general gave all of
us the discipline of critical thinking
where my advisor taught me to question
my thoughts before I questioned anyone
elses that's that that's a hard trick to
learn to criticize yourself before you
do someone else or someone else's work
and that is still being taught plentiful
in grad schools and schools around the
world and those students they come to
the real industry out here you know I've
numerous colleagues from Cornell I were
sitting out here today and other great
institutions who r square out you know
who are at places like Google Yahoo
Microsoft all other good companies and
those people have developed that
discipline and learned some things along
the way that have helped us get here now
that's not a very intelligent answer
that's a generic answer okay the harder
question which I have not yet been able
to answer that I hope some of you would
help me answer one day is what happens
to an academic field when it is
happening in the real world so when chip
design happen in Intel and AMD and other
companies how was the academic working
chip design influential to these
companies chip design take a life of its
own in the fab units of Intel and AMD or
the academic world had heavy influence
on that I I haven't yet discovered the
right answer I can do these case studies
one after the other take router design
or networking you know how much did
Cisco and so on run away with the future
of this technology and academia which
basically gave birth to all this what
happened after that I that's happening
to search today yeah so that's that's
really interesting answer because we're
seeing now the Intel's
and AMD is coming to us about multi-core
architectures and say we're gonna have
to do the whole thing over again and we
need you on the ground floor that's very
good what you said about critical
thinking reminds me of another question
we get a lot so one of the hallmarks of
an educated mind and educated
undergraduate for example is the ability
to think critically do you think there
is a new kind of critical thinking that
we need to teach because of digital
information being able to assess what
they get back from search engines what
they read in Wikipedia and so forth
indeed that's a that's a very good
question let me just hold that question
for a bit and go back to the previous
question of there are so many hard
problems for us to solve today Google
that we wouldn't be able to do it
without academia take a very simple
example we change our algorithm four
hundred times or more a year how do you
know that each and every change has
benefited our users it's a very hard
question because relevance of results is
somewhat subjective okay there's no
black and white it's all shades of grey
more relevant should come ahead of less
relevant and so on and so forth so
search engine evaluation for example is
a field with academia can do some
critical thinking that we won our
quarterly deadline can't do okay and it
doesn't really require that much
infrastructure so there are lots of hard
problems out there that we haven't
solved here and without academia we
won't be able to ever solve and some of
the great work done in the field of
clicks by thorsten in the department and
so on has been seminal and that kind of
stuff is just critical for real things
to happen now going to your question
about critical thinking so the web or
the internet has this beautiful property
that anyone can say and get give you
information that they have gathered in
their own personal experience however it
also brings a very nice umbrella of
enemy
t to that information and you know that
is that is a boon when you are dealing
with societies where that is absolutely
necessary to get information out for
example some countries where information
is not flowing freely it's important to
have that layer of anonymity preserved
so that citizens and human beings can
communicate their experiences to the
rest of the world without the cost of
persecution however the beauty of that
anonymity if used wrongly can get you a
lot of information which is very wrong
so just start as an as a thought process
if you start doing searches for
potentially alternative treatment for
you know chronic diseases or tritus and
so on and so forth there's a lot of good
information out there and there's a lot
of not so good information out there
motivated by commercial interest and it
would really hurt the society if people
said I read it on site X thus it must be
true ok and I'm I'm you know I wish it
had never happened before but the truth
is that i have found reporters who
should remain unnamed who read a certain
page and then write it down in their
story without checking the facts they
get paid to check the fact ok and that
critical thinking has to be developed
during undergraduate program and not
only in computer science but pretty much
in the entire educational system
repeatedly telling our students that you
have to triangulate you have to get to
the bottom of the right information
rather than just trust any site
otherwise it can hurt you and it does
hold people yes that that's a topic that
fascinates me a lot this critical
thinking about digital information
because one of the goals of our faculty
of Computing and information
science is to teach a course in either
information science or computer science
to every cornell undergrad and one of
the justifications for that is you're
going to need it to be able to think
critically in the digital age and you
know if we have time I'd love to go more
deeply into that but there's another
line of questioning that I get when I'm
out here it's really interesting that we
get pumped up by the technology that we
run into that's why Cornell deans and
presidents and and other people are out
here listening to the valley taking the
pulse trying to find out what's
happening and where it's at in fact we
have our college advisory boarding board
meeting right here in Palo Alto or right
over there in Palo Alto animate is one
of the members of our very small very
elite board of eight leaders in the
valley but one of the other things we
hear out here is a fear it's why I would
say over the past four or five years
there's been more concerned some of the
alums will tell me you know there is a
dark side to computer science and I
never recognized that myself for quite a
while because I'm a gung-ho computer
scientist I love our systems I think
we've done a lot of good for the world
and will but you hear out here the
concern that there is a big brother
society being created and we're losing
our privacy and when they worry about it
now they worry as much about the big
companies as they do about big
government and you'll hear on the radio
and in speeches of people who are very
keen like Bill Moyers gives these
wonderful speeches about the Internet
saving democracy but it also says maybe
some of your technology is going to
create the Big Brother society and
people will think about Google in that
context inevitably so I'm wondering I
was wondering if you believe early get
to that yeah
and set off without that was my
softening of this question so this is
this is a very good question a very
important question in front of society
today so as to all the information that
is out there and what people do to get
this information by searching Google
other search engines how much of their
privacy is is compromised in that
process so i can speak from a google
engineer perspective and i can say a few
things first as an individual and then
i'll say a few things as a google
engineer perspective as an individual me
and my family are avid Google users each
and every query that I have typed has
been in Google if I had a knee injury
Google knows that okay and so on and so
forth and I personally feel comfortable
more comfortable than I would have if I
didn't work at Google of what would
happen to that data what would happen to
my queries and so on and so forth
privacy is one of the most important
things that we discuss at Google it's
near and dear to us because each and
every one of us is an avid google user
and if anyone's privacy is compromised
it's mine first right and we have strict
policies policies like even I as one of
the top Google engineers cannot look at
logs unless I sign a whole legal
agreement of why I am going to look at
those logs and despite signing that
legal agreement I am NOT allowed to look
at the logs that I can identify anything
or anyone okay and this is the topmost
Google engineer talking there's a logs
policy that I have to sign my third
child third bond too if I were to look
at logs so so that's the personal side
because I care about my privacy and I
know
how deeply we care about our users
privacy my privacy I am my user and how
we protect it so Google has such a
strict logs policy and you might have
heard stories along the lines of when
the government subpoenaed all the search
engines everyone else but google
complied and we took the government to
court on that okay and be one we did not
diverge our logs so and but it's
important it's important to keep pushing
us for privacy and having strict
policies so that never ever is anyone's
privacy compromised because of google or
any other search engine okay what more
can I tell you about privacy policies so
the thing that one should also keep in
mind is google knows quite a bit about
your queries and so on and so forth but
there are many other entities in the
chain if privacy is compromised in any
of those pieces links in the chain it's
much worse so take your ISP for example
not only does your ISP know which
queries you are typing into Google which
Google knows it also knows which sites
you are going to each and every one of
them it also knows by the way what your
credit card number is and who you are
and where you live we don't know any of
that so the clearly google has a higher
responsibility because we are so
successful so clearly we should be held
to a much higher standard but when
thinking about privacy you need to think
of the entire chain from your keyboard
to the servers and the weaker link is
the worrisome part so I I think would be
good if we could open up the questioning
to to you all know and maybe we should
make sure you might not get the question
you wanted you might have gotten it from
me you might not get it from them so is
there anything you want to just say out
my guy I you should know this whatever
and then we'll get to question it I
could say one thing for sure if it was
not for Cornell I wouldn't be here and
that's all I wanted to say we can take
questions we have white you make changes
to your Maps program are you involved
with a view do you have part of that is
that one of the search things I work
with yes I'm part of the team that runs
our search algorithms also clearly you
know any change that is made I'm partly
involved the latest change that I've
observed it has as a whole tutorial that
comes up as soon as you try to get into
the new maps and I would expect that
that may be because a lot of people have
not been able to intuitively get into it
personally I haven't been able to
intuitively get into it what do you do
about changes that you think you're
reaching the user but then you get
feedback that it's not I i think google
not only in this case but in all cases
things on its feet and that's why we are
so agile as a company so we have made
mistakes before this if this particular
example which I can't relate to right
now but if this was an example of that
we basically listen to our users get the
feedback and we basically fix it as soon
as we can okay and we think on our feet
we make all these changes and we
listened back we listened back to the
bloggers from the blogosphere we
listened back to our avid users
sometimes I listen back from my wife you
know that one I fixed the next day by
the way
so clearly we think on our feet and
click our users are the lowest and we
thank them for the love they've given us
and basically we if we don't listen to
them we should be short Oh competition
is great and Bill Gates has always said
that he's constantly looking over his
shoulder and I wanted to ask you if you
what your opinions are about cool and
some of these other search engines that
you started with answer yourself
competition is great and I deeply
respect all the competition we have if
it were not for our wonderful
competition my good friends work there
my good friends work at Yahoo my good
friends work at Microsoft these are
great places to work these are good
people these are good companies some of
them i truly love drinking with you know
these are these are great great people
and if we are better off today because
we have this competition and the more
the better because it keeps us honest it
keeps us lean the only way you win is
not by hoping someone else will stumble
because those companies done who think
their opponent would stumble the only
way you win as a company's by running
fast you run fast and faster and faster
and you will if we didn't have anyone
behind us we wouldn't be running as fast
it can get tiring
over here going back to the question
about privacy could you address maybe
what might be the other half of that
question I imagine you're very fit very
aware of the issues you talked about
about not wanting anyone at Google to
see your information but what about when
it's just automated what about the
issues of privacy involved if you
automate something to go and do things
because I don't think that would give
you that same gut-wrenching fear so
where do you draw the line on selling
things based on your knowledge and which
knowledge is okay to sell based on which
isn't so that's that's a very good
question what about programs scouring
through these logs and so on and so
forth and I think all of us including
myself when we had earlier debates put
ourselves in the following situation we
type an email to someone my brother
message for my wife my family my
associates and these web-based email
systems take that text take it to auto
spell checker on their servers read it
and spell corrected how do we all feel
about that I think most of the people
are kind of k with that right and under
that paradigm as long as you have kept
policies very very strict that there can
be no individual identified and leaked
then our gmail program for example based
on the same text that we get to do spell
checking also present some contextual
ads on the side which you have seen and
you are probably referring to now you
know I I can understand if one feels
that spell checking is ok but that is
not but you know in some sense they are
kind of similar algorithms running
determining what words there are in
anemia so I think with strict policies
and strict privacy preservation making
some algorithms that run over these
things is okay for example we run some
of the best
nanami system in the world you don't
have to say ramstein kb you don't have
to say here base you can say Ramstein a
B Google understands its air base and
it's done by actually looking through
those logs and saying these two words
might mean the same thing so clearly
right there's strong benefit we have
been able to improve our search engine
spelling is an obvious example using
that type of information however no
human being should be able to identify
another human being and privacy should
be very very strict I owe me tell you so
too I'll try to squeeze in two questions
the first is you sound like a fun guy to
drink with so where do you drink and and
where did you drink at Cornell because
you've done a lot of drinking so let me
answer the latter one post at Cornell
wherever I could afford I was a grad
student so chapter house with these
other places like that and now it's not
that much occasionally you'll have
company I have some good bottle of
single malt I have one in my office to
it by the way for occasional fridays and
you know that's what we do now i ask you
that so i could soften you up for this
okay so you know that web search is a
very different game than Enterprise
Search you're talking about different
algorithms you're talking about
different types of problems some
different problems you have to wrestle
with could you comment a little bit
first on Google's efforts in enterprise
search the extent that you deal with
them number one and and maybe what
Google's plans are the enterprise's for
our search is concern and number two how
you see integrating more more meaning
whether you want to call it a meaning in
a Semantic Web context but how you could
bring more meaning to to pattern
recognition that that's a very good
question enterprise's struggle with
search it's important problem and there
are several great companies out there
who build enterprise search we happen to
think we have a great product and it has
been very successful you'd be surprised
how well our algorithms you know page
rank and so on work even on enterprises
our our our customers some of the big
ones are always vowed by the search
result our enterprise box produces so
clearly there needs to be some tailoring
of algorithms for enterprises however
it's really not that much simplicity
really works it's beautiful okay now i
can't say enterprise searches by any
means a salt problem it's a hard problem
and we are working on it and others are
too and once again competition keeps us
leaning and running fast where we are
going on enterprise search fight a late
drink test and so I of course can't tell
you where we are at it hahaha an
enterprise search but clearly it's a
very important problems a problem and as
enterprises grow and the information
grows which has been great and still
growing exponentially the problem is not
getting easier so do everyone please you
know keep thinking about it keep working
on it and that'll help you can answer
that question
on your firewall looking through your
email your documents etc I don't have
any real background in this feels at all
but what you say about logs is news to
me does google keep track of every of
every search I've made over the last 10
years and their logs note and how long
do you what do you need them for and how
long do you have to eat them that is you
if you get rid of them after three days
then you don't have to turn them over to
anyone yes that's it that you know
that's that's a very good question and
clearly you know a lot about it of
course to be asking you such an
intelligent question so Google's logs
policy which is written down is that we
discard our logs after nine months and
so we do keep logs and aggregate them to
learn things like spelling correction
for example out of those logs the policy
is well written it's documented and no
even when we retain logs no one's
personally identifiable so you know but
if I make a search a day for 90 days are
those all tied in with
depends on how your eyes speed as IPS
okay that's the real answer I can go
into all the technical details of that
but we cannot kill me once again no one
can see those so that's the first thing
no one on this earth can see that and we
have very strict policies on deleting
all logs and aggregating information as
soon as we can the benefit that comes
out of those logs is things like we know
that people who type this also type that
thereby we can offer you spell
correction if we didn't know that over a
large sample of population over an
extended period of time we wouldn't be
able to do that and so those benefits
are for hard out there they're measured
termino spell checking is one of our
most used features and clearly that has
to come with a log down privacy policy
that no one is identified by anyone and
which is what we maintain here but still
you know that it in the log knows the
same person logging in all the time not
necessarily that's the point right you
know it's not necessarily depends on how
I peas are assigned at your ISP ya back
you mentioned that the algorithms are
changed quite rapidly more than once a
day on average it sounds like maybe a
simplistic question but I'm curious what
are you solving for and how do you judge
success that's that's that's a wonderful
question that I alluded to in context of
evaluation when we are making those many
changes how do we know you're not going
around in circles and how do we know
that we are doing positive hillclimb big
you know we going higher and we have
strong evaluation technology inside
recently we have been writing blogs on
google's official blog on how we do all
this and the latest one that came out
yesterday or day before is on exactly
your question on evaluation written by
Scott Huffman who who's a colleague of
mine on how do you know that a certain
change is positive in aggregate and
those evaluation methods that were
developed some of those in I our
community things like recall precision I
won't go into details but basically the
game at the end of the day is to say
this is good not good you only launch
the good ones so yeah you know mumo
assumes that the search is initiated
with the keywords and obviously there's
other things that you can imagine that a
stretch could be initiated within so you
know Microsoft just bought power set
which is more of a you know full
sentence I you type out instead of just
keywords what's google seeing in terms
of trends and is keywords it in terms of
initiating search are there other
upcoming trends that's another great
question clearly keywords is not it
search is not done search is not solved
there's a lot to be done we are getting
started that's what keeps me so engaged
and busy then one can go into technology
of which technology is next technology
power set is a great company Microsoft
bought them I'm sure you know they will
do great things with them then you know
but the question is what is the next
thing that would help our users and we
are discovering it as we go I have
strong beliefs on you know what would
help our users just think about the
searches you did in some of the search
engines 10 12 years back LTVs time for
seek and various other search engines
and think about what you ask Google
today what you ask Google today you
didn't dream of being answered 12 years
back so search technology even though it
may be called keyword-based has come a
long way and it does thinks that people
wouldn't imagine a keyword system does
and I give you examples along the lines
of you know when you type the word a B
if the other word in your queries
ramstein it means air base and we know
it and if the other word in your query
is bed and breakfast then it's Alberta
we know it okay this is not what you
normally associate with a pure
keyword-based system there's a lot of
semantics that goes into it now
sentences and so on at one particular
form of structural analysis and I don't
want to go into the technical details of
it but clearly search engines have come
a long way in understanding what you are
asking and we and we have not come far
along enough and that's what would
happen over the next decade search would
keep improving tremendously it will get
integrated in your lives much more than
it is today with mobile devices now if I
travel for a day or two I live off of
this thing okay or my new other phone
which is showing up soon
and you know clearly it's getting
integrated but it's still not fast
enough it's it's you know these devices
are getting beer takes a while search
will get integrated in your lives you
would think of it as oh how could I live
without that and I don't know what it
would be but it would be there it would
be personalized to you it would be on a
mobile device and it would do magic
because some people already say search
does magic but I'm sorry being the
magician I know where the hole in the
jacket is okay clearly it would just go
far along you would ask queries that you
don't ask today and it would be
personalized to you on a mobile device
there's been a lot of great discussion
about ir and data and algorithms but
there's really been no discussion about
Google's business which is advertising
and I just want to ask you about how
Google and how your team reconciles the
need to provide consumers with access to
information with an advertiser's need to
create meaningful advertising
opportunities that might not have
existed otherwise that the answer is
very simple to that there is a Chinese
wall between us and the ad system that
system can never tell me what to do or
what not to do this ads are clearly
demand on the page in different color so
that our users understand that these are
things that if you click on their
sponsored links we make money of that we
do not mix ads in our search results we
do not take any money for n from anyone
to be either included in our index or
placed anywhere on the results section
the organic results section of the page
there's a clear separation between these
two teams and they the ad system cannot
influence what we do in my lifetime I
have made decision
1search side which have lost his
millions of dollars in a quarter okay I
knew that would happen and it did happen
whatever CEO and Larry and Sergey both
the founders of the company walked into
that meeting and said is it good for our
users and we said yes we believe it is
very good for our users then he says why
are you talking about it and that's the
philosophy we maintained to date and as
long as I'm with the company we will
maintain that philosophy when I was at
Cornell I had a little dispute with the
health center and it wasn't until my
senior year of my undergrad that at the
time at the health center they said well
have you talked to the Ombudsman and I
did until that point I didn't know that
guy existed and I realized that actually
it took one call and they took care of
everything does and I guess I was
thinking that as google has grown I
think we've all come to know and love
google because I don't know what I would
do without it at this point but I've
always kind of thought of it as a warm
fuzzy teddy bear I could trust you know
and but as google has grown there's been
a lot of concern especially in the
blogosphere that there is no
transparency there is there is a great
deal of power invested in one private
entity well publicly traded private
entity but has is there a third party
Ombudsman I I like you I trust you that
you're saying that nobody is looking at
these logs but I have to take your word
for that and I would feel more
comfortable if there was somebody they
don't have to tell me what is there but
have you considered you know engaging a
third party to make sure that that
transparency is there at least at a
level that i can say yeah I trust this
guy so I'm going to trust you yeah that
that's a that's a genuine question
really good question do things I'd like
to say
number one that's a good suggestion I'm
not the person who runs the privacy part
of the company I will take it to the
person and you don't see how that means
if they have done it if they have
considered doing it but on the other
side right you know Google I can say
this again and again cares deeply and I
am a user as well and and Google is
search engines are very easy to switch
with you know that's how we built our
business by people switching away from
some other search engine to us and we
care deeply about our users and I that's
why we have been this successful and the
day we break that trust we will lose
okay and we should the question i guess
i have is is you've been talking about
the words and ideas put together and the
history really of thinking which would
be phenomenology if I'm right and
question i have is academically when
when i was at Cornell there was a Dewey
Decimal System when you went to a
library and you organize things by
thoughts and you would separate cooking
cookbooks like you would get recipes
from from cooking the books like we are
now finding out and rest of the world
but the point is you know is google
looking at those issues in terms of how
you organize thought and two per the
magazine headline is google making a
stupid by just putting two words or
three words together and that's all we
need to know we don't need to know the
whole story anymore or is that really is
there a bigger agenda for a google to
say there are areas of thought that
really mattered that's a loaded question
actually i can i mean i'm not an expert
in this from at google / job is to get
to get our users to what information
they are looking from from the highest
quality source as soon as possible we
don't want to hold them on our site and
as we were talking about earlier i think
this critic
thinking I'll have to I have two kids I
have to teach them myself just don't go
read a website and do your homework okay
because that's your natural instinct as
a parent I have that responsibility to
teach my kids that down to net has of
course made that easier but those
distractions existed before in the other
world as well right even that would be
an equivalent of just you know cookie
picking one tiny thin book and not
reading three different things three
different books on the same subject
before you come to the conclusion of
whatever you want to come to this has
just become easier but you know all
those issues existed before as parents
as society as teachers we need to teach
our students and our kids to have that
critical thinking and not just read a
one-page somewhere and then write a term
paper so I mean Google just googles job
is to serve its users as fast as
possible and allow them getting
different views on our front page you
would you know you have no idea how many
press wars we have been through for
putting differing views on various
sensitive topics on the front page we're
going to take two more questions that's
you alluded briefly to the the cool new
cell phone that's coming your way in a
couple weeks and I wanted to ask if
that's also if it started to create a
whole new challenges for the search side
of the business is it is it just more
the same just as a smaller device with a
smaller screen or you're having to
almost reinvent search completely to
deal with a much larger number of
devices so the answer is neither black
nor white it's great in that it's we
have to rethink search interfaces
tremendously for these devices and once
again you know as soon as these devices
come out I take one and start using it
as a user again to see what my users
would be feeling when they run into this
and you know people who have gotten
email from me in this room on why is
this so broken and why is that so broken
I go yelling and and so on and so forth
so as a user I see what's broken but we
have to rethink in
much interface how are you going to get
the information that our user needs to
them real fat so for example and
location is far more critical on a
mobile phone where you are then it is in
general okay so getting our results
toward local information is far more
critical on a mobile phone where we had
to rethink that there are many such
things this is just one example of it
that we pay very close attention to over
user experience on mobile phones and
clearly the newer generation of mobile
phones are allowing us to do more and
more and that's a big boom for our users
of mobile phone itself and then the
ability to get to richer information on
those thoughts and we think about it
every day we have large groups devoted
to exactly that yeah I think Google is
terrific but I have to admit that there
are times where I'm not finding what I
want to find and that's because I never
seem to think the same way everybody
else does so my first question is who do
I talk to you about that seriously
because they're there are things other
than what everybody else seems to do
just as an example I was doing a search
at my brother's house in Maryland same
exact search I do it might have summer
in and I got way different answers
because it thinks I want information
from there which but I don't know how to
tell it that's not what I want that's
that's that's you can start with me
because you know I'm here you can tell
me how it's not working and then I'll go
figure out why it's not working I mean I
have absolutely but you know what a big
boon to a large percentage of our users
so for example I'm always in a
teeny-weeny little percent trust yes yes
and that's where personalization comes
in and I'll go into that in a bit but to
a large percentage of our users if you
type bank in India you're not looking
for bank of america or if you type bank
in the UK you're not looking for bank of
america or ICICI Bank which is what we
give them in India okay so our job is to
give the most locally relevant results
globally okay that that's the motto be
maintained and clear
Lee there are oddities of our UI user
interface which don't always communicate
that fully and they shouldn't be n you
know there are failure cases like the
one you just mentioned and we are
working on some of those things but
maybe we are just not doing the right
thing so I'd to love I'd love to hear
from you so as to what your experience
has been but then there's this other
important piece of our search system
where we personalize results to you as
an individual and you know if you log in
while you are searching we know about
your location and so on better than the
temporary location that we may be
getting from some system and then we
won't make such stupid mistakes for you
well I want to thank the audience as
well as amid I know what you're
experiencing because our undergrads
would not let him stop and he was a
tireless with them as he's been with us
but amid this was absolutely wonderful
and thank you very much thank
all right now what I'd like to do is for
the last 10 minutes we're going to do
our open mic section which is your
chance to make an announcement to the
audience and hopefully walk away with it
or whatever connection you were dying to
make when you first signed up for this
event so what I'd like you to do is if
you want to participate in open mic if
you could stand up and line up on the
side of the room and we'll make the do
about 10 minutes of announcements as
quickly as you can so what I'd recommend
is if you are startup and you are
looking for funding and you talked to me
about this tomorrow did not announce it
tonight I will kill you better yet it
won't help you or if you're looking for
a job or have jobs or all those
different types of announcements so
let's get that started now for anybody
who wants to make a announcement up over
here front of the room lined up good
okay hi I'm Bob sidemen I have two
companies that are pretty small but
growing one is a consulting company that
does IP litigation support engineering
support for intellectual property
litigation the other is a software
company that creates software for
comparing two programs to find out if
one might be copied from the other so
you can see how to use fit together I'm
hiring right now I may be hiring for the
software company pretty soon but it's
not clear but I'm definitely hiring for
the consulting company but if you're on
the computer science list I'm sure
you've seen this already but we've been
having a really hard time we need to
find someone who's interested in the
legal aspects of what we do who's also
got some years experience and
programming and who's interested in
running the tools that we've developed
improving the tools we've developed a
lot of the algorithms we use I think we
run into the research that Google's
doing when we're doing our research and
doing our patents so if you're
interested in that kind of research
analyzing other people's code getting
involved in the legal system please
contact me hello everyone my name is a
Shrikant Sharma I in my
order in the back we have launched this
the India investment fund called the
spark phone you might actually have seen
that on the Cornell website the reason I
wanted to kind of step up and just
announced that is besides those that
might be interested in investments tight
as a bad word of course but actually
surprisingly this might be a value but
also you know maybe it's not the best
audience but at the same time we are
looking for individuals that might be
interested in the investment space it's
a very promising opportunity that I
think so at least and we love to talk to
you folks if there's an interest so you
can reach me it's I'm albion on fluid
while longer happy to happy to chat
thanks greetings everyone my name is
pete a poll i'm an artist in san
francisco recently I've been thinking a
lot about environmental issues in my
artwork the most recent piece is called
the fantastic solution to global warming
been thinking a lot about that energy
solutions that sort of thing and just if
any of you guys are meeting us you know
if you just bought a house or anything
if you need recreation please see the
website hyper-modern net you can email
me at Pete at hyper modern net thank you
I have an announcement for software and
web entrepreneurs my name is John
Skinner i work in eco technology to
intel i'm also a member of keiretsu
forum which is an angel investment group
and on September 30th at Intel and santa
clara karatsu form and intel capital are
going to be host co-hosting a symposium
for web and software entrepreneurs to
discuss different funding up
alternatives and how to raise capital
for your startup so if any of you are
interested there's information on the
cornell bay area yahoo group Oh or see
me afterwards Thanks hi I'm o for Ronan
and I have a start-up names ondori where
a 10-person company and we're actually
looking for software developers were
working in the cool incubator in
sunnyvale and
it's in the search business so if
anyone's interested please come by and
talk to me ok and this so there's a
billion dollar industry around
monetizing domain names and we have
advertisers bidding directly to get
traffic from domains and so laptops com
HP and Dell are bidding for that it's
just an example but we do that on a
large scale hello my name is Rick Spratt
if anyone is interested in bringing
their product to market and needs
program management I'm looking for an
opportunity in that area have quite a
few years of experience bringing
successful technically challenging
products to market so if you're
interested stop by and see me afterwards
thank you my name is eitan I lon I'm
going to be going drinking afterwards if
anybody wants to join me and hopefully I
me will join us my company's global tech
research we just moved out here from New
York a couple weeks ago and we are
building a platform to speed the pace of
emerging technologies development we've
got three advisors out here a
partnership with a five billion dollar
software company that is a google
competitor although we're not a
competitor of Google and if you are a
CTO or a chief architect candidate
please come see me
my name is Jonathan spear I'm with a
company called blinks b li n KX it's a
cutting-edge video search company we're
looking for really good engineers and
also some good sales people if any of
you are looking for opportunities with a
company that's been listed one of the
fastest growing companies on the web
right now please come see me after this
presentation I'd love to talk to you
thank you hi my name is Trevor gas on
founder and CEO of a company called VAR
CD we actually also just moved out here
from the east coast horse ID is the
network that connects you to your sports
teams if you think about sports teams
they're very information intensive and
then a lot of people are responsible for
creating that information basically
varsity brings those people and that
information together in one place I
really have two announcements we're kind
of jointly looking for both investment
and also talent which is really why we
moved hi my name is Ben nurse I'm Carly
a commercial real estate property
manager in the Monterey area and we're
looking to move up to the bay area or if
you have contacts in Portland that would
be useful as well like I said I do sales
real estate management and have a tech
background but that's not relevant here
I guess but if you know of anything many
leaves that you can give me that'd be
great I'll be in the back commercial or
residential
hi my name is an ting i'm the founder
and CEO of fortress where we provide a
solution to help you protect the private
information you send it to other people
we have just launched a new personal
version called personal fortress that
you could try it's very simple to use is
as simple as you send any document
without protection to other people and
we're running an open beta so you can go
visit at ww personal fortress is p 0 p
RS 0 nal fo RG ress calm and there you
can sign up and for everybody who
complete our open beta will offer you
the initial release of personal fortress
for free so thank you awesome hi i'm
laura stewart and rather than talking
about business i want to talk about a
fun hobby that others might be
interested in that may may not know
exist I didn't know this hobby existed a
few years ago which is board gaming
specifically European board gaming which
is orders of magnitude better than
anything you may have seen in the
American Games you're used to the saris
and monopolies and so forth i can give
you where groups meet three times a week
in three different areas plus certain
saturdays just see me and i'll give you
lots of information about it and I guess
business-wise I am looking for a QA job
hi my name is John Zimmer I just car
pulled out from New York City to Palo
Alto because I'm one of the cofounders
of the carpool application on facebook
and we're looking for another developer
we just got one of the grants from
facebook so we're expanding the team
thanks and just two quick announcements
I just want to again thank the event
staff I want to make sure mention that
the fact that so hot in the room is not
their fault it's my fault for packing
the room for about twice its capacity
but they were nice enough to indulge and
then I also want to mention somebody
mentioned energy this year it's such a
hot topic
pun intended that we're going to combine
three events which are major Cornell
events into one event on March twelfth
the College of Engineering's annual
alumni event is moving out here to
Silicon Valley the Cornell Silicon
Valley annual entrepreneurship event and
the Cornell Silicon Valley presidential
event which are normally three different
events one of them happening in Ithaca
will all be one day at the computer
history museum March 12 all day long on
the topic of energy and sustainable
energy and it's just going to be
