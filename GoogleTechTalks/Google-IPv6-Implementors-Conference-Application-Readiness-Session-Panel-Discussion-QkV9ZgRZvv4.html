experiences of the Google ipv6 internal
software porting effort which I've been
part of for the last two years or so
more or less not enough so to give it a
bit over you google has a pretty large
code base it's not a humongous by any
standards but it's pretty large tens of
millions lines of code to c++ i'm going
to talk most about c++ because that's
where the interesting parts fly for us
for others this will obviously be
different when I say when I say Google's
code base we actually most have one
single tree and and this has advantages
and disadvantages it's great because you
can fix things once instead of a hundred
times it's not so great when you break
something central let me have a couple
thousand engineers that are mad at you
at that point it's good being in Zurich
this is not count a few a few external
things like Android is the part of this
chrome is that part of it but you can
get sort of the idea this is a bottom-up
effort it's not like management comes up
from from from below sorry that
management that comes down from above
and says do I pick six this is something
people started doing by themselves
because they thought it was a good idea
so at that point you want to prioritize
you want to take the most important part
first and the most important part is
definitely one that shows hey we can do
this so let's look at the the obvious
differences i mean i'm sure most people
know this but for others it's not as
obvious ipv4 and ipv6 are really much
the same thing I don't know who first
said no magic just 96 / bits I think I
picked it up from front of presentation
here couple years ago but it's
definitely true there are all these
sorts of of minor differences like flow
labels if anyone can tell me what a flow
label is good for please tell me but but
mostly you don't really have to care
about them the single biggest difference
at least when you're writing something
server side is that the adders this
happen to be larger and if you can fix
that you're like ninety-five percent
down the way there are a few exceptions
from that which will be talking about
near the end but in general if you can
make your application understand that an
address
is more than 32 bits you're good so
let's look at the different ways of
representing addresses in your space
these are a few things you should avoid
I've seen I mean one thing is obvious
like sockaddr in which is night before
address in adder which is like for a
dress with a port in is unfortunately
very common inside Google Apps you've
seen lots of hideous variations on these
like type thats to these like structs
containing them like people using 64-bit
in i don't think i've seen anyone
represent an IP address in a floating
point number yet but i wouldn't be
surprised if java ok thank you and we're
still you cannot grep from it so it's
really hard to know sort of when you
have 10 2 million classic code where is
sort of the devil but let's look at a
few strategies anyway the one first one
is the obvious one if you're writing
things from scratch you can pretend that
ipv4 and ipv6 is the same thing this is
basically what your operating system
probably already does if you open an
ipv6 socket and set it as dual stack and
people connect to it over IP for you
will get this special kind of IP for
mapped into the basic space which is
good because we have lots and lots and
lots of v6 place so we can put all the G
Force Base within it somewhere this
gives you these weird-looking ffff
addresses which you might when you're
displaying them show as something else
but in general you can just pretend that
well it's all ipv6 is fine and dandy and
we can go in there the problem is of
course if you don't have ipv6 on the
machine if you're writing client suffer
this doesn't work and the other really
much bigger problem is if you have an
interface with code that is not ready
this this doesn't work right if I have a
sock adder in six I cannot pass this off
to a function that has just takes in
socket area yes question ok the question
is if you store it as an as an ipv6
address you don't have a little big
endian problem i can tell you you
actually have little big and in problems
anyway but they're much more
obvious so so yes you're right so so the
big problem here it's a viable strategy
but it requires you to take everything
at once and as we already see I mean I
cannot go and fix fix a big programming
one night it's just impossible so the
other part which is probably what most
people is going to be doing is building
some sort of adders abstraction now
obviously this depends again on what
language am i using I'm talking about
C++ here for people using for instant
Python or PHP this is gonna be probably
a different game but an address
abstraction is simply some sort of
object that represents an IP address it
may be an ipv4 address it may be an ipv6
address but mostly you can sort of deal
them the same thing they have the same
client operations for instance I can get
the port both have a pork I can perhaps
match against them I can see that's this
list this is a dress match this list of
addresses so depending on language there
are different do different things and
fortunately see has the problem that we
don't have a good address reproduction
we do have sockaddr in storage which is
huge takes up like 256 bytes of memory
there is but there is nothing that
actually has a sniper previous text or
ipv4 address without a port people will
often use strings this is actually not
as bad as it might sound Java typically
does this it's not too uncommon in say
PHP if at least if you're in a
dynamically typed language this is this
is just fine we made our own classes IP
address which is an ipv4 and ipv6
address socket address which is the same
thing in a port and IP range which we
would have called IP subnet if that name
weren't taken actually the name IP
address were taken to remove like 4003
sabado to all the IP address and made
our new clothes these tights are not
magic they are not hard to make they are
pretty much obvious you can look at
squid for instance has something that
looked like if I didn't know better I
think they just like stole our code but
but you must must sort of decide to what
level do you want things to be
abstracted for instance we get to kick
back at some point
because we didn't support UNIX main
sockets you might if you if you are
adventurous you might want to pull the
NSA into this I wouldn't recommend sort
of mixing a hostname and an IP address
java try to do that it's it has problems
sorry decide what don't want abstract
away what do I want to do and what do I
not want to do and build something
simple this will usually serve you
pretty well so when we've been doing
this for a while like a couple of months
we saw that most code actually does not
need to care about what an address if
you get an address object from somewhere
you pass around you might store it
somewhere you might ask some function to
do it in a string but you don't actually
need to care what it is the structure of
an IP address is unless of course you're
riding a router which I'm not doing
thankfully you don't need to care about
what it is you can just like send them
up and that leads us to the strategy
music address coercion which basically
in our case for remaining way to do in
this we take the first 64 bits of an
address hash it and squeeze it into
unused I before space that's what would
you say yeah well deep okay so the
question is that's used and yes that is
multicast space but you can also take
like then we class II space right and
and if you if you really want to care
you can use localhost space for instance
so yes it's an ugly and hideous hack but
it actually works really well so so this
has been used all over the place and I'm
like okay thanks the good thing is it
allows you to take all your IP for code
and send them ipv4 addresses you can of
course there are some things you cannot
do you cannot G locate them you cannot
use them in acls there is some risk of
collision but of course there is risk of
collision in that anyway and we recurse
all the time I mean the very very first
Google over ipv6 implementation was
reverse proxy setting the address 22 to
55 666 and of course we're moving on
today most of our software now
understands understands physics
addresses but you can still actually I
mean you didn't need to be a bit careful
like at some point these leaked to the
use
so gmail would say you're lost login
address was 239 55 whatever so that's
obvious not yet but you can do it
everywhere and we even do it
automatically in production if at some
point you try to convert an ipv6 address
to an ipv4 relishes that are crashing
within the search failure we actually
discovered it and login warning and
Colin gets paged I don't think this
actually happened yet in production but
it's good to be sure so the obvious
battle plan this mostly others there's a
few problems left right there's
multi-homing which is not an ipv6
problem but now almost everyone will
have an ipv4 and ipv6 address anyway if
you'll need to deal with this is not the
simple case right the other case is that
the address space is a lot larger this
means that your typical spammer will
have that so outer space you're
typically thus attacker will have lots
of outer space it means you can no
longer store one bit per stash 24 so
you'll need some sort of structure that
doesn't deal with doesn't try to slice
up the ipv4 space into fixed sizes
anymore so you will need to do some
worker I'm saying generally this ipv6
porting is easy but it's not trivial and
especially multi-homing and security are
going to be your your difficult parts so
the obvious way of doing it chest it
start sending ipv6 traffic to your
service watch it break and when that
gets fixed you try it and try it again
until you're happy if you are using a
statically typed language like we're
doing you can simply go out and grab for
the types grep for inadar a wall decal
crap for int para compra can perhaps
crap for all IP address or whatever
we've been doing experiments with with
static analysis which actually looks
like if your function is dealing with
might be for specific type and not
dealing with might be the six pacific
type perhaps this should be a warning if
your function is calling another ipv4
unsafe function perhaps that is also bad
but in general low-tech works so so
simply just starting one end starting
the obvious end so you user can get your
quad a's and a man you need to take in
anything also go back and fix the
backends afterwards
questions you listed 33 struts that we
were kind of messing up stuff and I say
that wasn't the previous speaker talking
about gaborone windows that's the reason
yeah I don't actually know how this
works in the windows world right they
have these tapi and then some sort of
parallel API so I don't know how this
looks but in general I mean convert in a
dirty night or six and they will be most
different so so as a fellow programmer
what I struggle with with ipv6 is CLI
formatting because you don't have fit 17
a 17 with field is usually good for ipv4
address so I mean you guys have all this
cool gooey stuff that can compress
addresses but how do you deal with that
when you need to put do print apps and
that sort of stuff well thank you look
pretty thankfully we don't like most
users don't use use with any more I
would I mean I cannot help you compress
an attempt to it by bits down to like 15
characters unless of course you do the
hashing and cursing but I don't think
your admin will be happy about that
right yeah well we tend to do in when we
need to have summarized tables is that
we put high order two bytes dot Lord or
two bites and try to fit it in 17 so we
could have v4 and v6 manipulated me and
you know the height of bits aren't
always that useful unless you're looking
at prefixes and the lower ones are kind
of mac address okayish yeah and this
depends a lot of who you are right we
care I mean we don't even care about
lower 64 bits and the admin will
probably only care about lower 64 bit so
we had to sort of know your autumn's but
please allow me to make it wider gets my
screen is wide screen and I'd rather
have that than another weights of
showing it I have a more basic question
I didn't understand the trick of the
hashing so could you go back to the
fried and can I see that this port yeah
this has to be anything by the way you
might want to actually do encryption or
whatever in case you're worried that
attacker might be controlling your bits
so what what the purpose of discussing
what what what are you doing with this
what I'm doing with the address I'm
taking the ipv6 address I'm picking out
the first 64 bits which because the
lower 64 bits are for me they are noise
anyway and I'm hashing them down and
putting them in tonight before address
so whenever I now need to give this ipv6
address choose some piece of code or
some log or whatever that doesn't
understand v6 i will give that this
identifier instead now this address
doesn't mean and its name 11 major
applications of this is logging that
only understands I people for example is
that correct uh can you please repeat 00
show you cannot use this route on you
definitely cannot use this throughout on
at all this is just some sort of
identifiers that I'm giving to my
application software your what if this
is hotting it it it with many to one
mapping sure it's definitely manageable
my thing and you will get collisions of
course you could in theory make record
all the course Monsieur making and make
a reverse table like started tutoring
400 1 2 3 4 5 okay that might be viable
I've actually seen software which does
this regarding let me give you an
example for example if you're running a
telecommunications company and every
time you make a phone call or a data
connection and it logs that connection
as what's known as a call detail record
you will get a 39 character ipv6 string
if your billing system is very expensive
and difficult to upgrade this is a good
solution you you have a program that
doesn't understand ipv6 you want to use
it anyway you have millions of lines of
code that doesn't understand ip6 you
want to use them anyway you have a tiny
percentage of your users that's coming
in over v6 give it a v4 address that's
what it wants and then you can fix it on
its own time that that's the purpose of
this it's a if it's definitely a
temporary measure right you don't want
to have these lying around in 10 years
so you plan doing it on the
email log which you have your session
songs because it says undefined if you
would you like that or would you like
their gmail oh I like it kinda finds its
like more secret than yeah right well
also the reason now says undefined that
previously wouldn't say 224 whatever
blah blah 238 yeah yeah not sure if
everyone was present when I announced
this preliminary analysis results
yesterday but in terms of submit
branching the ipv6 addresses have two
regions between bites bits 12 and 48 and
beat 64 and 80 which makes 52 bits
together yeah so this is where
essentially information is in the ipv6
address ok it's good to know so you
might want to be more selective this is
sort of the quick and dirty solution
alright last comment has anyone
considered static code analysis if you
have millions of lines of yes good this
something like Coverity could find out
that this is ever this game out of a
socket or would bind the connect or is
going to be used in there you should be
able to find it them like it like I said
we did this with the Hydra which is a
GCC plugin you can probably also do it
with client and yes it gives you good
results but grap is for our purpose is
actually good enough I mean you can be
really high text if you use int of
course or you 32,000 I have a minimum
sure and and and then you go and sort of
beat the developer so so it doesn't do
that again and then you add a unit test
and you probably just like copy or IP
four unit test it doesn't do it again
that sounds good to me thank you
public service announcement if you're on
the v4 only Wi-Fi please get off it
embarrassingly we have run out of
private before space I swear I'm not
making this up it happened today dhcp is
now sailing across campus for the guest
network so please get off it leave those
there v6 network is separated has a
separate pool this is not by design but
it'll keep us safe for now it drives
ipv4 deployment so hi my name is
freaking I'm working Erickson back in
Sweden and I'm going to talk about
what's up with applications in ipv6 in
seller networks of some do's and don'ts
considerations so but first some some
some corporate PR quickly so if call
spreading mobile packet core they would
probably claim it to be the best packet
core in the world so we do and of course
we can collect rain probably the best
mobile attacker coin world so that's
that's apart okay let's move on is there
a mic or to have to stand here
okay good okay I can mean it so we've
seen some some some cellular network
explanations how it's actually done I
think we need to go down to the
seven-year-old way because to understand
this stuff really good so this is really
what we are doing we're kind of packing
stuff on top of other stuff IP on an IP
and we are doing encapsulation so just
to make it a bit more here I brought my
since I don't have a baby here I went
two one mark so so this is the the the
micellar look here oh it's a visit
pocket hotel so it's like if the gateway
here is here this is where you enter the
mobile network so this is I internet and
that's the mobile pocket corner and over
there there's the the cellular the radio
there and they'll be the determining the
packet comes in here and then the
Decatur encapsulate sit like this and
then okay we're a monk I'm going to go
and then there are several notes here
that you could ask for where was this at
last time so okay it's over at that cell
station so it's getting transported
through the network here so this is
actually encapsulation and this is very
important to understand that we already
do tunneling in mobile networks so and
then there's a radio here so then it you
just go over the air 00 packet drop
resend please resend please ok so
another new packet go through this same
station here hopefully I'll catch it
this time so now it's going on the radio
so now it's leaving the encapsulation
going on by a dull and then the terminal
takes it and that's it this is what we
do so did you understand the song or do
you want the PPP specs again
don't think so so some considerations
when when working in this environment so
let's look at the buzzword IP agnostic I
would like you to understand that IP
agnostic is is not being IP version
arrogant neither IP version ignorant so
this is a bit of a problem continuing
explain why so then those keep lights I
used to be using my my push email on my
phone for for Ericsson we had a very
expensive piece of software that only
could load on sony ericsson but he
killed my battery all the time because
of the keeper lives so what about ipv6
so i'm going to hurt Nats are gone or or
are they i got confused by all the
discussions here but still there are
some maybe some firewalls which stateful
and stuff like that so he might need it
but let's let's consider that they are
gone so we're not in natural for land
anymore so why why don't we want cheap
likes so if a cellular network an
application there sounds keep lives and
that could be plenty of applications or
that are actually online then then they
what happens simple ok there's the
packet going over there but what happens
in the network this happens and this is
on a good day this is when the mobile is
not moved it's at the same station as we
see saw here and you see the packet in
specially as in the blue part here
that's where we send packet but you have
a lot of conversation over radio before
that and then after while you do this so
a lot of signaling just for one stupid
keep-alive that doesn't mean tough to
see sent for a plea 6 so if a packet
core notes could talk they would
probably say are you happy now you're on
an end-to-end connection dumbass stop it
well unfortunately you cannot to kind of
communicate on that level but so if you
want to speed
speak wisely and we're talking about
ipv6 being gold and the silence is
golden so let's try to be quiet if we
don't have anything useful to say so
next consideration to be able to have
connectivity in mobile certain networks
you have to be able to provision for it
so try to do a little demo here this is
proved our point ok this is Android to
that one running ipv6 of a cellular so
if I go into the to the settings here
there is and i go to wireless networks
and mobile networks and access point
names I had to put the six in front of
the APM because there's no way of
actually saying that I want ipv6 or ipv4
and they spinning the standard since 97
so there's nothing new ok let's go out
of that just to prove that it's actually
working let's and that it's actually a
phone did what I'm using here this is
google and it choose to mobile hiya so
it's actually an android phone here and
we can do we can do the ipv6 test
wherever the screen is there is to watch
the how it goes with the oh it was cool
again i missed it but there's the banner
of the day so i think we're kind of done
with that last just to prove which
network and making camera happy a fire
away the tricorder and look no Wi-Fi
only cellular and it's on t-mobile so
its way
okay I can do that since the demos over
so won't be cool to have a phone like
this 22 well I put it on the coffee
table but there were no ladies coming
forward to me because I had this phone
or so it's not a babe magnet I'm sorry
but like the card says make it so let's
make all the other google phones use
ipv6 or hunger so provisioning two
minutes left okay provisioning I will do
this of course you will be able to you
can't have these kind of boxes that is
not my ballistics even if you hash it so
we can't do those and we have pockets in
packets so if you like to something like
duo satellite you have more practicing
packets so you don't want packed back
more packets in the package that's
already back to the inn package right
okay so and last it's it's a bit crowded
in the ipv6 cool right now but it will
go away because of the efforts that we
have been doing here and who will soon
be a bit more room there and if you want
to see some more videos of me doing IPC
service LOL there's the the others okay
thank you
crystal clear thanks i did a good job
then sorry i have a comment my company
is a user Belle Acheson products so I
had I have a lot of claim but anyway
yeah they said push application it has
very huge impact to the concurrent usage
of IP address before push application
number concurrent number of concurrent
IP address uses is very few compared
with the actual number but now now it is
becoming a sorry but after push
application this number grows very
rapidly so it has very big impact so I
totally ugly with you that mobile
application mobile industries should
also should move forward to active the
six that it is my comment yeah i agree
and not just for that reason but for two
reasons that actually forget more
devices and you could get better battery
life on so that's it mr. ipv6 can thank
you probably i can deduct this from
taxes since i've used it in work we're
going to get set up for a panel on the
Randy's Rainey's panel of presenters and
you get some slides up can you up set up
the chairs please thanks
three on the same side on this side on
the fine do whatever you do cheers watch
the my choir so all the things are
labeled the piano panel down here tell
people with all the things yeah well pnl
present a presentation you can find that
panel panel slides at the bottom we have
only one mobile Mike that's working I
think at the moment unfortunately so you
have the station it's okay we're only
got one guys doing mobility do you want
to introduce your your panel I was
thinking of that yeah that's good idea
hi I'm Randy Bush i J um we kind of put
together a panel at the end to talk
about um speed bumps you know if we have
a number different people who number of
different areas um Thomas talk about the
ITF and Lorenzo to talk about tow
content providers and Ron to talk about
large things at the other end of the
pipe and mozz to talk about backbone I'm
not going to talk about anything much
mom John I think GRE will be a good
example of the pollyanna everything's
wonderful and if everything were one was
wonderful why the hell are we having
this meeting um so no account for taste
um there's um so there are real problems
we are engineers denying problems
doesn't get them fixed so um we need to
figure out what we can do to make it
easy for the world to deploy ipv6 should
they become motivated to do some and
who'd like to go first
Thomas thanks for volunteering you were
holding the mic I saw that this is go
for it right thanks Randy my name is
yeah that's believable and I plan to do
a full screen somewhere this is I know
yikes my BM to work okay I'm gonna go
through this fairly briefly because uh
some of this is kind of boring i guess a
little bit boring but the general theme
here is what it worked we still need to
do here on the IETF side to get b6 ready
for deployment and make it more
deployable and the summer that I have is
that you're at a high level I think
overall the main work has been done we
people keep running around say what do
you do more what about this what about
this gap but when you sort of looking at
it in more detail it looks like the main
the major items that are out there on
the table are being worked on now or are
you know either close to being done or
done I'll go over some of those in
detail you know but that said is always
going to be work on v6 just like there's
work on be4 there's always more stuff to
be done in terms of revising documents
or as we actually deploy the stuff and
run into real problems or real
situations we can presumably fix them
and deal with them that said there are
some loose ends that should definitely
be dealt with one way or the other and
I'm right before this panel I had a
conversation was Randy where he asked me
well what about the stabs of this what
about the status of that I'm like well I
thought we had dealt with that or I
thought that was an issue that we
weren't going to move forward and
they're still I guess in some sense lack
of clarity about whether something needs
to move forward is a problem or whether
we really have decided not to do
something and I think that would be good
to do so the main work areas are you
know six rd there's there's work been
done there's some documents out or in
the queue soft wires it's a fair amount
of work behave or all the nat64 kind of
work is being done there's some work in
dhcp six-man v6 office and so forth and
i'll go through these pretty quickly
because i think we've covered a lot of
this the six rd work there's a document
that was published earlier that was
the informational there's a standards
track document in the queue that
allocates also some DCP code points
that's done in behave there's a
obviously a lot of work going on with
the the nat64 the u.s. 64 work they just
the thing to note is that I think five
documents went into ITF last call like
two weeks ago so now is a great time to
go look at those more carefully do
careful reviews and get this work done
and out the door softwire likewise they
have a number of work items they've been
working on dual stack light is obviously
progressing and it's something that
there's a lot of interest in if you go
to six man they are doing a number of
items I think most those are relatively
minor and not that interesting yes they
need to be done is sort of you know you
know God in the eye is you know and
crossing the t's sort of thing probably
the most interesting one is the RA the
router advertisement option for DNS
there's an experimental artists see that
did this already is being put on the
standards track to give it more wider
visibility and more of a green likely to
implement and as a part of doing that
they've also now added the DNS search
path to that document so you can through
an RA get all the information you need
to you know contact the DNS server and
do work a more major item that's still
out there is a dress selection RFC 3484
and there's been a fair amount of
discussion today and yesterday about
problems with you know actually using
these sakes and having a long time out a
lot of that is tied intimately with a
dress selection if you pick the right
address everything works beautifully the
trouble is is very hard to pick the
right address in all situations and so
there's clearly a revision needed for
the for 3484 just to clean up some loose
ends that we know about in the sense
that this is a relatively old RFC we
deprecated site local addresses as you
lays in the meantime and there's some
tweaking we should be do just to bring
it up to speed with the current
documents that are out there and in a
way that is not breaking the current
implementations that are already out
there a longer term work item is well do
we actually make me to make some fairly
substantial changes to add a selection
because what we're doing is simply not
workable and sort of one example I'll
give there is what Apple is done is they
aren't really doing 3484 they've done
it's completely differently and they
send out parallel queries
okay you know is that something that's
really needed to be done and if so are
you how we're going to go about getting
that done and I'll just also observe
this know you might take on the 30 40
for work is when we did it you know we
understood that a door selection is a
hard problem and fundamentally the
problem is is that you need a lot of
information in one place so you can sort
of make an optimal decision and that
information is not in one place it's
scattered around the system we have no
way of getting into one place and then
furthermore if you look at where the
decisions are made they're not made in a
centralized place you know by the
application they're sprouting different
pieces of the api's and it's hard to
bring them all together because they're
in different components of the system so
I'm relatively skeptical we're going to
find sort of a magic bullet that's going
to fix these problems we're seeing here
with a dress selection but that's it we
have to make it better than what it is
already dhcp one of these that's been
missing for a long time is there is no
way to bootstrap or do network boot over
dhcpv6 cuz the options were never
defined we have pixie and v4 it's
heavily used but that work is now mostly
done it's gone through the isg and
there's a another revision needed to
take care of the discusses and comments
there's been some discussions about the
multiple interfaces working group this
again is sort of tied to multi-homing
what happens if you have multiple
addresses and there's different places
you can go out in different routers you
can use and you use the wrong one and
might be black hole door suboptimal so
forth um there's a working group that's
charter to document the issues and also
to sort of evaluate what are the current
practices that are done and how helpful
they are but you aren't charter to
develop any new solutions yet again
that's an important area to look at if
you're concerned about this this my own
view is that this again is a very hard
problem and it's not clear that there's
good well it's clear to me there's not
going to be an easy straightforward
solution that works the way we'd like to
an ideal world the question is is what
can we possibly do if anything here to
make the situation better than it
already is and finally some loose ends
and these are sort of individual things
and there's a one of the questions that
keeps popping up again is our / 127 is
legal for point-to-point links and you
know there's some people that say yes
the specs say they are those people say
well no or it's not clear and so
obviously
we either need to clarify this or agree
that it isn't an issue that needs to be
to be fixed up dhcp default router
option that's a document that Ralph
drums and I put out for you know over a
year ago and at a time we we we brought
it up there was some support for but
it's also a lot of opposition for it and
we sort of dropped it for lack of
interest and lack of consensus and again
you know this week I'm hearing we need
to do that there are still this need to
have the same features and v6 that you
happen to be four so that somebody who's
already got an infrastructure built
using this kind of an option they can
just do so without having to re
architect something even if it isn't all
that hard to do why do we want to pose
barriers where they're not really needed
another question that comes up is unique
local addresses there's a centralized
version and there is a probabilistic Lee
a unique version the probabilistically
unique one is out there you know people
can use those and there's continues to
be questions and requests for a
centralized place to get one so that I
can get one I can be guaranteed its mind
forever and nobody's gonna be able to
take it away from me and that sort of
thing well we've been around and around
on that one the ITF is disgusted and
essentially table it for lack of
consensus but in the last few months it
came up again on the air inside you know
the ppl where they wanted to have this
push through again so you know do we
need to do this or not can we just sort
of you know close this in some sense for
good so open so that we don't keep
having the same conversations over and
over again and that's it thanks I just
want to note that I think it's about two
years ago that I went ballistic and said
you know NAT PT got deprecated and it's
taking the IETF two years to turn around
and redo it correctly and I think that's
pretty good I think it actually is it's
much better than we normally think of
the ITF it hasn't taken five years it's
not bad we do better work when it's
under the gun we're under the gun yeah
um so all in all what the heck yari
little sunshine
alright so trying to approach this issue
from wireless or cellular as perspective
what do we have to do to make ipv6
happen cellular networks you know after
all this discussions that we've had you
know we've had plenty of workshops on
the last year about this and you know
even more in the last ten years we have
lots of technology but still not much if
any commercial deployment why is that
what can we do about it and I have
serious of answers and the first one
that it's really there it tests for you
to turn it on that's the only thing you
need to do and some justification for
this answer um the standards have in
place since 98 basically the cellular
networks generally have supported this
since 2005 you can buy phones with ipv6
support we in the erection have been
doing this since 2003 you can do it too
there are issues many issues but they
are practical they are not fundamental
or stand thats related just get on
solving them and please stop developing
theories about you know alternative
designs or optimizations that you think
you need or other things just delay
deployment it did you know you just need
to go and do it and that's it well
moving away from the sunshine I guess
the other answers so there are obviously
some enhancements that would still be
useful so we keep inventing new ways to
use ipv6 or new ways to basically use
our networks or the internet we add home
routers and it's not just mobile phones
anymore it's it's routers we're
replacing our dsl connections with 50
megabit wirless connections and suddenly
you need something you need Nats in v4
and you need prefix delegation in vb6
ipv6
only networking you'll need nat64 or you
gain some additional operational
experience and you realize oh we didn't
actually do all the standards yet that
we should have done I i think is the
case with dns discovery on and there is
ongoing efforts around this in IIT f3
TPP and so forth we just had a few
months ago and me a joint meeting with
the 3gpp ITF that basically concluded
that the components are there or the
technology is there you can test switch
it on some networks are already running
it but there are a few things that we
could add and one of them was this
translation technology from from behave
and in the third answer that I wanted to
give to this question what can we do or
what why is this like this there's the
some multiple goals that one could have
so we 10 or NT users tend to think of
this ipv6 problem assets enable v6 for
me but there's actually multiple
possible things that we can do with v6
in in mobile networks so the mobility or
the mobile networks are nice in the
sense that they they separate the user
traffic from underlying core network by
this mobility tunnels and then it's also
this APN concept that separates
different types of traffic like a
operators own services and the general
purpose internet access and all of these
things mean that the ipv6 can can
actually be independently deployed on
the underlying network that you know
between the nodes that do all the
signaling that that you need to move or
allow the Mobile's to move around on the
use is traffic to internet you know that
is of course depending on what is the
servers on the internet doing are they
on v6 review for what and then operate
this own services voice ims and so forth
and and then finally on the fourth
answer what we really need to do I mean
I want to end in sort of positive note
that most if not all big operators have
very serious efforts underway I mean
you've heard some of it to green
theaters in two days but they really are
looking at this they're doing
their preparations there they are
deploying and and someone with it will
billy publicly visible soon so things
are happening and what these operators
actually need to do they need to have
the right network planning goals and
motives for the different cases that
I've talked about in the answer number
three we need to turn them turn on b6
because much of this code you mean it's
been tested and it runs but when you
actually run it in production you'll end
up seeing problems so we need to mature
the code base by turning on actually
getting that experience and the big
stuff is actually not test transporting
the packet but it's turning on that
billing system that enables that that
roaming to work having procedures for v6
having personnel trained upstream
connectivity dealing with wide lists you
know all kinds of practical things like
it that's where the effort is that's
where the where the problems are and of
course we don't have all devices today
supporting v6 small fraction so that's
another thing that needs to improve no
maybe Frederick's efforts in and then
Google can help there and we can make at
least Android to do v6 on all devices in
the future and we need to do that for
other products as well but one by one
that's all I have
thanks you re um from nice piece
perspective by the way I'd note that the
backend stuff and in the building
systems etc etc are the main thing um
were pressed for we have a half an hour
left so just be conscious that and they
do have a clock stuck over there thank
you thank you 510 ok this is mother for
my age I know yep so I'd like to share
needs from bachmann first I'd like to
know I want own networks so we need
measurement and people suggest to deploy
your stock network but the traffic flow
different between IPP i found that PP
six so somehow we'd like to know the
volume or statistics so there are
standards already so I'd like to ask Ben
does to support this meep or net froze
and another point we need
variable-length support so 128 or 127 or
whatever this actually works who
existing routers but bender said it's
it's not guaranteed but it works and
program so for a few routers are
actually
I heard of only one case that a
restriction that they can't install
these longer perfect sieve into its fear
so you can check on leave but the router
can't for them it's interesting and so
far from backbone that's all so it's
working we are ready to transmit ipv6
good house will be honest you've been
moving ipv6 since when ninety-eight ya
ready for 12 years um Ron let's see if I
can figure out how to do this here
you're probably better at it than I am
oops there's two of you can figure it
out yeah get the right one ear is that
the power point no no you want to borrow
my glasses what was the trick now don't
believe that control L stuff that's for
pdfs yeah there's some little icon right
here that you click and it makes it show
you how it's doing this one too there we
go okay unaffordable I can use this one
think okay so I'm going to cover the IP
and the inner p6 in the enterprise
what's still needed and it's just kind
of based on my experience in my
environments and so forth your
environment may be a little different
but a lot of it falls into these general
categories which I covered in my talk
yesterday the big one being feature
parity in all the mainstream vendor
products v6 needs just be as good
as v4 so that it doesn't feel like we're
going backwards or that you keep running
into just places where in your
infrastructure you think you're fully v6
capable and then there's just some
feature that's missing that you think
should just should have been there and
it's because the vendor hasn't gotten
around implementing it yet and it's not
only the functionality but it's the
performance we need it in hardware at
line rate just like in before so you
know think asics and that's why it takes
you know new product versions hardware
versions to to get that performance
often also we've noticed a lot of
problems in just the vendor QA of
products and this is because vendors not
eating their own dog food they don't
live on their own stuff and we found two
that we only some of the bugs we've seen
is just it's very basic it's like
haven't you tested this in your
environment at all and it's because the
QA suites are not mature and I think if
the vendors had to live on their own
stuff and feel the pain stuff would get
fixed a lot quicker so those just kind
of general things across the board with
get out getting into a bunch of
specifics some other pieces I'd like to
be able to do dhcpv6 it's what I wanted
to do you know this is eight ten years
ago almost but it required requires
broad client support it which is just
not there I mean in our environment
mostly we have windows XP Mac OS X
neither those have dhcpv6 clients and so
that was sort of a non-starter and
remains that way because of all the
windows machines that once in a while
get ICS turned on and various other
things that cause rogue are a
announcements we need something like our
a guard and I know it's there's an
internet draft for that we want to see
that implemented in the switch products
that's fairly high priority for us and
for now we have to come up with work
around and operationally that's that's
an impact we really need the unified IP
mibbe implemented across product lines
that's the RFC 4293 I think Maas
mentioned it as well it's it's
implemented its kind of spotty I mean at
Cisco it's sort of in some versions but
it's it's a huge challenge to figure out
what products it's implemented in
juniper you know some products it's
implemented for example the netscreen
products just it's not even there at all
and so there's no way to do some of the
network management that you need with it
with a common myth that works both for
v4 and v6 also things like all the flow
protocols we need the flow information
include both before and v6 for
management reasons as well ipv6 on
public facing services we found that
this has just been a problem not only
for us but a lot of the other
enterprises we deal with and it's
there's a number of showstoppers there
one of them a big one is Akamai has
everybody who's behind Akamai there's
just no way to get v6 support and that's
the initial show stopper or the Colo or
hosting facility they're on their
network just doesn't support v6 or the
load balancers don't support v6 or the
network engineers that really want to do
feed six have no influence on the local
it's-- or marketing staff that runs the
web server this this we run into over
and over again and they won't consider
simple alternatives to get started like
a simple v6 before proxy just to even
front end it just to get going so
usually for a lot of companies it just
stops right there OS vendors for
Microsoft if I had enough money and I
was king for a day I just outlaw XP
because and get everybody on Windows 7
because of ipv6 not on by default so you
have to convince somebody to turn it on
there's no dhcpv6 there's no dns over
ipv6 easy to become a rogue router with
ICS turned on and so we'd love to see
the world get get up to the later
version if what I really love is to find
a way to turn off the privacy randomized
address centrally some people are saying
we'll just do it active directory but in
my environment you know I got thousands
of customers that are all independent
autonomous not part of AD and so I need
a bit or a knob somewhere in the network
like you know like we have the mo no
bits and other bits in the router
advertisements I'd like another bit that
just says please don't do privacy or
randomized addresses because in an
enterprise there's many many reasons why
that's a killer and so I need to have
that turned off without visiting every
machine for apple mac OS x has just been
getting worse over the years and
especially with 10 6 and the mdns
respond the mtns responder brokenness
also the 64
preferences we've been hearing about
really need to get Apple to fix those
bugs we need to get DCPD 6 support I'd
love to have I so tap support for some
of our transition scenarios that would
really really help I think Apple
internally it'd be good if they duel
stack their own network ate their own
dog food had their people living on it
and then and then whitelist them and so
that they feel the pain also I'm sure
hoping that v6 works well in iOS four as
promised and we shall see there's the
the just do it which I I think that
really in order to get it into an
enterprise you need a corporate culture
it's got to permeate the entire IT
culture in an organization you can't
just have the engineering staff make
progress you need to get buy-in from the
CIO and the CEO on down you need a local
champion or an evangelist and in every
IT initiative in the organization its
has to have an ipv6 story and especially
when you're doing tech refresh this
doesn't have to be expensive it takes
time if you're doing it with tech
refresh but every time you're buying
something new we're doing an upgrade
make sure it's done the v6 way for
training we got to simplify it we can't
send people to these many multiple day
classes because by time they come home
and actually get around to it a month
later it seems overwhelming they would
have forgotten everything they don't
know where to start it's better just to
give some simple easy steps and force a
lot of people I think we can tell them
what are some of the easy steps like you
know do a triage do the simple things
first the low-hanging fruit and so do
things like worry about addressing then
your connectivity via the ISP then do a
test fit then do some training then
enable your public facing services then
worry about your security perimeter and
then your internal networks then your
systems and apps and sort of build out
from there and that certainly works a
lot better so that's the enterprise
story
thanks Ron I'd like to just make one
comment which is um when all these nice
folks from vendors stand up here and
blow smoke up my skirt is that when you
say that you want line rate and a six
when the vendors guess you mark talk
about backbone etc etc they think oh
there's two percent on the backbone
nobody's going to really notice that
this thing won't go full bore for five
years when you deploy in enterprise and
you deploy v6 your land starts screaming
v6 and the thing better run winery
Lorenzo you're gonna play it on your own
yeah I mean you know what you're doing
I've been talking too much anyway um I
think I met somebody listen and she said
so I don't know who you are cuz you
never introduced yourself on you but you
talk all the time so obviously you so
just briefly thing is at least for us I
mean we in the controvert has you know
they do they do a lot right they we run
at least you know here we're on we run a
network you know it looks like about one
network at least some of it does so we
need hardware for ring we need net flow
we need we need filtering on extensions
headers thank you very much they're not
just the first one because otherwise if
something comes in route with the
routing head or our only recourse is to
drop it so hardware support there and
and and and then feature parity then you
know load balancers yes load balancers
with the first of all load balances with
with ipv6 support you know just just to
get started and then it would be nice if
you could use v6 to talk to your
backends as well so if you don't want to
terminate ssl on your on your front end
load balancers then you can do that too
so and then how's the load balancer
going to talk to this network well I
mean do you have your do we have the RP
well maybe we don't have that yet or
maybe we can't do it with global
addresses so vrp
but this is this is what we've been
saying for a day and a half now which is
feature priority because unless you have
feature party you don't know which
feature you're going to need tomorrow
the only way to know that your design
what you design tomorrow is going to
work with the gear you have is if the
gear you have supports everything in the
same level and I understand that it
might be difficult but really that's the
only way out of this so and finally and
and and this is to some extent can be
worked around in this is our own
engineering and something that we really
can't work around by ourselves is broken
this out there in the field so broken CP
is out there they'll never be replaced
and there's nothing we can do about that
right because they're in home networks
and the ice P doesn't own them and we
don't own them and the user runs them
and the user doesn't know what the
problem is so we need it we need to fix
that and i think--not ice manufacturers
need to need to help there although we
haven't really had a lot of success that
yet so basically gos feature parity and
networking if you do md5 passwords do
them for v6 as well don't just implement
them in one place and then oh yeah or if
when you fix bugs oh this is race
condition we fixed it for before but we
didn't think it mattered for v6 and so
on so it boils down to two things for
future party in networking hardware and
let's find a way to fix this broken
users so that's it for me
Oh mr. do we have time for questions
whoo ok we have tongue room for 15
questions or some answers Cameron burn
t-mobile can we get to a flag day can we
revisit it and not think it's laughable
at least at least by flag day you mean
what happened at an analog and what
happened to the couple turn off ipv4
we're not going to turn it off that's
not realistic but can we get to a flag
day where we earnestly turn ipv6 on well
mods has an answer for we did in 98 next
I just remember in January one 1983 when
we turned off NCP worked great there
were stragglers things broke but it got
fixed really fast that's why I think you
know don't be afraid to break some glass
is kind of my motto at some point you
really have to make that decision I
think I mean for me in my mind you know
the day the Google feels safe enough to
really just not have to be white list
anymore instead of do black list that's
kind of a flag day in in one sense what
would we have to do to fix all the the
backbones the transport the the
brokenness out in the operating systems
and on all the home networks and so
forth to where the brokenness is small
enough or at least equivalent to be for
that we could GU or others could feel
safe to do that that would in a in a way
be a flag day I think that if if we fix
the u.s. is and so one of the problems
with a flag day is that when do you call
the day right do you want to wait for
Yahoo to have their stuff done and their
roadmap
the splits here yesterday that's next
year right so do you want to wait at you
if you want to start or do you want to
start now gradually and as regards as
Google right if if we can get working
packets to users that's the main thing
that's missing right it's not that we
have issues on our side Matthew from
internode I'm i agree with Cameron I
think we should stop fearing fear itself
and actually get on with it because if
we don't we're going to continue to sit
in fear of turning it on and that that
appears to be the problem at the moment
we are deadlocked with fear there is a
tiny percentage of people who may not
work and we kind of need to do it
because if we don't start to move
forward now we're going to be just as
much for a problem that's running out of
ipv4 I say something okay um Ron you
almost said it I walked up here to say
why don't we put if we're talking about
a flag day define what Ernest means and
i think it's it's it's a quad a flag day
that's what we're really talking about
right so the day that all the content
providers say okay there you go and it's
advertised and there you know you know
that there might be brokenness out there
everybody's waiting everybody the
service providers are expecting problems
it's even in the press whatever the quad
a flag day decide amongst yourselves
when it is how about the smtp received
header flag day that when i get email
from inside a vendor I look and I see if
the actual vendors desktop machine came
from an ipv6 address so that i know you
were eating your own dog food and maybe
your products would work um it time and
time again we heard the vendors aren't
eating the dog food
and and that means that you know the
consequences are pretty obvious and you
Lorenzo we're trying to get google
internal you hit a speed bump and you're
coming back off it but you know and and
we're doing it inside um when I first
moved to Tokyo i found out part of iij
it slipped back from v6 and maz and i
had to push okay get it rolled out
internally so you're eating your own dog
food whether you're an ISP whether
you're a vendor whether your content
provider or whether your Dino all I can
say is we lead by example you know I
can't um don't buy from a vendor whose
email headers aren't v6 well then you
might say don't buy a vendor who's who's
not in the v6 routing table and that's
our that's our network wiped out so I
mean you have to go some
you
you have to say I will buy this many a
by this amount of equipment and that
gets the VPS to listen it really does
that's the lever you have now I feel
uncomfortable at saying that because I
don't want to be this greedy prostitute
but that's the real world we've known
you for many years you are greedy
prostitute the but the point is don't
buy the kit unless they're for real it's
not just go to the VPS and say I will
buy 10 more billion dollars worth of
your rubbish if it moves v6 it's I will
not be by negative doesn't work you have
to be positive it's not fear that the
vendors care about its greed when ice
agree when I stop the orders John
Chambers moved I have to say that
wouldn't have worked for us that that
would have been a non-starter yes we
spent I it approximately zero in
hardware we got an early so that maybe
that's why it worked for us but that
wouldn't have worked for us I mean
Saints a memento hey here's this big
carrot that we there's internal buying
as well right you don't you're not one
hundred percent committed you just have
to beat your vendors into submission
that's not the way it works because
everyone is saying well I don't want to
take a step so wave NOLA rent lorenza is
still talking I'm not going to stop I'm
not going to talk all the reso stuff
Ralph ok Ralph Wallace command control
um quick just a quick question how many
solution providers are in here peep a
solution provider is somebody who goes
out to help people transition to ipv6
they provide a service to people to help
them transition ipv6 who else is in here
John you're but you're kind of I
understand John what is he so I'm who
else what what and who you okay so
there's two there's in this entire place
you get to Micah our company
and this company over here you got
people here who are water / listening in
so that we can go to enterprises public
or private and help them transition ipv6
and so I'm hearing you guys talk back
and forth you know Flag Day things like
that I know by the NCP right so we go to
places trying to help people transition
ipv6 and give them the reason for that
and I'm hearing you guys argue alright
and so here I am trying to help people
see the transition ipv6 I just want to
make sure that you guys got a
perspective from us because we went out
and we trained DARPA remember the
ARPANET we trained our pond implementing
ipv6 to their IT staff and how to secure
ipv6 based on all the rfcs right there
is cisco and microsoft shop their choice
not ours all right when we know I have
trained there RT staff we train them for
two weeks and they came am off the
training and they went holy crap how
come somebody hadn't told us this before
this is the IT enterprise infrastructure
staff for DARPA my point here we are
here talking about certain things you
know what there's a lot more education
that we need to do out there folks so if
that's a wake-up call I hope it is I
think we forgot the training Scott did
we do any Tracy's there yeah yeah I
think we forgot the training part ya
know internally I mean we I can't
remember us did we do it we didn't do
any training yeah okay yeah we yeah we
should have said oh we have this thing
we didn't deliver okay
yeah well nicely put common language out
of talk what is a new la right why is
icmpv6 report yeah you know it thinking
about the flag day thing yeah what we
ought to do as a community think about
where would we like to be a year from
now and a date that's close to that is
june six of 2011 which is five years
after the six bone is turned off you
know there's a good date that could be
in people's mind if you want to start
socializing so what could be
accomplished by then make an immediate
van it'll be right after the I Anna runs
out of I mean there could be a lot of
opportunities there so there's the date
but what do you want to have done by
then I mean I think we can be thinking
about that set a line in the sand maybe
we turn something off on that day or
maybe that's something where you know if
you don't have signs closed okay we got
three minutes left over you lose Martin
Bob so I'll be quick Bob Hindon so for
the company i work for the thing that
really got us motivated to put v6 in the
product was well me i would like to
think it was me giving presentations but
what it really was was the potential for
losing sales or losing business you know
or customers saying i will not i'm going
to switch to another vendor unless you
do this so that that worked quite well
oh um but in your case it was a check
mark and in many of the vendors cases
its weak implementation not they got the
check mark yeah well we had have some
customers who have real plans that are
going to need this Oh understand John so
we've we've done what Dino suggested
that that actually works you know I've
personally withheld payment on things
until it worked I've also taken we've
also taken our business elsewhere not me
personally but
what else in the company took bounds of
business elsewhere that also works you
know I also think that something you
know we you know to somebody's point you
we talk a lot I think actually doing it
actually helps and for whatever it's
worth I mean we're ready when you are
right dude where's my cable modem it's
in my hotel talk is cheap dog is my
hotel room it's still there my new hotel
room at the westin the st. Francis so
talk is cheap so so I mean yeah and i'm
not i'm not being cheap i don't think so
i mean like i said i'm ready when you
are right i mean i welcome qua days
right we know that there's problems out
there we all do right and and part of
what we you know we've been thinking
this is you know and we've heard this
year is you know sometimes you gotta
somebody keep saying you gotta break a
little guy break some eggs or whatever I
think there's something to that okay
just end on a positive note how many
people here think things are better in
Japan good we solve that one pardon the
food is much better my wife says that's
why we live there yep okay good that
education got done finally took a while
um that's about it Eric you want to wrap
thank you guys okay thank you
so this is very interesting in different
conference from last year some things
have been differently changing there's
definitely seems to be more of awareness
is clearly shifting right there's focus
is shifting and and especially last
appointment comes to fruition there's
issues about education and previous
talks about education was about you know
awareness education and now it's about
operational education and that's
definitely different but more focusing
on on real details like last mile issues
and some new apps kind of stuff there
are several people to thank I'd like to
thank the external folks who helped us
plan help us choose talks and get things
together and provide contacts and all
that kind of stuff that's Randy would
Jon dowski mark tounsi and others and
I'd mass and I have to thank our event
staff lissandra who's not here today and
Sabrina who is coordinating your
t-shirts which are outside in the lobby
I just think all that all the speaker's
everyone who came with lightning talks
and presented and someone's over the
panel participants this talk isn't
anything without you guys so thank you
so much and thank you all for coming one
of the things that I never thought about
starting v6 because I lied which is kind
of cool technology but turns out there's
a lot of cool people that you need doing
that too so that's that's been fantastic
