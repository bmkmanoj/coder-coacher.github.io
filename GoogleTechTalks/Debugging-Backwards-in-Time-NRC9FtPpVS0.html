Tufts University and he's here to talk
about his magical debugger so take it
away Thank You Neil and it is a great
honor and a pleasure to be here is the
sound good superb it's just after
Christmas so I asked myself the
following question if Santa Claus came
down the chimney and said I could have a
debugger which would give me any
information I wanted whatsoever what
would I want and I always come up with
the same answer ah the one thing I
always want to know when i'm debugging a
program is what did the value of that
variable used to be I just want to go
back in time which of course you can't
do but if you merely record every state
change in the entire run of a program
you can't reproduce the world as it was
and that's what I've done I am NOT the
first person to think of that idea but I
am the first person to make it work
effectively so here is the idea we are
going to record events of interest every
time that you change a variable of any
sort whatsoever local variable instance
variable etc array elements every time
you make a method call of any type I am
really going to record the fact that you
made that method call and here are the
arguments I claim this is a really
interesting thing to do number one cuz
debugging is easier if you can go
backwards in time number two it
eliminates all the worst problems with
breakpoint debuggers you don't have to
guess where to Brooke break points do i
put here there the other place you don't
have to worry about all those extra
steps forward forward skip etc you don't
have to ever worry about the good old
how many people have done this whoops I
went too far its course and there are no
non-deterministic problems if the
problem occurs under the debugger you've
got it it can't get away it's also true
that give the programmer unique view of
the program which is kind of cool and
because all the data is serializable you
could save it to a file you could have
your customers email you the results of
a debugging run and even though they
don't have the source code they don't
know what went wrong you can take that
and you can then go ahead and use it
with the source code zamp there's a bug
and of course you can imagine all the
other types of things you can do when
you're doing your regression testing g
with if it fails a regression test bring
it up under the debugger it's ready in
the morning when you walk in to debug
now ah just a second I need my props
not really above
it's more like a snake
you see
if you know where the problem showed
itself that's like seeing the tail of a
snake into the grass and if you can grab
that snake's tail all you have to do is
pull the tail and pretty soon you get to
the state's head and that is exactly
what we're going to see
the program outputs bad data that's the
tale we start with the bad data and just
go backwards as long as you poke can
point out well that was bad and that
one's bad but you got to be able to edit
your program then you're done and it
really is that easy if we can't see the
tail if the program fails not by putting
out something we didn't want but rather
failing to put outs output something
that needs a different type of a problem
that's not a snake in the grass problem
but it does mean that we know what we
were expecting to have happen and this
is a type of bug which is much easier to
debug going forward i also have worked
with complex searches over large sets of
events that is find an event which
matches some pattern and we'll take a
look at that in a moment now if we can't
see the tip here we are here's a typical
pattern which merely says this is a
function call the value of arguments 0
is a0 and the method Amos sort so we go
through the entire history of the
program and look for a call to sort
whose first argument is 0 and we'll
bring them up now with breakpoint
debuggers it's not like a snake so much
as it is he lizard
you see if there is a lizard in the
grass and you grab the Luthor's tail
what did the leather do he snapped off
his tail and he gets away and you're
left with a lizard's tail and this is
actually very very apt metaphor so this
is how I implemented the ignitions
debugger in Java I take your class files
and I instrument them while you're
loading you tick in my instrumentation
in there it runs in the same process as
a target program and it uses a single
block so that if you have multiple
threads running they synchronize
linearly I know how to do the same for
other languages it's just a lot harder
I've chosen these prints drinks nothing
special about them the first print
string my object underscore 123 is the
name of the class an iteration counter
this is a hundred and twenty third my
object that was created and optionally a
instance variable value so if you have
my ob's have the name variable you can
stick Bob in there that's what a array
of twenty integers looks like it's the
second array of 20 in a second array of
integers we've identified and then this
is what a class object looks like the
string and numbers of course would you
expect true false and because we can go
back in time double dashes if it has no
value so I would print out a person by
the name of Louie whose name age hoe and
hoe more listed as such an array of
integers or if I go backwards in time to
before Louie was created I'll see this
for the output and we'll be seeing that
in just a moment I do method traces ein
into method traces I think it really
makes it easier to see what your program
is doing so I do method traces that look
like this and you can see that the frob
method of herbs was called aab 6 and the
number in the string and it returns true
frog called twiddle twiddle called spin
three times then you can see Twitter
returned and frog return because spin
isn't calling anybody I simply lead the
return statement because it's pretty
clear what's going on so those are the
outputs we're going to be looking at I
gave a bunch of students a problem to
work with and they did it better with my
debugger than with any other method but
let's instead stop and take a tour I
have just as you can see in the emacs
window run the debugger and now
you
go okay
okay here's what we're looking at as we
can see up here we are now at the
beginning of time there were 1280 events
that occurred here are the method traces
and so from the meds method trace as you
can see that main called print line it
made a new vector it then called bad
method which is a static method it
didn't call horse method which is also
static worst etc it throws a
nullpointerexception which we then
catched and if we watch the code pain we
can see all of this happening here we
are we've just called main so if we're
top of Maine there we are doing a print
line we make a new vector and now we're
inside the first function the second
function the third function we're
throwing the null pointer exception and
there we catch the null pointer
exception and print out there was some
bug underneath here we have the output
pain and so this is what the TTYL output
looked like so at this point the only
thing we've printed so far is the first
line in blue and we haven't printed out
anything else which you can tell by the
double dashes on all these lines here so
I can advance through time I can select
any line here and i will go to when that
line occurred so there we are we're in a
print line statement like we expected I
can go back to here and I can see there
the print line for I through a
nullpointerexception um let's take you
down for a moment and look through the
method traces this is what a typical
program looks like they're the loop
printing out done and array and it looks
a bunch of print lines and here I'm
adding and subtracting things in a
vector and stuff like that the main bit
of this program is a multi-threaded
quicksort so if we go back here we
see in the first sorter thread the
typical outline of half of quicksort
which is I called a short a call to
average to find the pivot point then we
go ahead and call sort recursively doing
the pivot on the pivot point we've done
the pivot on the pivot point then we
call resort recursively we also make a
new thread right there to do the other
half of the sort so this thread was sort
of thread number one which is the next
thread and he's just like sort of thread
number two they accept half the size and
the next one's gets smaller and of
course smaller well more or less smaller
you can see what's going on so over here
we have all the threads that exists in
the entire run of the program and you
can see we had dozen threads or so I
gave them names summer sorter threads
some of these threads are doing other
things if we're in the middle of a
thread doing some work here we of course
see the stack as we expect it to be so
there a run method has called sort has
called average we are in the middle of
the average method there we are down
here we see all the local variables in
this case we have the two parameters
start and end but some and I haven't
been assigned it in the code pain we can
do step forward just like anything else
we have step in and we have step over
and step to the end of the entire
program let's do a step in and of course
you're going to see we're just going
through the loop for some adding things
up and we're done and of course all the
numbers over here are all of the data
over there is kept up to date as we go
through the program and of course the
cool thing is we can now go backwards
and we can say oh goody where did we
come from and we're going to see I get
smaller and of course I goes down just
like it's supposed to we
step entirely out of this program
function to where average was called in
the first place finally down here we
have the this object and we see whatever
values their R&amp;amp;D this for example an
array of 20 integers if I double-click
on him he will show up on this side of
the display let me make some room and
they're all the values of the array so
let's do this I can take the array i can
say go to when you were created so we go
back to time 38 and of course the array
is all zeros I can step forward saying
show me the next value of any element of
the array and you can see we're filling
up the array and if we look at that loop
that's just a typical little little
about the loop which stores random data
into the array so I can keep going
through the array now the array is full
and I can go forward and say oh let's
watch it pivot and oh boy I'm going to
watch this array pivot you can see the
wherever the asterisks is that indicates
a value which has changed between the
last time timestamp i was looking at in
the current timestamp so in this case
element number 13 is the only thing that
changed between the previous time i was
looking at it now if i go to the end of
the program for example I'll get lots of
asterisks is because everybody's
changing so we were back here I can also
do things like hey show me every value
that element number 13 ever had there
they are I can say hey cool I want to go
to when it was 12 21 I select it and
I've just gone to win it that's set to
12 21 so this is way cool anything you
see anywhere you can double-click on and
it will show up over here and if you
double click here it opens inside itself
recursively and you can see there the
character and a bite and oh the same
array of 20 integers it's yep it's the
same array so now let's go to the end of
time and take a look at our little array
of here everything looks copacetic 1968
it's greater than 1962 with greater than
1775 and it works all the way down to
element number one if we just don't look
at element zero number zero quicksort
works fine so what went wrong with
element number zero this actually is a
non snake in the grass problem because
what's going on is we're expecting
something to have changed it didn't
change so what we really want to do is
we want to search for word to say who
was responsible for making that change
and why didn't he make it so we can do
exactly that we might want to ask the
question what were all the values that
element number one ever had oh add Z
element the value zero that's pretty
uninteresting and element number zero
got initialized to 1 and never changed
okay that's not cool let's figure out
why who is responsible for change the
value of making sure that 0 and 1 had
the correct values while the presumably
the sort thread which was the deepest
let's see if we can find that guy this
sort thread should have sorted 0 through
19 this thread should have done 0
through five but he gave his
responsibility over here to this guy 0
through to
who is which sort of thin thread 30
clearly this guy should have taken care
of it that guy messed up let's go in and
see why we can step forward in time
that's what I'm going to do here and say
well let's see we called sort that's
cool and these guys are not sorted so
clearly this thread should have figured
it out let's go ahead down to average we
can't step into average and let's go
through average and see what average
does we know what it's supposed to do
it's going to take the average of
elements 0 1 and 2 and as we step
through here we can see over here yes a
sum is changing everything is changing
nicely and we get up element 0 and 1 and
whoops are we working yes and we're
stepping forward and oh we returned we
return the value zero the average of 237
and 0 and 1 is 0 and of course at this
point where you can say gee whiz I is
200 look at that I should have gone up
so that we should have counted the
element into and we only added elements
0 and 1 gee whiz this loop right here
that should have been less than or equal
to end so this is finding the average
value so we can choose the pivot yes
ah
clearly we have to fix it first
but not clearly but it seemed like a
good idea this was very wrong the first
person ever to notice that
go I want to talk about looking a few
other things first one of the things i
want to do is go back to the main thread
and looked at a few other things the
main thread came down here after he
finished doing all of his really cool
quicksort stuff he played around with a
vector let's take a look at this vector
do go away a vector when I think of a
vector I think of vectors is this some
number of elements I don't think of a
vector as being an array with an index
with a change count and all that other
stuff so I get to represent the vector
the way I want to I represent the vector
as having five elements and if I go
backwards in time I can say oh show me
when element and five wasn't there where
did element 5 come through come from
right there we didn't add of this guy
into vector 0 here and so if I can I can
step backwards and take things out of
the vector or step forwards and see
changes in the vector actually this guy
we go backwards let's see originally he
was full of beer so it looks like the
program put for bottle of the beer into
the vector and then he looks like he
actually removes a couple of bottle of
the beer and that's fine now there is a
snake in the grass problem here let's go
take a look at this puppy if we come up
to here look at that cotton exception
nullpointerexception aah evil
nullpointerexception actually I love no
pointer exceptions there's so much
better than seg these you can't believe
it um why did we get a null pointer
exception this is a snake tail if I've
ever seen one well let's see
here's where we caught it now we're
going to step backwards and we got a
null pointer exception because we called
null dot equals that's pretty clearly
uncool so no where did this come from s
equals s is no okay well that's clearly
a problem where did this come from gee
whiz if we back up a line here s came
from this vector vector one so let's
take a look at vector one here and we're
going to get rid of this guy and sure
enough element number two of vector
number one is null well where did that
come from let's go backwards and see up
after the first time we got an element
in number two it looks like because we
added null to the vector right there
okay why did we do that we are now in a
completely different section of the
program well right here we added s a
different s s is from dt name dt yeah i
was over there so dt now we in the right
plate a second we are adding a no we
went back to the previous line dt was
demo thing number two ah there he is his
name is indeed to know why is it no well
if we step backwards to hear ah he have
used to have a good name Vladimir and
right there for some unknown reason
somebody said it to know which is
actually a very common thing to do you I
constantly say to myself I'm changing
this for a little while and then I'll
know that it had has to be changed back
to some other value this type of thing
happens a lot and so that was a classic
snake in the grass problem you really
didn't have to know the code at all to
get back to this
point let's take a look at a couple
other things and then we'll be ready for
more fun um you I want demo thing demo
thing yes bring you all right you can if
you want to you can choose some point in
time let's go back to when let's go back
to that point in time whatever that
point in time is
i would like to i think i would like to
start elements 0 0 1 two 2 three
I want to back the program at this point
and running different function or the
same function with different arguments
so I am going to come down here you'll
notice in the mini buffer I can say demo
things 0 sore Oh average I don't want
average sort of
Priya nervously
chuck it I'm going to take the whole
world roll it back for look like at this
point in time and now go forward in a
separate timeline so I'm going to retain
my original timeline I'm not going to
drop any data but I might make a new
world and run this function I run it and
it should have sorted elements 3 shoot
through six I go through to the end of
time here elements 3 through 6 what do
you know they are shorted and in the
alternate timeline if you really want to
you can say gee whiz you know a sign I
don't want to 43 I want 99999 i change
this to nine nine nine nine nine and now
I can repeat my sort with nine nine nine
nine nine
and
where are we up and there we are we have
now correctly sorted everything you
could I don't I don't deal with that as
stupid itself is an application that I
have retarded
now this is really cool it's really fun
and it's really hard to do and it's
really kind of idiosyncratic but who
cares it's fun turns out it's not
actually useful but i'm debugging a
program i find that actually virtually
never want to do this which is a
surprise but there is
I'm sorry
oh of course
so we know yes you can you can build any
type of displaying its network
let's take a look at table you're not
going to go back to the original
timeline so here we are in the original
timeline and somewhere down here we have
a hash table of hash hash hash hash hash
does anyone see a hash table in here
well I don't so we can do a interactive
search hash you see the words passion
here no it doesn't like away what ah
hello
man I have no idea why are we slow
ok so here in the typical hash table
and so that's what that's how I chose to
represent a hash table the keys being
first 0 first second third etc and the
hash values over here and as you write
an alternative
adhya so I had basically I took the
original hash tables and made a subclass
which we do just what I wanted just the
right way
and then I played all sorts of games to
get my hash table then where you go past
him but um
um
so let's see how we do like to know when
threads are dead occasionally we like to
know for example to go at the end of
time we would like to know when threads
are alive in particular these two fine
threads named hanger 10 and 11 they are
blocked they are blocked waiting for
inspected lee demo thing five and demo
theme for gee i wonder why if i double
click on the two threads and say show me
these two threads at the end of time I
see yes they're blocked on these things
I can open those things up and I get to
see okay who is blocked waiting to get
the lock who is blocked waiting to get
woken up
let's waiters sleepers who owns a lock
with anybody owns a lot of course you
can see immediately right here that tea
with Fred Levin is the owner of the lock
for thing three between five and think
hanger thread 10 is waiting for it
thread 10 owns a lock a thing for and
thread 11 is waiting for it so classic
deadlock and it's obvious it's just like
they're just what we wanted I did
mention you one other thing up search
for searching I said that I wanted to be
able search 40 a
show me all the calls to a function and
r 0 is equal to 0 will share me all the
functions who are called with an
argument of 0 and there we go short is
called with an argument of z Ro averages
called with an argument of zero sort
again average again scored again etc and
if I don't like that if I want to see
more we talkin to me
No
and
there you go let only look for the ones
that have sort in them and once again
and now we can go backwards and I'm
slowly
ok
No
okay that's what we say absorb I have no
idea let's take a look at one other
thing and then it will be a good time to
think of questions I want to go back to
the top of this function and second
that didn't look right oh man I do when
you're giving a talk and debugging in
your debugger breaks what Oh what's the
debugger
yeah I think of that
but the divider with the time we needed
to monitor bugger and of course ends you
have guessed the debugger everything you
have been watching is already
recursively under itself this is 35,000
line the hiding it beautifully crafted
Java code running fully under itself
completely instrumented let's go ahead
and start recording in the to bug your
debugger press the button that went
wrong again the exception thrown don't
need the debugger let's look at what the
dip buggered of other has to tell us
about what went wrong with the buffers
so right there we have TTYL output
accepting in the buggers let's go go to
them okay in this thread da TT thread or
a surprise something went wrong
and let's see what do we got we caught
an exception and step backwards in time
towards an exception is thrown up the
exception was strong right after its
turn because we look like TS about time
gee willikers
TS is dull bummer where did TS come from
oh he's an argument to the function
revert let's go to the collar of revert
there is where reversion called up he
was just called with null ok this guy
still has TS TS s no TS came from here
let's step backwards and see where TS
came from in get first TS function here
we are ah this is why we gotta know
because this function returns now and
obviously we didn't handle it and so the
correct presumably the correct fix to
this is to handle know when this
function gives us know or not have this
function be able to return no but that
is by and large in essence how a bugging
works and now it's merely a question of
is it easier than sticking in
breakpoints is it more effective does
that do what you want to the work for
your program and now a good time to take
questions
Neil you get started okay so we want him
on the mic okay
there's a what
I have seen people
oh yes
serializable
which is far
this cigarette holder because
everyone's there
government with the Department
yep so
so
if you're the bug get your bug appears
under the ODB and you've got it if it
doesn't then you have then the LDV won't
help you and so yes there are some bugs
that simply won't occur under the old
living and of course double check
locking it is a classic is a good
example and it's yeah we can go into
that in great detail w built you an I
spend a lot of time on that dinner
question yep
plattsburgh diseases
and as it was a problem
time for me
I'm not particularly here's what I
actually do I'm instrument all your coat
and don't need to connect the job down
there is your classic I can and I have
done so that or I have instrumented
swing but that means that I have to take
the swing put into a different package
that i'm using swinging here so i can
see about swing to underneath it and yes
it works just fine no problem so there's
a small class of bugs classically the
total storm TSO style bugs where it's
not a hardware issue that simply won't
occur until you can't de button
very little else I've been able to find
pretty much everything
right now
yes to all so for example I mean the
TTYL is basically a strain and so you
can make a specialized thing like this
for others involved and that's
presumably what i would do if i had time
money
yes
there is a question of what's possible
and then the court step what if I do
what i do is i estimate code unloading
always running underneath another and so
for example when we do that's pretty
much
um
ok
is using
penalties
all is it done it in bra and otherwise
you
you want to know something about the
concert
we're worried
this is the first time anyone has ever
asked me this question two
here we go answer number 133 answered
answer number one is this is a proof of
concept out there he said good answer
has a number to their buckets are not
immutable attempt to that from this
technique use another technique I could
never see one
I have never had a bug that I hadn't
have fun
that's true
and here's the answer you really wanted
this is a naive implementation I can be
the factor number two's 2 applies
in 31 bit address space I have
successfully recorded 100 million events
had approximately one microsecond for
event caveat caveat kappa
are here in the cabinet
in a 64-bit address space you should be
able to get all whole pile of events in
there and the question really becomes if
your program takes 10,000 years to show
the bug would you be willing to wait
1,000 years to run it under the debugger
okay so in particular the worst possible
loop would be this one we are change
about your thumb on every single cycle
and we're not going out of cash
it's about 300 you can just a teeny bit
of work across the side of factors three
you can go out of cash like big array
boom drops a lot now we have because
you're doing more work outside and take
longer to load the cat's eyes and so
just doing that makes a huge difference
playing with strings I don't record the
internals of the string function so boom
at the snap so depending the obd a
factor of 10 to 300 button and for
about a factor seven so I recompile and
underneath
seven times forward
and I was happening
getting quite popular
so the question if I prefer my kid
customer is running the program
something goes wrong can I do anything
right there no the customer has to run
it underneath the developer once they do
it underneath the debugger then they can
yes I could just collect them for
basically not haven't done that it just
doesn't seem
maybe I'm wrong maybe that's the right
thing to do I mean you you can sort of
describe with that the super logging
structure just wats everything and we
played a different question
just in regard to the
granularity the tracing every time I see
a good field in your x file I follow it
with a record is different
every time I see a function positive so
they're thinking everything like I said
I don't do the foundation passes I can
it's just generally not each you get
the old
there are things that I can do which
could eliminate a lot of work this is
not even avatar so yeah I think you can
probably go other times that
that's naive
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
impress somebody you can come down the
hill here's a sack of gold and then I'll
help so the other we answered out you
can't very much right now right now and
I'm teaching at Tufts University
and and hoping that
if I keep talking someone will say oh
that's exactly
ah genius for next month
I don't have any
have their bits of GC where we're going
to this I want to make this change that
change that you may think I've comes
with one code base where the right thing
to do is to take all the ideas learned
throw away all the code let's start over
and do it quote unquote right
and they've got
oh ah
synchronization
wonderful that would be
okay I've talked it I've talked to it
they're never people doing something
with version of hardware copy
yes I have
checkpoint songs have the problems at
nap time principal is now you try to
before it's non deterministic but then
approach
every time you can check
accent this version actually had the
garbage
I will fill it up with however many tons
of s I want and that's our throw it away
over which is a really neat idea was
really fun to do turns out contracts it
just is interesting you can because of
our some of those in that solution
and in my experience the hardest month I
have still to evening with him
it just turned out this not an issue i
can find ways to reduce the amount of
there's so much it's not interesting
I'm so lucky to have you
the state's let's say you read from 531
night
something interesting happens
Thank You Baxter for me
megabyte file
actually eating
alright so we never would happen I've
reported
that have been played
council future by surprise okay yes they
need different possible futures gave you
the different animals so so on the one
side the answer oh I think you've got a
bit on the one side the answer's no
everything's history if you want to play
it forward and get some movement I see
it's fun
dicing and like I said just not useful I
just happened as a valuable but it's fun
it's typically
okay any other questions
then I think that we will call this day
and glorious success when I finish the
time I getting this talk to Luke oopsla
I had that last slide on there
oh yeah
and so if you can find I love way to be
very it hat you have to be able to take
that about ur have the debuff appear
under the debugger and so in other words
if their class loader problems okay
that's if I don't want to mess with them
I want to say you have algorithmic
column in Java code you're not dealing
with weird stuff and harbor and you
think anything that
Nathan birth under the bugger I could
find that
okay it has been a pleasure being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
