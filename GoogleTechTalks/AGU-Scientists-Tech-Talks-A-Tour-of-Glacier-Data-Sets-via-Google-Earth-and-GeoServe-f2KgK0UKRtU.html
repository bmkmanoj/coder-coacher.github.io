is Lisa Bala who works to be snow and
ice a national stone ice data center in
boulder colorado and she's going to be
talking about how they visualize data
from glaciers in Google Earth thank you
John as John mentioned I'm to be talking
today about to glacier datasets in
particular and how we can view them in
google earth and then i'm also going to
be talking about geoserver and the role
that geoserver plays in this project i'd
like to acknowledge my co-authors epin
Wang and Elena Wallace they have
contributed tremendously to this work
and I'd really like to acknowledge their
support before i get into the talk I'd
like to give you a little bit of
background first on the National stone
ice data center as John mentioned we're
located in boulder colorado and we're a
big data archive so we have tons and
tons of satellite imagery we have
imagery from submarines or data i should
say from submarines and we also have
photo collections we manage and
disseminate different snow and ice data
center and we're funded primarily by
NASA NOAA and the NSF the work that I'm
going to be talking today about today is
funded by Noah's national geophysical
data center I should say that at the
National snow and ice data center most
people come to our website looking for
data however if they're not looking for
data the most the second most popular
search term that they're looking for is
information on glaciers so I'm going to
be talking today about two different
glacier datasets the glacier photograph
collection and the world glacier
inventory I'm going to be showing how
you can visualize them in google earth
and i'm going to use geoserver to do
this and then at the very end I'm going
to be talking about our nsidc virtual
globe site
we have a glacier photograph collection
where we have glaciers that extend back
to the 1880s and then we have
information up to 2005 this is a really
neat collection because it was donated
to nsidc in the by William field back in
the 1970s and coverage primarily
includes Alaskan and Greenland glaciers
although we you have limited coverage in
other areas such as Canada Europe New
Zealand and Peru this data set is
actually really important it's one of
our most popular data sets at nsidc we
have it's doubled in size this year
since January of 2008 and with many
contributions by the USGS ice and
climate project with many contributions
from Austin post we now have over 10,000
glacier photographs online and this is a
whole project with accessibility because
when we received this huge collection
from William field a while ago he gave
us tons and tons of glacier photographs
but we had the photographic prints in
order to actually view this information
you had to go to boulder colorado and
you had to go into our analog archives
room and you could flip through all the
various different photographs which is
great however thanks to noah's climate
database modernization program we have
digitized a lot of these photographs and
now they're available online we do have
several thousand glaciers that are not
our prints that are not available online
yet but we are working with noah cgmp
program to get this funded and made
available online this just gives you an
example of a rapaho glacier in 1912 1966
and in 2004 and you can kind of see how
the glaciers have how this particular
glacier has retreated over time a subset
of our collection is a set of repeat
photographs where a photographer will go
to an exact location and specifically
try and repeat a photograph from the
past so for example this is holgate
glacier in alaska taken in july of 1909
and then taken again by bruce molnija in
august of 2004 and what's really neat
about this is that you can visually see
some of the retreat that's happened with
various glaciers over time and this is
really what the public are interested in
everyone is coming to our site looking
for glaciers and so we have these photos
now online and we've also created
several different KML files so that you
can zoom into Google Earth you can go to
Alaska look at the different place marks
you click on a place mark and it pops up
information in Google Earth it's also
important about the Google Earth work
that we've done is that we have
information we have our metadata
associated with these glaciers
autographs so you don't just have
glacier photographs without any context
we have information about each specific
glacier photograph in our collection and
this is really the most important part I
think because you can view the photos
which are obviously very interesting but
without the metadata you don't really
know what you're looking at and it's not
very useful I just talked about the
glacier photograph collection but the
second data said I'm going to talk about
is our world glacier inventory data set
so while the glacier photos are actually
photographs this is more raw data and
statistics about glaciers this
collection has over a hundred thousand
glaciers and it's a snapshot in time so
we have information such as the latitude
and longitude of the glacier the total
area the mean depth and so on our
objective our objective was to make this
information accessible through google
earth now with the glacier photograph
collection we have static KML files and
when the glacier photograph collection
is updated we have to update our KML
files to make sure that they are in sync
with the world by sure inventory it was
just too large to do this we have over a
hundred thousand records if we created a
KML file it would be thousands and
thousands of pages long and it would
probably crash if you tried to open it
in google earth so we had to come up
with some kind of solution and we wanted
it to be a dynamic solution because
every time we update the world glacier
inventory we don't want to actually go
in and manually update the KML file we
want this to be done automatically so
our solution was to use geoserver for
this which will dynamically request area
specific information
so to get our world glacier inventory
from the from our one database into KML
we're using geoserver if you're not
familiar with geoserver here's a diagram
that kind of shows you the different
inputs that you can use so we have
inputs for the world lay shirt i'm using
the world waste your inventory for this
and then you can have different output
options and what's nice about geoserver
is that it automatically creates these
output options for you we're using
postgis as our input so we've loaded all
of our world glacier inventory data into
this database and then we're connecting
it to geoserver and then geoserver
automatically creates this kml output
for us here's a quick view from Google
Earth of our worldly Shore inventory and
I've kind of zoomed in on Europe I've
added a little place mark here for the
overview to give you context for what
we're looking at and then we have little
red arrows and each red arrow represents
a glacier in our world glacier inventory
you can zoom in a little bit and zoom in
a little bit more and you can click on
one of these icons and it gives you
information about the data and this is
pulled dynamically from the database so
the closer you zoom in it's
recalculating oh I'm only interested in
this particular region I'm only going to
return these results to you through
geoserver and I have formatted this so
that you can go back to our
documentation to get information on the
metadata all the field names I've
included here along with all of their
values and for example let's say you
don't know what one of the country codes
means we don't know what CH means you
can click on our documentation and it
has information on what all the country
two codes mean and that helps you better
understand the data Michael Jones of
Google spoke last night at the agu
conference here in San Francisco and he
was talking about having scientists
communicate the results and distribute
their data and he mentioned that a lot
of scientists actually you know will
distribute their data and
put it online but sometimes they don't
have any information they don't have any
column headers so you can look at the
data but it's not going to make any
sense to you because you don't know what
the values mean you don't even know what
the headers are that's analogous to the
output that you'll get using geoserver
if you don't use kml templates and style
layer descriptors so in this example
here I have used a KML template and a
styled layer descriptor because if I
don't you're going to get this long
table with records from the database and
it its not going to really make any
sense to you for example topographic
scale and the database might have a
field name of top o underscore scale and
you might not know what that means and
it just gives you this long output so
I've formatted it to make it a little
bit easier to understand in Google Earth
at the heart of this of course is
geoserver and the key with geo servers
interoperability so you can date data
from various different sources you can
integrate it into geoserver and then you
can use this through several different
web mapping applications it supports OGC
standards and you can share an edit
geospatial data and what I like about
geoserver is at its gooey driven you
don't have to be a programmer in order
to be able to use geoserver the ones
geoserver is up and running you can load
your data into geoserver and it
automatically creates the kml files for
you and the GUI is very intuitive
another thing I should know is that a
lot of times when you think of open
source software you think oh well it
might not be very well documented i must
say that i'm quite impressed with the
documentation for geoserver several the
open source community has done a really
good job of putting information together
about geoserver and whenever I have
questions I resort back to the
documentation and I usually find the
answers that I'm looking for this is an
example of the geoserver main page
and from the main page I've clicked on
one of the layers this is the world
waste your inventory layer and I'm
clicking on KML here this this page kind
of lists all the layers that you see
along with all of the outputs you can
also go in and make configuration
changes so you can go to data and
feature types and you can get the world
glacier inventory data that you've just
loaded and you can change the style say
for example you don't like the red
arrows that I have and you want to have
a little white snowflake instead you can
create your own style layer descriptor
and it's pretty easy you just change the
style on this web page hit apply and
save and it's done for you
so this is an outreach project that
we're working on and so we wanted to
take the data from geoserver and put it
into google earth and we do this
obviously through KML and since this is
Otto dematic Lee generated it makes it
really nice as I mentioned the user
output is not very friendly at first but
you can use templates and style layer
descriptors and make it much nicer
here's an example styled layer
descriptor this is just a little piece
of code that i took out of it but
basically i've highlighted that you can
put this snowflake on our score thumb
gif file in here and it and you have to
save this file on geoserver but then
everything is snowflakes every single
glacier will be a snowflake instead of a
red arrow like I have it here's an
example KML template that I've created
this is just part of it but you can see
actually that part of the values in here
for example glacier underscored naam
value that's pulling information
dynamically from the database and as you
can see I'm pretty much using HTML tags
here so I don't have to know how to
program I don't have to know how to
create a KML file I just have to know
how to edit this template and all the
informations available through the
geoserver website
next I want to show you our virtual
globe site this is a site that we have
at the National snow and ice data center
and this has all of our Google Earth
files all in one place you can see on
the left hand side we have a little
snapshot image of the file and then we
also have the KML files that you can
download along with the data source so
that you can actually go to the data
source and find out more information
about this I should note that every file
on this page has been peer reviewed
we've set up a peer review process for
all of our KML files because our main
goal is we want to create KML files but
we don't want to make them unusable we
want to make KML files that are of high
quality and so at least three people of
you every single file that we've put on
this website and our goal obviously is
for outreach because we want to make
them easier and more accessible to a
broader audience you can see the
glaciers file that I spoke about earlier
that's right here you could download
that and if you look through this
website you will not find the world
glacier inventory file that I spoke
about earlier why is this that's because
it's on our Google Earth technical
experiments page so we're really trying
to foster innovation at nsidc and by
doing this we want to be able to have a
way to get files out to the public that
have not been peer reviewed but that are
more innovative so if you look on this
page the world glacier inventory file
that I was talking about is here and
this will go through our peer review
process it just has not yet but this
lists various files that we've been
experimenting with so if you're
wondering what we've been up to lately
you can go to this site and take a look
at some of the files that we have been
working on
this concludes my presentation as I
mentioned this is an outreach initiative
to reach a broad audience we really want
to get our data out there we want more
people to use it and we want to make it
as easy to use as possible a lot of
people like using google earth which is
why I've shown this I've showed Google
Earth in this presentation but KML is an
open standard so you can view KML and
other virtual Globes such as Microsoft
Virtual Earth geoserver helps sort of
data through google earth and it's open
source software which is why we have
selected google or geoserver and users
can view the glacier datasets in a
spatial environment feel free to contact
me if you have any questions thank you
very much are there any questions yes
ok
great thank you I will just repeat what
he said he had more of a comment more
rather than a question he's a teacher
and he uses he's used our CIS images and
some of the classes that he has taught
and he's found them useful and he
thanked us yes that's a good question I
don't know
I should note though that geoserver does
you can create you can add onto
geoserver so if it's not available in
geoserver you can program it and make it
do that okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
