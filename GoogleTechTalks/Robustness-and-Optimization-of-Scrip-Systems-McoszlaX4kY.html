introducer so I marked honor i'm an
engineering director here in the new
york office i would like to my distinct
pleasure and honor to introduce Joe
Halpern who's the the head of the cs
department at Cornell he started off as
an honest mathematician and then fell
into computer science sort of the way
many of the rest of us did over the
course of years he's done very many
interesting things including teaching
mathematics in Ghana for two years but
I'll let him tell the rest of the story
he's going to talk tonight about scrip
systems not script script so funny money
to you or something like something on
that order but there's lots of them
around and I will let him tell the story
Joe and you hear me back there okay uh
so the rules the game are do not wait to
the end to ask questions ask them
whenever you feel like asking them if I
think it's an appropriate or it makes
more sense to wait to the end I'm in
charge I'll tell you to wait okay so
this is joint work with you in cash was
my student he's now at batteries at
Microsoft in Cambridge England and Eric
Friedman who is now
bundle it was a Cornell so as Mark said
script is funny money um it's all over
the place actually you can think of as
Mark pointed out uh I get to the end
scoop is will widely used I I'll explain
to Washington the babysitting co-op
story that's coming up it's used in
systems like carmem brownie points and
dandelion and and frog so these are all
computer systems so are the following
the Gorog mariposa oodles Mirage eggs so
here they've been used to prevent free
writing I'll explain that and for
resource allocation so but they're also
used in the real world I think of
airline miles their script right it's
it's a way of keeping track of things
which you can use to get free trips and
other things um in Ithaca we have Ithaca
hours which is money you can script
money that you can use to pay for some
businesses it can be very effective
because you can think of script as a
market mechanism and they can yield
orderly systems beyond the ability of
any individual the plan and further
understand so this is saying basically
the market is a good thing but they're
far from perfect so we wanted to
understand script systems go they're
sort of on the border of script and real
money so I mean I you know this isn't
the talk of what is really script but i
think you know some extent they share
some of the features of script so let me
explain the Capitol Hill babysitting
co-op story this is a story that I read
about in an article by Paul Krugman yes
Nobel prize-winning Paul Krugman but
there's that there's a journal article
in econ journal that that his article is
based on so the story goes like this a
bunch of yuppies in Washington all had
kids and they decided they would they
would form a babysitting co-op they
would babysit for each other high-tech
um and so of course they didn't want to
pay each other but somehow they wanted
to keep track of who was babysitting
because they didn't want free riding
they didn't want it to be the case that
she you know people babysat for me
twenty times and I'd never babysat for
anybody else
right on so the way they did it is they
had tokens tokens are script so
everybody had some tokens and if you
wanted somebody to babysit for you you
had to give him a token and you got a
token when you babysat for someone else
so think of the script as functioning
like bookkeeping it had no value in the
outside world was just a system of
tokens now what was interesting is at
the beginning the system worked terribly
nobody was going out everybody was
staying home this is you know we have
this great system how come nobody's
going out so these were Washington
yuppies right so they legislated you
have to go out it's good for you go out
at least once a month get out of the
house didn't work then they brought in a
bright young economist said your problem
is you haven't got enough tokens in the
system so they printed more tokens work
like a charm people started going out
they said well gee if printing some
tokens is good it's got to be even
better to print more tokens they printed
more tokens yes Washington ah the system
crashed nobody went out anymore okay
time out so think about why did nobody
go out at the beginning and why did
people stop going out when they printed
more tokens any intuitions here
everybody's afraid of running out if you
only got one or two tokens of course we
have a zero tokens you can't go out
because you don't if you don't have a
token you can't get somebody to babysit
for you that's the whole point and if
you only have one or two you might be
well gee you know what happens if my mom
gets sick and I really need to go out or
you know there's some special occasion
so it's clear if they're very few tokens
in the system people are afraid of going
out because they're worried about
running out of script now what's the
problem when they printed a whole bunch
of script what went wrong then yeah yeah
so let's make precise why they don't I
mean you're right they don't have any
value why don't they have any value
let's some intuition all right there's a
lot of them they don't want to babysit
anymore they don't need any more that's
exactly
right right in other words if everybody
has 20 tokens say why the hell do i need
to go babysit for somebody else 20
tokens I mean so there's no problem I'm
happy to go out I got 20 tokens but I
don't have anybody who wants to babysit
for me because everybody else has 20
tokens to and they figure they don't
need a 21st okay so in our in our
framework and also in this story which
by the way was based in a real-life
situation that really was Washington
babysitting co-op ah there's no auctions
right so it's not you can say okay i'll
pay you three tokens to babysit so we
have two in so throughout this talk I'll
mention this again at the end because I
think it's an interesting research
question here you have to assume that
the price of a job is fixed one token
for job no bargaining no side payments
that's the market regardless there's no
inflation no nothing follow i'll talk
about that too okay so that's where we
came in we want to understand why do we
want to understand what was the research
question tasks as computer scientists
what's the right amount of money to pump
into the system what's the matter right
amount of script the pumping system if
you say well too little is bad too much
is bad now too little is bad because
people don't have enough they're worried
they're going to run out too much is bad
because everybody has too much they
don't want to babysit well what's the
sweet spot in the middle we want to
understand that okay so that that was
our technical question are we all
together so now I'm going to have some
technical slides which I hope I can
explain well but you understand that's
our motivation that's what we wanted to
oh sorry let's do this again so our
approach we want to develop a micro
economic model think game theory I'm
coming at it from the point of view of
games here I'll explain all this and I
want to try to figure out what the
optimal behavior is for agents in that
model what's the right thing to do if
you're rational and smart understand how
the system works what should you do I
want to show there's a stable outcome
that's a Nash equilibrium I'll explain
what Nash equilibrium is in fact let me
explain it now so this is game theory so
how many people don't know what Nash
equilibria miss it's okay if you don't
know okay so let me explain so I mean
have you heard of the movie A Beautiful
Mind John Nash right you got a Nobel
Prize right this is this is what he got
the prize for who
PhD thesis by the way ah so in game
theory the point is we have a bunch of
strategic agents they all have a
strategy strategy is just what you're
going to do in every situation now we're
going to say a collection of strategies
is an equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium
if everybody is best responding given
what everybody else is doing that even
if I know what all the rest of you are
doing I have no motivation to do
anything else other than what I'm doing
so fix the strategy for everybody we're
going to say that set of strategies that
collection of strategies is an
equilibrium or is a Nash equilibrium if
even if you knew what everybody else was
doing you would have no temptation to
switch to change what you were doing ok
that's enough chakra liberal you have no
it's it's a stable situation because
nobody wants to change what they're
doing it's not necessarily a good
situation you might be totally unhappy
with the equilibrium you're in but
nevertheless you can't do better by
unilaterally changing to something else
okay so we're trying to understand and
Nash equilibrium is imperfect them and I
could give a whole other talk and
problems with Nash equilibria man ways
to get around it but that's not this
talk of it is the case that in many
situations of interest especially people
really understand the system were they
what they end up doing is playing a Nash
equilibria so we wanted to understand
Nash equilibria in this setting with
script systems ok are we together that's
the goal um and we wanted to use the
understanding to maybe tell system
designers how to build better systems
right so here's the formal model it's
not as bad as it looks so let me explain
it intuitively this is some of the math
you're going to get but oh right that
make it easy so our pictures we've got a
bunch of agents in and for the purposes
of this slide let me assume that all
agents are the same and i'll explain in
what way is it the same so in each round
one agent is chosen randomly to make a
request what i mean by making requests
you need babysitting so i'm going to
assume that the need for babysitting
comes from the outside it's not
something you're planning strategically
you wake up one morning
you read in the paper great movie
playing I want to go out right so I want
babysitting tonight so nature chooses
somebody at random and need something to
want babysitting so I think in terms of
babysit now in our general model we
assume that there are different types of
players or some players if you like our
needier than others so if you like what
this is assuming is everybody's equally
likely to want babysitting right but you
can imagine some people tend to want
babysitting more than others i like
going on that's okay we allow that in
the general model but for this talk let
me nada sin that now the one strategic
choice you have is if i say look i need
some babysitting who is willing to
babysit for me tonight raise your hands
that's a strategic choice you might
decide I'm not interested in babysitting
right why might you say I'm not
interested because I have 20 tokens I
don't really wanna a 21st okay so you
have to decide whether or not you want a
baby said well once you've decided out
of all the people raise their hands and
said I'm willing to babysit I'm going to
choose one at random now again in our
general model we assume that the choice
isn't necessarily totally random you
imagine that some people advertise
better than others so if you've got good
advertising you're more likely if you
chosen to somebody who's allows the
advertiser or their reputation effects
but for the purposes of this talk just
to simplify things let's assume you're
chosen at random everybody's equally
likely to get chosen now the rest of it
is the obvious thing when the person who
makes the request gives one token to the
other person so you pays think of a
token as being a dollar but it's funny
money at script and you get one unit of
utility you tell you think of it as a
measure of happiness okay so the person
who gets the babysitting done gets one
unit of utility and the person who does
the babysitting and pays a dollar so
dollars and utilities are not the same
they the tokens are just bookkeeping
what you really care about is happiness
right so you get one unit of happiness
if you get babysitting done for you you
lose alpha units of happiness if you do
babysitting and we're going to sue man
alphas a lot less than 1 otherwise the
system would never get off the ground if
you were if the amount of unhappiness
you incurred by babysitting was more
than
out of happiness you were going to get
by having somebody babies for you of
course you'd never babysit right because
all you're getting is a token and the
how can advise you babysitting in the
future right so babysitting isn't worth
the pain of doing baby sudden would
never do it right so we're going to
assume that you get one unit of
happiness if you babysit and you lose
alpha units of happiness doing the
babysitting but alphas a lot less than
one um everybody else breaks even and of
course you the person who asks to have
the baby seen done has to pay a dollar
to the person who does the baby city but
the dollar is it has nothing to do with
happiness think of it as simply
bookkeeping it's a token okay um and the
other thing we're going to assume is
that there's what's called discounting
so a unit of happiness tomorrow is not
as it as a unit of happiness today right
so i'll pay you back on tuesday for the
daughter you giving me today the dollars
actually works less on tuesday than it's
worth today so we're assuming would so
technically we have a discount factor
delta think of delta is being less than
one but close to one so a dollar today
is worth delta dollars tomorrow so i
think of Delta's point nine delta
squared the next day delta cube the day
after that they'll put forth the day
after that question so I'm yeah I'm told
to repeat question and the question is
why do I assume a delta at all so if you
don't want to assume that thing and
we're going to think of this in time
think of Delta's being very very close
to one but I in fact it seems that in
real life people do assume there's a
delta law so I'm feel act as if there's
a delta less than one they getting
something today is better than getting
the same thing tomorrow so people act so
this seems to be a real psychological
phenomenon it's not like we made it up
now in fact for our results we need to
assume that n is relatively large
although it turns out like a hundred is
good enough as a practical matter and
Delta is pretty close to one okay yeah
so the question is is this independent
of termination effect so in this world
there's no termination people live
forever um stay tuned I mean you'll see
what the results are
say so what I care about think of me as
assistant designer this is the total
utility for an agent so this is saying
fresh round are look at how much utility
you get around our which is either 0 or
1 or negative alpha those are the only
possible utility quantities right if you
get babysitting done for you in round
our than you I are as one if you do
babysitting for somebody else around our
UI r is negative alpha and if you don't
babysit or get babysitting done this is
zero and the Delta they are just says
you know something 10 rounds out you x
del you know Delta to the pimp right so
this is your total utility for me the
system designer what I care about is
maximizing social welfare which is the
social buffer is just going to be the
sum of everybody's utility I want
everybody to be as happy as possible
right I want to design a system or I'm
going to have very high total utility
are we together right so I just add
everybody's utility here i'm waiting
everybody the same way and of course i'm
going to maximize total utility just
keep this back your mind by making sure
that whenever somebody wants babysitting
done they'll have a token to pay for it
and they'll have somebody who's willing
to do babysit so again think of the
Washington babysitting co-op story so
there are two things that can go wrong
if they're very few Toby if you got a
system of 10,000 people and you have 100
tokens and it's clear that most people
most the time don't have a token bad bad
for the point of view is this and
designer who wants to maximize social
welfare because if you don't have very
many tokens even if you have 10,000
people and 20,000 tokens there's a
non-trivial chance somebody won't have a
token right this week you look at
fluctuations right so I want a job done
I don't have a token I'm unhappy I could
have been happier if I had a token to
pay for right conversely if I want a job
done and there's lots of tokens floating
around nobody's going to intuitively I
haven't said why yet but nobody's going
to volunteer I'm also unhappy I have
lots of money to pay for you but you
know nobody is raising their hand right
so I want to maximize to probability and
that's was as you'll see later what's
going to happen is too few tokens in the
system will be bad for social welfare
because a lot of times when somebody
wants a job done they won't have a token
pay for it too many tokens in the system
will be bad for social welfare because a
lot of times when somebody wants a job
done nobody will raise their hand
question sorry ok so again I will repeat
so the question was they could start
asking for five tokens for babysitting
rather than one I'm not allowing that so
in this system prices are fixed now
again it's very interesting to ask what
happens if you allow markets or you can
say look how much how much are you
willing to bid for this job I won't do
it for one but maybe i'll do it for
three right so we're not allowing that
again i claim this is quite realistic
there are many markets in the world
where prices are fixed certainly I go
nasaka where I live mystic hours or
fixed prices for things they're posted
think of all the things that you're
aware of in the world for their fixed
posted prices now I understand there's
other situations where there's
bargaining but bargaining and kearns
overhead right so it's our customers and
producers like it much better when
they're fixed prices again as an
empirical statement there is so again
look this is google google works by by
well you know by bids right and and
market design i understand that and it's
very interesting to ask how things would
change this framework if we allowed
bidding but let me at least claim there
are lots of real-world scenarios whether
there are fixed posted prices so it's
not like we're making up something that
never happens in real world up and loved
me as a technical matter what I'm about
to tell you in this talk says nothing
about what happens when their bid
there's there's sort of auctions for
goods although I'll come back to that at
the end our questions yep you have to
express the question was are my results
robust under a no-trade negative utility
pedal things that they don't understand
what that is well the utilities are just
what I have there so your tail use
either 0 negative alpha or one on each
round and that's there's nothing hidden
that's that's the utility ah yeah
yeah so think of social welfare is
overall happiness which is literally
defined as the sum of everybody's
utility so this is the utility for a
particular agent I so 10,000 agents each
one has their utility just add them all
up that's social over by definition I am
so the question is is this situation and
a result in a situation where a few
people do all the work in practice in
practice we can prove theoretically know
things will be quite uniform but stay
tuned let me get the technical results
so I think at this point i will stop
questions and keep going so our
assumption so let me repeat i was saying
this before freeze of exposition just
and this is not what we assume in the
full paper i've assumed that ages are
homogeneous in the following sense they
have the same cost alpha for performing
work and of course the real world that
might be true but in many cases a might
not so I might love babysitting your
kids by cost for babysitting your kids
is very low or I might hate babysitting
your kids the real brats and and the
kospi highs there's no reason to assume
that all agents feel some people love
babysitting some people hate it um I've
assumed that everybody has the same
property of being chosen if they
volunteer right so among the people
raise your hands I choose at random so
everybody is equal to like I don't have
to us in that I've assumed that
everybody gets the same utility for
having a job done of course the real
world I might love going out to a movie
you might sort of movies are good but
you know I mean I don't mind staying at
home and reading um I've assumed that
everybody uses the same discount fact I
think of discount factor as measuring
your patience so it roughly speaking at
saying you know how patient are you if
you get a dollar today but you're not
going to be able to use it for three
weeks are you okay with that if you have
it so your discount factors between 0
and 1 i'm going to serve the people are
pretty patient discount factors close to
one but a discount factor is close to 0
is saying hey if I don't get to spend my
money right away think of like my kids
when they were young it's not good for
anything right so if I can't spend the
next you know money two days from now is
basically worthless right so that's you
think of a discount factor like a
quarter
you know so a dollar today is worth like
a sixteenth of a dollar tomorrow and his
64th of a doll or three days from now
I'm pretty close to zero so if you're
very impatient your discount factor is
close to zero if you're very patient
your discount factor is very close to
one are we together that that's the
technical content so again i'm assuming
that everybody has the same discount
factor that might not be true and and in
our general model we have what
economists call different types of agent
wear a type is characterized by their
alpha the probability of being chosen
they do know who gets all these five
factors of we have a number for each of
them and that tuple of five numbers
characterized as an agent but and again
let me repeat I've said it three times I
think the price of a job is fixed so so
there's been other work some of it based
on our work so hens at all did their
work independently their economists
slightly different model they assume
that there is no cost for volunteering
that is babysitting you know no pain at
all ah but they assume that agency
utilities change over time we don't and
they ascend ages choose where to provide
service request service Rob that's they
have a slightly different model but
again they're investigating script
systems operate I sand and johari
actually had a paper that followed on
two hours but their focus was in finding
equilibrium prices which are it's isn't
but I mean you this scholar and telling
the but other work ah so back to what we
were doing we were interested in what
seems to be the most natural kind of
strategy which is you have a threshold
and the way you think about the
threshold so suppose my threshold for
seven dollars why should I work you know
under what circumstances will I work
what's the intuition so again let me ask
you to make sure that we're all on the
same page here what would induce you to
raise your hand if somebody says I need
a babysitter yeah sorry you know you
have something coming up on this model
you don't remember your chosen at random
but you can figure out the probability
that you'll have something covered
coming up but but why am i one person be
more likely to raise their hand in
another yeah yeah lest bus tokens right
so basically the intuition is if you
have very few tokens you're nervous
why are you nervous suppose you have two
tokens you're nervous that you might
want something three times in a row
before you get a chance to I mean
raising your hand doesn't guarantee that
you're going to get work right raising
your hand just says I'm one of the 25
people raised their hand I probably won
over 25 of being chosen right so
intuitively you're you you volunteer for
a job if you feel like you're running
low whatever that means and that's what
we're going to be talking about at what
point do I start getting nervous when do
I stop feeling like I'm running low on
and if you feel like you have a lot of
money you don't raise your hand so
that's the way you're thinking you're
following a threshold strategy so a
threshold strategy says I have a
threshold let's say of seven dollars and
what that means is if I have less or
seven tokens if I have less than seven
tokens I volunteer if I have seven or
more I don't are we together that seems
like the most natural strategy you have
some fixed threshold very easy to
implement obviously in a computer system
you have some fixed threshold it says
below that I raised my hand above that I
don't ok that's the threshold stretch oh
I did it again two buttons are sudden
you know better human factors so you
know why do I want to satisfy stuff and
why don't I do this is just an argument
for threshold if I have lots of money I
don't raise my hand if I'm running short
I if I'm running short I do raise my
right yeah
right so again there so the questions do
all the ages have prior independent
alphas and the answers they all have the
same alpha right I in the general model
they don't so in the general model part
of your type or personalities your alpha
and we allow for finitely many types it
could be very large number of agents but
it might be seven types of Ages so your
type is characterized by five numbers
one of them as the Alpha and sorry your
second question was what about auctions
so the questions do they have insight
into the success of prior auctions in a
precise sense as we'll see they don't
have to okay so if the answer is it's
irrelevant but let me make that process
okay so everybody understands a
threshold strategy you understand why
sort the obvious thing to do so
threshold strategy let me call it s K is
volunteer if I have less than K dollars
so think of K is your comfort level and
so the question we're asking technically
is it reasonable ah not my phone your
phone I feel like the airline pilot that
says you know ever should turn off your
cell phones right so is it reasonable to
play the threshold strategy and how does
this is behave if everyone plays the
threshold strategy the way we're going
to formalize that we're going to prove
that there's a Nash equilibrium where
everybody plays a threshold strategy
actually there's an easy Nash equilibria
where everybody plays a threshold
strategy that's where everybody plays
the threshold strategy of 00 a threshold
strategy of zero says you never
volunteer because you volunteer I if you
have less than zero dollars and you'll
never have less than zero dollars right
so that's a threshold strategy where K
is zero that's a special case okay is
zero I and I claim if everybody plays
the strategy s0 or which is never
volunteer that's an equilibrium why is
in equilibrium well I claim if I'm never
been if none of you ever going to
volunteer the best thing for me to do is
not the volunteer why should I volunteer
well if I volunteer you will happily you
know so you need babysitting if I say
okay yes I'm going to do you say great
i'll take you babysit here's a token
okay now you have a token what can you
do with the token well next time you
want babies and you
say oh who wants to volunteer but all
the rest of you are never volunteering
what good is my token doing okay so
clearly if everybody else is following
the strategy of never volunteer my best
response is never volunteer so there is
a Nash equilibrium where nobody ever
volunteers that's obviously not very
interesting so we're interested in the
question of is there and non-trivial
equilibrium a threshold k where
everybody plays k and they're happy with
that and k is not zero right and and how
does it behave and you'll see it does
very interesting things so you would ask
you know do you know what other people
are doing in the success of let me sort
of start addressing that question so
here are some technical stuff so bear
with me a few seconds I think I can
explain this and there is not much of it
anyway but I think it's real cool so ah
I don't care I'll see how many people
heard of maximum entropy if you don't
know what it is I'm Rico at least heard
of it fair number of you okay so it
turns out that that I'll explain it I
understand you know it the maximum
entropy characterizes the distribution
of money in the system and knowing that
we can use that to prove that there is
not technically in nash equilibria but
an epsilon Nash equilibria so what I'm
Nash equilibria says given what
everybody else is doing what I'm doing
is a best response epsilon says what I'm
doing is a best response to within a
very small epsilon like there might be
something I could do that's better but
it can't be more think of epsilon as
being like point zero zero one it's not
going to be more than epsilon better so
if i don't want to spend hours thinking
about what's the best thing to do i'm
happy with just playing my threshold
strategy or may be out there there's
something a bit better but it's not
going to get one you can make epsilon as
small as you want as it happens um so I
mentioned that there is also a Nash
equilibrium if everybody plays a
threshold of zero never volunteering but
it's not interesting now here's the
interesting thing for system designers
what we're going to show is so no matter
how much money there is in the system
there is an equilibrium but now it turns
out as you pump more and more money into
the system start at zero
put more money into the system Social
Welfare improves right so if your
assistant designer you want to pump more
and more money into the system up until
a certain critical point so again going
back to Washington babysitting co-op
story you can see that if you start with
zero dollars that means nobody can ever
do any babysitting cuz they have no
tokens putting more money into the
system that increases social welfare
people are going to be happier they're
gonna be able to pay for babysitting
until you get to a certain point where
there's lots of money floating around
the system and nobody's going to want to
volunteer right that's the intuition but
what we show is it's a critical point so
things get better and better and better
and better till there's a crash and it's
a sharp crash it's like you fall off a
cliff so if your assistant designer
there's sort of a magic amount of money
all that matters it turns out is the
average amount of money per person so
there's a particular number like seven
if your assistant designer independent
of the number of people in the system
you want to have an average of seven
dollars per person in the system you
want to get as close to that as you can
but if you have a little bit more than
that so putting in more and more money
after you get the seven makes things
better and better and better the total
amount of happiness in the system keeps
increasing I'll continue get to this
clip point then you fall off the cliff
and then nobody is ever going to
volunteer anymore and people are
extremely unhappy no babysitting gets
done at all right so now this assumes of
course there everybody's totally
rational now of course in the real world
even if you totally understand this is
not everybody's rations of our assistant
designer I wouldn't push my luck and go
all the way to seven or even point six
nine nine nine six point nine nine nine
you want to back off a bit and I'll talk
about that later in the talk but this is
the lesson for system designers that
there is a magic number which is the
average amount of money per person and
that's what you want to hit well you
don't exactly want to hit it you
probably the real world want to get
fairly close but not you don't want to
push your luck right but if you go over
it the system will crash very bad crash
in the sense of nobody will ever
volunteer are we together so that's what
the mathematics is telling they've
actually observed this phenomenon in the
real world
thinkin second life lecture if somebody
knows more about this I mean somebody
mentioned this me after talking it
actually observed a second life is it
because a a game right and apparently as
phenomena hasn't been observed so we can
sort of simulate it but but it happens
ok next few slides are technical bear
with me if you're totally
non-mathematical is probably maybe timed
it out but I will try to make it as
accessible as possible and then we'll
get back to what what we learned from
this ok so formally we can view the
system is what's called a Markov chain a
Markov chain ok let me know how many
people have heard of Markov chains for a
number ok but even though i'll try to
make sense this so markov chain consists
of a collection of states and
transitions between states so if you're
in this state you'll move to another
state with a certain probability so
think of it as as what we call a graph
so a bunch of nodes and nodes of the
state's the states are connected by
edges and the edges have probabilities
on them and the way to think about this
if you're at this node you look at where
the edges are going each to edge is
labeled with a number that's a
probability to some of the numbers is
one and says you know the probably a
third you're going here with a probably
a quarter you're going here with
probability whatever Club 512 you're
going over here Thank so each of the
edges is labeled with a number that's a
probability that's a markov change that
will tell you it doesn't tell you
exactly what's going to happen you can
sort of figure out how likely is the
each path right you know if I'm here I'm
going to go here then I'm going to go
here what's the probability this right
that's a Markov chain on and you can so
what are the states the states are just
a tuple that describes how much money
each agent halves so imagine I've got a
thousand agents and I've got two
thousand dollars in the system 2000
hokan's estate just describes how those
two thousand popkins are split up
between the agents you've got three
you've got to you've got 27 you're
sitting there with 300 of them a bunch
of people have zeros okay that's that's
a state who has how much light are we
together now if you're in a certain
state what's the probability of moving
to another state well the only other
state I can move to if I'm talking about
tokens is one person gets one more token
and somebody else gets one less token
that's the only move that I'm allowed
right so if you have three
and you need babysitting done and you
volunteered then one of your 300 is
going over him you have 299 and you have
what have you had plus one are we
together those are the state transitions
but there are lots of possible
transitions because somebody is chosen
at random so everybody is equally likely
to be chosen to want babysitting now I
can't tell you what the transition
function is until I tell you what
strategy everybody's following so
suppose we fix everybody else at
following at spread a threshold of seven
let's say once I fix everybody else at
following a threshold of seven then I
can describe this as a markup changes i
guess i look with equal likelihood each
one of you is going to be chosen who
wants something for in a particular
state remember state is a tuple saying
how much money everybody okay so with if
there's 200 of you here with probably
one over 200 mark has chosen to want
something if he has greater than zero
dollars he can say okay who's going to a
job if he has zero that's it he's chosen
but nothing happens so it's probably one
we stay in the same state of he's chosen
but otherwise everybody who has less
than seven dollars will volunteer
because they all have we all have a
threshold 27 so everybody with fewer
than seven dollars will volunteer and
one of them has chosen at random through
the job and marks money goes down by a
dollar and whoever shows new job their
money goes up by dollar that's the
transition so it's easy once we know
everybody else's strategy we everybody
else's threshold to compute the
transitions is that clear I mean even
you can understand there's no deep math
going on that's the Markov chain right
now a key fact about this Markov chain
is if you run it for a while you just
keep doing you know nature chooses
somebody random you see what happens
what's going to happen after a while and
this is just as a whole there's books
and books on on markov theory so i'll
explain why this happens you're going to
end up in a situation where each state
is equally likely this is a standard you
know like theorem 2 and there's any
standard book of markov chains i'm not
going to prove it but I'll it but the
key observation is the transitions are
symmetrical what I mean by that and that
I
we'll explain is that the probability of
going from state 1 to state 2 is exactly
the same as they're probably of coming
back and state to to state 1 now explain
why in a second that's up so then we'll
open up your favorite book on markov
chains and there's lots and you know one
of the theorem says in any situation
where the properties are symmetric after
a while you end up in a situation where
all states are equally likely so let me
explain the symmetry so again symmetry
means that the probability of going from
state 1 to state 2 is exactly the same
as the problem coming back from two to
one but what's the probability of going
from state want to state to remember the
only states i'm interested in is ones
where i have the transition means i have
a dollar less unless they still has a
dollar more those are the only possible
transitions right so let's look at a
situation where I'm the one who wanted
babysitting done so that happened with
property 1 over n that I was chosen and
let's look at all the people I again I
fix the threshold let's say at seven so
let's fix all the people have seven
dollars or let so I have less than seven
dollars they're going to volunteer and
Stuart is one of them and each one is
equally likely get chosen so the
probability of making that transition is
1 over n times 1 over m where m is the
number of volunteers what's the
probability of coming back well as the
probably that Stuart is chosen to want
babysitting which is 1 over N and the
probability that I get chosen that I
volunteer and I get chosen but in the
long run if the threshold that
everybody's playing is K once after a
while nobody will ever have more than K
dollars because if you had more than K
you're going to come down to K you'll
never volunteer till your ad payer below
and you'll never go above k so after the
system is employed you see that so if
the threshold is seven you might start
out life I don't care how you saw our
life you might not start Sara like fifty
dollars but if everybody is playing a
threshold of seven well you'll have 50
then you'll want something done you want
4940 you'll never volunteer to your
below seven and once you're below seven
you'll never rise above it so after some
initial period I don't care what say we
started out in will be in a situation
where nobody has more than seven right
so
let me talk about again why the
probability is 1 over in one of them
coming back so again the problem of me
wanting something is 1 over N and Stuart
being chosen as one of ram that means
that M people had seven dollars or less
and less than seven dollars well coming
back was the probably Stuart pink chosen
that's 1 over N and what's the
probability that there's going to be a
volunteer well there's one fewer
volunteers Stuart but there's one more
volunteer that's me and I will have less
than M dollars because even if I had em
before I give Stuart of dollars i have
left them so it's the same one over N
times what is exactly the same
volunteers when I wanted a job done is
when Stuart wants a job done except that
before Stuart volunteered and I didn't
because you won't volunteer for yourself
and now I'm volunteering the stewardess
so it's trivial and as I say um there's
this theorem which i'm not going to
prove that says if you have that
situation all states are equally likely
seems good we understand the sister
fight there's 15 problem oh god they're
digging you can see I'm a high-tech kind
of guy uh so I don't care about exactly
how much money steward has and exactly
how much money mark hasn't exactly how
much money ma Liam has I really care
about the distribution of money what
fraction of people where I really care
about is what fraction of people have
less than K dolls why do I care what
fraction people have less than K dollars
why should I care about that sorry well
I love else could be a more practical
answer why do I care about the number
three what was the a dollars it tells me
the number of volunteers and why do I
care about that yeah so look I'm trying
to figure out so so suppose all the rest
of you are following threshold strategy
k I'm trying to figure out what I should
do I'm noise I'm not going to affect
anything but so I'm trying to figure out
my best response all the rest of you are
clamped at following a threshold
strategy of seven are we together and
I'm going to figure out what I should do
in response well what should I be
comfortable should I set my threshold of
10 should I set my threshold of three
what's the right number well what I want
to know is what's my competition if I
volunteer I mean what I need to figure
out you know here I'm sitting there with
with 10 tokens and is that a good number
or not you know should I feel
comfortable having 10 tokens well what
do I need to know to figure it out well
what I need to know is how likely am I
to run out of tokens before I can
replenish right if I'm worried that I'm
going to run out of tokens before I can
before you know in other words I'm
worried I'm going to be chosen to want
something 11 times before I get a chance
to volunteer and be chosen are we
together because then I'll be unhappy
right of course if I mean there's always
it's always possible that I get chosen
11 times in a row I mean this is random
it could be coin lands heads you know 11
x 0 but I have to figure how likely that
is right so what I have to figure out
are we to get is the probability that
all be chosen 11 times before I get a
chance to make a token right that's what
I'm interested but now I claim so I need
to know what my competition is going to
be like when I volunteer now if all the
rest of you are following a strategy a
threshold strategy 07 my competition is
exactly the number of people who have
less than seven dollars does that make
sense that's why I want to understand so
I don't care whether it's Stewart who
volunteers or David who volunteers or
Marco volunteers I don't care who
volunteers I just want to know how many
of you volunteer write the names that
people volunteer is totally irrelevant
so I don't want to know who has five
dollars new has three dollars i want to
know what fraction of people have five
dollars and three dollars in six dot
well actually all I really care about is
what fraction that people have less than
seven dollars are we together that's the
technical point here about that you're
you're in good shape so um now look at
what happens suppose we have imaged
suppose I tell you there are two dollars
in the system well what could happen it
could be your the agents one person has
the two dollars how many ways are there
for that to happen to remember your
comment works from high school given
agents how many ways are there that one
of them has two dollars not very hard
and ways
right okay the other possibility is
those two dollars one person or two
different people each have a dollar
price I'm thinking how could the two
dollars be spread or mounting system
well either one person has both dollars
or two different people each have one
dollar how many ways are there for two
different people to have a doll remember
this from high school and choose to n
times n minus 1 over 2 so n choose 2
that's how you choose to people out of n
to have a dollar is about n squared it's
n squared over 2 or n times n minus 1
over 2 so there's n ways that one person
has two dollars in choose two ways that
two people each have a dollar and choose
to is much bigger than n N squared is
much bigger than an for large values of
n so it's far more likely that if I have
two dollars in the system that each of
two people will each have a dollar then
the one person has two dollars now that
generalizes and in fact this is an
instance what business is called a
concentration phenomenon and and okay
here's the match though skip the math
because I'm getting close to seven
thirty but I can so what Maksym entropy
does so given it okay let me say a
little bit given a distribution mu so
think of mu of I as being the number of
agents that have I dollars the fraction
of age instead of idols is interview if
suppose n is 200 if 18 of you have three
dollars that means nine percent of you
have three dollars so mu of three would
be 0 point 0 9 99 / one sonu of I is the
fraction of ages of I dollars now the
entropy of the function of the
distribution you this is 0 this is the
entropy function has new dialogue move I
so it's the fraction of agents that have
three dollars I'm quagga the fraction of
Ages to have three dollars and some data
put a minus sign in front that's the
entropy of a distribution of for those
who are familiar with it that's what it
is if not don't worry about it but it
turns out that this is the key the key
mathematical fact that the number of
agents if the product there are lots of
different ways to distribute n dollars a
ma
sorry distribute capital n dollars like
ten thousand dollars among 500 people
less if one person could have five
thousand one person could have a zero
right elastic are all ways of doing it
but it turns out that ways that have it
end up having a distribution money
that's very close to the entropy
distribution a maximum at cementery
distribution dominate all other ways so
that the number of ways is characterized
the likelihood of having the
distribution of money be characterized
by probably mu is characterized by the
entropy of new a distribution with the
greatest entropy or distribution as
close to that are far far more likely
than anything else what does that mean
in practice this is an answer to your
question but why don't have to know
anything about previous auctions I know
if n is reasonably large yes so as long
as I know how much money is in
circulation if n is reasonably large
then I know almost for sure like with
probably you know um you know in 9999
circumstances out of 10,000 very very
close to one I know for sure what
fraction of agents have zero dollars
what fraction of Ages have one dollar
what fraction of agents have P dollars
well vary within a very small fudge
factor of f spot it's characterized by
the distribution to maximize entropy
that maximizes this expression sorry
this expression of this the entropy
stretches the distribution that
maximizes the entropy is the one that
almost surely characterizes the fraction
of agents that have each bearing amount
money so I don't have to know anything
else I know what my competition is gonna
be like I know how many people are going
to if the threshold of seven I know
almost for sure like I would bet huge
sums of money on it you're much safer
betting on this and crossing the street
that's how sure you are how many agents
are going to volunteer new trend I don't
know who they are so I don't know which
agents have three dollars which ones
have five dollars but I know which how
what fraction of agents will have three
dollars what fraction will have five
dollars in a particular virtual in the
seventh what fraction will have less
that
votes so I know what my competition is
going to be one I know every time I
raised my hand always for sure how many
other people are going to raise their
hands each round is going to be 112
people raising their hand almost for
sure different people are we together
that's sort of the power of mathematics
here so i can now figure out it's a
fairly straightforward computation what
my threshold out to be it's the point
where the likelihood of you know the
cost of not raising my hand exceeds the
cost of raising my end other words i
wait well how likely is if i'm going to
run out of money if I pin and tokens how
likely will I run out knowing what my
competitions like I can figure out how
likely I am to be chosen to become Ares
my hand I can figure out how many times
it's going to be before I run out of
money with all property because I have
the complete probabilistic model I can
figure out what's the right amount of
tokens I should if I'm going to do a
best response okay that's what this
tells me now here's a sanity check even
if you don't understand any of the
mathematics suppose so what I've done
now is I said clamp everybody at
following a threshold with seven now
suppose I change that and said clamp
everybody at following a threshold of
ten should my threshold go up or down
what's your intuition so if I know all
the rest of you are following a
threshold of n compared to seven so I
figured out my best response let's say
my best response if you're following the
threshold of seven the right thing for
me to do is to have ten toes right
suppose I raised your threshold to 10 so
you're going to you're going to raise
your hand as long as you have 10 tokens
or less should I raise my threshold or
lower my threshold or no clue or any
intuitions raised why okay let's make it
a bit more precise I mean you're sort of
right so that's the right answer if
other people are raising their threshold
I should raise my threshold but why
there's a really good intuitive answer
anybody else yeah you will have more
competitors that was exactly the right
answer
right if everybody else is raising their
hand before they were all raising the
hand if they had less than seven dollars
now they're raising their hand if they
have less than ten dollars you have to
be a little bit careful because if the
threshold is ten the distribution
changes because before the only had
amounts between 0 and seven now they
have announced between zero again so
there's a slight subtlety here but
nevertheless is the case it's not hard
to show that if everybody is raising
their threshold to 10 you're going to
have more competition than when the
threshold was seven so you ought to
raise your threshold so the best
response function your best response
function is a function of what everybody
else is threshold is is increasing yea
though it's not raising their price it's
raising when they're willing to
volunteer raise their threshold it's not
a price right the price is always one
token there's no change in price so it's
raising your comfort level before you
were willing to you're only going to
volunteer provides you with the second
seven tokens now you're going to
volunteer here fewer than 10 tablets is
that oh yeah we shouldn't I mean let's
just stick to think about tokens or not
not priced so so using this what happens
is there's so there's a theorem for the
technically oriented there's a theorem
by famous mathematician named alfred
tarski that more or less says if you
have a monotonic function so the best
response function which is what should i
do given what you're doing so you is
everybody else so if I know everybody
else is best response is 7 what what's
my best response I know everybody else's
clamp it n what's my best response every
time to 15 what's my best response that
best response function is monotonic as
if as I raise what everybody else is
threshold is my threshold my best
response goes up if you have a monotonic
function there's a fixed point a fixed
point means everybody else is doing 12
my best responses 12 that's an
equilibrium in other words if
everybody's playing 12 their best
responding everybody else playing 12 so
you
I know that all the rest of you are
playing 12 as 12 is a fixed point then
I'm playing the best response that
that's a Nash equilibria so this theorem
basically says that there's as long as
Delta is close to 1 and and there's
enough agents enough turns out to be
like 100 then this is basically saying
that there's an epsilon best reply
that's a threshold strategy and the best
reply functions monotonic and from that
we can conclude that that there's a
greatest least fixed point and we can
find the fixed point by iterating well
let me skip over this let me jump the
punch line that we have a Nash
equilibrium and threshold strategies but
this is what I was saying before how
much money suppose you know that so you
know no matter your the system designer
no matter how much money you pump into
the system there's a threshold that's
good there's a there's a magic number
like 12 that the agents can actually
learn by just playing and discovering
distressed responding to each other they
can figure out what the best response is
so there is a Nash equilibrium we're all
going to play 12 we're all going to be
happily play 12 and it's non-trivial one
again it's national living through all
pie threshold of 0 that's not
interesting but there's a non-trivial
Nash equilibrium hob but that hasn't
answered the question that you know
what's the right amount of money to pump
into the system and and they're of the
key is this is this is the third you
know we did experiments we can actually
both prove this mathematically an
observer by simulation that as you pop
more and more money assistant to look at
the toe happinesses remember you're
totally happy you increase happiness by
making sure that when somebody wants a
job done they have money following this
threshold strategy they're unlikely to
run out of money again it's always
possible to run out using a threshold of
10 always possible to 10 times in a row
very quickly you'll you'll you'll want a
job done before you get a chance to make
an extra dollars it's possible but
unlikely as you pump more money more
money to the system that likelihood goes
down but then you want to worry that
that will it be the case that people
will volunteer and so there's a magic
threshold where people all of a sudden
stop volunteering that was a surprise
that was a clip
it happens all of a sudden that you
reach this magic number of people stop
volunteering and this says something so
now let me talk about system design
issues i'll try to finish up the next
five minutes or so Bob ya know so we're
looking at we're not clamping the
threshold we're looking at what's the
best what's the equilibrium and the
equilibria what changes you pump money
if this is right so I'm not now i'm not
sending the threshold now i'm assuming
everybody is a rational agent they're
all going to play a nash equilibrium so
if I you know otherwise if I said
everybody at seven you might think well
gee why should I place that 12 is better
for me right so you want that the
equilibrium is everybody's playing 12
and that's also the best response 12 is
the best response to everybody playing
12 and I make a sense of silica not so
happy so look so let me say okay so what
I'm claiming is there's a unique
technically greatest fixed point so once
you fix the money supply there is a
magic number that you can compute and I
can even give you the procedure but let
me not do that now that gives you a
fixed point that is there is a magic
threshold let me say 12 but it's not
well but it is a function the money
supply and the number of agents what
really matters it turns out is not the
money supply the number of Ages
separately it's the average amount of
money per person right so it's the money
supply divided by the number of HS that
turns out to be the key parameter the
only parameter that matters but once you
fix that so for every average amount of
money per person once you fix that
there's a magic threshold what we say 12
but it's not such that that's the
greatest fixed point so it's everybody
playing 12 is a best response everybody
else playing 12 and there might be other
fixed points but they'll be small older
than 12 so it's so that's what we're
looking at but that was assuming that
the system size was fixed okay now
imagine a real world system is dynamic
people enter and leave right and
particular you're interested in systems
were lots of people are coming in you
have a growing peer-to-peer
system right you're doing this as you
know you want people to do jobs free
this really happens in real systems
right it's not like I'm making it up um
and the system grows and now you say
well okay I'm in system designer what's
my goal well what I've learned from this
talk is what I want to keep is the
average amount of money preferred a
virgin mount of money for person fix so
if the right average amount of money was
let's say seven so if another 200 people
enter the system I want to pop 1,400
more tokens into the system right so I
don't want to do with the babysitting
co-op didn't pump closet opens in for no
good reason there's a magic number but
of course if more people join the coop
then you want to increase now what's the
right way of doing this your system is
on plus a one obvious way of doing this
is ok every time somebody comes in the
system you give them seven dollars ah
why is that not a good idea on the
internet I know your assistant designer
and you want to keep the average amount
of money per person fixed at seven and
now your system is growing you've just
had a thousand people joining the system
this really happens and and and you know
you could say ok one way to keep the
average amount of money it was seven
dollars before make sure each person
company and get seven dollars of course
the average look at himself why is that
a bad idea zombies 2 accounts you're all
saying the same thing as phone right
it's called the Civil problem in that's
that's the technical terminology but
it's you know I come in I get my seven
dollars I ask for seven jobs now I'm
down to zero no problem i leave my twin
brother comes in gets the seven dollars
and and and spends the seven dollars and
leaves but then I also have a triplet
you know I've had the sister out there
she comes in gets seven dollars spends
at all movies this is the you know
zombie is simple problem many people in
terminal Bob so that's a very bad idea
if your assistant design so what do you
do instead redistribute you bring so
what we suggest is bring people in with
zero how do you raise you know if so
suppose the system doubles in size right
before you had a thousand I you have two
thousand eight you want to bring in a
new thousand people with zero dollars
otherwise you're going to get the Civil
problem zombie problem but you still
want to keep the average amount of money
at seven dollars per person
well you just give everybody double the
amount of money they had right the
people who are there before new people
get zero so um we have inflation here
yes but but you still keep the average
amount of money at seven dollars per
person and that that turns out to be
what you want you want to keep the
average right or equivalently you have
the price of a job notice of giving
everybody twice as much money as they
had before effectively is saying the
price of a job used to be taller now
it's 50 cents yeah that would be another
way of doing it then again this would
tell you what would be the right price
to set it at to solve the zombie problem
right so you could say cost seven
dollars to enter the system and good and
i'm going to give you seven dollars
right so that that would be another way
of doing it would maintain the average
amount of money at seven but you have no
temptation although it turns out you do
and I'll come back to that debt to have
to have zombies right are we together I
mean this is the kind of thing assistant
for ants the thing but Samuel right so
you got to think about these things as a
systems person and and the hope is that
that the number of people are entering
is relatively small relative the number
of people there so what it means is when
you'd answer you'd have to do some work
okay so maybe you know now you have to
I'm not denying what you're saying um so
you need to think maybe the right thing
to do is charge a small amount to enter
I mean you know you can't win here so if
you give everybody seven dollars then
you're going to have a simple problem
and otherwise but so we didn't uh
because we we didn't have exponential
growth and in our simulation right so
again these are things you do so I we
didn't do it and I think as assistants
person you clearly have to do it so let
me just do one or two slides I know I'm
over seven thirty so let me try to
finish off quickly Bob now in the real
world as I said not everybody's rational
now these are tokens
there's no happiness value associated
these tokens right you don't die happy
if you have a million-dollar stuffed
under your mattress I'm told um but uh
you know in the real world there are
people who like to have money for the
sake of having money let me call them
orders and there's other people who are
also a soup I love babysitting your kids
you don't have to pay me I know you're
because it's just so great I'll do it
for free but we call those altruist
seeeeee so I mean I think there are many
types of irrational behavior I'm not
trying to suggest irrational only in the
sense that that they're not treating
these as just your tokens right I don't
want to say necessarily also it's a
really irrational quarters are really
irrational but they're rational mark
just give me one difference from the
point of view of I know I'm over time
from the point of view of our framework
in the system right but my guess is that
that in the real world you'll find I'm
in all sorts of different flavors of
irrationality but a few rather common
flavors of rationality and I'm
suggesting hoarding and altruism are
going to be fairly common flavors of
irrationality so it turns out that
hoarding has the effect of removing
money from the system so if you
understand that ten percent of the
people in the world are going to be
orders well so what happens now is that
critical point just move over a little
bit you should pump a bit more money in
the system and that turns out to be just
right mathematically as well as
intuitively does that make sense i mean
basically putting the money in your
mattress is taking the money out of the
system well so you put in a bit more
money the system to compensate now
altruist have the opposite effect sort
of but it's a bit more complicated uh
roughly they're like adding money the
systems are going to do work for free
having some altruist in the system makes
everybody bitter off so if I know
there's like ten people out there who
work for free what you great because
those few times when you know with very
very low probability I ran out of money
you're there to babysit for me because
you just love my kids and you're going
to do it for free great I'm social
welfare increases right you like
babysitting my kids didn't hurt you and
and you know my I'm happier right so q
ql to us are good grantor through that's
right your call grandparents um but too
much money can too many can hurt social
welfare
let me give you the entire i can give
you the graph but but but so this is
what happens yeah a doll trust the
system things get better and better but
then there's a crash any intuition for
the crash and i can give it to you but
does anybody have a sense for again real
world phenomenon has a real world
explanation why should having and this
actually I can I mean in the academic
world I can give you a phenomenon like
this if you think there's a lot of
people are willing to referee a paper
some you any thoughts exactly so suppose
I'm perfectly rational and I say hey why
should I work to get a token there's a
bunch of guys out there who are willing
to babysit for me for nothing right now
it's not true so actually this only
makes sense when we assume that so you
know slightly more complicated model
well you don't always volunteer even if
even if you're an altruist or even if
you need the money let's say friday
night i'd love to volunteer sorry i
can't for some probably beta I'm busy
and I just can't volunteer so we've
assumed in this paper that beta is one
that as long as you have less than your
threshold amount of money you'll
volunteer for sure but in our more
general result we assume the desert
probability or even if you're an
altruist or even if you need the money
it won't volunteer because hey you're
busy or your you know in the real world
in a real systems world right now as it
happens you don't have the spare cycles
to do the job right it's just a busy
time all right so we assume that was
some property data you won't volunteer
even if normally you would right well in
that case imagine there's a bunch of
people are altruist and I say why should
I volunteer because when I want
something done there is a good chance
that somebody out there is an altruist
and will do it for free now
unfortunately that chance isn't high
enough so there'll be I mean it's still
not worth it for me to volunteer but
there'll be a bunch of times where I'm
going to want something done and I'm not
going to you know they're simply won't
be a volunteer so in a system that's
tuned right with no all tourists you can
be better off than in a system where
there are altruist because in terms of
total social welfare there'll be kinds
of when you know i'm just going to half
of this is ugly out there volunteering
for all right and we can do this by
simulation but that's the intuition okay
just about done symbols have some
so remember symbols are these zombies so
you can stop Sybil's you know what you
can stop the obvious civil attack by
saying okay you come in with zero dollar
so it looks like you have no incentive
to bring in sales ah not so fast you do
have an incentive to bring it's Sybil's
provided that so suppose you raise your
hands now suppose I had five siblings
now and suppose okay I tell all my
Sybil's or just me right with different
IP addresses or something okay I need a
job all of us raise our hands and of
course if any one of us is chosen it's
like I do the work and I get the token
right if we can do that and again
whether or not we can do that depends on
features the system and I'm not really
talking about that but if we can do that
that means having Sybil's I can arrange
us on my probability of getting chosen
as higher than it would be without
civils does that make sense you know
having a simple just double my
probability of getting chosen is now
they're two hands going up said one
right so it works if I have symbols and
nobody else does of course then we get
an arms race everybody has symbols right
if everybody has another Civil I'm you
know right back where I started right so
you know there's all sorts of issues
here so it turns out that that again we
can we can show by simulation and I
can't remember we actually add a theorem
about this that the symbols have
diminishing returns like even if nobody
else is going to have Sybil's two
symbols that help three symbols helps
but you know more suppose help us but
the amount helps goes down pretty
rapidly so it seems to me in this kind
of a situation where you probably do
want to charge a little bit to enter the
system even if you going to come in with
zero but again this is this is a systems
question not a theoretical question a
few symbols can be good let me let me
skip this so we have other results and
how you infer the types of agents you
know what's your alpha what's your beta
the probability that that you'll be able
to work even if you want to so if we
have different kinds of agents unlike
this rice and every was homogeneous
it turns out we can infer that which is
something that that marketers want to do
from the distribution of wealth I we
sort of understand how the system is
going to evolve over time so you have
some answers your question about
convergence time it turns out that in
general most of all equilibrium
even a threshold strategy but the one
that we looked at always the greatest
equilibria the greatest fixed point that
has those properties these are technical
results for those interested in them one
thing we looked at is the advancing the
very last thing I want to say is that we
said well how hard is it to learn what
to do right it's not like somebody tells
you a the right threshold the play is 12
right you're entering the system how do
you know well it turns out again
precisely if you don't have this
inflating your ex exponential growth if
the amount of growth in the system is
relatively small so you have relatively
few new entrants for the amount of
people there you can learn the right
thing to do simply by experiment right
cuz you know let me try 10 let me try 11
let me try 12 let me try it 15 para
little experimentation will get the
right place this works if most people in
the system know what to do so they're
not experimented but now if you have a
bunch of people entering the system and
they're all experimenting at the same
time totally breaks down you get chaotic
behavior you get really weird stuff we
don't totally understand what's going to
happen hob so we do provide some
theoretical results for learning large
anonymous systems um I'm not sure it it
depends very very much of what you
assume how about how it you know I can
make it converge if I make enough
assumption so yes but but I'm not going
to try to tell you those assumptions are
all reasonable ah no because we're still
keeping the price of a job so the
question is is equivalent to an auction
or key right so let me just stop and
then I'll you know so the mark won't
feel like I'm abusing everybody's time
here so just to summarize that it turns
out mathematically rather amazingly like
sudden we certainly didn't expect this
actually the way we got here is I had he
and who is my student I'm do simulations
simulations was saying there really is a
nice best reply function there really is
a knife olivium and it felt like there
must be something going on
mathematically and it's sort of I've
done other work where I use max I'm
entropy and somehow I sort of sterilize
it this sort of feels like the other
work Ian go think about it that's what
we have students
and it turned out magic back
symmetrically work so I don't want to
say that boy we were so brilliant we do
all the stuff was going to happen we
really did it and I'm ass irritation I
usually start by proving theorems this
is a problem the first paper in my life
but I started by telling us to do
simulations I don't really have a good
sense of what's going to happen the
simulation showed we were getting really
wrapped convergence with about a hundred
agents and it looked like there was a
nice iquilibrium of threshold strategies
and we said god this is happening every
time there must be some theorem here
that explains what's going on so then we
proved the theorem but but you no it
didn't I told the story not the way it
happens of course now that I'm giving
the talk I tell you about the theorem
and I explain it but that's not how it
happened but so so a theoretician it's
sort of nice that you can totally
characterize what's going on in the
system for a fixed number of agents
using maximum entropy and using the
monofin invest five functions as a
technical meet for the paper here but if
you don't follow that to worry about it
for the system designer the message here
is is the right quantity to manage the
only question you care about is the
average amount of money per person um
and more money is better up to a point
but that point the critical point is a
cliff there and you might want to trade
off efficiency for some robustness want
to back off from the cliff just a teeny
bit we can sort of understand how to
deal with with sort of standard if you
like standard irrational behavior like
hoarders and altruists and with civils
but i think there's a lot more to be
done and and one of the things that i
think i would really like to do so let
me just close what this is understand
the impact of auction so people are
asking the beginning you know shouldn't
you have options and my intuition says
it depends on the kind of market if you
have a market with many buyers and
sellers auctions or buy you much or as
you have rather small specialized
auctions markets options the right thing
to do now that's as an intuition and the
mathematician of me wants to formalize
that but let me let me just give you the
intuition I can go the large grocery
store near my house which is a tops or
wegmans and even a ten o'clock at night
it happens when it's open 24 hours a day
but even imagine a store that closed at
midnight and I can see there's a lot of
tomatoes long and I knew
with it by tomorrow they're going to go
bad they do not auction tomatoes there's
a fixed price for tomatoes now okay I
know I can also go to soak in in Egypt
or you know in Jerusalem and there you
can bargain for vegetables right i mean
but certainly a large grocery stores you
can't and they've decided it's not worth
another's lots of reasons stuff is
overhead in allowing auctions right you
don't have a large growth systems you do
have them a more personal smaller
settings like markets so I think there
is a technical question here assuming
your system design there's real overhead
and building a system with okay I know
Google does it so you know it's wrong
feisty saying this but but certainly in
some kinds of markets instituting it
auction because real overhead and as
much support and and definitely
producers and consumers like the
certainty of fixed prices i can plan a
whole lot better if I know that's in a
cost five dollars for the next year I
mean I can figure out what my expenses
are going to be I don't like I mean my
intuitions with very large markets but
with a large number of buyers and
sellers you didn't have to have an
auction because you're going to end up
at a certain fixed price anyway things
aren't going to change much again
assuming everything stable things change
if you have all of a sudden you know
explosive growth in the number of
players then you get inflation right and
we can see these four not yeah okay so
they do so mine died so I again I'm not
saying it's silly uh it's not that
common though so I again I I'm
definitely you should not take what I'm
saying as auctions bad fixed price is
good I am saying that that fixed
auctions and curse them overhead and you
have to think hard about when to do them
they don't have them all the time I
simply do it very another day maybe so
but these were yuppies they didn't want
to get into you know I mean again think
about the sociological context you don't
want it to be the case so it's not like
I'm going out to the workforce and
posting an ad on the Internet this is a
group of 30 people they all know each
other you're not going to bargain about
the price of babysitting I mean maybe
they should okay so there's an
interesting uh yeah they're positive
Kavya so I so let me some markets it's
12 minutes to eight I mean I don't mind
cutting it can come to me and ask Nick
precious or have more questions and then
neighborhood absolutely it's a cultural
phenomenon I believe me I know I i well
I know what it's like in the face and
and and they like to tell tourists this
is my fav I've been to not there on but
many other countries and and I and my
daughter calls me in to bargain for her
when she wants to do some shopping the
Jerusalem market and and if she says I'm
a better partner than she is but I they
like to pretend the prices are fixed
they certainly want to slug you in the
face if you take their first offer um
they're very happening well they might
think you're a fool right well defense
but yeah it's definitely cultural
phenomenon there are many issues here
I'm not trying to say they're armed but
but again even so but I think there's
more to it than just a cultural effect I
think there are markets where it's much
simpler as I say for a producer of
there's a comfort knowing fix cry say
there's some real benefits so so this is
the interesting I talk a lot to
economists so I think you can say you
leave money on the table if you don't
have auctions it's more efficient to
have auctions in some settings i believe
it's true and the question is what's the
cost of inefficient i mean i have the
paper title written you know if the
papers gonna be called the cost of
inefficiency you know so yeah there's
how much time and and and you know your
assistant designer it's more complicated
i mean i think are many many issues so
to work with
to take a random stock sure that's one
again it depends very much in the
setting that's an instance of where you
might argue that there's a price to be
paid for the efficiency of auctions and
so my own feeling is I would love as a
theoretician to be able to characterize
the features of markets then make fix
prices the way to go right and you sort
of give me one instance and and my gut
love my gut tells me is if your addition
that there ought to be a theorem here
this sort of characterizes them but you
know future work okay well 20 questions
when there's room for one right that's a
great question I mean so I results have
nothing to say about it right so so we
were assuming there's only one market
here's a fixed price you can't go
elsewhere to get your job done now
you're talking about a situation where
there's several markets right so that if
you don't like my one dollar price you
can go somewhere else and get it for 75
cents right that introduces a whole
bunch of complicating factors I'm sure
all my results go away so as a technical
matter I have nothing to say about it
but it's certainly an interesting
question but again you know why doesn't
everybody go there so you have to assume
that you know as an economist have to
understand what are the features the
various markets I mean if all markets
are the same then in the end will be one
market because you know if the discount
market gives you isn't every way as good
as the non discount market and why would
you ever shop at the non discount market
except for maybe if you don't realize
discount market is there so it's bounded
rationality but no lack of information
so mark says that it was last question
but I'm going to stick around if you
have more questions
