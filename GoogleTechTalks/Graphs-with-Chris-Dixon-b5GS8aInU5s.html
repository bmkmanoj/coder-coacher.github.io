Mitchell I'm an engineering director
here in the New York office welcome to
our monthly text beaker series we're
very excited to have chris dixon
co-founder of hunch and the founder
collective and fixture the new york tech
scene talking about graphs he is a
prolific blogger and one of the entries
that caught my eye a little while ago
was about graphs in different contexts
social graphs taste graphs and so we
thought would be pretty interesting to
hear him come and talk about this also
want to draw your attention to the fact
that we do this series every month you
should be able to continue to see it on
posted about on meetup and we're going
to be inviting a mix of speakers some
who work at Google some from outside
we're very excited and very interested
in any kind of feedback that you want to
give us and so come up to me or anybody
who's wearing a Google t-shirt and tell
us more about some of the kinds of talks
that you'd like to see without further
ado here's Chris thanks for having me
can you hear me ok so my name is chris
dixon i'm the co-founder of hunch and
also a seed venture fund got found our
collective and I blog at sea Dixon org
if you're interested and I was excited
to be invited to talk about this topic
usually I get asked to talk about like
venture capital and other kinds of
things which it kind of tiring and this
is I think much more interesting so and
if you want to tweet about it I propose
a hashtag there and so I decided that
for all my blog post now I'm going to
have my title and then like a Malcolm
Gladwell title to mix this sounds a lot
sexier so my titles graphs in the
malcolm gladwell title is which Oh Blake
Glenn Beck alien abductions he's about
the future of the web all right so what
is a graph so you guys I think there's
maybe a more technical crowd than I
anticipated so maybe I'll try to be kind
of quick with the stuff but the simplest
form of graph is a nodes connected with
edges and the edges the nodes can be in
the case of like a social network that
nodes are people and the edges are
relationship of friendship right in a
communication graph like sky nodes or
people edges or people you talk to you
know you can think of Google search
change course search ranking algorithms
as a graph where the nodes are pages and
links are the edges sort of like links
or kind of votes for the authority of a
page at hunch wheat we think about what
we call a taste graph where nodes are
people or they can also be items and the
edges between them are sort of the
similarity and taste and then there's
you can people call them different
things but like Twitter and maybe it's
like something like Instagram or sort of
interest graphs maybe aesthetics graphs
etc so that's uh so just going back in
history a little bit here since I always
feel like in business and computer
science talk we're sounding like
everything began in like nineteen ninety
but in fact there was a lot more before
it so graph theory kind of began 1702
the oilers seven bridges of Conan
problem the kind of key insight here was
so the idea was the question you see
here is a possible Traverse to town and
cross the bridge exactly once the key
insight here was to to ignore the
geometric properties of the of the town
and just simply look at each land masses
anode and the bridges edges and so you
know if you see on the right that's how
it's structured and that's sort of the
beginning of what's called topology
which is basically kind of like you know
the study of shapes where you don't
actually wear if you bend them in this
and that they're sort of doesn't matter
the actual spatial relationships it's
all about just the connections between
them so so graphs they're sort of in
there sort of two basic kinds of graphs
one's an undirected graph where they're
symmetric so if the relationship of
friendship is an undirected graph where
you know we're familiar with on facebook
if I'm friends with you than your
friends with me a directed graph is non
symmetric so they can be symmetric
meaning you know I can follow you on
twitter and you can follow me on Twitter
but we can also choose to have it one
where the other glenn beck is follows 25
people but is fall
by for an 50,000 in some ways I don't
know if it's deliberate or not but like
you could think of Twitter sort of
primary innovation as being too kind of
relax the simplest symmetry constraint
on the on the friend relationship and I
think that then led to probably a lot of
emergent behavior which ended up being
what it is today which is kind of more
of like a publishing platform you know
Facebook people think of it as an
undirected friend graph but actually i
think you know last year they introduced
the like button and the like button has
i think should be thought is easy best
thought of as sort of a interest graph
bolted onto a so directed nutri scrap
bolted onto an undirected friend graph
okay i'm just going to throw on some fun
data here because to keep it fun and so
this is some analysis we did at hunch
okay so I don't know if I've ever seen
this data before I don't know if
anyone's done this but this is this is
this is that this is accurate data like
counting lots of millions of people so
on Twitter the average number where you
can see the numbers you don't want to
explain them all but I guess what note
is uh is the on Facebook the number of
likes it's 30 that's actually something
that you know facebook wants to increase
if you see like the changes they've did
recently the profile pages and all the
sort of syndicated likes and things like
this is something that they've made a
real big effort to kind of improve
that's that and then the 217 is the is
the inverse of X to the comment whatever
that's a you know on average by things
that are liked craft or coca-cola or
something on average they're liked by
217 people but the interesting thing
here is really it's not working at the
distributions so on Twitter so the
x-axis is is the number of people that
the left that remember followers you
have no sorry is the the y-axis number
of people number of followers you have
and the excesses the number of people
who that applies to so what you
basically see is there sort of like the
for Winfrey's and the Ashton Kutcher's
of the world who are followed by tons
and tons of people and then it drops off
dramatically that spike they're not
exactly sure what that that's people you
follow I believe that has to do with the
old onboarding process where they had to
suggest a user list and they suggested
20 people that's I think but if anyone
has any other theories I mentioned in
them I guess it would be interesting if
there was a bimodal distribution but now
contrast that to the facebook graph
which so this is a this is a the Y is
the number of people accident or friends
with those people so you see the spike
there where a lot of people have just
one friend sort of sad I guess and then
and then that and then two is pretty big
too i think that has to do with the
onboarding again like hey you should
friends one maybe like the one is like
the person that invited them and they
didn't use it or whatever and then it
follows kind of you know a little more
like a bell curve you know this this is
a reflective of if you look at actual
social relationships they tend to be
more of a bell curve versus a publishing
plot you know so i think to me what
these two slides say is publishing
platform friend social network you know
and then as I sort of claiming before
the likes the likes thing bolted onto
facebook is a undirected interest graph
and I think this power curve looking
like Twitter kind of is evidence of that
so all right so so why do we care about
graphs I'll give a couple examples of
real world applications in marketing
this is a very interesting I can't walk
around with this thing is like to like
the pace but it's okay dancer all right
so I'm there's a very interesting study
done by telethia to telecommunications
company all right so a large
telecommunications company did a study
where they what they basically did was
they they took some product let's call
like ass wit the swiffer or something
and they found people that bought the
swiffer and that's that's in my example
person a and then they looked at the
calling patterns of people using their
phone network
and they saw that person a communicated
with you know person be lets say a
family member or something and then they
took persons see who was sort of someone
they they that was that would be highly
targeted according to traditional
marketing techniques psychographic
profile demographic profile etc and they
basically you know called up C and B and
they did course it is it a large scale
and they said you want to buy Swiffer or
whatever that the person they had
already bought and so it turns out that
be buys a lot more swiffers than C so it
turns out that simply like being someone
who communicates to somebody else what
greatly dominated sort of other
traditional marketing techniques and
this is this was actually done long
before kind of social networks and
things like this but is the basis for
you know the ad targeting on facebook
and also a lot there's a lot of them
independent like new york-based
companies which have taken similar
approaches that sort of track mule
cookies and trying to figure out like
who have you know certain who are
related to each other and if you know if
you click on whatever the ad for a
connect and it knows that your friend
whose cookie you know is your friend
you'll still there more likely to see
that ad so this is one example of a
graph in action another one is more
serious is in defense and law
enforcement so if you can you can use
graphs to and this is this is this is a
this is something is really you know
actively done but basically like if you
want to map out an organization one of
the things you can do if you if you
don't even if you don't know the
contents of the communications between
the individuals in the organization and
all you simply know is that you know a
called B&amp;amp;B called be called a back so
you know when when your boss calls you
call your boss right back when the
subordinate calls the boss who might
take a day to call back so from patterns
like that and there's other more
sophisticated patterns you can kind of
map out that in that case you know a is
the boss and b is the henchmen and you
can imagine sort of iterating through
this and doing it for you know
organizations and figuring out like this
you know terrorist cell or mafia
organization etc actually this was this
is a there was a study done using
something like World of Warcraft that
where researchers tried to do this and
figure out the structure of the of the
you know the what you call them and
dungeon dragons the you know the
adventure parties or whatever and and
and tried to predict when they were
going to like make a raid on the castle
or something like this so anyways this
is another kind of fun and since we're
google in a lot of ways the big two
hundred billion dollar idea google is I
think people so people thought about
before Google you know alta vista and i
don't know if people remember all this
stuff from too old or whatever but
they're on the you can think about just
forgetting about links just thinking
about just pure text documents and words
you can think about those like as graphs
where words and documents are nodes and
occurrence like a word occurring in a
document as a connection between the two
and that was sort of how the traditional
search engines worked realizing that a
link was a very strong signal of kind of
a vote for authoritative pneus was kind
of the key insight which was at you know
had a dramatic improvement on the
quality of the search results you know
that's of course since been copied by
all the other search engines and now the
basis of competition has shifted to
other things but and then of course
besides just that one insight there was
a lot of interesting math about how to
propagate that authority through the
graph and and so that's another
application of graphs and then i just
had to put in a few it for the nerds
here XKCD context so another practical
application of graphs is a dating i
guess um okay so how do you build graphs
so i'm interested in my primary interest
is in in sort of startups
and a lot of the most interesting
internet and particularly internet
companies a lot of the most interesting
a lot of the most all right a lot of the
most interesting internet companies in
the lobby ways of all graphs and so if
you're a startup person or your investor
one question is how do you build graphs
like how do you get started a lot of
graphs exhibit what are called network
effects which is you know they get
valuable they get more valuable to each
user as more users are using them and so
that is a double-edged sword it's great
if you're really big and it's really bad
if you really small and so you know one
strategy a lot of stuff by the way if
you're curious about it I kind of all
these are things i blogged about like
bowling pins strategy and things that I
kind of go into more detail but the the
bowling constructions comes from a book
by Geoffrey Moore called crossin chasm
which is a great book if you haven't
read it which is basically the idea is
sort of that that if that the utility of
the utility of a of a of a network is
proportional to kind of the coverage you
have within that graph so one way so
obviously the great one great thing to
do is if you can just get a lot of
coverage if you can't you know another
thing to do is to sort of shrink the
graph you try to cover initially and so
you kind of think about like we're
facebook started they started at Harvard
and you know I think about I don't know
how many students go to Harvard let's
say a couple thousand people were on the
net were let's say fifty percent of
Harvard students around the network and
let's say that was three thousand people
or something the you know once you get a
three thousand people at Harvard he
became useful to everyone at Harvard or
a lot of people at Harvard if those same
three thousand people were randomly
distributed around the country it
probably wouldn't be useful to anyone so
it was very important that they were
within that kind of think of the social
network as these clusters is very
important they sort of attacked one
cluster initially and we're useful in
that cluster at the second important
feature of that of that of Harvard or
whatever was that that that there was
what I call spillover effects which is
that you know people at Harvard were
friends with people at other schools
because you don't want to be completely
self you so what you
kind of want as a cluster that's small
enough and contained enough that these
people want to interact with each other
and they get utility when you have a
certain kind of critical mass of
coverage but not so isolated that they
won't then spill out over into other
areas by the way that if you read the
book crossing the chasm it's actually a
book that's mostly focused on like b2b
enterprise stuff and it's it applies
just as much to you know if you're
selling healthcare billing software as
if you're selling you know trying to
build a social network and I just one of
probably two or three business books
that are actually worth reading I highly
recommend it so okay another strategy is
you find a cluster with an existing
graph so you know in the 90s every lot
of people thought dating would be sort
of a winner-take-all market they thought
it'd be like eBay or something where
like you know or maybe like social
networking seems like it is right now it
turned out later on there were all these
sort of initiating such a daze one
example that was successful there's just
countless now you can pretty much if you
can invent think of a think of a human
attribute there's probably a dating site
a successful dating site associated with
it and so it turned out that that that
dating was not sort of a uniformly
connected graph that there are all these
sort of sub clusters and that wasn't
obvious at first and so like you know
like the lesson here is if you're
thinking about doing a start-up are you
thinking about launching a product you
know when people assume that it's sort
of the market is a winner-take-all fully
connected graph question that assumption
and you know I may be an opportunity so
here what I want to talk so the idea
here is that on different sort of these
are all sort of marketplaces which are
kind of like graphs and these the point
the salient point is that and some of
them the types of nodes or homogeneous
and the other the types of nodes are
heterogeneous so with opentable you have
restaurants and you have people that
want to go to restaurants are very
distinct with you know with Skype you
have you people just talking to each
other and there's like you know there's
no sort of buyer and seller or something
you know another example would be you
know a sort of straight dating so
light versus like a gay dating site
where their heterogenous or homogeneous
and then you know with google adwords
eating about advertisers and publishers
that's actually maybe that should be in
hybrid is actually a lot of advertisers
are publishers but it's different i mean
sort of different a lot of people say
that like you know the reason ebay sort
of got going initially was actually a
lot of the buyers were also sellers you
know obviously that can't work with
things like OpenTable i think one of the
interesting things like when i think
about people come to me and talk to me
about businesses that are where there
where the there heterogeneous in almost
all cases there's one or the other side
that's much harder to acquire as a
customer and you know and so for example
in the case of open table it's the
restaurant well I mean there's always
critical you get critical mass of
restaurants to get people to want use
your website but the restaurants
initially we're very hard and so what
they did is I have a blog post about
this view in should called the ladies
night strategy which is just basically
just taken from what bars do which is
they have ladies night because they've
decided a lot of bars have decided that
that for whatever sociological reason
it's harder for them to attract females
and then men to the bars and so they
offer incentives to sort of the harder
side opentable went out and gave out
free kind of CRM systems to restaurants
into the sort of incentives to kind of
get them initially on board you know in
the advertising space typically the
publishers are much harder to get and
the advertisers are pretty easy to get
and so you know I think if you're ever
thinking about a start-up or a new
business or something like around these
areas it's always like you should always
ask yourself sir which is the hard side
and what can I do it is sort of
incentivize that side graph Wars so
there's been lots of interesting battles
between graphs and then talk briefly
about this this is a message on Google's
export page when you tried this is a
screenshot when you try to export your
social graph to Facebook and it says
hold on are you super sure you want to
import your contact information to a
service won't let you get it out and now
I think this is you know Google's
which has always been pro openness and
this is probably you know there's
probably part of that part of that sort
of consistent with that theme but
there's also you could argue business
reasons behind it and so there's there's
something called Metcalfe's law which
not only is it not a lot it's probably
not even true but it's but it's sort of
sort of interesting it's a it's
basically that the value the claim is it
the value of a network also he'd say all
right this isn't Metcalfe himself but I
won't come on video um so um so I the
claim is that the value of the network
increases with the stew with the square
of the number of nodes in the network
you know the more people using fat the
more people have facts every time
there's someone gets another fax machine
you know that my fax machine becomes
more valuable it's directionally correct
right i mean like the it's the sum it
makes assumptions like every person's
connected to every other person like you
know in fact that you're like if some
random person I'm never going to speak
to gets a fax machine doesn't actually
make my fax machine more valuable but it
directions correct so the idea is sort
of that the bigger you know the
network's grow with the square of the
number of nodes and so it's sort of a
corollary to that is that when you think
about two networks interoperating the
the smaller network stands to benefit
more than the larger network so if you
want if you're interested I have a it's
called the interoperability of social
networks a blog post where actually
walks through a little math very you
know arithmetic or whatever it is to
show the example but but I we saw this
sort of play out in the early 2000s with
AOL Instant Messenger yeah I mean it
seems funny now but there was like the
the I am battles of the early 90s 2000s
and there was yahoo messenger msn or
whatever it's called yahoo msn google
released chat and had you gonna do but a
well and semester was the biggest and
everyone else wanted to interoperate AOL
didn't because you know because
obviously for this reason that they had
the biggest network
and and you know clearly when you're the
new person you're like yeah that'd be
great I want to be open so it's a very
similar thing going on with social
networks when you're like Facebook kind
of they claim to let you export your
social graph but really it's like you
download it and like some CSV file or
whatever it's really not like meant to
really interoperate with anything and so
you know when you think about sort of I
mean now you know the shame here is of
course would be great for users if these
people all got along and operated you
know the the the you know sometimes I
mean this is you know it depends on your
political orientation or something but
some people some people would argue this
is a case of market failure where it is
actually you know beneficial to have
government regulation this has been the
case in like telecommunication other
areas because oftentimes you just simply
have no you know there's simply no
incentive for these large you know kind
of huge network effect monopolistic
companies Deborah nor operate and it
hurts consumers and hurts competition
but uh my libertarian friends think
everything works out magically so so
this is a graph the graphs here meant to
represent sort of the rise and fall of
social networks for in-store myspace etc
there seems to be this seem to be a
pattern where social networks would rise
they're cool and then like your mom
would get on it and like yeah you know
you'd start like friending people you
met at a conference and pretty soon
there was like the sort of natural decay
and you know what Facebook did which was
uh was was kind of you know brilliant
was add on a win you know when they
really were in the cycle here i'm sort
of inventing a little bit here but what
they basically said you know what it's
not good for us to interoperate with
google let's say but it is good for us
to interoperate with lots of little
companies and basically build a platform
and so this is sort of Zynga and all
these other people built on so they they
introduced their app platform and
facebook connect and and through that
have now sort of really entrenched
themselves in the
coming of of the web in a way that it
would be very hard to displace you know
even if even if the network sort of
decayed and so that was probably a
brilliant strategic move and and I think
it all goes back to these kinds of basic
graph principles so ok so now I'm going
to do my side self-promotional part
talking about taste graphs so so I'd
like this game carcass on I actually
blog about it if she's interested in I
challenge anyone who like to play me
it's a German German board game it's a
and when I go to the Apple they have
this recommendations is genius thing
they have and they they says because you
like carcass on you like train conductor
or something like this well train
conductor you can kind of see like
superficially like it's like they're
both tile games but actually it's like I
think it's lame and like it's nothing to
do with this and this is like this cool
asynchronous strategy game and turning
conductors not but so what I did instead
was I said okay let me go on itunes and
click on click on carcass on I look at
all people to give it five stars and
then I looked at something went through
and which of those people and I found
like three people that like they like so
these are my three favorite actual three
favorite iphone games and I found like
three people that had those three years
or favors it's kind of a weird three
like enigmas like a physics game modern
conflicts like RTS and carcass sounds
like a a synchronous strategy German
tile game I mean so it's like the fact
that these ppl so basically the idea was
there's he's like doppelgangers I don't
know what like in Nebraska or something
who like you know who lived like this
weird identical taste to me in my phone
games and maybe like they have totally
different taste in restaurants and
totally different tastes and everything
else but they were like and so of course
like when I looked at their fourth and
fifth game I well that's really really
interesting you know because like who
has this like exact back so that's kind
of like that sort of the motivation
behind behind hunch i forgot Elsa Hugo
Lou and Matt gatos here from hunch
Hugo's teachers computational aesthetics
at MIT is a PhD from MIT and Matt's also
MIT and
there are chief scientists and CTO but
but this is sort of our sort of our I
think our basic insight was that there's
a sort of value in this sort of notion
of what we call it taste me or this or
taste similarity know what that is um so
what are the some of the challenges when
building kind of a taste graph so
there's something that sort of famous I
call the cold start problem in
recommendation systems the Colts our
problem is sort of this chaos that what
happened that uh that when you you want
to provide the best user experience when
someone first comes to your website you
have like three seconds to impress them
but for any system to give you good
recommendation to s learn about you and
sort of sort of this tension between the
two you know netflix I think they just
have such a great product and people
love getting their movies and etc that
they just sort of say if you want to get
recommendations you got to have to Train
you're gonna have to rate a lot of
movies that's their kind of answer
amazon sort of does it based on the kind
of popularity and they kind of learn
about you to look at what you bought and
they do other kind of tricks you know
Facebook basically just assumes your
taste you know when they show you ads
and other kinds of things they just sort
of assumed that if your friends are
somebody you have similar taste to them
which is you know probably directionally
correct but not you know completely our
approach has been to to sort of suck in
lots of data sources and two and so for
example I'll just give you an example so
for example so we have let's say we want
to be want to predict somebody's
political orientation so we go when we
look at like the Facebook and Twitter
graph and and and we have known points
on the graph we have people who have
twitter or facebook connected into hunch
and answering questions about their
politics so if I go say a million issue
of those people so we have sort of a
million known data points and they're
all spread throughout the Facebook and
Twitter graphs and what we do then is we
do the sort of taste propagation we call
it so what that is is
now I can't go the next slide I don't
know all right every presentation is you
put a man on the moon but we can't get a
PowerPoint to go all right well I think
there we go so what we do is we take so
if let's say I follow Glenn Beck you
know we know that I'm a right-wing you
know whatever who falls glenn beck and
well wrong is a cool video it so we know
I'm so I follow glenn beck let me keep
it I follow Barrack Obama you know I'm
look you know I'm a I answered I got a
hunch I say I'm like a like a you know
New York liberal or whatever and then
and then I followed Barack Obama and
then a bunch of other New York liberals
follow Barrack Obama and then what punch
does the basic says okay I assume people
who fall Barack Obama or politically
liberal and then we have a new user come
along who is not a hunch user but they
follow Barrack Obama and so we it makes
the assumption that that user has that
political orientation now what we do is
we take that kind of that political
rotations one of about eighty dimensions
that we do it on we do it on like you
know your food preferences your music
preferences and so each one sort of
independently think of it as like kind
of flowing to the graph and this is just
kind of because it looks cool but this
is kind of this is a visualization kind
of how it works so these are like people
following other people with the arrows
here and so far we don't know then we to
find out they're conservative in their
there you know the red are conservative
in the bluer liberal and then Matt's
magical algorithm spreads them out and
and propagates the taste to the
appropriate people so one of the
interesting things this is a if you look
at the academic literature on this
problem it's a it's something that like
it's like most a kiss I so working like
finances like most academia like it's a
great in theory but then like when you
actually you know that knows you know
like they don't take into account the
fact that it takes like you know it
would take a supercomputer 18 years to
run the algorithm or something and so
like one of the big problems that we've
worked on and solved the time just being
do this in real time so we can take a
brand new user and fit them into the
graph in real time and things like that
aren't generally considered by the kind
of academics so I think there's some
interesting intellectual property there
okay the next slide okay so why would
you care about this on our current side
we're about to release like a major new
launch with a whole bunch of new
features including a mobile app and a
bunch of other things current site you
kind of think of it as a little bit like
Netflix for everything it's sort of we
make predictions about what you'd like
but it's not just for movies is for
anything could be a iphone game or you
know this is our actual predictions and
thinks I'm going to like kind of like
words with friends and hate 90210 which
is true probably and you know we have
deals with a bunch of other website is
where we like we have a gift app where
we predict that you log in on Facebook
and we can predict what your friends
would like what gifts they would like
that's where our cold start problem is
particularly valuable because we've
never seen your friend before they never
come to hunch and we can make
predictions we're working a lot on
mobile obviously mobiles a really
interesting area and we think is
completely useful a lot of the stuff you
know I think around kind of the future
of mobile search and discovery is going
to involve kind of understanding
people's tastes we think we play
important part in that and then actually
I just threw this in here this was last
weekend there was music hack day at
General Assembly where a bunch of people
came together and did some cool stuff
including some stuff with a hunch API
which if anyone here does packs on api's
encourage you to try it it's free for
non-commercial use and probably cheap
for commercial use your friendly to us
so you zach is it takes it looks at the
Foursquare check-ins at a venue and and
then looks at their twitter names and
cross-references with a hot their hunch
taste profile and then decides what
music should be played at that venue
we've pretty cool and an automatic DJ it
is a-comin health face calm is really
cool technology and I'm not affiliated
with them not but actually thinks
genuinely cool they they they do face
recognition and it works really well
it's like shockingly well and figure out
which of your friends you're looking at
and then they cross referenced are so
out of my DJ cross-reference it with a
hunch database and decides what music to
play I think we're actually going to
build it so like we have a webcam at
hunch and
as you walk in the door it starts
playing like you walk in is like stairs
playing Bohemian Rhapsody or whatever so
it's kind of futuristic it's cool all
right so now since I just write google I
thought I would just toss in some random
stuff about Google well I think it's a
to be a solution question people talk a
lot about app Google and Apple building
social networks people have speculated
about you know Apple has in some ways a
social network they have your contacts
you know there was this whole thing with
you know Google Buzz sort of using
assuming so kind of lissa T making the
assumption that your contacts or social
network you know I don't really have an
answer here but you know I think looking
at my contact list and my phone it's you
know you have you have situations you
know you have everything from the fact
that you may have like a plumber or
something done so if you know the people
you communicate with the Knights of the
people that you are friends with I don't
answer anything really smart say but
except i think it's going to be a big
issue going forward because you're going
to have all of these people compete
clearly who want to build giant social
networks and you have incredible
communication networks and kind of going
from one to the other is going to be a
big interesting challenge all right and
I just wanted one last thing so this is
a it's actually pretty cool if you go to
if you're logged into google and you
type like you go to google ad
preferences i guess if you google google
ad preferences you there's this page
which shows you what Google thinks your
interests are and this is this is for
the purposes of you being able to opt
out of advertising I just thought it was
I think it's just inherently interesting
like sort of fun to see what it thinks
you're interested in and so as
separately google has a new thing called
hot pot which is pretty cool which is a
thing we're eight restaurants a little
bit like hunched like great restaurants
and then it predicts what restaurants
you'd like and overlays it on the maps
and so sort of part of our what we do is
let's say for example we see here you
like classical music yoga poetry and
hiking
what we do and this is kind of part of
our core thesis at hunch is we can say
because you like classical music you're
going to like mediterranean food because
you like camping you're like seafood
because you like poetry like sushi etc
so like kind of a lot of our thesis so
there's there's something called the few
red there's a there's a there's a
there's a survey people know the netflix
challenge which is like netflix offered
a million dollars for people to improve
their algorithm and there was something
called the Napoleon Dynamite problem
which was the new york times magazine
article which if you're in
recommendation system so how they
recommend which is basically all these
researchers were saying they could
predict you know all sorts of acura
things but there were certain particular
movies that seemed to elude all their
predictions and napoleon dynamite was
one of them actually turns out it was
movie what women want is the hardest
movie to predict it's a movie starring
mel gibson where he can wear where he
can hear the thoughts of women and i
think it's like depending on whether
you're you see there like highly
misogynistic or romantic or something i
don't know but but but that's actually
the hardest movie to predict so i want
to have like a party where we watched
that and pulling dynamite and like
although i don't know i guess you don't
know who to invite but anyway so fuck
them but part of our thesis is that is
that that a lot of these that hunch is
that a lot of these systems so far have
you know like the reason you have their
point on my problem is not the PR people
inherently unpredictable like is it
impossible to predict oakland to go in
dynamite or is it just that the fact our
belief is that it's the fact they've
limited the data set the input data set
to simply what movies you like like it
turns out of you and actually have data
for this if you ask questions like it
turns out the highest correlations and
if you can read it here are have you
ever egg toilet paper to house is highly
correlated with liking Napoleon Dynamite
do you know which music reviews the line
tin roof rusted as b-52s i think if you
know that you'd like it and if you this
t-shirt you are retarded your spell
youur if you find that basically ironic
or funny then if you like to find
dynamite and if you find it offensive
than you won't so
and so there's all sorts i mean i'm
using kind of whimsical examples here
but the point is you can actually
predict Napoleon Dynamite you can
predict all sorts of things we believe
that people are much more predictable
than then then it's actually kind of
funny like some of the stuff we've
remember during the campaign they have
last presidential campaign John McCain
accused Barack Obama of being an arugula
leading liberal so we thought okay well
is it true do Liberal leader available
turns out liberals eat arugula and
Conservancy diceberg it's actually one
of the kind of depressing things in
doing all the statistical analysis of
people is that a lot of these
stereotypes turned out to be true people
that like you know that like Maxie
themselves into individual more
individualistic and like to dance and I
don't all this other stuff but like so
so so that's that so that's kind of it
and I think no Q&amp;amp;A here
so in theory we had two mics but I'm
holding one of them so we'll figure that
out but if you have questions so that
everybody can hear you can come up to
one of these mics and maybe I can run
back and forth and that way everybody
will be able to hear your question and
Chris can enter thank you very much that
was really interesting my question for
you would be do you think that you could
predict people's preferences in food and
what sort of input data would you like
to see in order to predict that type of
actually yeah foods turns out to be very
predictable we actually have if you're
interested out so what I'll do after
this is I think they're going to put the
video on YouTube and i'll blog about it
and i'll put some relevant links if
you're interested see dixon org and but
we have a bunch of reports we've done
it's come just for fun to show off the
data or whatever and food turns out to
be an area that's that's quite
predictable so I don't know Matt you
anything to say about food in particular
no I mean most of the stuff that people
are heartily blog about someone like
yeah it's mostly like this sort of these
you know like you know like it's funny
actually you can tell like
businesspeople like for questions and
like it turns out others you want to
intern things we've discovered is what I
mean with 20 questions you can predict
20 questions you can break like
ninety-five percent of people's
basically answers to anything and
probably with five you can do you know
like what kind of fries do you like I
mean what kind of fries you like do you
like McDonald's or do you like those
like Belgian ones you dip in mayonnaise
like so that tends that trans
conservative for example I don't know
are you conservative four years ago what
the audience and be presented with it
and get for your students today we know
that when we say wrong and it was like
really hard for us back in the day to
actually look at data and they
challenged full subjected to the market
yeah I mean so one of the things we've
done like so like you know so like I was
talking like I was talking to someone
you know one of these location-based
startups and they were like how do we
think about how should we think about
like check-ins versus likes how do we
wait them you know when you think about
like building recommendation system and
I mean my view is it's not like the
answer was like point six or something
like I don't like some a priori like you
know constant that like he's going to
explain all like so basically what our
approach has been as a very empirical
approach so what we do is we we builded
systems that we think will make good
predictions then we actually run tests
so we like run we for example run ads on
Facebook which are deliberately around
the world across different demographics
and we test we say we think you'll like
arugula or something or actually we ask
them like do you like this to this and
we prettily had something called the
prediction game and we run tests so we
actually do it empirically I think
that's a really do these things is you
know you can use all this sort of fancy
algorithms and fancy data and everything
else but ultimately the way that you
measure these systems is
empirically and and added a million
statistics here but like but uh you know
doing kind of cross-validation all the
other kinds of things just doesn't
really work you know it's not really
that reliable it's also to buy a cease
and the only really real way to test so
we've done a lot it so we know for
example that we can take an arbitrary
Facebook user and with eighty five
percent accuracy basically predict any
question in our database like political
orientations that are just simply from
their facebook profile right and then if
they answer questions we can get higher
a lot of these systems like I have a
blog post sex that called something like
machine learning is really good at
partially solving every problem which is
like if you like it like the Watson
thing the other day like I don't know
what you guys think I was not impressed
because it's basically like I mean I was
well yeah first of all like you're
playing the game where whoever pushes
the buzzer buzzer faster and like that's
that's kind of like inherently biased
towards the machine but secondly
basically if you sit like it's like most
machine learn anything like you can be
if I can I build a system I could do it
seems to me like 10 minutes where you
take you type the question to Google you
take the top result you push the buzzer
faster you probably going to beat most
people just that way right i mean like
and then they just like tweaked it a
little I mean I'm sorry if someone here
work them Watson or whatever I mean
basically that's where they started and
they took them like three day I've seen
this million times machine but it took
in like three days and then they spent
the rest of the time like oh crap what
happens when you know it's in this it's
in travel it doesn't work as well let's
make a special little trick for travel
oh let's make a special and so what
happens is it takes you three days to
get did like eighty percent and then it
takes you like three years to go to
eighty eight percent or something and
then that's why it answered it said
what's what city has to what US city has
two airports named after world war two
battles and it said Toronto right i mean
it's like something like you know it's
like but like that's why I failed
because it's one of these things we're
just like you know it's basically
putting into Google and whatever you had
some random thing I don't know but is
that am I being unfair to Watson or you
agree okay so so empirical for a 1000
sorry
okay full formal development so if you
take your empirical model and actually
go into the field and test it
empirically say ask people do you like
cauliflower and then give a taste of
something else can you comment on we
don't have the ability to I mean we're
doing everything a lot it's awful Pepsi
challenge to sv would write suggesting
to actually give them yeah what they
actually yeah I mean I think I mean look
one of the biases that systems like ours
have is is uh there's a couple there's a
couple of interesting you're getting at
it thinks different biases that that
these different methods have so for
example if you ask people what kind of
car they want we call this a Lamborghini
problem right they always say the lamb
burger you know when in fact they
realistically are going to get the camry
or something right like like but like
and on the flip side if you look at like
where people actually check in on
foursquare the reality is they check in
at chipotle all the time but you don't
want to say recommend chipotle to like
you know a Frenchman coming to New York
for the first time right i mean so like
so like you have these biases in both
directions of both like on the one hand
the bias towards like the more you know
I extravagance in the other hand by sees
maybe towards the more mundane or
something they're all sorts of issues
like this and and yeah and like this no
I mean we don't have the resources or
the wherewithal to like get people to
physically cauliflower but you know but
I but we sort of try to adjust for these
biases in other ways but but it might be
seen as a narrowing rather than
broadening of thinking of thought and
might also be interesting to look at
age-adjusted stuff is and aspects like
that second question one of the other
two or three favorite business books Oh
information rules which actually is a
googler Hal Varian I think co-author as
a phenomenal book it's like the only
book that like real econo economist
talking about information every other
information book is just like I'm sorry
i just find it to be like you know
platitudes or something and then um but
also like Oh clay Christiansen like
innovators dilemma that's a great book
that's a that basically I mean that's
the whole like
you know he has this whole thing about
like why you know it's it's a kind of
mystery like how do why is it that that
every six year you know you look at the
list of Internet companies that are
today that the dominate and ten years
ago and it simply different list like
how the heck does it happen like how did
they miss if you know how it like and
that's sort of what he's trying to do
you know it's kind of a mystery right
like shouldn't you see these trends
count you know like there's huge teams
of people at Microsoft and Yahoo and all
these people trying to look for the next
big thing and tracking it and doing
everything and they have the best
resources the world they have billions
of dollars and they just miss Google
they miss facebook they like you know
and and and so Christensen has a whole
interesting theory about how this sort
of works and you know a lot of it has to
do with the fact that a lot of these
interesting new technology sort of start
out looking like a toy as he calls them
so when you look go back and you look at
like Western Union dismissed the
telephone as a toy and they passed on
the rights to buy for you know very low
price because at the time it only went
you know a mile and their customers
Western your customer all business
customers who had to transmit you know
important information from New York to
San Francisco what's this toy that you
can call your friend and talk mile away
the basic the basic premise of the book
is that people's demand for technology
is sort of like this and technology
always kind of gets better like this and
you've gotta like trowel you've got of
course realize that the phone's going to
start going farther and farther and that
you know all sorts of things are going
to you know so it's he goes through all
these really interesting examples a lot
of his focus on like hard drives and
it's very technically it's very ancient
book and it sort of explains like why
this can have this can happen this
happen you know and like that that these
new things come and one of the things he
says is the next big thing will look
like a toy like which is kind of
interesting i think i think you know
actually was a working at a venture
capital firm when we invested in the
first round of skype and that was
exactly what I mean member the telecom
companies exactly saying that this
thing's a toy at the time it was a toy
like you know that it was garbled sound
worked it dropped calls half the time
like but of course the broadband you
know the stuff will get better of course
that their technology we kept you know
like etc you know like it just the
trends were all in his favor I'm not
saying we knew was in the next pick you
knows get lucky also like this a lot of
other things happen but but but I'm
sorry
yeah yeah or and it became a not
interesting business of them so they
didn't care about anymore or whatever
but anyways them so I had a question
about 11 problem that I'm constantly
running up against is you know you have
to sort of preference sets and you have
a lot you have an inflection point
between them so the preference sets look
very near according to your algorithm
right and then something minor changes
and it causes and then the users heads
like wholly different like preferences
so you seem likely like a mood change on
Netflix yeah you know the an interesting
in netflix right is it a u.s. crookham
wrong like people are only like one of
the challenges is people are only
self-consistent on their ratings like
nine deep what is it like ninety percent
of the time or something so in other
words you ask the very same person to
rate the very same movies the next day
and they rate them temperature time
differently so like how the hell can a
computer do better than that like you
can't do better than the person right
like but like a lot of it's like also
like mood and like I'm in the mood for a
thriller right now I just had a bad day
I want to romantica you know like like
those kinds of things are big challenges
for these kinds of systems yes of like
I'm thinking where you have like two
solution sets that are very near and
then what happens is is you know
something minor changes whether or not
it whether or not their preference has
its change over time or anything but two
people very close to each other unlike
90 different things are suddenly very
different from each other on one thing
because there's one minor other change
somewhere else and a lot of trending and
continuous like methods of trying to
figure out what people's preference sets
are seem to not be able to take this
into account very well so that's wanting
to get any of it so I'm hang up the
phone a friend on this one over here it
really depends on kind of like the
methods that you use to generate
recommendations I think but a
nearest-neighbor type algorithms have
the kind of problem that you're talking
about where you know like my nearest
neighbor is this person because I'm so
solar to him and like anything that he
does you also recommend to me but then
all of a sudden like you know you figure
out he's not your nearest neighbor
anymore and I'm like what happens you
know the system you know has all these
like look sort of local artifacts just
because of the locality of the data
there but we treat things a lot more
statistical
in a lot more like we can think about
things in terms of court like aggregate
correlations not really Chris's examples
were you know where you're showing like
hit how it kind of found his taste mates
and then showed people similar to him
that's that's just sort of like an
example of you know how one might use
the graph to improve recommendations but
in reality our algorithm is more a
little more advanced than that cool
thanks just one of the ads that dumb I
my group at the Media Lab where I did my
PhD is patty Mazdas group and
collaborative filtering actually came
out of our group earlier in the group's
lifecycle and um you know it people ran
into this problem a lot because you use
clickstream data which is within one
domain right and the problem is that
what you realize is that it works really
well in this domain the moment you try
to cross an inflection point or leave
the domain it breaks that's because
you're stuck in a local maximum your
training against a local maximum yeah
and so what we're doing the hunch is
we're really doing open domain
recommendation and so the idea is that a
lot of our features sure we use cameras
love ratings to predict camera ratings
but we also have things like personality
features behavioral features did you
have a goldfish when you're a child and
a lot of these features don't don't
change as much they're not as sort of um
they're not as vulnerable to reporting
bias and and just errands reporting and
the hypothesis is that we can be truly
broad and agnostic with respect to the
feature set then you can sort of avoid
these kinds of problems nice it sounds
like you need a lot of computational
power for that well I mean like it
sounds like you work for Intel or
something i wish i wish i could sell you
something right now no you have any
recommended reading all my chance I'm
long afterwards yeah at it no I wrote a
if you want to read my dissertation I
wrote a dissertation on taste modeling
so nice thank you Hugo has a thing
called the synesthetic cookbook which is
um it was like in the New York all these
LA Times needs like smoking a pipe he's
like we having fun of him for it but I
you type in your mood right and it finds
recipes for you according to your mood
when I write for us but here's nothing
about my favorite things you did
is you roll over any text on the web and
then he shows you what each of the
Supreme Court justice would say about
that and so it's like Clarence Thomas's
like that's disgusting a min like
anyways alright so thank you for the
talk and I wanted to ask you if you
could tell us more about how you went
from the theoretical analysis to the
practical use of all the graph theories
because you mentioned that one of the
biggest challenge with that when you
take algorithm from the research world
it may take 18 years to computer
something like a lot matt talk about
that because he did he actually did the
work on that so you mean specifically
like kind of what what what change with
our data as to what's typically in the
real world yeah i mean so basically you
know typical you know academic machine
learning problem is you know they all
have the same data sets it's sort of
like you know they collected this data
set and you know 1990 or whatever and
it's just you know you train on that
data set and maybe you leave some
samples out and then you try to go
predict you know those samples and it's
it's very you know it's very contrived
in that respect whereas in real life you
have new users who've never seen
anything before you have samples that
come in you can't always just build a
statistical model you know for a batch
set of data and then just you know have
users coming on the fly and sort of
immediately adjust not only your model
for that user but your model for the
things that that user rates so there's
just they're basically you have to
adjust to a much more dynamic world when
you know when you're talking about you
know users that come to a website
because it's not you know you can you
can optimize all you want on you know
the specific data set but in reality
like you know data data set is like that
so yeah it just sounds a technology
point of view is it did you have to use
some specific type of hardware or
specific architecture to be able to yeah
well algorithmically we spent a long
time we're researching different
different ways to sort of fold in you
know iteratively you take sort of models
that existed so we're using some you
know some of the latest research
you know take a lot of sort of
algorithms that existed for cloud or
filtering and taking those and just
being able to make them work real time
so there's adjustments the algorithm is
a sort of fold in new data so they can
sort of the outer the model the models
that you generate sort of evolved over
time as opposed to you know just get
generated in in bash modes yeah I mean
well the hardware the we have a you know
sort of a it's a huge computational
problem it's not really related it's not
really because of the dynamic aspects of
it though just because we by crawling
all these data sources and folding in
all these different domains of data you
know we have over like 30 billion edges
now and you know that's and even if you
make if you have a very compact
representation whether that's only like
you know 18 bytes per edge that's you
know still hundreds of gigabytes of data
you know that you need to actually you
know not just run through once but you
know you know these algorithms have
running times yeah and that's another
thing is you know traditional databases
you know have a kind of different view
of the world where your graph databases
the end of the nodes are highly
connected to each other and the
algorithms that you know in order to you
know figure out the taste profile of a
user you need to know all the things
that is connected to in real time and
you know you can't really partition at
data very well because everything is so
well connected so it's not like a
traditional kind of thing I like at
Google you can you know use MapReduce
and you know massively parallel eyes it
across you know distributed network so
you know we have things like super
computers to you know load all the data
up in hundreds of gigabytes of memory
and then process it that way thank you I
want to go back to that the inherent
bias in trying to graph certain kinds of
data where people's assumptions are just
wrong going in and how do you overcome
that for instance if someone says that
you can't do business in a particular
developed country but they've never been
there they even if you present them with
data that says this is a good place to
do business I'll and when you try to
graph that I'm sort of confused as to
how I can overcome that that inherent
bias that this is not a place to do
business because they don't know
anything about the place well I think I
mean maybe a way I'll interpret that I
guess question may tell if I'm wrong is
there's there's two problems there's
giving recommendations and then there's
convincing people that the
recommendations are correct and I don't
know about your particular example but
I'll just speak more generally I think
that second part of convincing people is
probably one of the harder and more
interesting areas so like one thing
we've been sort of frustrated by is that
we we know that that for example on
hunch that if it recommends something
that you know the ninety-five percent of
the time if you go do four hours of
research you'll come to the same
conclusion but people don't believe it
so like you know how do we convince them
of that one way to convince people is
you know to have their friend recommend
something right like that's sort of the
Facebook approach like you know hey I
trust Frank and Frank said that Hawaii
is a great place to vacation and you
know there's that aspect right I think
we're intrigued by this idea of taste
mates if somebody you know hey this
person thinks like me in all these
different ways and and and I sort of
gain trust that way another way is to
sort of give a set of reasons and sort
of other things but that's I think it's
a big interesting open problem i think
if you look at like the existing
solutions like you know apple genius
they just say they just give they say
you should download this because you
downloaded that like one or you bother
this i don't think it works that well
and it's not very convincing and it's a
really hard problem you know i don't
know it sounds like you're talking
almost more about just convincing human
beings of that of things and in like in
real life or something and put ya know
it that that's part of it but i'll give
you a quick example i do a lot of
consulting in developing countries and
if i say to someone donna is one of the
most tech digitally advanced countries
in africa
um just saying that even if i give them
data how do you convince an investor to
say this is a good place to do business
that i can talk about it but i don't
know i mean that's that's a good
question i mean no no i'm equally
irrational and you know you know I can't
believe after you know I don't done like
seventy percent of country think like
UFOs are real and the angels are flying
I don't know so what am I Diana and
that's that's my question I you know no
matter what statistical model I come up
with yeah it's still tough to say hey
here's the data these are facts I mean
all depends on the type of type of
person you're dealing with and I I don't
know that I'm sorry I don't really have
a great yeah I'm okay it's just
something and I'm gonna back of your
mind yeah right I questioned us Oh Izzy
you guys build grass now and you connect
people and things in different ways
social networks you know their
preferences and there's many ways in
Kalama I was wondering if you guys had
put any thought into you know
information right so I mean information
i think is the ultimate thing that kind
of like I connects us all yeah at the
extreme this is the extreme weather
extremes I'm saying this and you're
recording that in your brain so it's you
know these information of its associated
with you and with me because i said that
right i mean this is an extreme right
but more tactically you know if I've
send an email to a friend you know that
same information is you know here and
there and this is too extreme tactical
and you know route this is the same
information in one place and the other I
don't know if you guys have put any
thought into into that concept of how
information links things people and so
on seems like it's kind of a broad
question yeah I think Google's
organizing the world information we're
trying to we're trying to stay out of
their way I don't know but yeah let's
stay away from the steamroller they had
no change from is you know I'm looking
for this perspective but I guess I'd
need a more specific question right so
are you an example
summon need something good and you're
looking actually right what did it by
the actual so like if you're saying you
sent your natural language processing or
so no no no even but that's more
advanced forum or dumbed would be you
have a blog post and I copy and paste a
piece of it and I do a quote in my vlog
say right we're not friends in treater
facebook because you're saying like for
example what Google has to do to text
spam farms and things like this like
every time I do a blog post there's like
a thousand or not me not me but like
when of TechCrunch as a blog post
there's a thousand go but i'm not saying
like for that purpose but for the
purpose of like how people and things
are connected i see that band no I'm
moschino so I guess the answer is like
it's not a variable that you guys have I
know I mean as a generally like as a in
our particular approach and not saying
there aren't other approaches it would
work our particular approach has been
very sophisticated lot of these are
language models analyzing tweets etc but
to believe but that doesn't mean it
can't work and we just yeah you got to
have you got a right number of times in
particular word or words I mean Hugo did
his thesis on like sentiment analysis
and email so I guess right i mean yeah i
guess i don't so this is my point that's
the exactly my point like if I you put a
blog post and I copy and paste a piece
of it and I put it in my blog post right
there is a connection between you and me
right yes in that connection is not
capture anywhere else uh well yeah I
mean you can capture by crawling the web
and seeing the two you can cut right by
there's like a company called tint to
that actually like in beds your link
whenever you copy and paste and
intercepts the copy command I mean
there's people trying to work on that
problem a little bit but yeah
um it's not so it's I guess it's just
beyond our purview or something but I'm
sorry do you guys take into
consideration how taste profiles might
might evolve over time oh okay do we
take yeah well we try to do is we try to
focus on on kind of we kind of try to
think of it as like there's take there's
sort of you know a silly philosophy
there's like a you know like Aristotle
would say there's there's essential
properties of people and then there's
accidental properties and the essential
ones are ones its persist throughout
time and so you know they're sort of
like there's you know the fact that or I
guess you could think of it also is just
a scale of sort of the degree of
persistence of each thing you know so if
someone has strong political beliefs
that tends to that tends to persist you
know the other extreme is like a mood or
something which which won't at all and
so we try to you know we try to focus on
things which which which persist and you
know kept your mood and other things in
other ways but that is a problem I mean
it's sort of a natural I think with any
kind of data set about people there's
just always a natural decay you know
people change over time and that's just
one of I mean we have we face this
problem both the terms of people and in
terms of so we kind of think of the
world as people and items or items is
like so we want to build it like say
like you like this restaurant and so the
we also have a taste profile for that
restaurant and you know those things
change very quickly too they go out of
business new ones come about they
changed their menu whatever the case
might be right and so there's a constant
problems or data refresh so it's sort of
like you have to think of I think you
have to think a lot of these systems as
you know Wikipedia every day it's
actually another good business but clay
shirky here comes everybody I mean we
talks about how every day there's you
know a million instances of somebody
vandalizing the website and every day
there's two millions of people improving
it you know and it's like this constant
sort of float like decay and rebuilding
and this is this is a this is a feature
of a lot of websites
I'm sure it's true google search
algorithms asset you know like there's
sort of this constant and so I think
that's sort of how you have to think
about it and so but as a company as a
start-up is the challenge is keeping the
flow data coming in sufficiently to kind
of keep up with the changes I guess I
was more thinking about like if you like
medium bodied wine right now you might
like full-bodied wine like six months
from now it because you develop this
taste do you have any data on that or
observations yeah I'm sorry full body
would so yeah um I mean I offhand I
don't know do we know we have wine data
we know a fan but but um but like you
know you have an edge between you know
like you come to our website and you
liked wine and so so where we draw an
edge from u2 that you know the medium
bodied wine and then so there's there's
a value for that which is you know is it
a positive edge or negative edge that
you'd liked it or disliked it but then
there's also sort of a confidence level
associated with it does that make sense
sort of if it was gathered from a weak
signal or a strong signal this might be
also getting back at the previous
question a little bit you know how that
you have sort of weak signals and strong
signal so you have to model that in your
data you know if you just saw somebody
mentioned something in a tweet that
might not they might not actually like
that you know like we treat Foursquare
check-ins differently than you know
someone explicitly saying that they like
that restaurant and so we just do that
by you know there's a lot of different
ways you can model that but in order to
have something really simple that you
can use across you know all the domains
that we try to accomplish and we sorta
sign of confidence there and that actual
confidence can decay over time decay
over time so basically you know if you
enter that two years ago you know we can
go through the system and sort of you
know decay that that confidence level
there but it really hasn't been a huge
issue for us yet like we kind of tackle
these problems as they come and like it
hasn't been like you know we haven't
gotten any complaints with people being
like oh you know this is this data is
you know stale or whatever yet
because like Chris's we're focusing on
you know getting more of it more of an
more of it like not like phasing parts
of it out yet I was just going to add
one more thing which is that if so you
have taste how much of that is signal
and how much is noise right so that if
you are romantic you'd believe that at
some point on your taste would converge
upon your collective individual right
and you everyone would live in taste
tribes in the future and you sort of
have a lot of reflectiveness about
yourself so one of the easy things we
can do from a static shot is we can
infer how much signals there so you can
look at simply look at the coherence or
distance relationships in the data and
see if they support whether or not this
is you're likely to have stable tastes
according to what we know is stable from
our static snapshot or if you're sort of
tastes are in flux or underdeveloped
right that's another way to look at it
these drugs I think we're just going to
take one more question I want to be
respectful of our speakers time and and
and give them a warm welcome and send
off and then people will be free to kind
of mix and mingle and Christmas hang
around a little bit more so you can ask
some more questions so so one more thank
you I actually have two questions one
flowing on that but the first one is
very simple you pointed out that you
know so in facebook they make the
assumption that people who are socially
connected are similar but you've gone
the other way and looked at other
features for taste crafts I was curious
if your data showed the reverse that you
know people who are taste mates are
actually connected in the social network
or not actually turn so it turns out on
certain Facebook that what the things
you like are vastly more predictive than
the people who you're friends with and
who your friends is actually not that
yeah the weak ties I mean they yeah it
actually is not a very good predictor of
taste right I mean it's you know I think
with a telemarketing example use earlier
it's better than these like throwing you
know darts at a dartboard methods they
use you know in comparison but yeah
we're talking you know it's like but but
it's it's very let me just think about I
don't know like you're you know think
about your friends and their food
preferences like I'm very curious to
know if you can kind of come up with a
six degrees of separation you know it's
like based on how close we are we always
about two degrees is actually one of the
things I was hoping to click we didn't
have time
you know but I was hoping to get more
data collected here which is exactly
that's what I think they call the
diameter of a graph right which is how
many degrees of separation on average
and uh I was hoping to do that both for
hunch facebook twitter etc something I'd
like to maybe we'll try to run that
analysis but that it would be
interesting right I mean yeah I
supposedly in real life it's 6 degrees I
don't know it wasn't it was six I think
debunked but yeah but Facebook destroyed
all statistics um yeah the other
question was kind of building on that
and you know there's this year there's
been like a lot of buzz about
gamification and game mechanics to
influence behavior and things like that
so i was wondering it sounded to me i
might have got this wrong that two nodes
in your taste graph have a lot of
features that connect them and you wait
to all the different features so I was
wondering does that give you insights
into persuade ability can you tell that
you know this is a taste that can be
influenced so I think would be really
cool for like obesity and health right I
can just tell you hey Weight Watchers is
not gonna work for you you know but
maybe if you did go and join a gym it
might based on the fact that you're
tastefully similar to people like that
don't see why persuade ability she
couldn't be a it may already be in our
database it could be that could be
interesting report like that would be
very yeah so that's a good idea yet okay
cool thanks well thanks thanks very much
for coming and
