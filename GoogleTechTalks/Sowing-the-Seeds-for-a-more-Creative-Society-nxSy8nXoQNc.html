sowing the seeds for a more creative
society we're very pleased to have a
Mitch Resnick with us today he is a
professor of learning research at the
MIT Media laboratory he's also head of
their lifelong kindergarten research
program and in that program they've
worked very closely with Mattel and
other companies to get the technologies
out out into the world Mitch also was
co-founder of the computer clubhouse
which is a project that helps low-income
youth get access to Creative
Technologies recently mitch has been
looking at sort of the transition from
kind of like the 1990s knowledge
knowledge society to what he calls the
creative society so today is going to
discuss some of the technologies and
research going on at MIT Media Lab that
will help us with that transition please
join me in welcoming miss Resnick it's
really nice to be here know what thank
Jeff for hosting we intersected a number
of years ago in a previous job of his
where we'd also worked on some projects
involving technology and education it's
nice to be able to connect again and
look explore ways we might be able to
connect with Google around some of these
ideas I also feel like I have lots of
connected to these days it seems that we
MIT computer science student who
graduates wants to come work at Google
so we have lots of feel from MIT are now
roaming the halls here since as Jeff
mentioned I do a lot of work with
technology and education so we're going
to start out with a quiz so I hope you
came prepared so put your get your
pencils ready and it's one of those
quizzes it's of the form which of these
three things is not like the other the
you ask this on Sesame Street all the
time so I'm going to name three things
and you have to think about which of
these three things is not like the other
and the three things are television
computer and paint brush now with an
audience like this you probably already
know what it is I'm getting at but I
often ask this question when I start to
talk with teachers as they are thinking
about using
computers and as went talk to groups of
educators and asked this as you can you
know probably tell from the other idea
behind this there's one obvious choice
that your teachers will often say well
it seems that the paintbrush doesn't
quite fit and it's certainly true the
computers and television are similar in
many ways they're both inventions of the
19th century of their 20th century
they're both involve electronic
technology to both great technologies
for disseminating information where the
paintbrush really isn't like them in any
of those dimensions I think the main
point they want to be making today is
that we're not gonna be able to make
good use of computers especially
computers for learning and education
until we start thinking of computers
more like paintbrushes and less like
televisions less as technologies for
disseminating information and more as
technologies for personal expression
being able to design and create things
with it the way you do with the
paintbrush so well unfortunately that's
not the way most technology and
computers get out to the world today in
the world of education if you go to most
schools where computers have been they
generally are used more like televisions
than like paintbrushes they generally
argues for just distributing and
delivering information and you might
wonder well why is it that it happens
that way i do think one of the reasons
it happens that way is because of the
way people think about education people
tend to think about education with a
model someone like this you know they
think of education in terms of this sort
of a delivery or transmission model that
education is about delivering
information from one person to another
so that when the computer comes along if
people have this model of learning is a
oh that's great we'll just replace that
person up there with a computer and have
it delivered the information and that is
the way that a lot of computers get used
in education and in homes and community
centers these days and this is where we
sort of need to move away from over you
know we've seen over and over in our
research and everyone in doing
educational research sees that a lot of
the most important learning doesn't
happen this way of just delivering
information from one person to another
or from a computer to a person or from a
more knowledgeable to a novice
it's not the way most learning happens
the most learning and some of the most
important learning happens when people
are deeply engaged with designing things
creating things experimenting exploring
expressing themselves as you do with the
paintbrush so we wanted to we spend a
lot of time think about how is it that
we could use new technology to fit those
approaches that we know are most
successful for learning that involve
designing creating experimenting
exploring as we've done that we look
around say well what can we use for
inspiration what are models out there
that are already working well we might
you know get some inspiration and uses a
model and one of the models that we've
often been inspired by is looking at the
way that kindergartens work this is my
prototypical kindergarten and in fact
you know most people feel that the
traditional kindergarten works pretty
well people complain a lot about the
educational system that people generally
feel kindergarten works pretty well and
they're right you know i think the
tradition on preschool toward leading up
to it in fact at least people used to
think kindergarten works okay you might
have seen Newsweek magazine had a cover
story a few weeks ago it was called the
new first grade that was about first
grade and kindergarten of hell first
grade and kindergarten that used to be
places for exploration experimentation
are becoming much more like the rest of
school so Mike what's happening is the
you know the model of the rest of school
which is much more transmission oriented
of people sitting there getting lectured
at filling out worksheets is drifting
down into first grade and kindergarten
with high stakes tests you know
benchmarks every other week so the rest
of the school approach is drifting down
towards kindergarten what we want to do
is exactly the opposite we want to take
what has been best about kindergarten
through the years and push that upward
to make all of schools somewhat more
like kindergarten in fact as Jeff said
my own research group we call lifelong
kindergarten for that reason we want to
take what's worked well back
kindergarten and make it you extend
through all of the different ages and
thank you the fact that kindergarten
works that way it's not just an accident
the person who invented the first
kindergarten kindergarten was an
invention and was invented a little less
than 200 years ago by a German educator
and designer named Froy ball and when
he'd set the first kindergarten he
didn't just say well let's make a
for younger kids he also tried to
rethink what the educational approach
was going to be as I said he wasn't just
an educator he was a designer and he
thought what can we design to put in the
hands of five-year-olds they will enable
them to learn the things that are
important for five-year-olds to be
learning so he designed what came to be
known as verbals gifts and these are
different manipulative materials blocks
and balls and beads and tiles and he
thought about how could he design those
so that kids just as they play and build
and design with those materials will
naturally learn the important things for
five-year-olds to learn to learn about
number and shape and size and color and
this was really effective and the ideas
got picked up by you know later
educators you if I may have you know
about Maria Montessori who was very
influenced by Freud ball took this as a
basic idea behind her approach that
spread widely and others have also been
very approached you know influenced by
this and if you walk into kindergartens
today you often will see your current
date descendants of foibles gifts
different manipulative materials as I
said it then starts to change as you get
up and you get to the older grades kids
don't have the opportunity to experiment
explore design create and it is much
more to that tradition in that
transmission model well why is it that
it happened that way is it just no one's
thought about this I don't think it's
just that I do think part of the reason
that the education has shifted as kids
get older is because we haven't had the
right materials and technologies to
extend the kindergarten approach because
if you have blocks and beads and tiles
those are great for learning
kindergarten concepts about a number and
shape and size and color but when you
get to be 10 years old or 15 years old
or 25 years old or 45 years old and if
all you have our blocks and tiles it's
not going to let you design the things
you want to design or to learn the
things they want to learn but this is
where in my mind new technologies can
make a big difference that with new
technologies there's a chance if we
design them the right way and use them
the right way we can design the
technology that can extend the
kindergarten approach and allow learners
of all ages to
is this kindergarten approach of
designing creating experimenting
exploring but to work on more advanced
projects and to learn more sophisticated
ideas so that's the goal of our research
group and for a lot of the work going on
the education area at the Media Lab its
say how can we develop this new
generation of technologies based on the
kindergarten approach be useful for
learners of all ages to help them learn
more advanced things using these types
of approaches so to be more concrete
I'll give an example we've been
developing for a number of years what
might be called invention kits for kids
we've worked closely with the Lego toy
company on the leg on mines would lead
to Lego Mindstorms probably a lot of you
have heard of Lego Mindstorms actually
how many of you have ever used Lego
Mindstorms so if I have two people hmmm
so it's unfair hopefully people use
elsewhere as well so if you know people
you have used this and you know it's
great that there's gotten out to the
world in a significant way they're like
there are a million of these they've
gotten around the world for letting
people you design and build things and
learn important ideas game beyond the
kindergarten concepts but to new learn
ideas about feedback and control and
sensing by building things in the world
and building different robotic systems
with this you at MIT this is you know
turned into a you know a big boy
important part of the educational
landscape every January there's a robot
design competition it also gets used in
many other similar things in many other
places but maybe you probably seen
things like this well just show a little
clip this is from about ten years ago
before my Strom's came out but a
colleague of mine fred martin who worked
in you with our group and developing
some of the prototypes for this he and
some other colleagues Randy sergeant and
others set up the initial robot design
contest at MIT where the month of
January between semesters people would
use thoroughly prototypes of this to
build robots to compete in competitions
let me just show a little bit of this
whoops
and again your people will build it and
then these are autonomous robots people
will build a robot and in this case the
idea is to get ping pong balls to the
other side of the table so you see the
top of your knock two balls over and
then chop that one on the other side
sounds a pretty effective strategy the
robot on the bottom here actually picks
up the ball Rose them to the other side
and MIT students have a variety of the
mechanical expertise it's throwing the
balls the other side I mentioned Fred
marketed PhD dissertation Sean how will
people learn by participating in this
and how they learn certain engineering
ideas better through these types of
hands on interdisciplinary design
activities compared to traditional
engineering approaches you see well this
has been drugged balls across the other
one's been picking up the balls and
green them after cross
as you can see the MIT there's a great
spectator sport they pull up our de
Torme's hours ahead of time I liked it
is it the MIT vielen of the big football
weekend with the MIT football teams not
so great but again as we were developing
this although it's great for to work for
MIT students our real goal is to see how
it could reach out more broadly so we're
very happy as this became a commercial
product we were able to set up things
like this for younger kids all over the
world so like here's images from in
Singapore where I visit Singapore these
were some kids participating in their
robot design competition this was the
national champion I think he was you
know 13 years old of their robot
competition so it's really getting out
there although I was struck the thing I
remember most from visiting in Singapore
I thought he in his class mr. doing very
creative things with the robot but then
when I talked to the teacher I told her
I was impressed with what the kids were
doing it seemed they were learning a lot
but you know I said I was curious how is
it that they integrated this into their
you know curriculum and she looked at me
as if i was crazy she said we would
never do this during the school day this
is only for after school during the day
they must be drilled on there you know
Emil on their math lessons and to me it
sort of shows the resistance of the
educational system where there's no
doubt this is an incredibly you know you
know rich learning experience and yet
educational systems still it's very
difficult to bring about change there
was a traditional ways of doing things
and trying to bring about change is very
difficult and this is even in Singapore
I had been invited there because the
Ministry of Education wanted to bring
about more creative thinking into the
classroom because they'd been getting a
lot of complaints from businesses in
Singapore as you might know the schools
in Singapore have been very successful
in the international math and science
exam they scored near the top of the
world in international math science
exams and yet when the kids graduate and
go into the business world the
businesses were complaining that the
students even those that squirts oh hi
weren't able to come up with innovative
solutions to unexpected problems they
knew how to do certain things by Road
but they had no idea how that you
develop innovative or creative
approaches they said we need something
different in the school system and the
mystery of Education was trying to bring
about that change
and the sponsored events like this you
could all see the resistance of the
school system and you see this around
the world and there's this growing gap
in my mind between what's needed to
succeed in the world these days to be
able to think creatively and what it is
that schools are preparing kids for I
think there's this real problem with the
growing gap and what we're trying to do
is to bridge that gap to try to change
the educational system so it really does
meet the needs of what people need today
to be successful in their work lives and
also satisfied in their personal lives
and good participants in their civic
lives you know although this has been
very successful with mindstorms getting
out to the world there are some ways in
which we were frustrated by the way it
got out there as I said it got out of
pretty big numbers more than a million
kits sold around the world but if you go
to a lot of the robot design
competitions a lot of the participants
are boys even when there have been very
strong efforts to broaden who it is that
appear who gets involved there have been
seventy percent participants or boys
even after those strong efforts now it's
not say that some girls aren't doing
very well in these competitions some are
very very interested we just see this
around the world the way that it gets
presented and we don't think its
inherent to the technology we think it's
much more the way it gets presented if
you say build a robot to compete in this
competition it's going to peel the some
kids more than other kids I think alot
kids want to make things and design
things the world not everybody wants to
make robots to participate in
competitions so what we wanted to do is
have a more general purpose invention
toolkit to let you design all sorts of
things so with that in mind what we've
been doing in recent years is developing
what we call a cricket which is a
similar to the Lego Mindstorms this is
the little computer and again just
smaller and lighter which has some
advantages you'll see this it can make
it a little bit more portable but more
important it doesn't just drive motors
that are in robots but control lights
and music and sound in order to control
lots of different things in the world so
kids can build things like this they
might build a little cat and with a cat
when you pet the cat
well then meow so this is one the kids
that built this they put a light sensor
in the back and then wrote a program for
the cricket it says when the light level
drops below a certain amount play the
mewling sound I think if you walk into
toy stores these days you see lots of
toys where something will you know meow
when you're petted or wiggle its ears
when you talk to it but it's been
pre-programmed by the toy company all
kids get to do is interact with that and
we have no doubt the designers of the
toy company learned a great deal while
they were designing the toy for our
concern is the kids didn't sa learned
that much just by interacting with the
toy because we think the learning goes
on when you're designing it and
programming it so we want to give that
activity to the kids so you can make
things like the cat or here's another
example where there's a birthday cake
and has served a flashing candle I'm
going to blow out the candle it plays a
birthday song so in this case there's a
sound sensor that's built in and when
you blow into it the sound sensor heard
the sound of my breath and the program
says to turn off the light and then to
you know play that play the music i said
i should point out we even have someone
who worked on the crickets from the
early stages now works at Google Chris
line is sitting in the back there was
actually one who is a student at MIT did
love of the early work as we were
developing all the different different
types of devices that connect to the
cricket so over the years we had lots of
people trying to think how this can be a
general purpose tool do you connect all
sorts of things to let me assure briefly
what is the kids do is they want to you
know create something like the cat or
the birthday cake so to the computer you
can connect up this is justin into the
USB port we have a USB serial cable
that's going to hook up to an infrared
beaming device so you can be mailed
information from the computer and then
there's a is the programming language if
i take the cricket and i plug in
something like i have one of the this is
one of that it's a light that can be
cold can be controlled from the cricket
so i plug this into the cricket
put it next to the beaming device and in
the programming language you see there's
a block here that says set the light
color I'm going to change what color it
is let's say I want to make it blue I go
to blue and then when I double-click the
light turns blow if I want to turn it
red I just put down to read double-click
and the light turns red I can build up
programs just by doing stocks of blocks
so i could say i wanted let's say I want
to start turn it blue wait a little bit
if they just snap together like lego
bricks let's say I didn't want to make a
turn back to read and then wait a little
bit more so now when I double-click
there whoops it'll go blue and then the
red we're going to do it again I just
hit the button it goes blue and then
read or if I want to do that a certain
number of times you can put different
control structures i could say i want to
repeat 10 times so now continuously go
blue and red and blue and rad or it
could put on a sound sensor
and say actually want to trigger that I
say I want to wait until and it just
snaps together again we want to get rid
of a lot of this syntax of traditional
programming languages we found the one
thing that really stops novices from
gangstarr in program is where do you put
the parentheses in the square brackets
here we have things only fit together in
ways that make sense to fit together as
you see the different shapes indicates
different types and things only fit
where they can make sense and people can
just sort of scan the different things
and try to look for what it is that they
might be able to add to it so I care we
might say I want to i'm going to wait
until i'll put a a greater than i would
say wait till the loudness from the
sound sensor is greater than i'll say
nine day they all go
oops it triggered as I was Dennis all
started again start so just wait until
heard a loud sound and then start any
what it was doing and then similarly in
addition controlling the light i'll just
show one more thing you can put on the O
sound and say I want to
oops click this play the Khitan sound
with this one has a horse sale or
there's a melody added or I can make my
own little melody this is how the
birthday song was made and try it out
and if I like that I say okay and then
it created a block with my melodies now
it basically created a procedure of the
melody and then I can also say i want to
change what instrument is playing the
procedure so that was with the piano now
it's a flute or it can change the
instrument to the kitten again so the
idea is to make it with the term we use
we want to have we want to have a very
think herbal programming language most
programming languages you can't just
mess about you have to sort of think
much more formally about it and plan
ahead we our idea is to not think that
you have to sort of plan it right it
compile it and then run it it's much
more like playing with Lego bricks I
want you to have and you notice I just
have these other blocks scattered on my
desktop like with Lego bricks on desktop
and I can work on a little bit something
here working a little bit sign there
snap them together so make a very easy
people to play around and with
programming so we've been trying this
out in a variety of different you know
places you actually it's just recently
this came out we will work on this for a
number of years it just we see it came
out as a product from a small company
called playful invention company where
you get the cricket for different types
of sensors for different output devices
motors you know you know music sound
devices the digit display you know the
colored lights along with some Lego
materials art materials to build the
type of things that I've been showing
and we've been trying it out in lots of
different places so that was fair this
is one of the early things this was one
of our early tests in Boston as we work
to this this is for kids where they were
at a workshop we
we told them that the goal was to invent
something that could be useful to them
in their everyday lives so for think
about what were they interests in their
everyday lives now could they use this
technology to do things in their
everyday lives so here's where they come
up with this is the local TV station
came at the end of a two-week workshops
they worked on this for two weeks over
the summer and this is what they came up
with yeah it'd just be Christina Kosta
is trying to build a better mousetrap
make that gerbil trap light sensor it's
one of the many inventions created at
this free math and science camp run by
the computer museum and the Girl Scouts
we're girls from Boston are devising
everything from an odometer for
rollerblades to a diary security system
and someone touches this to try to open
the diary will take a picture of that
person so like if your creepy little
brother tries to read your diary yeah
he's on camera yeah I mean I think you
see just from those examples the range
of inventiveness which is possible when
you give kids the right tools in the
right support I think one reason this
was so successful is they really worked
on things that they really cared about
personally you know the girl who did the
rollerblade she loved rollerblading so
she was working sign she cared about she
wanted to know how fast she was going so
after she put the sensor on the wheel
that sensor told her revolutions per
second but she wants to know how fast
she was going on miles per hour so she
was motivated to do the math to figure
out how fast she was going in miles per
hour and we see this over and over with
here just a few more examples from
workshops around the world this isn't
Hong Kong we did workshops and he worked
on a portable jukebox we put in a coin
there was a sensor to detect what type
of coin and it played different musics
it was a budding entrepreneur she put
she hit Sydney or she went to have her
boots light up the same way that some
sneakers right up light up now as you
walk so she put lights inside those
ping-pong balls with his sensor on her
shoe and ash we'd walk they would light
up different colors in different ways
there's a workshop in Iceland this is a
route a security system for a room with
a light beam that gets broken in sounds
an alarm or song comes into her room
this was everyone these mondays it was
an automatic toilet paper dispenser so
you clap your hands it printed
spews out toilet paper for you and this
is actually one my favorite this is an
alarm clock it was set up with a light
sensor so when the light comes in the
room it will then trigger the light
sensor and it turns on the motor the
russell his hair and played some music
to wake him up but after you developed
it someone asked me I said yo this is
Iceland the Sun usually doesn't come in
the window in the morning so at the
final exhibition when they had posters
about it he wrote at the bottom of this
poster for export only tell you I think
I said the kids are not just learning
the technology but starting to think
about the user community and how they
get their ideas out to the world you
know I think well here I'll just show
you know kids Wilson emphasized for kids
to think about the whole design process
when we worked on one workshop at
another MIT researcher ran a workshop
where he had kids working with the
crickets and then a week later had some
other kids and he asked the first group
to write down some you know some
suggestions for them for the next group
the lessons they learn what advice would
they give the next group about how to
design things with this technology so
some of the things that kids come up
with a sedative things like start simple
work on things do you like that's always
a good idea do things there personally
meaningful if you have a close to do
figure if you have a clue what to do
fiddle around again messing about off in
a good strategy don't be afraid to
experiment find a friend to work with
share ideas their importance of
collaboration it's okay to copy stuff to
give an idea too often in school kids
are told not to copy it's good to copy I
mean giving you a give appropriate
credit but most inventions come by
copying keep your ideas you know build
take apart rebuild the idea of iterative
iterative design your lots of things go
wrong stick with that the importance of
persistence so I think we're hoping that
kids aren't just learning specific
technical skills but also about the
process of design another project that
we're working on dits in the same spirit
whereas the crickets are trying to let
kids design things in the physical world
and make them come to life we also want
to let kids take control of the media
that they interact with today's kids
grow up doing lots of things with media
on the screen but usually they just
again are interacting with the media
they go to a web page they've moved the
mouse around letters dance and you know
different fireworks go off but they
never get to
create those things themselves you know
even kids they become fairly savvy with
computers and use paint programs or even
use Photoshop to manipulate some
photographs it's usually making static
images it's not so easy for people to
grow up and to make dynamic interactive
things so we really want to give kids
the opportunity to make dynamic
interactive things on the screen like
the things they see and like the
physical things they can do with
crickets but we did you know but to get
do it on the screen so we've been
developing a programming language called
scratch this for that purpose let me
give you a an example of this so with
scratch is the same building block
metaphor that we showed before I showed
before this is a top-down view of a cat
you can drag out blocks this says to
move 10 steps will make the cap move
those of you who at some point of your
childhood did things with logo the
programming language will see some
things about moving a turtle on the
screen you can start with the same sorts
of things but more easily since these
graphical blocks don't worry about
syntax but more importantly can go much
further so again you can do things you
can make a turn you can put them
together so it moves and turns you can
bring out control structures so you can
tell it to go forever and again things
snap in place so go forever but again
most kids today aren't I wish to just
make a cat or a turtle move on the
screen they want to manipulate media so
this is really meant is a medial
authoring tool so I can do things
instead of the cat I can give it a
different costume I could say I want to
import a costume I can just grab it from
a rabbit from a web page oh I forgot to
actually I didn't have the image here
that I wanted but let's just take one of
these so here's a character that I
brought in I'm gonna make a little bit
bigger oops the other I still want to
manipulate this image I can do things
like of course I can make it spin around
like at the cat spin around but I want
to do things like kids doing photoshop
so I can do things like I can manipulate
these are different types of image
filters you would find in Photoshop this
is a whirl filter and I could say when I
click on this it whirls the face and
twist it around but then you know I want
to be able go beyond that and be able to
do it interactively so I can do things
like I want to say I want to
continuously set the world filter based
on the x position of the mouse snail
just with a few blocks I've made an
interactive application is I move the
mouse around I can control the image on
the screen then even if it's running i
could say i want the y position of the
mouse to control say the color so now is
it go up and down you change the color
and left to right it whirls it so just
the idea of beyond do these simple
interactive animations are things that
traditionally or just aren't very easy
to do these days but there's no reason
it shouldn't be easy just be able to put
a few different things together and to
be able to do this to have interactive
applications I'll show you the type of
things that people you can do right now
there's still a beta version this is a
project that we're planning to have this
downloadable by the end of this year we
have this downloadable for free from the
net to let people create things like
this
so in this case each of these objects
here you have lots of different objects
each one has its own code associated
with its own stack of blocks so I can
look to see the stack of blocks
associated with each of these it happens
like this boom box is set up that when i
click it it makes the dancers start
dancing each of these right click on it
so you can do different exit dancer
apply different image effects different
sound effects so again we want to let
people mix different media together in
fact we called of language scratch
because it's inspired by the way DJ
scratch with music they take existing
pieces of music blend them together in
different ways and you mess around with
them so we want to let kids mess around
with media but to learn programming
ideas in that in the process so the goal
is to help people design things they
want to design more flexibly to learn
computational ideas which have been
difficult to learn in the past and also
to learn about the process of design
I'll show one more example you know
certain kids when they see this they
want to do it to create games it's the
type of games they might make here's an
example like this is one where again
there's a big fish and little fish each
one has its own programs when I the big
fish is programmed to follow the mouse
so I have to coalesce to eat the fish
the little fish in fact when I saw the
kid who was working on a project just
like this one and he's got to this stage
but would he want to do with to keep
score and didn't have to keep score so I
showed him I said well we can do is
there's a category here called variables
I say want to make a variable I'll call
it score that automatically generates
three new blocks called chain score by
set score two and it shows up the score
here on the screen so if I click on
change square by one it increments the
score right there so that was the what
you want to do I start to show them you
could just drag this out and put it in
the pro
with a big fish eats the little fish and
his eyes lit up you saw what he could do
when you've reached out hey said thank
you thank you thank you and what crossed
my mind was I wondered how many 8th
grade algebra teachers ever thanked by
their students for teaching them how
about variables it just doesn't happen
but here he was learning about variables
in a way the key really cared about he
wanted to make use of it I think this is
the way we want to have mathematical and
scientific and engineering ideas
introduced to kids in a context where
they really want to make use of it see
how it can be used and then be able to
use it as part of design projects so as
I said this design we've been testing it
out in a few different places but you're
now ready to get out to the world but a
big part of getting out to the world is
not just have the software we want to
make a community around that we've been
very influenced by websites like Flickr
where people get to put their own you
know photographs up and you get to learn
from seeing other people's photographs
or YouTube you're where you put videos
as not just to get your stuff to be seen
by the world we can learn from what you
see other people's doing so influenced
by things like Flickr we're creating a
website that at least 10 we've been
calling scratcher so you can put up your
own scratch projects and then suddenly
in the other pill can see it but you
also can browse and look at other
people's projects once you put it up
there you can actually run it in the
browser itself you can't author in the
browser but if you have any java enabled
browser if we put it in a forum where
you can just run the project right in
the browser so i think we want to be
able to move much more in the direction
of letting people make computationally
active creations that they can just run
in the browser in fact it's always a
frustration for me it seems that there's
so much stuff being done by you know
people here at Google in particular of
making more things you can do in the
browser but they're still not so much
about enabling you to create
computationally active things dynamic
interactive things within the browser I
think direction we want to go with this
is as I said right now we can't author
in the browser itself but you should be
able to do things like that the same way
that in scratch being able to make the
type of your music animation or that
game one should be able to just make it
easy ways for people to author things
like that right in the browser share
with one another in sites like this and
it feels to me that I wish there were
more people work on that that's tight
with it would be great to try to
with people here I'll be able to move
some of this to be able to do this
totally within the browser and to let
people be able to not just take videos
and photographs but also make
computationally dynamically active
things that they then share with one
another of course it shouldn't just run
on laptop to desktop machines we've been
working on version of this to run on on
hand on cell phones PDAs and again there
we probably aren't going to be authoring
on the cell phone before you can do is
you can design it on your laptop
download it to your cell phone but then
just send it to other people in their
cell phones one of my graduate students
is interested in studying how the
creations get shared with each other so
as you send it from one cell phone to
another or online from one person other
it keeps track of where it's been spread
too so you can you get a sense of how
ideas spread through the network and we
want to expose that to kids as well or
adults who use this so they get a sense
of the social network that they're part
of and really contract how the things
they've created the spread to each other
again I think cell phones are also
particularly good for doing this we want
to make this active and just use the
microphones there in every cell phone
cameras they're increasingly in cell
phones so the kids can create things
like this example which is modeled after
the physical birthday cake when you get
on your cell phone the candles are
flickering and use the microphone when
you blow into your cell phone and then
puts out the candles and plays the song
so you should be able to create your own
little animated greetings like that and
send it to other peoples the direction
we're hoping to go I want to end up by
talking a little bit about how we're
trying to get these ideas out to the
world because it's not just enough to
make the technologies you know we're
working hard on technologies like the
crickets and scratch we also want to
make sure that these ideas and
technologies get out to the world and to
reach everybody in the world not just to
you just put this online it's going to
reach a thin slice of people and we all
want to try to make sure that reaches
bill from all walks of life you know in
all different parts of society and
towards that end we will work on a
project for more than a decade now
called the computer clubhouse which is
an afternet work of afterschool centers
for young people from low-income
communities where they can come and
learn to design and create things
with computers and express themselves
creatively so it's not just about
getting access to technology but to
learn to express themselves creatively
with the technology so we have kids
doing things like one of the first kids
who came to the very first Clubhouse
which was in Boston he came in he hadn't
used his name was Mike he hadn't used
computers before but when the first
things did he loved to draw so he showed
him I we could just draw and then scan
it in so this one the first things did
it was drawn by hand scanned in he only
used the computer for adding color and
we think that's a good way to get
started start with something you know
and use the computer just that he'll add
a little bit to it by a few weeks later
he was doing things like this we was
adding layering and things that he
couldn't have done by hand on paper she
was trying to take greater advantage of
the computer I think what was most
important was by a few weeks later other
kids in the clubhouse had discovered
what he was doing they really liked what
he was doing and came to him for advice
so this astounding was done by other
kids but they said we learned how to do
this from Mike and that gave Mike a
great sense of pride because he was
doing some things that other people
cared about no one had come to him for
advice before like this even changed his
own artwork where initially you know he
was doing a lot of things with gang
imagery with guns and knives then he saw
ten he was 16 at the time and so 10 year
olds copying that is that they shouldn't
be doing that so he changed his own
artwork because he saw himself having a
role of responsibility in the community
you he went on to doing these are some
collages that he did he did some things
that were stolen were political he
actually even got a job at a local
company designing graphics for their
website so signed it enabled him to you
get a job and sort of benefit
economically financially but in my mind
was most important was not just the
financial economic side but the fact
that he saw that he could play a role in
the community there was a purpose to
what he was doing and he sort of start
to feel that there was there was a role
to play it was you know we've come in
pretty a lien ated from the rest of
society and now we saw there was a role
that could be played the great educator
philosopher John do we had a line about
education I always liked he said the
wrote that the goal of education is not
just learning to make a living but
learning to make a life and I think
that's what Mike was doing what he was
learning how to make a life so with
we've been trying to from the success of
the first Clubhouse you
we teamed up with Intel to sort of
spread these clubhouses around the world
we now have more than 100 club houses in
20 countries around the world we're kids
do all sorts of things this in Mexico
City we're in the middle of every club
us there's a green table where kids work
with physical stuff with glue guns in
balsa wood when I was visiting the
clubhouse in Mexico City did they were
taking apart some electronic device to
get a motor and making a plane but I'd
like the fact that across the clubhouse
for these kids were making a physical
plane another kid was using 3ds 3d
studio max in order to do a 3d rendering
of a plane and I'd like the fact of kids
being able to use lots of different
media physical and online media to be
able to create things in the world this
was in San Paulo Brazil when I was
visiting they were making costumes from
the south and making a video that they
were then editing this in Taiwan where
they're making New Years cards when I
was visiting this is in Jordan in Amman
Jordan where she was trading different
projects on the internet that connects
all the clubhouse we made an Internet
where kids at different club houses can
share projects with each other well in
fact this isn't this internet has been
very successful but I also have to give
it a special thank you to just recently
Google agreed to donate a google search
appliance for us because we want to
expand this level so we really need a
google search appliance with the help of
Jeff and others really a google search
appliance for be able to expand the
village to really help you know kids in
different clubs be able to share and
then find each other's work online this
is an Indian deli where there's a 13
year old it was using a microscope where
he could put things in the microscope
and get to see it on the screen enlarge
and then compare different images he'd
brought in a little vial of water from
home and we looked at it under the
microscope he was really disturbed by
what he saw because all the others junk
in it so that led him to start to look
around you what is it that you know how
this word get handled in the community
and this was a commute with no indoor
plumbing so he went around these are
photos he talked and he sort of
investigated how is it the Woodards
gathers typically the women in the
community go with jugs gather wood ur
not the most sanitary of conditions he
went around and they did surveys asking
people how do you store your wood or
well how do you treat your water he
gathered lots of samples you see all the
water samples there
to see and he and a friend sort of
evaluated they learned about it they
found out at least one thing you can do
is boil the water so he proudly showed
me in his home where he had now
convinced his parents we should boil the
water so in this case you know he really
felt that suddenly he learned at the
clubhouse was something that he could
really affect his family's health in the
short term no not everybody get to that
point you know it's not always on they
can really affect your health or welfare
in the short term but what's most
important is trying to give kids a sense
did you really can make a difference in
the world that by the things that they
experiment with things they create this
not just the world they don't have to be
passive in the world and we're assigned
to happen to them they can take
advantage of new technologies like with
a paintbrush and be able to sort of
you'll get their own ideas out to the
world I think that's what we're trying
to do both of the technologies we do you
know with the different types of
settings that we're doing projects
they've spun out for the middle of
Google actually has been a supporter of
100 our laptop project you probably know
that was start by the founder of the
meetup Nicholas Negroponte it is based
on some of these same ideas about trying
to get technology out there to let
people express themselves more
creatively biking putting new
technologies in their hands and I think
what we're trying to do with that is to
switch around this Jeff was saying an
introduction to ship the way people
think about the society it's not just a
matter of how can you get information
isn't as important as information is
just give me pal access to information
isn't enough they think what we will
really look at how can to make use of
that information to be able to get their
ideas out to the world because we think
you know increasing it's becoming clear
to us that success in the future withers
for an individual for a community for a
company or for country as a whole is we
based not on what you know or even how
much you know bread the ability to think
and act creatively you know with the
things with the information and
knowledge that you have and that's
really what's going to make the
difference so our hope is that through
some of these technologies and outreach
programs we're able to help prepare
young people so they're better prepared
for that creative society that they're
growing up into so we'd love to find
ways to work together with Google to try
to see how we could join forces with
this project like scratch come out I've
start talking some people here I might
try to help get that out and put in
hands and to distribute have more with
ways for kids to use the technology it
is increasingly ubiquitous it is getting
in the hands of kids but it's not just
America getting hit in the hands of kids
but making sure that they use the
technology in a way that's going to
prepare them to be able to have your
full you know satisfying lives in ways
that they can really contribute to the
society around them thanks a lot I mean
I'm happy to answer a question it took
ya so i had 10 fun scratch today really
and i found it creation because it's not
as constraining as my tour ok mysore
video is through some soccer I know how
to program stuff how much a rather trace
rashi bit better but you said you want
to get scrapped out to lots of people
off the communities but I always thought
exit miners is there an open source
project for that we're plan to share was
right now it's done beta form but we're
actually eventually get pills in but
we're planning to share the source with
people who are interested in we're not
so in how many people develop all sorts
of other you know Forks off of scratch
because we put a lot of time designing
things carefully and just have a mixture
of lots of your scratch versions out
there we don't necessary happy to share
the source with anybody's interested and
try to work together to try to add
different aspects to it so if you're
just feel free to contact us and
eventually once is it it sits out freely
downloadable we will put away that
people can download source if they're
interested in it second question
are surely the interactive but they're
just they're just like pre can survive
so they just they just get to interact
they don't get to invent so a lot of the
games are available especially on
open-source platforms like super taxes
good example one kids love to create
their own levels of summer times so they
go off and design the different bottles
and think about what's going to happen
30 play again yeah well I do you think
overall there are things moving in a
good direction they're more things there
are customizable I mean even just in a
minimal say it's just being able to you
know customize with skins there's little
ways in which people you get more
control and with games gradually over
time there's been more to be able to do
some general design but I think there's
a lot further that we can go I mean I do
think there a lot of things pointing in
the right direction but a lot of times
it's still just giving you a little bit
of control or when it gives you more
control it's not easy enough for a broad
number of people to use that so I think
we're so I agree there are other things
out there trying to do it they're also
other efforts to make through
programming languages accessible we're
talking with some people early about the
Alice project at CMU as some of the same
spirit there are some other things out
there but I think that I think it hasn't
caught on as well as it as it might have
three just want to go further with that
the questions or thoughts to suggestions
working you get scratch the executable
lease right now excuse me work okay okay
yeah if you go to and get to deal with
the baited you have to search a little
bit we just put the bait on line but
right now we're starting it away because
we're not there's not a lot of good war
materials for outside anywhere that I
could find yeah but if you look a little
bit going to the FAQ and it says on like
how do i download scratch and you can't
buy the link there okay but later this
year we're going to get promoted make it
more visible now we sort of only want
people to get it if they really wanted
at it so if you have trouble finding it
email which i can find it on the subject
of promoting scratch otherwise it looks
like a big part of that is the sharing
yeah content what types of interfaces
and systems
to enable kids from one part of the
world to really work with others and
share their ideas well some is both sort
of the technological infrastructure and
then serve the community building
infrastructure say yes right so again
this is again we're trying to model
after all those other things with user
content creation but even with the
growth of user content creation there
isn't very much interactive con you sir
created interactive content so we're
hoping that this see this be you know
giving more capabilities of user-created
and rat interactive content is where
we're hoping to do we're trying to
hopefully we'll have some infrastructure
where both within the scratch website
but also we're going to make it easy for
people to put their scratch projects
inside their myspace page so try to make
it easy for you to embed it within other
new web pages that you're creating and
then different ways of getting it out
there we even though we've tried to make
scratch as easy as we can and yeah I
think you've got some sense of it I
think it's easier than a lot of
traditional languages it's still not as
easy as many other things so trying to
get more places that can sport support
helping kids get started with it so
we're trying to team up with different
places doing teacher professional
development so I get it into schools
trying to work with after-school centers
where it can be introduced because i do
think for this really to get out there
you are going to need a network of
people who can help one another some of
it can be done online again we certainly
hope they will build an online community
where people have questions they can ask
each other online see how other people
did it and hopefully that can get pretty
far that way but I think we also still
need to build up a you know physical
infrastructure through schools after
school centers so we're trying to get
started with that as well so those are
different ways we're spreading it
something like that part of the viral
distribution yeah I'm happy
hot program or the animation that
someone made who distributed to others
in there I'm excited about it yeah I
want to then extend yeah people seeing
things they want the day get excited
about wanting to do things like that one
thing we're trying to we're just can't
start now if anybody is interested in
this feel free we're going doesn't feel
that we see as you know really great
interactive designers feel like you know
ken pearl and at NYU toshio why in Japan
who peeled using these beautiful
interactive graphic designs and try to
get them to do some things in scratch to
show what's possible with these tools
because I think that's one way to
inspire people but then also just saying
but you know a seventh person would a
seventh grader in Japan or France or
South Africa did they also can be very
inspiring so hopefully the just thing
other things are available the online
community what one thing always spurred
me to about the need for that to have
online community was with the logo
programming language which as some of
you know got out into schools in a
somewhat significant way in the 80s but
those are plateaued and it sort of
dissipated Marvin Minsky the MIT
professor and while the great you know
pioneers and AI his critique of logo and
why it didn't really get out there I was
he said that he said it's a nice grammar
but there was no literature and at the
high seas earth it's not a bad language
to work with but you can't see what
other people have done with it and
partly was out there pre you know
pre-internet so there weren't easy ways
to see what else is out there and be
inspired by other people have done and
to read what other people have done so I
do think we're in a much better position
now to create the literature around
scratch I really do think that's an
important part of trying to get out
there that will help spark it virally if
we get the right things out there and to
try to get certain uses of it like
sending interactive greeting cards in
the early days of the web when they were
the first sites with greeting cards that
really good tracted a lot of people to
the web when they found out that they
could send a greeting card you can just
get a link to see this greeting card now
we want to have kids make interactive
greeting cards and similar to make it
very easy for them just to you send an
interactive greeting card to a friends
and things like that some prototypical
uses of scratch that sort of catch on
and is one of the things we're hoping to
do but to be perfectly honest probably
we aren't going to come up with the
killer ways of doing it hopefully if we
get it out there other people will come
up with really creative ways of doing it
that will help spread it that's what we
hope okay hey wait thanks on if you want
to find when there's stuff on the web if
you're gonna actually scratch on mit.edu
for scratch or the crickets there's
typically they're called pico cricket to
be searched on that we also have you
know some little information here about
that if you're interested thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
