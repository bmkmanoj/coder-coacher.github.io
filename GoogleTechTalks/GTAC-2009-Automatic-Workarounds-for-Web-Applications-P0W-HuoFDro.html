we've got our next talk which is from
Mario and Andrea about automatic
workarounds they're from the University
of lugano and thank you very much so I'm
model and i'm from mexico gano and i
present a sort of the word on a working
progress in lugano about automatic
workarounds and as most of the academic
work would be more like a look ahead out
of them what we can do today and I'd
like to give you really a different
perspective in in what we are doing this
is a picture that I see as a metaphor
what what is going on today whatever you
have is when you have a problem in
system whether it's also you develop
memories during maintenance whether it
is during during operation you have to
go in a testing environment so if your
aircraft does not live because the pilot
sees is red light he would actually call
for maintenance and I've been actually
personally stuck in the airport for a
few hours just waiting for there for
there have to be repaired before leaving
and the question is really this you know
when you actually go through testing and
then to maintenance whatever its
automatic is manual is still driven to
the system Nautilus system by expert by
known expert you have to stop operating
and you cannot operate why test that's
actually the main problem that you see
and what we're trying to do in this new
project is really to move to a different
different completely different
perspective which is actually
represented metaphorical with this guy
which means basically you don't really
have to do anything you know what you
want to do is you don't you can probably
I don't think you can get everything out
i get the human out of the loop or get
rid of testing but what you can do and
what we hope we can do is basically have
someone or the system itself trying to
repair itself so instead of actually
have to stop and wait you would like you
to prefer to have the system working for
you and maybe continuing working and
that's actually very big saving time now
let me give you the perspective from the
most web oriented respect you know if
you have if you're a user of a web
application like up there and a failure
of course what happens is that you can
do match you basically have to report to
the
some bad report systems actually you
have to report as a user to your
application developers detection
developers may or may not be reachable
eventually he will actually report to
the bug report systems and someone
probably in this room we look at the box
and with their own priority maybe low
priority for them we try to fix the bug
will wig annoyed by this new wherever a
bug report we will ship the bag out and
it may take hours days weeks Emmy
nothing user I've been waiting for it
for weeks sometimes even more just for
the bottom it takes probably because it
does not in the priority list of a of
the of the Google developer and and
that's actually something that you can
simply stay and you can do much about
that and what really want to do is we
want to move to a completely different
scenario which is represented in this
way this is the scenario that I'm trying
to explain how to reach which is
whenever they the failure of course you
don't really look for your google
developer to actually try to fix the
pole not always a twist but you try to
you'll notify the failure to the GUI
application and that's one of the first
side part is we do which actually was
very well in web application which is
your ETA someone who tells you their
application fail it may not be easy in
all the cases but it's then it's easy
because you actually look at the
application and you see the application
does not react us as your spec so you
get something you don't want and you you
notify that that that failure to the
system instead of going through this
partially manual partially automated
part of the signals loop which in days
weeks month will actually return to you
the system basic and conducts will
immediately say oh look is this better
now and that's the idea underlying what
you are doing you trying to have the
system proposing a difference so we
shouldn't see whether you can actually
fix the solution that's fantastic and
how do you do that so the next question
is how do we really exploit workaround
well Oh ugly I or how do we really
really actually try to to solve the
problem and what we try to do is we try
to emulate what people do owe a manually
okay let's go
back for a moment and think about what
you do in your application does not work
okay and this is an example actually
it's a true example of the backs from
pelicula which is fixed now so don't
find it you can find it anymore but it
used to be in Flickr so you have your
your favorite photos and your favorite
pictures are on your site and they are
private for you now what you really want
to do you really for example want to
share it with your family and then use
not to work so that transition from my
own picture to my family picture did not
work in that specific girl is a freak so
what you do is basically you look at
here how can you do something about this
before notifying to my favorite
developers hoping he will actually react
to me and this is a flick developer not
Google developer by the way you go back
and say oh I can maybe try to use make
it completely public and then suddenly
immediately go to your family and you
did work in that case okay that's
exactly the kind of thing that people
would do you know if you interact with
an application the application fails the
first thing you do if you are this mark
user usually is actually looking at
application and say yes I can publicly
obtain the same effect that with a
different in a different way okay and
that's what we call a workaround and
that's what we call what we look for we
look for what we call intrinsic
redundancy what is intrinsic redundancy
intrinsic redundancies for us is
something which is in the code which can
be using the code and thus produce the
same or similar effect so the tricky
thing here is can we automatically look
for the redundancy in our code so that
we can actually then have the system
looking that redundancy in the code and
use that redundancies to automatically
find workarounds without requiring the
user to be smart or even without
requiring the user to be able to access
that redundancy because that's another
very important problem you know yet
example is fairly simple you can play
with the interface you know and I'm sure
I know probably many here had some
experience of finding to try to try to
get the same effect that actually didn't
get with the most of this approach by
finding some work around it to do that
manually as a user you really need to
sit down and be able to find the work
around through the interface and in many
cases in other case medicated
redundancies inside the system so in
many cases what you want to do is you
want
actually open the system look in the
system and use that redundancy and that
you cannot do that and why the system
can do it so as a conclusion for this is
you many want to have we learned that
your family is equal to anyone your
family so moving from only you to your
family is equivalent to moving from
anyone to your family another kind of
information is dragon trying to instruct
right let me tell you how we do that we
do that in two steps step number one
step number one is we look for what we
call equivalent sequences you have an
example equivalent sequences are
basically something that you can
identify and they tell you how let's
assume that they are there for the
moment so assume for the moment that we
can actually look at the system for
example the code for example
specifications and assume that we can
actually extract some information like
or whenever you do you family you go
from only you to your family you can
actually go that do you get the same
effect by going through any one and then
your family or whenever you actually
like to do an operation you can do
another operation instead you can do the
same operation and then another
operation and get the same effect okay
that's the kind of of information we try
to extract and I'll tell you how we do
that at the moment we actually assume
that we have this equivalent sequences
and what we do is is something like that
we try to have whenever the the user
does find a problem what it does is
simply signal so the the the problem to
the system in the system looks in this
repository of equivalent sequences which
is that with a good one lets you find a
good one and returns a new a new page
and hopefully that's correct and if not
you can repeat it again and again and
again of course you know up to the time
where the user set okay give up I don't
want to wait listen to you anymore so
there is always a trade-off between how
much the operation is important for the
user and how much time the user is won't
want to spend on the operation so if you
want to look at the page it doesn't show
pop-up will say okay forget about that
but if you really want to look at your
account bank account and inside that
they only want to know whether you know
you want to but what's your balance and
you have time till Monday to get a real
answer from bank you may actually like
try several times to get the information
so they know depending on the phone
import an important information you can
go through that loop once twice many
times so first part is how do I actually
create equivalent sequences second part
is how do I actually select the
equivalent sequence that solve the
problem which is the workaround what we
call the workaround let me try to start
telling you what how do i do a strat
equivalent sequences honestly what we
did we started with a long set of
experiments so one thing that we did and
you'll see it in the tank of whether the
talk we actually mind the weather the
Google back would posit or e to see
whether the where workarounds there that
understand what they were how they work
why they work whether they automated or
not and we eventually identified three
major classes of workarounds both of
equivalent sequences class number one is
what we call function in our operations
this our operation that affect anything
but functionality they may affect timing
that may affect scheduling that may
affect anything else but not the
functionally then have a simple example
that which is actually probably the
favorite work around in Google
application we found which is set
timeout settimeout does change the
application because in the set timeout
will have a different timing different
response time but does not change the
functionality should not change the
function on now we've noticed that in
many cases just inserting a set time out
my soul synchronization problems may
serve race condition problems by so many
different many little province that
often arise in many web applications so
what you do is they many cases although
the set timeout should not change at all
the semantics of your application when
the semantics is wrong when the
publication phase inserting the set
timeout sometimes helps you solving the
problem and that's one of the possible
classes and we have several others that
we show you later second class of
equivalent sequences is what we call
invariant operations there are
operations whose functional behavior is
important but they actually complement
each other so for example you may if you
have some some some
shown item on your room where my webpage
you can hide and show it again hiding
and showing something which is available
doesn't change anything or should not
change anything it had another kind of
thing that make really really helpful in
terms of solving little problems like an
interrelation problem like state
province so what you do you may do it's
basically yet that's actually interplay
hide hide and show and see whether they
actually work together on that the
second classes which we call environment
operations third class is what we call
alternative operations and that's what
we've seen before by the way and that's
what you see many very many times in
many different application which is in
many many cases you can really get the
same effect through different steps okay
for example in this case and that's
again from flickr so these are actually
example complete so we actually started
working on three good first you can set
tags of your favorite pictures and you
can add tags and it is set them multiple
set of tags i hope most of you are
familiar with flick the notices an
implication when it's set to toggle you
can set several texts to your picture
and then you know you have multiple
parameters but you can also set the
first tag and then add the other tax the
effect is exactly the same you know you
actually eventually have two tags
wanting to attach to your to your fifth
to your picture but the difference is
that you actually use different code so
is one of the code is faulty and
actually brings you to failure you may
try to the other one and hopefully
doesn't mean as in give you the same
thing okay now how do we work with that
let me give you some more examples and
try to explain you better what they are
and give some complete exams and they
take something get some of your familiar
with with its google maps okay these are
by the way you see up there issue number
519 this is this where issues that are
issue that you find in the depositor of
google map and there actually was an
important source of information for us
and that's one for example you know
that's a up there you see a piece of
code that is supposed to central map and
display a window and it doesn't work
here I don't know whether you see it by
the people window the picture has very
small battery for windows over the
border so you don't see the info window
on
top part of it or the picture and the
workaround that you find in the actual
battle posit Ori that lets you do it do
that to actually solve it is set them
out before before said center and this
all what I think is a synchronization
problem between the two things and you
know I think that simple step timeout
would actually give you the correct
dysplasia that's the kind of one example
of what we call functional operations
another example that's another one issue
1 305 that there is a function and in
google map again that allows you to draw
a polyline and that was faulty in some
old version these are all solve problems
so its history more than just the
reality so don't try now we put it on
they work now let's say polyline and at
that in that version you could actually
draw the vertices and you can see that
you know the beginning of the polyline
and then the vertices and you didn't see
the polyline and what was what is
suggested in the positive is again or
try to do something we should not do
anything but actually had to solving the
problem and that something is basically
delete and insert the last words okay
somehow and you know to me it sounds
magic because i'm not a google map
developers so i look at that say wow but
some of you may actually sound normal or
a reasonable by simply inserting
something that is exactly what we call
an invariant operational evaluation
which means you do you undo and do again
and you get exactly the same result then
doing that before drawing the polyline
would actually make the polyline work
okay sir the problem of the class of
workarounds is this one now again the
result of the picture does not help but
you may see up there a little red spot
in the top picture that's a marker and
you don't see I'm sure this button down
there that says delete market that you
can actually delete much you can remove
the marker basically now we have a
market that doesn't other than work
animals and you remove the marker that
the code that the issue and the press
the button
Marcus tears there and and again you
look in the repository and you find out
that you can actually substitute the
show and they hide operation with
different sets of operations so you
start with to the show with another girl
a show and if I said to do they hide
with the remove of the leg and they do
actually work and the effect is the same
is exactly the same song you press the
button the second time the market
correctly disappears on the pitch and by
the way remember I'm started with an
example which is basically playing with
the interfaces this is hidden to the
user you know your favorite developer
you can actually help you in renew
removing that the problem by inserting
was suggesting that work around to the
application developer but as a user you
click the bottom the marketer there over
change application if it may not be that
important but maybe important that you
can do anything then waiting for the
application to work so let me actually
now tell you about the second step for a
moment so right now what I try to to
show you is that there exists intrinsic
redundancy some intrinsic redundancy
it's of some given classes and can be
easy exploited actually can is exploited
manually in applications to solve
problems now let's go for it to step
further and see how do we actually
extract select the actual work around so
think about that you know I can spend a
lot of time and I'll show you why how to
collect the equivalent sequences now I
have let's say 10,000 equivalent
sequences in my my repository and my
user says oh fail and then I have to
pick up one I mean I don't think I don't
know how many users would actually try
ten thousand times faith faith faith to
pick at the good one okay so you really
want to have something and we are
experimenting with this kind of thing
which you call it a priority scheme a
priority schema which is it's very
simple at the moment we measure two
things one is the success rate and the
other one is the number of successes so
the success rate is abusing the ratio
between how many times you succeed
compared to how many times you actually
use that specific work around restlessly
people in signal
so you pick up setting out 10 times and
it was effective on least five times so
that's fifty percent of the times and
the saxes is actually how many times it
actually succeeded so let's say I have
two operational actually the example
here they have two operations I have a
set time out before the set Center and
that's a classic work around i would say
in google maps we use it 14 times and
out of 14 times we've got seven
successes another workaround is you
actually a dish show after the add
operation and another kind of work
around we use it only two times and we
succeeded once so we have the same
number of success rate half but we have
a different number of successes so our
strategy so far and there's something
that working on is that you actually
look at the success rate first and you
see how much how well it did head so you
prefer to get someone with the success
right-handed percent of the times rather
than ten percent will be times fifty
percent are than forty percent and in
the same class you actually prefer
something that has been successful many
times because it's likely to be such to
be successful model and then of course
you know these priorities will change
dynamically okay and so in this case
we're actually to pick up the first the
first of the two rules if it both can
apply to your faulty page okay that's
actually done automatically by the by
the system so we have somehow the way of
building this equivalent sequence
repository with all the possible
alternatives that can actually represent
a workaround and a very simple dynamic
mechanism that assign priorities and
tells you the more you succeed basically
the more likely you will succeed in the
future and one more thing is of course
pages may be used by more than one user
actually that's why we look for going to
walk around so let's assume that we have
a workaround that assume that our pool
user has had to go seven or eight times
through different faith faith faith
before actually getting a success so
what we do then is basically we store
the the valid workaround once the user
says yes that's one that succeeded so
that the next time the next you
will we try and with Fay we see the same
failure would actually it's at the same
time have a privilege workaround we
could actually attach the workaround to
the use of the page we don't do that yet
because we prefer the user to select
workarounds because they're not really
sure about how safely the mekinese so we
prefer to give you the plane application
and you feat your faith and you say well
once you fail you prefer to actually try
a workaround other than do nothing
that's another part of you actually work
on that now okay now let me go through
experimental part which is sort of
renewed for the demonstration we need
run experiments of course because that's
nice that's exciting i would say it's a
new idea but that it works so we built a
very simple prototype which is basically
a proxy okay you see proxy and the proxy
filters the communication should you
said if you have on the left and the
server get on the line right and in the
normal case the user ask something in
the proxy transmitted leslie request and
the pups it doesn't do anything but
inserting that little marker in the page
that allows the user to solitude to
signal a fault so the proxy needs only
to know which is the page and which is
the failure which page the Pharaoh
belongs to so nothing but recording the
flow of pages a worker when the user
gets a failure he can signal the failure
and then you actually activate what we
could they automatically round module
that search in the equivalent circuit
sequences that are available available
discard the one that are not applicable
to that specific page 21 that are
applicable try to understand which one
is they like the most likely successful
one apply that and return that with a
new page to the user who may be happy
and accept and that's an important
information because we store that
information say look let's valid
workaround for that specific page or may
not be happy and try again or simply
give up okay and how do we generate
equivalent sequences well we generate
them in Maine couple of different ways
here
I show you one way which is the one
where is it now and then there is
another way which is the one we are
working now the one really the one
you're using now is simply and we showed
experiment we rely on the ability of the
developers so the first time they use a
sickness a workaround we could ship it
to Google and we hope actually saw it
the first time they use a signature
failure we ship to Google we hope Google
actually corrects it and populates
that's populating the equivalence
another repository and in a short time
we have some something to try before
shaping their failure to peddle notice
to the Google designer and hopefully in
a short time we get to the repository
which is good enough for us to solve
some workarounds the other situation is
to take advantage of the knowledge that
you're building up right now which is
your understanding that there are few
classes of very frequent workarounds
that work very well can be generalized
can be extracted from the information
from the code and so we look at the
specification we look at the code and
i'm sure you can tell me who what are
the work around because you know I'm as
Nicolas via this morning said I'm a
professor so I don't problem anymore you
do actually sir I noticed that for
example set timeout is specified as
being having no functional operation so
you can say ok that's actually category
number one you may get a bit more
actually will show you later you can get
some other operation that we belong to
category number one so operation that by
construction by definition by
specification should not affect the
behavior the functional behavior of the
system and so can be inserted you can
look at this place other day at the
specification and say oh I know that
adding and removing it doesn't make any
difference so that is the second class
of workarounds or equivalent sequences
on it you know even you may even get
information about Oh adding multiple
tags or one target the time eventually
gets the same research and let the third
category so in the future we may
actually we are trying to investigate
now whether we can populate that that
repository with with a set of
workarounds of equivalent sequences from
the beginning okay right now we don't
have that about that we do have that
about about the first
so that's actually the the report of the
first experiment let me actually
illustrate that it's fairly simple
report so I tell you what we did we took
well our favorite bug repository family
because it actually contains a lot of
very well structure and useful
information not because it's
particularly potent which is the google
map one we looked at the issues that
were so that's a workaround so if you
look at the depository will find that
issue number 33 4961 271 blah blah blah
these are all issues that we identified
as shoulder with a workaround and we
simulated this game the first time we
start with an empty an empty an empty
people in sequence repository and the
first time we have failure the failure
is ship to Google and Google corrects it
and we actually take the correction
which is in that case a set timeout
before an opening info window which is
the null functional in a location and we
put it in my an hour equivalent sequence
repository stop then the second time the
users is signal set Taylor that's
actually the entry 49 in the repository
we see whether the the equivalent
statements we have it's only one right
now which is set timeout before by
window supplies and if it applies we
actually try to apply it to solve the
problem it doesn't so we ship it back or
we simulate the ship into the Google
designer and the Google join camera
comes back with another kind of work
around which is actually entertainment
alternative of sequence of operations
and we going on ahead you know the third
time like a the entry number 61 again we
try to understand whether what we have
so the problem or not again it doesn't
it's a set time out again actually which
is not the same set timeout so look and
that's where we bought now set timeout
works in many cases but you don't want
to simply insert the set amount that any
possible places a little line of code
because then you actually get millions
of different things
are actually privileged locations
because they're all locations before
instruction that are potentially
interfering with other structures
because of some salmon some some race
condition with some some some order in
condition so you put the set by mouth
before before an opening in info window
before it said center window not in
general and in our experiment we went
there he was sort of very frustrating
because we started the first the second
the third the fourth the fifth and none
of them was actually the user would all
the six was the seventh was and wonder
why after the fifth most time most of
the times you actually succeeded so what
you see in that picture is a two things
the first thing you see is down the this
red and green line okay that red and
green line is the summary of the 24
problems we actually analyzed in that
order in the Google that repository and
we try to use exactly this approach
start with an empty equivalent set try
to populate with the first first
equivalent sequence try to use that for
the second one fail populate again third
one fail it again and you notice that
after one two three four five then the
success rate is really really high okay
so we really have that if we had the the
this system in place we could have had
the most users happy so happily served
by the system itself without having you
guys involved in the in the inner
apparent ok let's because from a given
point on the set timeout be that such
Center is fantastic so the lot of things
the set timeout before the opens the
opening for windows source a lot of
things way and so on and you see also we
actually record that this tournament is
not that big actually it's only 24 24
problems so far but you see we have the
the workarounds we've been using in the
24 cases so if L is reasonably small
amount ok it gives you also data feeling
that is not that you have one problem
one workaround and other problem and
other work around another problem rather
work it out no
you have one problem one workaround Oh
another problem the same workarounds
work again or the same workarounds work
again so that's why we are really
thinking that in the near future we can
actually give some some partially
automatically automated rules that can
say okay look pick up all the operations
that shares some common features with
opening for windows with center the
features of obviously the possibility of
interfering because of a different
timing and generate automatically
potential you potentially use of useful
work around which is to the set timeout
before okay pick up and so we really
think that this can actually be
automatically applied at Matthews a
narrative even if you cannot
automatically generated we can simply
live with the same situation we have now
for the first part of the first life of
the system and then so on get to the
point that the number of of blog reports
goes from like 100 to 10 at least for
this specific kind of blocks but we have
another thing around fear which I try to
explain you what it is because the other
question is how much do we annoy the
user of course you know where the shoes
of the user right now you try to get
something done and you fail okay being
able to say oh fail and then you get
another reply which is correct or place
again failing and another advantage is
correct I'm sure you don't mind with two
or three times not for every page of
course you know but let's say once in a
while you would mind we do it 20 times
so we also measure the efficiency of our
priority schema which is fairly simple
and of course it works on a small set of
workarounds what you think that they can
be applied in many different point of
the JavaScript so in general you know
the single workaround can be applied
many different times and we found out
that we have measured the average number
of attempts for each work around default
solving the problem so one means the
highest priority work around the deep
work for the first time okay and in many
cases is actually the results in the
woods cage we had so far is 2.8
so within at most three clicks we often
get in average we sold the problem so
that's an average number of application
where work here comes easily it's a good
measure actually you know you can
actually we have I think the worst case
was 10 which is annoying but not that
annoying compared to waiting for three
months for someone you don't know so the
observing the problem in sending in
shipping the solution okay so
applicability okay so so far I try to
convince you that you have a good idea
that's easy and that it can work little
bit more difficult how often can it work
no because I say yeah yeah great if you
can solve two problems prior oh come on
you don't really you don't really going
to be help us too much I do what you
know so we try to start this simple
measure which is we took her again the
Google Maps repository and we use the
simple search mechanism which is look
for pattern matching look for work
alerts and we found the world
workarounds in 63 different angles so I
don't have enough students to actually
have them looking at each single end of
each single pole but you know I could
have people looking at that 63 so we
look at at 63 and only 43 actually are
workarounds because you know the word
workarounds appeared since things like
oh this is a problem it may be so good
to work around and that's not a
workaround you know what there are some
cases where it is actually working on so
out of the google map repository we've
been able to identify 43 actual problems
that have been sold with the workaround
and then we took them and we try to show
them with our automatic to automatically
generated equivalent sequences and we
found that 14 out of them have been
happening so can be solved so now if
there is anyone strongest at this ticket
stop here because you know cause the
numbers are small so you can generalize
too much but at least in this experiment
we can claim that we actually can find
automatically 33 one-third of the
workarounds that you guys generate
manually right now not a big number in
absolute terms 14 but if you generalize
well enough and you think how many times
you actually use that for work solving
the workarounds it can be a big amount
of saving in terms of the not they work
now at this point I want to convince you
even more by having alessandra showing
you a short time about what we did a
substantial it's under will show you
both for two different experiments about
the effectiveness of the work around and
the effectiveness of this of this a
notification of this access to the to
the actual thanks MA room can you hear
me yes okay so I'm going to talk about a
couple of issues in google maps so is
there any Google API developer near put
much better like this so that you don't
hate me okay now let's see what happens
when when the user is not using the
automatic workaround approach so here we
see a Google map pretty simple that can
be dragged and as you can see there is a
marker in here that is centered in
Zurich where we are now and what we
should see is an info window that
appears as soon as the these are clicks
on the marker but trust me I'm clicking
and nothing happens so what the what can
what can be user do now nothing the user
can just hope that the the person who
developed this page somehow realizes how
to try to find a workaround and avoid
this problem or wait until the developer
goes into the Google Maps issue page and
report the issue to the google map
developers and wait until the developers
fix the problem and this is this is
actually a known issue this is the the
issue number 11 18 and as you can see
it's been reported in here and it's now
fixed but yeah again until the the
developers don't fix the problem then
the user keeps experienced this and all
the applications were using that
particular function that fails we'll
we'll also have failures you know so
knows other pages but now let's see what
happens when when the user is that is
using the automatic workarounds approach
so now i'm going to start the proxy
okay and now I already configured my
browsers to go through through this
proxy so now as soon as I reload my page
the requests will go through the proxy
so now let's see works so as you can see
I again have exactly the same page but i
have now this small button on the top
left corner that says find workarounds
automatically so when the user sees that
the page has a problem as we see here
because again the application is not
working because when we click on the
market and nothing nothing happens the
user can now say that there is a problem
here and we see that the page the map is
reloaded so and we see that now the
application is working so whenever I
click on the other marker I successful
you can see the info window now let me
try to tell you a bit but what we did
and by doing that I need to show you the
original code of the google maps api
that we signed in the page as you can
see it's pretty easy yes you can read it
better so basically in that in that map
we just create a map then we set the the
center to the desert to the Google
Zurich office then we add a marker and
then we associate to to the marker an
info window okay and the issue that
we're talking about actually involves
exactly this operation here so basically
the problem is that for an old version
of the Google Maps API this method was
just not working so what what indeed I
was working was too and this is now I'm
showing you the new code that
being loaded after we try to find a
workaround as you can see it's exactly
the same but he here the binding for
window HTML has been substituted by by
an operation that is equivalent that is
associated to a marker the function that
are opened an info window HTML and
whenever the click event of course okay
so this was easy because we managed to
do it very first time but we'll see that
it doesn't always happen so now let's go
on to the to the second case study again
we have another another google map in
this case i cannot drag them up so it's
fixed i have instead a fixed marker and
if I click on it I see again where we
are it is the Google office and then I
also have another market that can be
moved okay by clicking on this marker I
should again see in any for window but
again I don't see it so this is another
issue that is known in Google Maps API
it's the issue number 33 and it's it's
pretty annoying because it's one of the
oldest but it's still open although
there is a workaround so in the in this
case the user tries to ask for a
workaround and we see that it doesn't
work we'll see now what is the the first
work around that has been tried and so
maybe I should first show you the
original code it's this one as you can
see that in the original page the there
is nothing but the creation of the map
then the creation of a market that is it
can be dragged and if you notice this we
associate to the to the marker the the
info window by using the app
operation and then we do the same for
the other marker so if you remember the
previous case we used exactly and now
i'm switching to the the new JavaScript
code that is the zig has been executed
now but that still doesn't work as you
see the first work around that has been
tried is to substitute the listener too
with the bind info we do HTML why
because it worked before so it can work
also in the other way but in this case
it didn't so now we go on I try to ask
for another workaround and and I mean we
broke the application anymore because
now we don't even see the markers now
again again if you want to see the code
of the new code that is pin loaded is
clean this case is to is to add a set of
time out here a while disabling the
dragging and let me go yes so but still
it doesn't work as you can see now we go
again and finally I can tell you already
that this this is finally successful ok
and i can see that i can still click on
the on the fixed marker and still the
application is working and the map is
still not great not drag about so now
i'll show you the valid workaround that
is basically to insert a set time out
when you you call the opening for window
HTML function and so what is the point
here well in the first case study we
successfully could find the work around
at the very first time this time it took
us quite a lot of attempts before
finding the valid workaround
so as Mara said so actually since we
found the workaround I should actually
say to the system that I found it and so
now that I found a workaround what
happens if another user is as asking for
the same page well I'll simulate this by
opening another browser and by calling
again the same page as you can see in
here the the user still experience the
the problem because by clicking on the
marker nothing happens but as soon as he
finds he asked for a workaround than the
the one the the workaround that was
successful for the other user is the
first one that is tried so this that's
pretty much concludes the demo so I'm
gave the word back to tomorrow such that
it can
okay so couple words for concluding and
I think you asking questions hopefully I
wanted to sort of start from the
beginning and tell you what we really
try to explain here first of all a
completely new way of looking at the
problem you're not trying to solve the
testing profit by itself although we
have as a project on that we're trying
to actually look at a different
perspective which is not substitute but
complement test you know we cannot get
rid of testing we do not we do need the
good testing what we're trying to do is
we're trying to get rid of some of the
annoyance comes with after testing when
you actually get system despite good
testing despite good maintenance still
breaking into into into in the real
world and the other thing is this is not
a magic tool so it doesn't solve every
problem you know in fact we actually
focus only on the problem that can be
sold through automatic workarounds and
smote rounds and some of them cannot be
so automatically at all so in general
the goal is not actually the gold could
be to solve all problems regardless what
they are but you know let's say our less
less shorter term goal will be actually
to solve some of the process and you
know we really believe if we get rid of
ten fifteen percent twenty percent of
the user reports we save a lot of money
we save a lot of effort and we put that
effort in many other different things in
other hand we notice is that and you've
seen that there is a sort of a set of
information that accumulates and may be
useful to develop at itself so in some
cases and we mentioned like the sandbox
which are still open and we actually did
we didn't show that we don't have time
but we are not starting this new
experiments which is get the repository
of workarounds we have now apply it to
open problems and try to see whether it
works and it did work actually indeed in
a couple of prior cases of course you
know is not that frequent you know
because first of all because it takes a
lot of time for each experiment and
again I don't have that many students to
be able to run too many experiments in
panel but you know it is actually
interesting too
see that sometimes you get an open
problem that probably simply did not
attract the attention of anyone in
Google yet and it can be solved actually
maybe no it's not the solution it's
basically like a sort of patch that you
put on the problem to let the user work
bit better without actually interrupting
their their flow of operations as I
mentioned before the beginning it's an
open the nopin project we are we putting
out of effort in if you get in the first
good results out of it we believe it is
applicable more extensively than just
web application and we are actually
applying it to other other classes of
applications we have some problems
although without lights publication
because there are two elements that
actually I didn't mention it's basically
but actually very important in this kind
of application the user can actually
reported a problem you know in in
another system reporting the failure is
not easy and the other problem that we
have is you can apply the workaround as
many time as you want and the page
reloads completely and reloading the
page reloads complete to the page you
know you don't want to be in tribal with
the database where you actually try to
serve as many information as you want to
try to show the problem so you have the
problem of stability of state so it's
not that generalizable we see a big
improvement in being able to generator
is equivalent sequences I will soon
Alice al tamari I and I think we can do
that we the one thing is actually
important we really need more more than
normal experiments now let me spend one
word on vector and to include really i
want to say google maps is not just
sweeter for this audience it's also
important for us because a specific
advantage that I defined only in google
maps which is we do have a very
well-documented set of box and we can
actually reproduce the bugs it's
actually very important for us and we
are thankful for to google for this
because i think that's maybe without
even knowing it but was a bit a big help
to our to our work and my last message
is if
you have problems if you have bad
repositories you may not want to
disclose all owe everything to us but
just shit the problem to try and we may
tell you whether the system works and it
will be wearing began to rise
alright so from my experience developers
don't like testing developers don't like
debugging a developer likes progress and
then likes release and have more
progress do you worry at all that while
this kind of automated workarounds is
useful and good for the user it
discourages the developer from actually
fixing the root cause of the bugs by
making it less of an issue for them oh
that's actually a very interesting
question because we we did have a much
larger project at some point with was
about self feeling so this is part of it
actually which is not just try to find a
workaround but just to fix the whole
system and we working on a European
project with the company developing
software for avionics in aerospace and
they said we don't want that stuff
because we don't really want our
engineer thinking that they can develop
bodies of just because we can
automatically fix it but that's a human
factor mode you know I think yes you're
right I think let me say one more word I
think that's the way I teach actually
the software engineering is first of all
and human intellectual intensive
activity brain intensive activity and
any time you must believe you must think
that the human is in the Libyan you
cannot be at the lumen are you man how
to dilute II of course if you look at
this as oh yeah i can ship for baggage
softer because anyhow somebody else will
take care of that that's going to be a
disaster but if you actually put this in
place in pattern what we have now and
what is actually proving out that's
going to be much much better and if i
can add something from our experience
with all the the box that we started on
google maps basically all except one
that have it really has a workaround
known all the bugs have been fixed
anyways I think also the ability to to
identify a workaround automatically can
also help the developer to find a better
fix because for a workaround that we
don't know why it works can be a useful
information for the developer because
the developers for sure has no more
knowledge about the
how does this system know what is the
problem in a demo we don't see how to
use a reporter problem and the second
question is how if you have some
equivalent sequences for a particular
problem in your repository how do you
identify how to link it with a new
problem what's the crowd here and you
decide that these two problems are
actually similar or the same okay the
first one is fairly simple the user has
this little button on the top that says
I try finding a workaround actually
probably you know in the demo you've
seen this information on the top which
was used for the demo you know i will
just a saying wrong page try again you
something like that you know because I
understand that you know the classic
user would not say find an automatic
workaround say wrong page give me
another one you know and that's exactly
that's a very good point actually as I
mentioned that at the very end it's a
very good point because actually that's
the major one of the major problems in
applying these techniques outside the
web application vironment because we
really need someone who tells us this
fail so in this case they user clicks
and say page failure and that's when we
trigger the application we try to use it
like for java programs and developers
value i play and then it's going to be
more visible for the same page the
problem can be that the methodist the
map is the wrong map or the scale is
different oh yes oh yes yes no no okay
so the only information we have is an
economical the first question is at some
point the users is something that does
not satisfy it clicks the new patrons or
try to fix it please Ron page we fix it
let's actually played the second
question is if you look at the different
workarounds that we had okay there is a
constant we didn't actually we do have a
formal formalization of the workarounds
that actually tells you how to apply
then you can see that for example the
first one says if you have an open win
info window you may actually set a time
out now before now if you don't have any
opening for window doesn't apply it
applies only
two pages with an opening for window
another one says you can actually
instead of a double a you can switch
between a delivery and I show or removal
I and hide okay again if you don't have
any of these occurrences in the code it
doesn't really help you so it's
basically by context and going back to
the question that's actually I say I
it's not magic it doesn't solve the
problem of the times it may serve the
wrong problem in fact we've seen you
know in the second example it right
seven times before actually get into the
problem the question is not enough so
let's say you should not see this as an
alternative to a full tolerance system
on your favorite aircraft you know don't
take that you know it's more like it's
more like you know I'm i really wish i
knew what what's in that position and
they can get to the info window okay can
you try against once more can you try
once more and we mainly you know in fact
in many case you will fail completely
and you know the user tries to three
times i look i don't care anymore what's
new on this end oh so you can think of
that not just like the absolute solution
so for example if the problem is that
you want to brag the page and it doesn't
like okay of course then you know there
may be actually working under the place
so that's so in fact what Alexander
showed you are two things was failure
click the Trichinella fold try to see
whether it's all the problem you've seen
for example that the Sun cases the to
market disappears a G no it's not what I
want it may actually have been what you
wanted you know but it was not so we
don't the system does not know what is
what's right let's not even know what is
wrong it simply knows that there are
some elements that can be actually fixed
and fixing maybe rock so but the point
is in in one-third of the cases it has
been correct and that's actually what's
in colleges us concerned is also sort of
answering the second question yeah what
could see the user has to click
something yeah have you thought about
trying this in with real users and
seeing how many times they would
actually click fixes automatically
there's a your average user if something
takes more than a second to load is
going to go right so I want to move to
another website because on board of this
they're going to probably click fix
fixes automatically once if they're
going to click it at all and then move
on have you thoughts are you going to
tackle that option well you mentioned to
kind of users real users and the average
users i will use as a student so they
are rare but not average so no they
wanted to be honest now the prototype
has been is in the early stages so we do
actually work on pelletized we do
actually work with students we cannot
afford to work with real users yet you
know the test average Jesus oh and of
course you know if I tell students can
you try and see how many times it works
so they would try and try and try and
try and try and try they would not stop
so this again they see my factors of
this psychological factor they say how
many times you try before giving up like
you know I can't report you you know and
you probably know them very well you
know many users do not go to be on the
second play the second colleague or do
not although you know the glute
encouraging gorjan think is this one
which is many cases the first time you
click you get the right page so i assume
you open your let's say the University
of you can open web page and you up a
yoke open the google map and you know
there is a nice mark here and you want
to get information and doesn't get
anything and you really want to let it
to come to unity of organism you click
again instigating at the information and
i think once is worthwhile but no we
didn't actually make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
