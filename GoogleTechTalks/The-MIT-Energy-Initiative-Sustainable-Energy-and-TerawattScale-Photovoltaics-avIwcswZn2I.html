about MIT Energy Initiative and some of
the specifics within that my name is
Doug spring I'm a MIT alumnus class is
65 I'll be the host for our two speakers
here today who I'll introduce in a
second first I'd like to express my
appreciation to Kevin Chen who
unfortunately couldn't be with us today
but he helped set this up and also Alice
Ryan who's helped us with logistics so
Thank You Alice
so as we all know the world's energy
challenges are enormous in scope and it
would be hard enough just to meet the
growth in energy requirements but when
you start talking about replacing
petroleum fuel based ways of or coal
based ways of generating energy with
renewable and you consider the terawatts
scale that you're talking about and
everything you realize that to address
this challenge you need some major major
breakthroughs in the cost and the
scalability of the renewable energy and
we're seeing some successes here and
there along the way but we're a long
long way from achieving that result one
of these things is though as trained
engineers or scientists or people who
have worked in technology industries
here at Google for instance and
elsewhere in Silicon Valley we know that
technology can be a major leverage
factor in terms of addressing issues
like cost the scalability and so that's
the one of the reasons for being
optimistic about what we can do so we're
here this afternoon to explore with with
you all some of the possibilities of
addressing this challenge particularly
in the area of solar and we'll tell you
a lot more about it once we get into it
we call this program mighty on the road
and it's the MIT Energy Initiative so
MIT EEI and Energy Initiative mighty is
how we pronounce it the on the road
basically means that we want to bring
MIT to you and tell you more about the
research that's going on at MIT in the
area of energy because we know that many
of you are extremely interested
in this and and we want to tell our
story the energy initiative and I need
to advance the slide okay what I wanted
to do yeah
the energy initiative at MIT was kicked
off about three or four years ago by
Susan Hockfield who was at that time the
new president and since then at this
time even over twenty percent of the
faculty is actively engaged in energy
research and there's a MIT energy club
that was established about the same time
this currently has 1,700 members it's a
completely student-run organization and
and the consequence of looking at this
is is that energy has become a huge
program at MIT and as evoked a really
passionate response in the part of both
students and faculty Daniel Anderton is
sitting down here will be our first
speaker he's a former president of the
MIT energy club he's going to give you a
brief overview of mighty followed by a
more in-depth presentation on the
sustainable energy revolutions program
or have affectionately called SERP s ERP
so Daniel is going to tell us about that
first a little history on why we're
doing this mighty on the road in April
this year the MIT Alumni Association
conducted a survey of its alumni and
that wanted to find out they want to
test basically the law is interest in
and ideas for further more more
significant engagement in the area of
energy and environment and so we
designed a survey for the alumni and
sampled the base and the results that we
got were pretty amazing and and one of
the things that was surprising about the
results were that they were totally
uniform it didn't matter what kind of
course you took what what generation you
graduated in or anything like whether
you donated or not donated to the
Institute everybody had the same kind of
feeling about energy in the environment
and in fact 70% of the alumni surveyed
you describe their personal interest as
either strong or passionate and in about
20
percent of them actually said passionate
which is a kind of an office shark
charts kind of a result I think I don't
know how many of you have ever answered
passionate to a survey I it's the first
time I ever did so so I found this kind
of amazing and so we felt like we really
had something but it gave us the the
reason for bringing MIT more out
basically on the road if you will to to
the people that are out in the regions
because the region's people the region's
said hey we don't have to go back to
Cambridge Massachusetts to find out
what's going on we'd like to know more
about it where we live and work and so
that's one of the reasons why we're
doing this here also in the survey
alumni indicated their areas of interest
and the biggest one was in the area of
renewable energy particularly solar was
the strongest win was number two and
also in storage as a key enabler for
being able to store these more
intermittent sources of the energy to be
used for later on and so those were all
really oriented indicated as very very
important subjects to go over and the
technology research going on in those
areas what they want to know about so
that's why we've asked professor Tonio
bonus but it's easy to come here talk
specifically about solar seems to be one
of the more interesting areas for just
MIT alums but I think out here in
California it's even worse it's
significant now why would we bring MIT
to Google you know yeah we know there's
quite a few MIT alumni here but a lot
more that or not and two reasons I think
number one is your company is extremely
well known as a very environmentally
oriented and sensitive company and we
understand that you know that there's a
lot of personal interest in the
employees here as well and and the
second thing is a large number of
technical people and who can grasp the
technical significance of the kind of
work that we're doing so so those are
the two major reasons for this but have
we upped admits kind of a test you know
to see how it goes see what the reaction
is and so on now of course out here in
California the solar revolution is in
you know full force
we got dozens of solar startups again
millions of dollars of venture capital
money that have gone into this
in the Bay Area alone in the state of
California with its million rooftops
program is promoting solar on the roof
and so on and so forth so you know we
live in an environment out here where
this is a really big issue and we're
blessed with having a wonderful climate
to to help solar along so that's another
reason why we asked Tony Oh bonus easy
to be our first speaker and what we hope
to be is actually a series of events so
thinking maybe about once every three
months to have a new speaker in these
topical areas that that we mentioned
okay so professor Bowen acini is going
to follow Daniel Anderton in the program
we'll talk about some of the technical
challenges and some of the possibilities
of how we can scale up to the terawatts
with solar photovoltaics so here's the
agenda I just did you're welcome Daniel
is going to give the overview of the
energy initiative and then followed by
Tonio to the terawatts scale
photovoltaics and then we'll have time
for Q&amp;amp;A at the end as long as you'd like
actually so the annuals gonna be about
15 20 minutes
tonio is gonna be about 30 or so and Q&amp;amp;A
you know there we go Daniel
so as Doug indicated I work for the
Energy Initiative I'm the executive
director of the sustainable energy
revolutions program which is basically
an extremely long winded way of saying
that my job is to help build renewable
energy research programs and so actually
what I want to do real quick is just
kind of give you a quick overview of
some of the things that are going on in
energy at MIT I would be potentially
good sort of resource just to sort of
help facilitate connections between
yourselves engineers and engineers back
at MIT if that's of interest and also to
talk a little bit more about my program
something sort of close to my heart so I
actually I don't know if you can read
this from back here but we were
fortunate to have the the president come
back a couple of weeks ago and he gave a
talk on energy but also did a quick
whirlwind tour of some labs beforehand
and some students talk there professor
vladimir vulovic into getting the
president to sign a deputy
chamber for him and so it says good work
Barack Obama and so now they're trying
to figure out how to sort of encapsulate
that so that you know the the rigors of
lab use doesn't sort of where'd away
over time so as as Doug said the the
energy issues been around for three
years it was started by our president
who came in just before that and this is
actually one of her major initiatives
she's really working to sort of harness
the enthusiasm and direct the Institute
towards energy and out of which was
formed the MIT Energy Initiative has
four main parts research education
campus energy and outreach research sort
of spans quite a gamut of research and
it's really driven by what the fact that
these interests are there's quite a bit
I mean eighty five percent of our
primary energy comes from fossil source
a lot of it just thinks about how to
consume produce and consume fossil
energy more efficiently both supply and
demand side a lot of it I probably the
majority of the research is going on is
sort of looking towards renewable energy
and storage options sort of transforming
the energy systems of tomorrow a lot of
also just sort of basic undercutting
science the sort of crosscut slot
technology systems analysis so on and so
forth education there is a there's
definitely a dearth of talent to be able
to go into the energy workforce develop
technologies implement new business
plans and that sort of thing is there's
a major effort underway to sort of
educate
sort of develop curriculum and programs
towards educating students to go off and
work in the energy field campus energy
if we're gonna get serious about doing
work in energy we should look at our own
carbon footprint our own energy use and
see what we can do about it and we have
a rather old campus that affords as many
opportunities to think about how one
retrofits existing building stock and
then finally outreach uh there's there's
definitely I mean that there's an
elevated level of public discourse on
energy at the national scene a
university can have a really good role
in terms of trying to be an honest
broker about sort of the intersection of
technology policy economics regulation
and try and sort of help this sort of
guide
see and and decision-making is so forth
and so there's been a lot of outreach
work really focused at a kind of a
national level which I'll highlight and
so what I'll do is I'll just kind of
give a quick example of something that's
going on each one of these areas the one
that I'll do the least is research
simply because Tonio is going to give
you some really directed comments and
research so so all I just want to do
here is say that solar energy is our
most sort of robust program analysis
there's over 40 faculty that are working
this area the only thing that I kind of
want to get across with this slide is
just simply that we're trying to sort of
work with all sorts of different key
players we think it's really important
working with industry both big like any
but also small a lot of startups
building philanthropic lis supportive
programs building government support
programs working with other nonprofits
like Fraunhofer and Masdar they all have
they all have really important roles to
play and we and and we think it's really
important to sort of be able to team
with all education so so at a lot of
universities you take a very deep dive
into your program Chemical Engineering
double e whatever it is that you're
doing but if you want to go on and work
in energy oftentimes a lot of context is
needed so for example let's say a
student from Tonio's lab is sort of
studying some defect engineering but
they're interested maybe commercializing
something that they're developing well
they really need to know some things
about business they need to know some
things about sort of economics policy
basic science engineering so on and so
forth and so the idea is is that
undergraduates now have the opportunity
to take this minor which is the first
kind of cross-cutting Institute minor
that we actually have at MIT with the
idea is that they complement their sort
of core course of study with other areas
like energy science social science and
sort of technology and engineering the
idea to sort of prepare more
well-rounded students when they when
they want to then exit the Institute and
go off into the workforce and actually a
really important part of that as well is
that includes sort of research and very
hands-on projects seen at the
undergraduate level i campus energy so
we have a lot of really old buildings
that don't have sort of the latest sense
so forth and so here's a really good
example of actually a student project
aimed at reducing electricity
consumption for lighting purposes the
the building on the the upper panel is
the Frank Gehry Stata Center it's the
the II Electrical Engineering and
computer science building and all around
it are these older buildings and so
they've set up cameras in the windows
and this is the the lower left panel is
the camera looking at one of these
buildings and it's there's an algorithm
such that it takes a picture every 20
minutes it can its figured out sort of
which lights are on and which are off
and then sends an automated email to the
occupants of that room they've left
their lights on to sort of give them a
sort of a nudge sort of a behavioural
prompt so to say which is kind of a nice
work around when you have an old
building stock something something
really similar chemistry fume hoods if
you leave like a modest-sized fume hood
open it's about the same power
consumption as a mod as a house and so
it's very easy to leave these up when
you're done with your experiments or
when you're in the middle of it and so
similar sort of thing putting in sensors
to automatically sort of prompt the
users to close the fume hoods when
they're done and department chemistry
expects to save a hundred thousand
dollars annually just just from
implementing these sensors in the fume
hoods so these are a couple of things
that we're trying to to do on campus
actually something that may be of
interest to the to the to you guys is
there's a lot of interesting research
that's going on too in terms of things
like trying to do remote sensing to
detect opportunities for energy
efficiency improvements so some thermal
imaging sort of a spectrum from
satellite or land-based systems actually
it's a professor Sanjay sama or someone
who works with Tonio bone and ccc so if
anyone's interested in going into that
and more teton happy to chat about it
afterwards and then finally I'll just
mention a little bit about outreach so
like I said we've tried to take on these
series of studies that are really
focused on on doing sort of honest
assessments of different parts the
energy sector here's a few of our
studies that we've done on the Left done
on coal nuclear power a do II
commissioned one
thermal another one on sort of looking
forward in the transport the light duty
vehicle transportation fleet in the US
all actually the the three up the three
on the kind of upper left have actually
all resulted directly in legislation at
the national level pre coal in the case
of policies to encourage demonstration
scale facilities for carbon
sequestration because that's kind of one
of the impedances to understanding if
that is going to be a viable technology
deploy at scale the geothermal court was
kind of one of a number of pieces that
sort of helped prompt the de to
resurrect their their geothermal program
which had previously been zeroed out the
three that we have ongoing right now are
solar energy natural gas and the future
of the electric grid you can actually
bother Tony about it after season with
the author's on the solar study for
natural gas it's about halfway through
the study and they're already they're
coming up with some real interesting
results they've they've done a really in
depth of supply assessment of shale gas
and and they've they've really helped to
show just the the absolute abundance of
shale gas that we have in this country I
mean sort of available at the five to
seven dollars an mm BTU level now but
but that that price is going down and so
that really changes with the energy
dynamic in the US and so these are all
available online you can read the report
so you can see the studies I can give
you a links to them they might be of
interest and so with that what I'll do
is I'll just describe a little bit of
about the program that I'm working on
and so the that there's kind of two
pieces to it the first is the solar
revolution project and so here what it
is is is we find this this case where
oftentimes you have a professor that has
a really good idea and it doesn't really
fit in a good box so for example maybe
one of the specific programs that the do
e or or companies aren't sort of ready
for and so oftentimes what you need to
be able to move the the technology
development along is is just a little
bit of a kick start fellowships a little
bit of support go manual here and so
what we try to do is pair a faculty with
really novel ideas with foundations and
don't
so Doug being one of them just so nice
family being another one to try and move
an idea to the point where you can get
it where you have a proof of concept you
can have a paper a patent something
where you can take and you can really
demonstrate your you're onto something
so set such that you can apply for a
relatively large research program with
the do-e or engage in industry in sort
of a fruitful collaboration and really
build large robust research programs and
so an example so this isn't just some
some random picture off the web of some
dapper looking gentlemen it's actually
Don Sadoway who's a materials professor
at MIT and he does actually dress like
that every day he's kind of to the nines
with his suits so he he had this really
interesting idea or this is kind of
challenged in large-scale storage where
what a lot of people have been thinking
about in terms of batteries is trying to
teach it or trying to get a device that
you know how that can storage hard and
try to teach you how to handle a high
current which needs them it's something
you need for a grid scale application
and it's been really hard to sort of
scale up something like a lithium-ion
battery and so he's kind of turned it on
his head where he had this idea well
let's take a high current device and try
and see if we can't teach it how to
store a charge and so he comes from a
metallurgical background and so he's
very familiar with aluminum smelters
which is like there's no better example
of a high current device and so what he
did it was kind of turn an aluminum
smelter into a battery by by using a
liquid anode a liquid electrolyte and a
liquid cathode that are all density
separated and through through just
basically a fellowship supported by that
your sonís foundation was able to you
can't see this too well but this is
actually sort of maybe about five
centimeters in the vertical was able to
sort of demonstrate this liquid metal
battery concept at the crucible scale
and so you can actually see the
electrodes new lecturer right here and
and this sort of proof of concept you
know just in terms of thinking about
like the materials that were used and
their abundance in the earth and them
how much they cost the number the cycle
performance they're able to get kind of
at this scale so on and so forth that
they think they're onto something and
they think they can do it on a much
larger scale
and because they were able to kind of do
some of these preliminary explorations
with through the help of the foundation
they're now able to over the course of
basically a year and a half leverage
that into an eleven million dollar
research program both with total for
home scale applications and arpa-e which
is a new deal we program for much larger
great scale applications so we really
think there's something to this model if
we can kind of help these projects along
it's just the earliest stages that we
can really get them ready to sort of
really launch off with government and
industry so the program that I'm running
is the idea is to take this first to
continue to grow it within the solar and
storage communities at MIT that's that's
where we have kind of some of our
biggest areas of faculty interest and
there's there's so many ideas there that
that still needs sort of taking off but
then also really to leverage it and to
take this model apply it to other
renewables areas and as well as enabling
technology so things like grid materials
so on and so forth and so here's an
example of a potential project which is
perfect since Google has a sort of a
keen interest in engineered geothermal
systems so Paul Moscow on the left he's
he's a he does fusion power research he
works on a levitated dipole experiment
at MIT to do these to do this work you
need a millimeter wavelength source at
low power ratings to diagnose the plasma
and get some characteristics about it
and at a high wavelength source to
actually inject be able to inject energy
into into the plasma and so what his
idea is is to take this millimeter
wavelength source and use it for
drilling so I don't know if any of you
guys have have thought about laser
drilling for engineered geothermal
systems being able to drill hard rock
they think that it has a lot of
advantages over laser drilling because
the millimeter wave expressions are much
more efficient you have less much less
scattering and so they're kind of at the
point now where they they have the
source and I just want to build a
waveguide to be able to sort of all try
and volatize some rocks and if that
works then you know they think they can
sort of take that to the gue so crazy
idea but also a really transformative
one and so
this is the sort of thing where if we
can just bring it to the point where
sort of if something is there we can
sort of take it to the next level so
that's the program that I'm involved in
and I'll turn over to Tonio now and he's
so he's going to give kind of launched
into some of his solar photovoltaics
research and can kind of take a much
deeper dive so tell me yeah Thank You
Daniel and thank you ladies and
gentlemen for coming today it's an honor
but foremost a pleasure for me to be
here today with you especially given
Google's commitment to renewable
energies and sustainability so today
I'll be chatting a bit about our program
at MIT focused on photovoltaics and in
particular the unique niche that MIT and
universities can play in in in
photovoltaics and the development
thereof focused on the scaling and and
cost challenges of PV so I'll start with
the basic slide that presents to you my
motivation my personal motivation on a
month-to-month year-to-year basis for
working in PV obviously on a day-to-day
week-to-week I'm I love being in the lab
I like working with students and I like
teaching and doing some fun research so
that's what keeps me going in the short
term but longer term when I look in the
mirror and figure where am I going what
am I doing with my life and and what am
i dedicating my time and energy to which
is really the invest biggest investment
any of us can make it's about solar
precisely because of the large resource
base that's available so on the left
hand side here we have the resource the
solar resources provided by the Sun
around 10 to the 5th terawatts and on
the right hand side that tiny little
blue cube it represents the human energy
use estimated in the mid-to-late century
and even if we consider the losses that
occur in an atmospheric absorption
what's reaching the Earth's surface is
still several orders of magnitude larger
than our energy use hence if we can
capture even a small percent of that
total we'll be in pretty good shape so
if I look at solar energy today and ask
what is the status quo of the industry
we have a few pictures here of different
solar energy installations on
the upper right there's a winery in Napa
Valley on the lower right there's a
house in New York State and on the lower
left we have a picture of a large field
installation the snaky white feature on
the lower right part of that image is a
road leading up to a large field
installation of solar panels in the
middle of the image and the little green
specks are trees so you can get a sense
of the scale there it's a installation
of several tens of megawatts so solar
today is a professional industry it's on
the order of 50 billion dollar in terms
of total movement if you go to any of
the large trade shows you'll see it's a
very professional environment akin to
any of the other large even software or
hardware development in the in the IC
and computer industries its competitive
with bulk power in some markets and I
stress the point some in this case due
to the fact that still today the cost is
is high relative to conventional power
sources and as a consequence total grid
penetration meaning the total amount of
solar that's on the grid competing with
fossil fuels comprises less than 1% of
total electricity generation meaning
there's a huge upside for this
technology if we can get the cost down
and allow it to scale in terms of
technologies this is this chart here
represents the total growth of the solar
industry broken down by technology so on
the vertical axis we have here starting
from 1980 and going up to a couple years
back and in the horizontal axis e
insists that we have the total capacity
the total annual production of PV and
since we're on an exponential growth
curve here this is growing quite fast
and already out of date but as we see
the breakdown of the technologies this
is still roughly representative of what
we have today so back in 1985 there was
about a third third third split between
mono crystal and silicon which is
representative of the integrated circuit
industry these circular wafers grown by
the Tsiolkovsky growth method achieving
solar cell efficiencies in the range of
15 to 23 percent
we have about 50% of the market or today
back in 1985 about a third of the market
comprised of a large grained
polycrystalline variety of silicon known
as multi crystalline silicon and that
usually achieves efficiencies on the ore
fourteen to sixteen point five percent
due to the higher defect density that
inhibits solar cell performance and we
also have a small but growing percentage
of thin films today that achieve
efficiencies usually somewhere in the
range of 6 to 10 percent now are there
some newer technologies that might be
even pushing 13 so if you look back to
1985 there was about a third third third
split between these three groups of
technologies today the market is largely
dominated by crystalline silicon because
this particular technology was able to
scale faster and because of the higher
efficiencies there were less costs
downstream for instance if you have a
higher efficiency cell you need less in
capsule interior to install the same
amount of power or less racking
materials and so forth so because of
this efficiency lever these particular
types of technologies were cheaper and
able to scale faster and we have a
situation where we're at today a large
percentage of the market dominated by
crystalline silicon technologies a small
but growing percentage of thin film
technologies and in today's talk we'll
be talking a bit about both technologies
both the crystalline silicon and thin
films the incumbent and the emerging
technologies so I've told you a little
bit about the status quo where we're at
today but what I really want to talk to
you about is the vision for PV where I
think we can go from here and I think
I'm fairly well convinced based on on
the calculations that we've done and
also looking at other technologies that
have gone through similar growth curves
that a significant fraction of the
world's energy portfolio can derive from
PV within a few decades and the
advantage obviously is that as a clean
renewable energy source can be produced
and manufactured and used locally I
emphasize hear the word portfolio energy
portfolio I'm not exactly a nut who
thinks that all power will be coming
from solar and we should turn off all of
our other power plants immediately and I
think that Solar will play a role we'll
take a play a part in the energy
portfolio that will be comprised of
other sources as well but I hope for the
future of our planet that these will be
renewable and clean in the sense of non
co2 emitting energy sources I also
envision a future in which solar panels
are so cheap to manufacture that they
can be produced locally
say for example glass
glasses manufactured locally typically
and used locally because it's so heavy
and cheap to manufacture it would be
impractical to manufacture overseas and
ship around so we can envision a future
in which solar panels reach the same
level if we can reduce the cost of
manufacturing there's another element to
the vision here which relates to the map
below and you can see the solar
distribution around the world and
sunlight heavily concentrated in the so
called developing regions of the world
and on the next slide here we have a
cute little chart today I came up with
some late night thinking about solar
where we have the Human Development
Index the HDI which is a United Nations
index of human development versus
insulation the total amount of sunlight
that a particular region on average
receives on a daily basis and you can
see that those regions that are
developing that need energy the most are
also the regions that fortuitously have
the highest amount of sunlight available
to them so I'm quite hopeful that PV can
be a development enabler and a conflict
reduction vector in in the process of
human evolution so this is the grand
vision for solar and for PV in
particular the conversion of sunlight
into electricity now regarding getting
there how do we actually move from where
we are today to where we need to get how
do we make this vision a reality well
we're here we're at a relatively small
fraction of the world's total energy mix
and if we maintain a steady clip a
steady growth rate we should be reaching
some meaningful percentage of world
electricity generation and I emphasize
electricity generation it's not fossil
fuels that are dedicated to the
transportation sector here as well this
is this is solely electricity I do think
that within a few decades if we keep it
up we can get there but there are two
obvious challenges to scaling the first
which most people are familiar with is
the cost issue we know that in most
markets PV is not cost competitive that
if you take power directly out of the
wall power being produced by a nearby
natural gas-fired power plant coal power
plant nuclear or hydroelectric that PV
will usually not be competitive in most
markets with certain exceptions
California - your 4 &amp;amp; 5
Hawaii and so forth but as the costs
continue to come down you'll hit grid
parity in other markets and the growth
should accelerate the other element that
most people are not necessarily aware of
is the sheer scale of manufacturing
now since manufacturing went overseas in
the United States to to East Asia in
other locations around the world where
the labor costs and materials costs are
lower we've somewhat forgotten this
element but it's very very important
that we keep it in mind when we think
about producing terawatts of power if we
take the current manufacturing
facilities for the dominant technologies
out there in the market today
crystalline silicon right here what you
see is a CAD rendering of a one gigawatt
fab for producing solar modules using
crystalline silicon technology this is
our EC it's a company based in Norway
it's re C's plant that is located in
Singapore now if we take that Factory
and scale it up a thousandfold to get to
the terawatts level what we really need
to be aiming for if we're going to be
producing meaningful percentages of the
total world power we're looking at land
areas just for the factory alone on the
order of the size of the state of Rhode
Island these are the left two bars in
this figure right here for crystalline
silicon and thin films actual if we
envision another reality where we have a
much faster manufacturing process for
instance the Pilkington float glass
process which is used to produce most of
our glass if we envision that instead
producing solar cells we would need much
less land area because of the higher
throughput of that process and lastly on
the far right portion of this plot we
have the high speed printer the laser
jet that's firing out fifty five pages a
minute and if each of those were a 15%
solar cell we would need an area the
equivalent of the size of five football
fields which at that point everybody
could do any country could have their
own little football field dedicated to
solar cell manufacturing and off we go
so it's not only a materials challenge
but also a manufacturing challenge and I
want to highlight these two points as we
move forward oh one more thing if even
if we use a very very thin layer of
solar cell material if we're going to be
producing the Sun on the terawatts level
we're producing tens of thousands of
square kilometers of this material per
year just to replace the modules that
are going out of out of
out of service and that equates to a
very large massive material something on
the order of the Empire State Building
per year in terms of materials processed
to keep these these very thin layers of
solar cell materials active in the field
so that limits us in terms of what
elements we can actually use on the
periodic table there are many that are
too rare to serve for large-scale solar
production ok so we've talked a little
bit about the the motivation for solar
the solar status-quo the vision of what
we can achieve in the future some of the
big challenges and now I'd like to talk
a little bit about what we're doing at
MIT to address these challenges and back
in 2007 when I first landed there at MIT
started as a junior professor the vision
was to produce a or to create a
laboratory that was a hundred percent
dedicated to solar and I think we've
we've done a decent job at growing up
now in September over nine we have a
group of around 15 people and a nice
balance of folks from around the world
and different backgrounds and and life
experiences but a hundred percent
dedicated to PV solar research R&amp;amp;D and
we are use inspired which means well
this is a kind of funny term use
inspired why do we what does that mean
that's actually a code word for
government funding agencies you see if
you if you go to the certain agencies
within the Department of Energy and say
the word basic research you get kicked
out they only want applied research if
you turn it on his head and go to the
National Science Foundation in utter the
word or the phrase Applied Research
again they'll kick you out into the
street and say we only do basic research
so use inspired is a way for us to say
look we do we need both and we need
basic research because we need to
understand some of the fundamentals and
how to make breakthroughs in areas that
haven't been haven't been made yet but
we also need the applied side we need to
understand how we take these these
fundamental breakthroughs and introduce
them into real life systems to make a
difference if it just stays in a thesis
on a shelf it's not going to do much
good for the planet
and it's not really going to justify our
existence so we start from a cost model
in general if we're looking at a cost
reduction an efficiency here is a huge
lever on your cost there are also other
things that are completely outside of
our control like the interest rate on
the loan you get to build your
solar facility that has about the same
influence as efficiency so there's both
business and Technology related
challenges here and we also emphasize
medium-term real-world impacts now it
would be so much easier for myself as a
professor just to say oh I'm gonna be
working on some really far-out project
and in 40 years when I retire the world
can judge me instead I put my reputation
on the line on a regular basis and say
okay within five years we hope to have
this accomplished within two years we
hope to have this accomplished the
reason I do that is is because there is
an urgency for this problem of climate
change and we have to get moving quickly
there's another element to this as well
we want to help the students who will be
graduating in two to five years if we
set them loose on a project of
fundamental importance today and that
will be bearing fruit within two to five
years then when they go out into
industry they're they're sought-after
commodity and they're much more likely
to get a position so let me highlight it
for you a few of the examples of the
instances in my own career that have led
me along this path of medium-term impact
as a graduate student in Berkeley we we
developed some technologies that spun
off into a company called Cali solar
which is located just up the street here
using dirtier forms of feedstock
material to make high-efficiency solar
cells and we also have developed some
newer technologies more recently this is
a map of current collection efficiency
that are improving battery jhin's of
solar cell materials that are now
implemented in commercial production so
it's kind of fun to visit Cali solar's
factory early today and see some of the
technologies under development being
actually used out there in industry so
it was thanks to these advances that
were I think one of the rarer research
groups that's actually carbon positive
right now our efficiency increases in
industry have offset the insane amount
of traveling I do running around giving
presentations and the like so I I'm
motivated to keep it that way and
hopefully will will continue making
advances that continue to improve solar
so let me give you a few case studies
well we'll get into the science and I
would like to make this as interesting
as possible for you so I'll if I happen
to breeze over some of the subjects and
you really want to talk about them we
can go back to some of the details in
the Q&amp;amp;A
number one we're gonna talk about multi
crystalline silicon again the technology
that comprises about 50% of the world's
market today and the reason we're
focusing on this is because many of the
established companies are very risk
adverse this is a commodity industry
where you're producing a product that
will last for 20 years it's like the
building construction industry so
there's a very high risk if you do
something new and it doesn't work out
and you have a massive module recall
it's going to cost a company quite a bit
so at the same time breakthroughs are
solar are sorely needed there is a
strong driving force for innovation to
drive the cost down and improve the
scalability of these technologies and
it's it's motivating for the students I
think to have this shorter time to
market impact in this particular field
so let me give you an example here of
multi crystalline silicon this on the
the right hand side is an image of a
silicon nitride coated multi crystalline
silicon wafer and the order of about
five by five inches so you can get a
sense of the beautiful crystal pattern
this is a picture of the crystal growth
area within a production facility for
these multi crystalline silicon
materials and you can see here on the on
the lower right portion of that image a
small keyboard and monitor for size
comparison these are rather large
furnaces each furnace produces ingots
between one and four ingots somewhere
the range of 250 to 400 kilograms today
they're even going up to 600 kilograms
and one ton ingots are an RD stage so
these are massive blocks of silicon and
out of those blocks you can see the size
here of the crucibles with one of our
students Sarah burn artist as a
comparison the number after the Jen
refers the number of wafers along the
linear dimension so Jen five would be
five way for so long the linear
dimension 25 wafers total along each
thin Delta the Delta Z of your of your
crucible and out of these crucibles come
material that looks something like this
these are columnar growth structures
starting from the bottom all the way to
the top and then you slice your wafers
out horizontally and your grain
boundaries are running perpendicular to
their surfaces and don't interfere much
with charge transport so we have this
sort of material what are how can we do
better where are we at today and were
the opportunities for innovation
well if we were to look inside of the
material with a little bit of x-ray
vision here and to detect the defect
clusters within the material we would
see these defective zones going from the
bottom of the ingot all the way through
the top and these are zones that contain
dislocations which are essentially
one-dimensional line defects within your
material on order of ten to the fourth
and ten to the eight dislocations per
square centimeter anybody who's worked
with integrated circuits or are LED
emitting diodes for instance knows these
are very very high values very
detrimental for electronic properties of
a semiconductor material now to
illustrate that in the more sciency form
we have performance in in the y-axis and
this location density and the x-axis
here as you increase your dislocation
density or performance comes down we
have some magic number here where we
have better solar cells with lower
dislocation densities and where solar
cells above if you get down to this
number 10 to the 4 per square centimeter
this magic number then solar cell
performance it's not really influenced
much because the probability that some
electron inside the material will
encounter your defect is very very low
now let's take a wafer out of a vertical
slice shown here by this little box and
if we scan that region using an
electrical performance mapper we realize
that there are some really bad regions
caused by regions of high dislocation
density likewise if we take away fur in
the cross section as we're apt to do
when we actually produce a solar cell we
find that the the wafer itself has a
check board like pattern of these bad
regions together with the good ones and
what that means from a practical point
of view is that if you have the good
regions and bad regions all connected
together through a parallel circuit
through the front surface emitter and
the back surface metallization the bad
regions will drain current from the good
ones in the overall performance of your
device will be reduced so these
dislocations are public enemy number one
in terms of solar cell performance and a
lot of work has gone into it in the past
to try to figure out how to reduce their
impact on solar cell performance usually
after the material has already made and
while you're doing the cell processing
steps the phosphorus diffusion the
anti-reflection coating deposition
trying all sorts of things well as a
starting professor at MIT had a
completely blank slate we said well why
don't we try something very very
different here we know that this
location
are manipulated in metallurgy in the
steel and aluminum industries so why
don't we go ahead and try to apply some
of that learning to multi crystalline
silicon solar cell material we know that
at low temperatures dislocations really
don't move anywhere silicon is a brittle
material like glass if you push it it
will deform elastically meaning just
bonds will stretch but won't won't slip
and eventually if you keep pushing the
thing will just shatter and the same is
true for for silicon so at room
temperature as you start increasing the
temperature of it you can actually have
the the material deforms just like a
paper clip would a piece of metal of
ductile material you've you've gone
above the brittle to ductile transition
temperature this for silicon occurs
around 500 degrees Celsius but because
of the unique crystal structure you're
still limited to how mobile these
dislocations are you really need to go
above a thousand degrees C before you
start getting dislocations moving freely
throughout the lattice and note that
silicon melts at around 1400 degrees
Celsius so these are very high
temperatures and this little dislocation
core structure denoted here with this
this defect is free to move around the
lattice so with this knowledge in our
minds we sought out some ceramic
annealing furnaces and develop the
process at MIT where we can eliminate
the dislocations inside of these multi
crystalline silicon materials so on the
bottom part of this figure we have a
control wafer with these little pits
that correspond to dislocations after
the sample has been defect itched and on
the top we have the annealed sample
which is essentially taken from an
adjacent part of material where we
demonstrate that the dislocations have
been effectively removed and we believe
that this process if done correctly
could be done for about a cent per wafer
penny per wafer which is really really
promising if we can implement this and
manage to scale it up we have a few more
tests to run in the laboratory I'm
really telling you some of the
cutting-edge research that we're doing
in our lab but if we're successful in
ramping it up we could for a mere penny
per wafer be increasing the efficiencies
of these solar cell devices anywhere
between 10 and 40% relative to where
they are today which is a big deal and
we're pretty excited about it
so let me zoom through these slides
since we'll be discussing more about
that in the QA but the takeaways from
this first part here is that there's
plenty plenty plenty of room for it
in existing commercial PV technologies
and anybody out there who says well you
know it makes no sense to dedicate any
time to commercial technologies because
our big industry is thinking about it I
would say actually the big industries
are looking in the areas where they
think they can have the biggest impact
in the lowest risk the lowest risk
opportunities if you come along with a
great idea
that the industry thinks that's too
risky maybe somebody tried it back in
the 1970s it didn't work don't waste
your time I would encourage you to go
ahead because maybe just maybe you'll
strike upon something really interesting
you really have to take advantage of the
years of insights gained in parallel
fields especially those fields that are
going out of vogue like metallurgy it's
not often that you hear a new department
from a new university forming the
metallurgy department no actually if you
speed back 50 years when steel was the
big material that everybody was
researching you'll find that many of the
materials science and engineering
departments were called Department of
mining and metallurgy or something
equivalent thereof nowadays it's it's
the Department of nanotechnology which
is great we should definitely be looking
at the new materials but we also
shouldn't forget the wealth of knowledge
that there are in these fields that are
now going out of vogue just because the
light is shining in that corner of the
room when you've lost your keys doesn't
mean that your keys are over there they
might be somewhere else in the room and
you might have to create your own light
to go looking for them the third part is
that I just wanted to mention this point
that the model for funding research
within universities is changing a bit as
Daniel alluded to before the involvement
of individuals within university
research philanthropic individuals is
very important and there was actually
Doug and Barbara spraying that allowed
this project to get off the ground when
it was still an idea in our minds me as
a starting professor without many
resources to to get started with they
were the ones who actually oiled the
machine and allowed things to get
started and some first proofs of
principle eventually now it's funded by
a de project so that's an interesting
part so we're going to change gears and
move from the existing crystal and
silicon technologies into some of the
thin film technologies if I might remind
you of that previous slide at the
beginning of the talk thin film
technologies today comprise a very small
percentage of the total solar produced
and however there's a large potential
for thin film to
for the following reasons there's a
scalability argument to be made these
these thin film materials use a hundred
times less materials than a standard
crystalline silicon technology to give
you some concrete numbers the absorber
layers the active layer materials are
typically on the order of 300 nanometers
to 3 microns as a coat as opposed to a
standard silicon wafer which is on the
order of 150 to 180 microns thick which
is about four times the width of your
human hair so you can imagine how thin
these these thin film layers really are
but because they are so-called direct
bandgap semiconductors or take advantage
of very good light trapping they're able
to get away with much less material
there's also the potential for very high
throughput manufacturing with a thin
film technology one could in principle
produce solar cells as shown here on the
right this is a picture from uni solar
an engineer here processing solar cell
materials onto a roll of stainless steel
foil and that's of course a big step
forward in terms of manufacturability
where we're producing solar cell
materials like newspapers the challenges
however are twofold to date thin film
materials haven't been able to achieve
very high efficiencies and thus haven't
been competitive in the bulk market when
you have more efficient solar panels
that require less labour unless
materials to install per per unit power
produced and secondly the conventional
thin film materials will ultimately be
limited in how fast they or how large
how much they can scale because of the
materials availability now we'll get to
that in a few slides I'll come back to
that point so the research goal within
our laboratory is to design scalable
earth-abundant thin film materials
meaning materials that are that have a
large enough natural abundance in the
earth to scale to the terawatts level so
the functional requirements if you think
about this from a design engineering
perspective we have to have an
efficiency of about 15 percent or more
it has to be able to absorb sunlight
very efficiently generate a high volume
of charge carriers and minimize the
carrier collection loss in within the
material and so there are some design
parameters that relate to the material
properties that we have to design for
and the constraints are essentially the
ability to scale up to the terawatts
level
and low-cost and of course durability so
let's focus on this scaling up to the 10
terawatts level I'll show you some
numbers if we look at the periodic table
and we assess which elements out there
are abundant enough to be deployed in
the tens of terawatts scale we're
looking at about 50 of them and out of
those elements there's a subset of the
elements that are produced in a high
enough volume of manufacturing today
there's about 30 so these are materials
today that they're manufactured at scale
and if we take those 30 elements and
begin combining them to form
semiconductor compounds we have a number
of possibilities to choose from and by
screening both experimentally and
theoretically using some very
sophisticated computer modeling by a
colleague of mine GERD Seder in the
material science and engineering
department we're able to hone in on
around 10 compounds that really show
some good promise for making thin film
earth-abundant solar cell materials
however if we start comparing the real
efficiencies the record efficiencies of
these materials versus the theoretical
maximum shown here this plot is the
theoretical maximum efficiency as a
function of bandgap and we compare the
actual record solar cell efficiencies
for several compounds including iron
sulfide tin sulfide copper zinc tin
sulfide cuprous oxide and and in
tungsten sulphide we see that the record
efficiencies of these earth-abundant
compounds are much much much lower than
the theoretical maximum efficiency and
this is after several years of work
especially during the 1980s on these
particular compounds compare that to
crystalline silicon the blue are the
records cell and module efficiencies the
red are the typical commercial cell and
module efficiencies head and shoulders
above the earth abundant compounds so
the question is you know since these
materials underperform are they
intrinsically limited by some
fundamental electronic property of the
material or are they limited by defects
the same way that crystalline silicon is
limited and of course when the word
defect comes along my ears perk up I'm
of course fascinated by these defects
they're not only bad but in many cases
quite good you can think of examples in
the real world around you where defects
are actually helpful for example
anything from strengthening steel or
aluminum you add impurities to
strengthen
steel in particular stainless steel you
add chromium to form a passivating layer
of chromium oxide that prevents oxygen
from going in and corroding the steel
now you can even have examples of
colored glass or gemstones that gain
their color by the presence of certain
point defect impurities so defects here
are very valuable in certain cases but
of course detrimental in others and for
solar cell material as we just saw
example we have some detrimental effects
so our first step is grain boundary
engineering we want to make sure that
these materials have large enough grains
such that the grain boundaries do not
inhibit carrier transport and let me
just show you here the grain boundaries
highlighted in the cross-sectional
scanning electron microscope image of a
thin film material if this is our little
electron at the bottom it has to be able
to make its way out of the material
without interacting with the grain
boundaries so the grain size has to be
on the order of 5 times the thickness of
your of your material if you have about
a 1 micron thick solar cell material you
need grains on the order of about 5
microns thick and this is just a quick
little simulation to show you that point
so we've been doing a lot of work on
trying to increase the grain sizes of
these thin film materials for example
this one a cuprous oxide earth-abundant
solar cell material we have a layer
somewhere in the order of 100 nanometers
thick and we're trying to achieve a
grain sizes in the order of 500
nanometers or more you can see that
we've managed to increase it quite a bit
and just last week the student on this
project showed me a figure that I wasn't
able to incorporate into this which
basically had grains that were larger
than the little box that I'm showing
right here so really really large grain
material and the resistivities of these
materials were such that they could be
incorporated into devices that's our
next step that we're working on and
hopefully hopefully with any luck knock
on wood
we'll be able to beat the efficiency
limit and have a record efficiency cell
if we can get above 2% efficiency it's
it's not a high bar to cross so we're
working on this avidly at MIT and
hopefully we'll make some some nice
progress over the next year or so on
this topic so takeaways in this
particular subset we have novel
earth-abundant thin film materials which
we believe offer great potential for
substituting out the commercial thin
film technologies on the order of 5 to
10 years and now this this
basically says guys don't don't go out
and sell all your stock and first solar
or give up on all the six startups in
the Bay Area no no no no there's there's
still several years that cadmium
telluride and copper indium gallium
diselenide can continue producing before
you start running up against resource
walls but many people think by about
2020 will start hitting these these
walls of material availability and we'll
need new technologies to overcome that
really the niche that works attempting
to develop breaks them the second take
that current earth abundant solar cell
materials are underperforming we believe
that it's in part due to defects we see
some evidence for this already and by
defect engineering the same types or
general classes of techniques we've
developed for crystalline silicon
applied to thin films we believe we can
overcome these efficiency limits so the
next few years we'll be able to tell
whether we're successful or not and in
conclusion so we can open it up for Q&amp;amp;A
the potential of the solar resource is
very vast terawatt scaling is possible
if certain challenges do to scale and
costs can be overcome and most
importantly at this very early stage of
the solar market development a very
small innovation can go a long long way
if you make an innovation today and the
market continues to grow up you can
envision a situation in which your small
deviations impact over tens of percents
a total market if you develop a very
successful product so with that I'd like
to really conclude by acknowledging the
team it's not myself doing this work
it's it's an entire team of people
comprised of students undergraduate and
graduate postdoctoral fellows and
research scientists and we have here the
team up here and our collaborators
internationally and nationally and our
funding agencies of course with that I'd
like to open it up QA and perhaps turn
it back to our MC or open up room yep
well just we'll just open it up straight
for Q&amp;amp;A make it efficient that way so
question in the back yeah so the
question was our most materials most
earth-abundant materials all fides yes
there are several worth abundant
materials that our fault but we have
some very intricate irreal properties
they're very typically prevalent ly
bonded materials or near covalent
that allow for type of car transport
about the layers you don't have as far
as local issues you might have an oxide
so yes they are they're quite popular
this gentleman excuse me sir
on GPR remote TVR can you hear us
sir stop the recording no don't stop the
recording we just have somebody typing
on the keyboard that's making a little
bit of odd I think the yep okay
fantastic yes so yes so the question is
can consult I to react with with the
environment most certainly so this is
one of the disadvantages of sulphide
materials they are rather reactive and
as a result the encapsulation becomes
very very important there is one type of
sulphide material in near commercial
production today they're just at the
cusp of commercial production is called
cigs it means copper indium gallium
disulfide and this particular type of
material that can be very well
encapsulated to avoid any sort of
degradation due to exposure to the
elements or ingress of gases and
moisture through the encapsulants to the
active layer materials themselves
because they're very very thin layers
they're extremely sensitive to to this
the ingress problems yeah question the
front yes certainly so the the essence
of tuning the band gap so that the band
gap basically means the the the energy
at which the semiconductor begins to
absorb light and anything with the
higher energy than that semiconductor
can absorb light and transform that into
electrical current so the band gap is a
very important material parameter you
match that up with a solar spectrum and
try to absorb as much as large of a
solar spectrum as you can
and the material will absorb light most
efficiently at the bandgap energy so you
can stack different materials one on top
of one another that absorb most
efficiently at different regions of the
solar spectrum thus achieving a very
high efficiency solar cell so to make a
long story short yes you can tune the
band gap of materials by alloying them
by say for example taking three elements
and changing the ratio of the first and
second element so that you go from a low
bandgap material to a high band gap
material and absorb very efficiently the
Reds and the in the Blues of your solar
spectrum while certainly there is this
efforts in these directions one usually
does that once one already has an
established solar cell material so the
first step is to get a solar cell
material that works with some band gap
and then from there you can innovate an
alloy and change the bandgap properties
so we're one step behind that still in
terms of the earth-abundant compounds in
terms of the non earth abundant
compounds they're already quite there
with the 3 5 compounds certainly indium
nitride indium gallium nitride and other
compounds you can alloy in this way sir
so the question was it the dollar a watt
on the module level the the premise here
was that first solar produces solar cell
modules that are $1.00 while in the
module level but because of the high
installation costs these are low
efficiency panels because of the high
installation cost is required you you
wind up with this installed system cost
much higher than $1 per watt and it's
still not cost-effective so as one of
the requirements that I had earlier in
the slides a baseline efficiency of 15%
was what we're targeting and with those
sorts of efficiencies if you have a
dollar per watt the installed costs
become lower as a total percent so there
there is an element there embedded
perhaps I didn't express it clearly
enough it a more precise way of saying
that would be
exactly as you recommend the price at
the installed system level which does
capture the efficiency trickle-down
effects personally I think that a large
fraction of the cost that can be
squeezed out of solar cell production is
not only on the materials and the
manufacturing side of things but also on
the balance of system on the module
level and on the installation side and
we were touring some some companies this
morning that are doing innovations in
this area here in the Bay Area and in
the installation and better framing
materials and better ways of installing
them certainly there is a lot of
leverage to be gained there if you look
to Germany the price of installation is
about half of what it is in the United
States in large part due to more
streamlined processes for installation
including the bureaucracy involved so
there are a number of different pieces
that can be you can you can squeeze
costs out of and ultimately those
efficiencies will need to come to bear
if we are to produce solar at the
terawatt scale so yes that would be my
answer
yeah so what are the materials
innovations in concentrating solar power
that was the NCP V so c pv is a
technology in which you utilize optics
to concentrate sunlight into a very very
small cell and you can spend more money
to produce that cell because you're
taking light from a larger area and
constant concentrating it down so in
terms of total cost of production the
balance of system components the optics
and the structure around it ends up
being comparable if not much greater
than the actual cost of the cell itself
so it's fascinating that that that type
of technology because you can envision a
scenario in which maybe a better cell
comes along in three to five years and
you just swap it out and you haven't
changed the total price of your system
much a lot of innovation goes around
managing the heat load in these devices
and because you're concentrating 500
Suns up to 500 Suns it can be less but
up to hundreds of Suns on to a very very
small area when I say a Sun that's the
equivalent of going out and standing in
midday Sun you imagine 500 times that
amount
heat that's a lot of power to dissipate
any inefficiency in the solar cell
device will usually generate heat and
you have to extract it somehow so
there's been a lot of work going into
the materials used for the packaging and
heat extraction from such devices and as
well onto the materials that that
comprise the active layer solar cell
itself so in those cases goodness if you
concentrate enough maybe maybe it
becomes impractical at very high
concentrations to the heat load but if
you concentrate enough it might reduce
some of your material constraints as
well you might be able to instead of 30
elements you might have about 34 or 35
to deal with on the periodic table which
could open up some possibilities as well
yeah another question yeah certainly
so um today the some of the most
cost-effective installations are large
field installations largely because you
you don't have to worry about some of
the safety regulations of installing it
on the rooftop of somebody's house and
just put up a big fence around the area
install a bunch of modules at once and
then only pay for one architect in one
design engineers fees for a very very
large field installation and negotiate
down the price per module with the
supplier because you're buying it bulk
so these field installations are price
competitive today but I really do hope
and and secondly expect that the
residential market will comprise
ultimately a large portion of the demand
because we pay a higher price for our
electricity than commercial suppliers do
and secondly if we produce the energy
locally we're using it locally as well
and we don't have to pay for the
transmission distribution the
electricity it's not a commonly known
fact but if you're buying coal power
the total price that you pay or the
total cost to get it to your home half
of that is a transmission and
distribution cost the other half is in
production so if you produce your power
locally your producing on your roof and
consuming it locally I think that's
ultimately where the market has to head
now the question is is there enough roof
space in the United States to actually
make that happen
barely and I would add furthermore that
we shouldn't bank on it
I think rooftops definitely should all
be covered or at least the practical
ones should be covered with good solar
panels but there are also other
opportunities of dead spaces around the
United States that we can consider
covering let's take for a second the
total road coverage in the United States
if you look at the total network of
highways and roads around the u.s. you
can download these numbers in the
government and you look at an average
width of a road you multiply the two
together that they get the total land
area you're looking at a fraction
between one and two percent of all the
United States covered in asphalt it is
an amazingly large number you look at
other types of things like the
percentage of Virginia covered in
tobacco farms it's also in the order of
percent so there are examples of
human-made structures perhaps not the
tobacco farms but roads and parking lots
that could be considered as well for for
installation of solar panels and the the
parking lots being a great example if
you install them on uncovered Lots so I
think we have enough dead space is
already spaces that aren't being
utilized that we don't have to take new
pristine land and produce solar panels
there that might be a good way to get
the industry jump-started near-term but
longer term there are certainly a lot of
options for us with with the spaces
we've already created
absolutely so the the earth-abundant
materials the question was it's not such
a new idea there have been people
investigating this for several years
absolutely true so the history of
earth-abundant
solar cell materials I believe started
way back in in the 1970s or perhaps
early 1980s cigs copper indium gallium
diselenide actually started from
investigations of copper sulfide and the
realization that this material wasn't
stable the copper tended to electoral
migrates let's add some heavier elements
in there to stabilize this and get a
firmer structure and then from there
they added indium but anyway the the
research that's been going on let's see
some of the big names in the field
finally in in in Texas has been
investigating this Alex for quite a bit
other groups cyrus whadya from berkeley
produced a great paper where he looked
at the economic aspects together with
dan chemin and there's been a growing
enthusiasm for this idea in the field
now the the ultimate Achilles heel for
all of this is that we haven't been able
to really make one of these
earth-abundant materials work on a large
scale precisely because of the
efficiency issue there are different
types of problems that affect each type
of material and we're just now beginning
to get a sense of appreciation of the
limiting factors for each of these
let's take sulfides for instance a lot
of work went into sulphide research in
in here in California several decades
ago and and the Han Meitner Institute
which is now the hell Helmholtz Centre
in Berlin in Berlin Germany during the
1990s working on compounds like copper
sulfide and iron sulfide and it we we
just didn't get critical mass is my
belief and III do think that the the key
efficiency limiting defects for each of
these different materials are on the
cusp of being identified and if we can
identify them and if we can overcome
them then these materials have a chance
but if we just go by brute force alone
trying to deposit them and make solar
cells out of them we won't get anywhere
good well I'll turn it back to our emcee
I do thank you for your questions it's
been fun being here and thank you
Thank You Tonio Thank You Daniel as well
okay so just about done just to let you
know that we do have some handout
material over here which give you a lot
more information on some of the other
programs that are involved in mighty and
the sustainable energy revolution
program and some actual backing an
interesting background articles about
some projects that are possible in the
area of wind geothermal and storage so
you're welcome to have those also if
you'd like to sign up to receive the MIT
Energy Initiative newsletter on a
regular basis to see what's going on at
MIT some of you've already signed up
over here but others that haven't yet
you're a please feel free to do it and
in the bold hope that any of you out
there may be actually interested in
funding some of this research just come
and talk to either Richard over there or
me after this is over and well we'll be
happy to followup with you
so that's it thanks very much for coming
and thank you out there viewing audience
I hope you all enjoy seeing it on
YouTube thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
