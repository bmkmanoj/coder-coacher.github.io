I'm on the tech talks team here at
Google Los Angeles and today we're
excited to welcome Jennifer Segal
jennifer is known for her work in
creating the mobile home of the 20th
century she's a founder and principal of
the LOS angeles-based firm office of
mobile design which is dedicated to the
design and construction of ecologically
sound dynamic structures utilizing
portable and prefabricated architecture
she earned a master's degree from
sci-arc in 1994 and a 2000 was a 2003
Loeb fellow at Harvard Graduate School
design she's presently an adjunct
associate professor at USC her
innovative design sensibilities and
expertise and futuristic concepts
prefabricated construction and green
building technologies were reconciled by
the popular media in 2003 when Esquire
named her one of the design world's best
and brightest and the architectural
League of New York included her in the
acclaimed emerging voices program she
was honored when Mayor Antonio
Villaraigosa presented her with the
History Channel's 2006 infinite Design
Excellence Award for her competition
entry for the los angeles city of the
future 2106 today Jennifer will tell us
more about her work and especially the
aeromobil project which is currently a
pop-up exhibit here at the Google
courtyard so please join me in welcoming
Jennifer Siegel
Thank You Julie and thank you google for
hosting this tech talk today it's a big
honor to be here the title of today's
lecture moto Pia deployed strategies for
the language of movement in the art of
off-site construction is a series of
ideas and a kind of historical overview
to some degree of mobility not only in
my work but in the work of others that
came before me and also a small glimpse
into the work that office of mobile
design has been my company has been
doing for the last 15 years the first
image i'm showing you shows the depth
and the breadth of what mobile
architecture means to our society
starting with a Mongolian yurt from the
600 BC up until today's culture which
has become as we're all very much aware
more mobile than ever I'm the offer
author of a series of books on mobile
architecture both published by Princeton
Architectural press this first book came
out in 2002 and on its heels in 2008
more mobile looking at a series of
architects and artists from around the
world that have been building and
creating ideas around lightness
portability trance and transpositions
and just a quick little diagram of the
work from office of mobile design where
you can see a variety of different
objects that we've created over the
years some of them dealing with modular
and prefab construction some of them
more rooted in industrialization and
some of them fully deployable and mobile
such as the aeromobil that's here in the
courtyard at Google this quote I think
from Benjamin Bratton from his this a
little bit from his article iPhone city
in some ways really summarizes a lot of
my feeling about living in Los Angeles
and what that means where he talks about
sitting in traffic on the LA freeway
something that we're all very much aware
of looking at my edits for this essay
i'm reminded of Joan Didion's revelation
that this is the most authentic Angelino
social experience we are not going to
any place all lined up behind our
windshields we are already there so this
understanding a recognition of the
circumstances in which we live in and
the kind of growth and opportunity of
these environments is something that I'm
very interested in and not only am i
concerned with ideas and environmental
consequences of auto mobility or dro
mala g a term coined by Paul Verrilli Oh
meaning the science of travel but I'm
equally interested in using design to
affect social mobility and this project
is an example from MIT Media Lab their
electric robot wheeled city car that
Bill Mitchell had been working on who's
the former dean at you at MIT and also
running the Media Lab and you'll see a
kind of genesis of this idea as the talk
continues you could say that my
preoccupation with devising portable
structures grew out of my family's own
economic history my grandfather in this
image had a hot dog cart in New York
City and two generations later while
myself through graduate school at
sci-arc I did as well so it was not
necessarily a leap but rather a logical
move when I founded office of mobile
design in 1998 as a way to actively
engage in designing non permanently
cited structures that move across and
rest lightly upon the land and then the
other images from the brewery big
artists live work colony in downtown Los
Angeles where I had my office for many
years and I was directly adjacent to an
active train yard so the entire building
would shake every time the charians
coupled together which was a constant
reminder of the work that I was involved
with at the time my work seeks to
rethink and reestablish methods of
building that contrast with a generic
clutter that increasingly crowds the
landscape I'm inspired by San Ellias
futurist manifesto in that I share in
his philosophy that quote we no longer
believe in the monumental the heavy and
static and have enriched our
sensibilities with the taste for
lightness transients and practicality
shown here in a region of instability in
Israel between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv
where this gas station can easily be
retracted when necessary this desire for
the active mobile and everywhere dynamic
that characterized the Italian futurist
machine aesthetic infuses my work at omd
shown here is the rock climber whose
dynamic form responds to the static rock
face or the parcours efficient and quick
ability to overcome obstacles another
text reference would be from deleuze and
guitar ease nomads ology the war machine
talking about the smooth versus the
striated of space and while
architectures purpose remains constant
providing inspiration and shelter from
the natural elements and community among
its inhabitants mobile and portable
structures Herald the dawn of the age of
new nomadism
the applications and uses are limitless
these buildings have no borders the
diversity of material palette design
style and transportation method are
varied here buckminster fuller's
dropping in one of his dime axiom domes
and a take on Fuller's dome along with
his Dymaxion car a three-wheeled vehicle
certainly the precursor to the RVs that
we see now on the road was a project
called you town from 1996 kind of a take
on a rethinking of the trailer park so
mobile architecture then can be defined
not merely in terms of movable
structures but rather as a way of
intelligently inhabiting a specific
environment at a specific time in place
in a way that better reacts to
increasingly frequent social and
environmental shifts these fluval forms
are expressed best in the extreme sports
world where surfers meld with the
breaking surfaces the sea becomes the
form giver or the intuition and
innovation of the skateboarder working
off the urban infrastructure the
information age wets our appetite for
the exploration of the unknown as
inquisitive social beings and innate
explorers of the universe we are
standing at a new threshold of curiosity
and movement biological and
technological advancements reveal
themselves in our everyday lives echoing
prophecies and environmental visions
from American pulp science fiction
architecture today roles flows inflates
breathes expands multiplies and
contracts finally hoisting itself up as
ARCA Graham predicted at the end of the
1960's to go in search of its next user
I'm also quite interested as my USC
students know in ideas of manufacturing
and kind of rethinking the possibilities
of how we build today and in the future
the machines and tools that are now
available to us cnc milling and robot
are
to some degree really come out of the
industry of aerospace and automobile
industries that have already been
thinking about off-site construction to
a large degree and my argument is that
architecture needs to be more aware and
wake up to the possibilities of what is
in store for it ultimately I feel and
Google is probably at the forefront of a
lot of this is that architecture or
intelligence will be more embedded
within our skins in our bodies and allow
for greater diversity and versatility in
the future the project that I showing
here in the courtyard at Google is from
an exhibition called trucka texture and
trucka texture was conceived by another
local Venetian an architect named Mark
Mac asking the question of you know when
you fuse mobility and prefabrication
what do you get and this was an idea
that I had been thinking about for many
years and had the opportunity to build
it this summer this small little vehicle
becomes the platform for invention or
pop-up possibilities it's made from a
variety of different industrial recycled
materials including the uld which is the
aluminum box sitting on the top of it
which comes from the aerospace industry
typically used to move luggage around
airports or in the whole of aircraft and
the this little truck then allows for a
startup company possibly or an incubator
company in the tech world to have
instant meetings in a variety of
different locations or test out new
ideas to consumers on the street I'm
going to show you a lot of examples
right now some of them theoretical some
of them built of the work that I've been
doing since 1998 and even before that
this project was a kind of rethinking of
the Bambi airstream and and what the
possibilities are for a KCRW sonic trace
recording studio so that this little
vehicle could come into your town or
city or plaza and from the outside you
would actually see the movement of the
skin based on the voices from that were
being recorded on the inside
globetrotter was done for the National
Building Museum in Washington as an
homage to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre a
hundred years later thinking again about
community public space and how to bring
the building to the people where this
truck would unfold creating a venue for
theater and the back of it the pneumatic
bubbles become the place for change our
ticket encounters or you know where the
backstage happens it's fully powered by
the Sun as well which is an idea that
I've been thinking about for a long time
the storehouse came about for a group
that was haagen-dazs that was thinking
about a pop-up ice cream stand and also
for the cooper-hewitt Museum in New York
when they had asked me to be part of
their triennial exhibition and you can
start to see that you know I'm looking a
lot at outside industries in this case
windsurfing to give me some inspiration
for the idea of movement without being
too explicit in the building or the
construction and this small project was
done for the Monterey Design Museum and
thinking again about kind of mobile
pop-up experiences where the museum
wanted to show some of their ideas or
their maritime equipment but they didn't
they wanted to allow people to interact
with it on it in a new way so you
weren't just looking at the model of a
boat but you were actually seeing
something that was moving and this
allowed you to kind of capture space
and be a part of it at the same time
feel like you were in a more sheltered
environment and then finally this
project elispot was designed for the
walker museum thinking again about the
way in which we as human beings will
interact with a digital environment so
I'm always looking for ways to move
beyond just the screen to allow the
material to be responsive to the user so
again in this case these kind of
cloud-like structures that hover over
this this bed shows the imagery of
what's on the screen in front of the
person who's using it so that someone
from a distance is always kind of seeing
the way that clouds pass the interaction
of the particular user so there's always
a connection outside of just you're the
one on one with the screen or whether
it's on the floor you know that trying
to take you away from you know the flat
on screen in front of you this question
that fuller raises madam do you know the
weight of your house was never a
question that was posed to me while I
was a student in architecture but it has
become a question I always ask my
students but it's also something that
becomes a daily encounter with the work
that I do this is my house in Venice and
I am training in a truck into the
backyard as an addition to the house as
a sort of early morning experiment
before the neighbors are aware of what's
happening and then it becomes a very
simple and easy prefabricated edition
which has now become the art room for my
daughter and I took on the idea of
trucks because I like the fact that they
were contained and already built and you
could dismantle them or cut into them in
certain ways and
and transform them and yet they still
maintained their truck pneus and this
project ecolab was done for a group of
people in Hollywood with with students
of mine at the time at woodbury
university teaching children about the
life of a tree as this classroom this
mobile classroom comes to the children
and they move in and out of this truck
sort of understanding space in a very
different way but ultimately
understanding you know that there is
nature outside of the urban condition
that we live in and on the heels of that
another project that was built here in
Los Angeles for the Venice Community
Housing Corporation with a friend of
mine Larry scarpa who teaches also at
USC trains people in construction so
this portable construction training
center is an old manufactured home as
you can see by removing two of the walls
from replacing it with steel we were
able to delaminate it d skin it and then
allow for the whole building to open up
to the outside and people could practice
different forms of construction rip it
out and read and build it back in so
it's a very active and transformed
transformable construction experience
and then this house was done for a
client who owns the brewery my former
landlord it's about a 10,000 square foot
lot it's directly opposite the brewery
site which is on the bottom half of your
screen and the house was built from a
series of recycled and found objects
that he already had on the site we chose
to position the house at the back of the
lot because like you know all good
Angelenos he drives to work across the
street so we thought it would be a good
idea to get him out of the car to walk
his garden every day and then get into
the car and drive it's made from for
shipping containers and to grain
trailers it's a simple construction
and yet it becomes very elaborate once
the pieces are assembled and on your
right you can see the boneyard
essentially of all of the materials that
were gathered to make the house on the
on the left hand side there's something
quite magical about the site because as
we started to remove tarmac and remove
age-old concrete on the ground and
introduce a natural kind of planting
scheme it woke up the entire
neighborhood and butterflies were coming
and hummingbirds and all of these these
birds that hadn't you know had a place
to land before on their path then
returned to their native environment the
grain trailers the two of them ones on
the inside of the house one is on the
outside of the house he fills them with
koi fish so there's a constant feeling
of movement and a slight dank smell from
the fish I was also really interested in
this project with the shipping
containers of sort of leaving them as
they were not covering them up so there
are two steel containers and two
aluminum containers of just you know
simply painted and the rest of the
materials are left exposed
over the years I get approached by a
variety of different publications and
magazines and publishers to propose
ideas for buildings and this particular
building came about when dwell magazine
who had just started out at the time it
was two thousand or two thousand one had
asked me if I had a design for a prefab
house and I was starting to look a lot
at the trailer industry or the
manufactured housing industry but mostly
at the portable classroom industry and I
realized that the structure that the
portable classrooms were made out of
could easily be transformed into
residential units so this was an idea
that was you know before its time before
I was even ready to really digest it was
published and then that's when my phone
in many ways started ringing when I
started to go into these factories and
look at these kind of simple steel
structures I thought it was going to be
a very easy transformation between
educational and commercial use to
residential use as it turned out it
probably took me about half a dozen
years to really master the transition
and really understand what the
possibilities were but this was my first
prototype and I was thinking about it in
terms of multiples or modules and how I
could create courtyards or green spaces
and a kind of ease of construction
off-site construction you know whether
these ideas would exist in very arid
lands or in more urban dense conditions
this one being downtown Los Angeles
creating an artist community on a piece
of land that hadn't been developed and a
client came to me asking what he what i
could do with this area when i finally
figured out how to build it that
prototype came here to venice to abbot
kinney and became the show house for my
office where i was able to bring people
into
my world and give them a better
understanding of what a new
prefabricated mobile home could look
like I changed materials I used things
like polycarbonate on the walls apply
boo on the floor higher ceilings so this
otherwise very narrow space it's only 12
feet wide it gives you a whole new sense
of volume and a movement that project
was then bought by a client who moved it
over to Joshua Tree where it sits on
about 80 acres right now and it's a
self-sufficient contained housing and
house and then one of the project is to
kind of give you an idea of what the
flexibility of these systems allow this
is a form module prefabricated house
that is in Santa Monica right on the
border between Venice and Santa Monica
it's a very narrow lot and the modules
at their grade if greatest width or 16
feet wide so this house fit perfectly on
there this lot given the setbacks that
we were faced with and you can see that
there's a kind of public space on the
ground floor and a more private space on
the second floor the biggest challenge
in some ways for these buildings is
transportation and moving then on to
cite sometimes orchestrating cranes
sometimes jumping over you know
electrical wires it's probably for me
one of the most harrowing moments in the
entire process is when the cranes pick
up the buildings and are positioning
them very gently on their location
I've also been working to some degree
with a sip panel construction
structurally insulated panels which came
out of an invited competition by dwell
magazine to rethink the prefabricated
home I was interested in coming up with
a system that was somehow flexible
enough to give you a variety of outcomes
but with a consistent structural and
skin package that could be put together
so you can see here in this image you
know using that same kind of S shape you
can create three different types of
modular conditions this was the outcome
that I proposed for the competition and
well and it was then purchased by a
client about a block from here and
constructed in i guess the wall system
the whole sip panel system went up in
about three days he is a sound he is a
recording artist genius and he works a
lot with some pretty big names and so he
has a recording studio on this property
he was very interested in the control of
sound waves so what I found out with
working with this whole system is that
you get you know you can really tune
your building and then another project
that's a sort of hybrid between the
modular and the SIP panel system was one
that I worked on with a group of
students at Taliesin in Arizona which
was the first project I believe that was
built with the blessing of the Taliesin
community since the death of Frank Lloyd
Wright so it was oh it was a challenge
but you can see the project being built
in the desert you know by student labor
they already had a lot of the skills but
they hadn't built something at this
scale before and probably i'm not sure
what they're doing now this is the
outcome of that project it's it's over
a ravine it's a steel modular base and
chassis with a sip panel skin it's
applied to it and it also has a solar
array so it generates its own energy and
is off the grid which surprisingly
enough is not a common sight in a city
like Phoenix so modular construction and
mobile Construction is far greater and
wider and has much more profound I think
implications than any of us are even
aware of ideas that have been generated
for many years this was Claude proved
A's building that was designed in the
early 70s 72 74 he was the son of jean
proved a one of my great heroes i guess
and this is in france and it was a meant
to be a 60-unit or an eight-story
modular construction which was never
fully realized and this one was this is
the nakajima capsule tower by kurokawa
this was also built in 1972 70s the
early 70s were in late 60s were a very
important time when you look at
metabolized and you look at groups like
ARCA Graham so all around the world
there were pockets of people that were
thinking about mobility and and
prefabrication and transportation ideas
and a couple of these ideas were built
on this project unfortunately was
destroyed a few years ago but you can
see again this idea of off-site
construction building things with a lot
more control in a factory and then
introducing them onto a site and just
quickly assembling them and then this is
a project that oh that my firm is doing
in Seoul Korea right now which takes its
clue from some of that history I'm
thinking also about a tower but working
with industrial up-cycled materials in
this case shipping containers or jetways
and then small vehicles so this company
is a retail company and they sell
high-end sports equipment and they
wanted a way to not only display their
goods for shopping but the idea that I
brought to them was that they could pull
pieces of the building off and those
building pieces could move around the
city creating kind of pop up instant
retail experiences which they liked and
with that of course comes an app and you
can locate you know your pop-up
environment as needed so this is the
beginning of you know the app and what
the opportunities are for displacement
or relocation and then elements of the
building from ETF e skins which are
pneumatic skins to hydraulic car lifts
where things kind of expand and contract
it will and the section here shows you
that the public space and the private
space have are certainly separated from
each other and yet are able to be
blurred depending on the use or the time
of the day and here it is in downtown
Seoul as we've conceived of it
so finally I'm just going to show you a
video from an entry an award winning
entry for a project called the city of
the future that was put on and presented
at lac Mariah T of designers and
architects were selected to contribute
to this and my thinking about it you
know even though this was a few years
ago I still feel that this holds true
that water our most precious resource
will essentially become the new oil in
terms of what are our needs and desires
are in this city just pull up my film
possibly
see so this shows
this shows the idea that our buildings
will start to mimic kind of a biomorphic
condition that as they they grow and
they are more responsive more like a
plant they will be able to be controlled
in terms of their energy use or what
kind of program exists in them these
buildings might feed off of the existing
aquaduct which is what we consider to be
the LA River and that they will be able
to be positioned in parts of the city
that haven't necessarily had the
opportunity for growth so in between
crevices you know over the rooftops or
underground I realize that this has a
long way to go but I I also believe that
this idea of mobile portable deployable
architecture depends on the resources it
depends on you know the kind of
environment that we they we want for our
future and and it also kind of looks to
the future for a better way of living
that's it thank you
ah Julie just anything I met anyone have
it questions um I like for using pinky a
mobile architecture as terms as
repurposing trucks and gets very
effective in Los Angeles but I was
wondering if you had any thoughts about
other areas of the world like maybe i
don't know like Venice or Amsterdam or
even up in seattle where there's a lot
of water and thinking about mobile
architectures terms as nautical instead
of just something that you drive on the
highway mm-hmm so absolutely i mean
they're actually there are projects that
i just didn't bring today that think
quite a bit about life on on the ocean
and inhabiting you know some of the
largest most vastly unoccupied spaces on
the planet I think that all of these
ideas and in terms can be applied to
those environments whether it's you know
space or whether it's on as I said on
the ocean you know not mr. Lee the ocean
floor but a floating architecture
there's a project called Hydra house
that I've been developing for 10 years
that again thinks about self-sufficient
housing but then how those small hydras
can Mass together to create different
forms of community you know for me this
is just the beginning of a lot of these
ideas and I think that it's something
that I offer to you as students in ways
of developing it further will come you
know from from your generation
I don't know if I heard you correctly
but did you say architecture embedded
under the skin in the future and if you
did what what do you mean by that well
I've been really interested in wearable
architecture for quite some time and I
think we're starting to see it I mean
right didn't apple just put out their
new watch that's about to be released
you know so that's different that's on
the surface of our skin but groups I
would look to someone like Michael Webb
from ARCA Graham from the early 70s late
60s you know we're thinking about
smaller contained environments that
could then open up and unfold but really
we could wear them on our bodies so you
know when I start to think about truly
what the future will will bring us I I
imagine it as being a much more
compressed wearable environment that you
know as needed it inflates it expands it
contracts and it's light and it's
adaptable you know and possibly it's
within you know under embedded within
our skin almost robotic almost robotic
some robotic extension would come out
from under our skin and I think we're
seeing it already i really think that it
exists you know certainly hollywood has
a fantasy about it it's typically
dystopic but i am a lot more optimistic
than Hollywood and I feel like you know
what is getting produced even in the
world of fashion and the way in which a
lot of designers now we're working with
the kind of machined crafted you know
use of materials and cutting fabrics
that information will eventually trickle
down to us I often look outside of my
industry or outside of architecture to
get inspiration and I see all of these
other industries starting to work in
different ways and I'm trying to find
ways for us to you know successfully
pull that information towards us
I guess it makes me when you're speaking
maybe think of Alexander McQueen one of
his many shows with the robotic arms
that painted right as she was put
through the paintballs yeah yeah I was
just looking yeah so hopefully it's not
just something that's you know a fashion
experience but it's really actually GM
picked that up and they have it on a
commercial where they have these robotic
arms there as the GM is the cars on the
runway and the robotic arms are dancing
well I often think that the automobile
industry is light years ahead of
architecture I mean cars you know they
they can they can heat your body they
can cool your body they you know give
lots of different sound environments
they're super kinetic you know that the
doors open you know five to fifty times
per day and our our buildings remain
heavily static and inoperable and you
know we have these large spaces in these
large rooms that we heat and cool as
opposed to thinking about the personal
user and the and the body in space like
each one of you should have your own
personal heating or cooling unit and not
this whole room along with our personal
brands and our brands so another
question and have you ever taken like a
semi truck and driven it on a site and
built around the truck not just the
truck itself but the entire unit the
semi truck so you could actually kind of
live in the front of it mm-hmm as well
as the back mm-hmm I have I was curious
if it done that but the project that i
need that i'm showing here at Google
that aeromobil is a very small version
of that I mean this is possibly a
dwelling unit it's only 12 feet long
it's an electric truck it's meant to you
know not be an 80 foot long Sam I it's
really meant to think about you know the
ease of mobility well I love trucks and
I have you know I probably entertain
myself constantly driving down the free
by looking at all the different
varieties of trucks and the skins and
what they can do you know I haven't had
the opportunity to work on that scale
yet I have one question regarding the
possibility or if you already worked on
structures for disaster relief mmhmm
yeah I mean I think that's a great
question janiel that comes up a lot for
me and I get asked quite a bit to
address that it's a really broad topic
and it's really a heart I mean no one
has really cracked it you know I think
one of the challenges has to do with
weight and deployability and you know
and the long-term use of a disaster
relief environment so you know whether
it's you're introducing a blue tarp as
you know we often see that then takes on
a variety of different shapes and forms
over time it's it's a huge challenge and
I seen some interesting designs but I've
never seen anybody successfully you know
create the perfect environment for and
maybe there is no particular one answer
I love to use this the analogy from the
film the gods must be crazy because
there's a scene if you haven't seen it
there's a scene where there's coke
bottle is dropped into the middle of
this African tribe and they pick it up
and they see it as you know as a kind of
answer or as a token from God that it
has these mystical powers but it really
creates all kinds of animosity within
this group of people so the point is if
you introduce a foreign material into a
particular region or environment you
have to be prepared for what you know
its meaning we'll have our how do you
take care of it over time
a lot of the technology that we think of
it as commonplace it's hard to get that
bolt it's hard to get you know that
piece of wire to replace a piece when
it's broken I've traveled a lot in
Southeast Asia and I see these
incredible inventions you know that
always have to do with mobile businesses
and enterprises and you know in China
where you see all of these this huge
variety of pop-up wheeled businesses you
know and it's made from found objects
and it's kind of you know just anything
that's anything that's within reach you
can fold into the project when it comes
to disaster relief I think there is this
overall sensibility or feeling within
the NGO environment that it has to be
something that's clean and something
that's kind of you know perfectly fit
into that particular condition and I
just don't think that exists in across
the board but it's something that you
know maybe you will think you're out add
one more question regarding like I
really like the idea of how like you're
approaching housing and especially with
the growing of cities that we coming up
like that statistics are just incredible
of like the population growth and I feel
that these might actually be the future
and I'm just thinking like in terms of
like multiple functions for like one
specific like type of we have different
programs into like one type of
architecture have you thought about like
converting the emerging different
functions into yeah maybe you heard the
story on NPR this morning but they were
talking about dead malls and the kind of
rethinking of what the mall you know
America has more malls than any other
country in the world and so many of them
are now obsolete because we don't shop
in the same way retail is changing so
these malls are becoming office spaces
or residential units but the primary
success behind the revitalization of
dead
mals is in a multi functional approach
so I definitely think that the idea of
program and architecture is shifting
radically that you know building a
building that's only about an office
function is a waste of time you know it
has to serve multiple purposes in
multiple ways and be a lot more
accommodating to the user otherwise it's
you know it'll be a dead mall okay that
was great thank you for the questions
thanks for coming and if you'd like to
join us we'll take a tour of the
aeromobil thank you Thank You Jennifer
