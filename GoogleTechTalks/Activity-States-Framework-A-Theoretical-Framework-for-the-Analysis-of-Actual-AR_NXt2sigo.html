much to Jacoby Nile is going to be
talking about activity States framework
and I hope that the sort of the subtext
of everything that she will tell us
about she has been to do some wonderful
adventures in trying to combine machine
learning with activity theory with a
conversation analysis so that that's
just mind-boggling interesting so thank
you ahead give us all right okay so good
morning everyone and thanks for being
here so just call me nyla and currently
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the
horn Eden laboratory National Institute
of informatics in Tokyo Japan so this
morning I'm actually going to present my
PhD dissertation since two years ago on
activity States framework which is a
theoretical framework for the analysis
of actual human collaboration on the web
so this is the outline of my talk for
this morning first of all I'm going I'm
going to try and get all of you into the
overall story of how the framework came
about and what it was for in the very
beginning by sharing a little bit about
the background history and the goals and
then I will proceed to introduce the
framework and I'm going to show a sample
of how it's being done and finally I
will move on to the discussion you know
what are the shortcomings what can we
learn from this framework and then
evidently asking ourselves like where do
we go next so the framework has history
actually into domain which is on agent
technology and work practice while I was
a PhD student at leiram cnrs my PhD
supervisor had this idea to conceive a
learning agent that can induce
communication protocols of another agent
on a great infrastructure so what what
we mean by communication protocol is the
ability for the agent to infer a new
context of communication and to knowing
what to communicate with with whom and
with when so similarly in 2004 I met
bill can see who is the chief scientist
at the human scent
computing at NASA Amos and he read my
paper workshop people on the agent and
communication protocols and then he came
back with a handful of comments in
future direction so he started to
narrate the challenges that they were
facing during the NASA health and Mars
project for shop from NASA hisham p and
what this na sahi champey project is
about is actually it's an it's an
exploration project which is aimed at
developing new technologies on agents
and tools to support people
collaborating in cross domain
collaboration and one of the aim is to
design these tools so that you can
support robots and human to explore Mars
and other planets in the future and so
the main challenge was simply this how
do you understand the communication how
do people induce communication protocols
in cross domain collaboration for Clancy
at them during the NASA hisham p and i'm
going to explain the two contexts where
it's concerning understanding
communication protocols in cross domain
collaboration so the first challenge is
how do you enable robots to communicate
with astronauts on Mars so one of the
difficulty that they had was to develop
the robot the robot did not know when a
communication with an astronaut for
example has come to an end or whether
the communication is still in a in a
possible you know my work activity with
you hasn't ended yet and it makes it
even more complicated when the robot for
example has to communicate with the
geologists or computer scientists
because all these experts has a
different way of you know carrying out
their work practice so then the question
goes back like how do you enable agents
able to induce communication protocols
now the second challenge is also it's
about NASA hisham team members
collaborating with outside organizations
I'm through email so Clancy had like a
short experiment in 1999 and it to event
two events took place actual events
which the first costs
to the team members so what happened was
one of the NASA members was allowed to
have private email with outside
organization and the context that they
were discussing was about the safety
issues at the habitat so that's a
habitat so you know where they go and
simulate their work practice and it
actually affected the group decision
problem by allowing this direct
communication with the outside experts
but on the other hand during another
event where the members the NASA members
were communicating with outside experts
on weather forecasting the there wasn't
any problems at all so it did it
actually in fact the group were in a
mutual collaboration process learning
collaboration process so then again how
do you know when to allow the members
the NASA members to use email to
collaborate with outside organization on
for example explaining about safety
issues procedure or on weather
forecasting so then it goes a bit again
to how do people induced communication
protocols in different contexts of
communication so sorry yeah it was a
problem so the problem was what it was
an intuitive oh okay so what happened
was the he after direct directly
communicating with the outside expert he
had his own interpretation of how the
safety issues the procedures should be
carried out during the simulation at the
habitat and as you know that the NASA
members there are in a hierarchy inner
power order so you have the mission
support the commander and the crew
members so the member who communicated
was a crew member and the commander is
supposed to control the communication on
a need-to-know basis so that all
decision is being made by the commander
and the crew members supposed to follow
the decision so because of this direct
communication with the outside expert
this crew member did not agree with the
commander's way of handling the safety
issue instead he said you know I've had
this direct communication but I don't
think we should be following this way I
think from my own interpretation we
should carry out the safety issues in
this manner so
that wasn't so so one important point is
that when you said communication
protocol I imagined one thing mm-hmm
about you know sending it pieces of
information to put and this is a failure
of the sort of power or hierarchy
protocol yes the answer ya medication
protocol I know those get entangled but
I there are two separable ideas so okay
so when when I say the communication
protocol here is again I say that how do
you infer the different context so that
you can know when and what and how to
communicate with in that situation so in
this in this context of problem in fact
what happened was the both of them was
they were in a breakdown situation
because for the for the team leader
there's a there's a difference between
what he knows how to normally
communicate through the protocols and
what actually happened in out offer as
the effect of the event yeah yeah just
that you're using the term protocol in
many senses here okay using instance of
social protocol and sense of power
protocol in a sense of communication
protocol which I think to pay to be sort
of messages going back and forth and
when you talk about inducing the end of
a communication no no I think about that
in sort of lower level that I think
you're meaning it is that when did you
hit the end of your paragraph right
versus I don't believe what you're
saying because you spoke out of turn
with an external expert there's
different levels of abstraction all
right okay so and then so I said the
long term to find to understand how
people induce communication protocols in
cross-domain collaboration so why would
such findings be important for NASA
hisham p is that to allow some sort of
prediction of communicative behaviors
because with the prediction you know the
you can know the implications of actions
so if there is a discipline see between
the robot human communication how how
would you allow the robot to handle that
disprin see or what sort of tools can
you build to incorporate that disprin
see and
then if you allow them to collaborate on
internet for example what if gtalk is a
lot as a communication tool with outside
experts what are the consequences of
that and this is when I did a little bit
of virtual ethnographies so i had to
find a similar context of study and i
used their European Union learning great
infrastructure project to to carry out
my observation so the image I project
was the European Union funded project in
2004 and they had this goal to
reengineer present tools bodyspace
instant messaging and flash meeting
which was developed by knowledge media
Institute at Open University and also to
build new ones to support a group of
chemists collaborating in Europe and one
of the future goal is how do you use
agent that can communicate with people
to carry some of their task for them and
what was interesting was during this
collaboration there are many different
experts they were cognitive
psychologists computer scientists IT
people who were going who were whose
communication were mediated by all these
tools so I focus on one subject which is
the project executive of the project of
the image I project and I try to keep
track of his communication with other
other group members during the
collaboration so I got permission to get
real chat logs and video meetings and
for the chat logs I had the project
executive six months history chat logs
with another project manager and for the
meeting they were about like five or six
people having regular meeting like once
in two weeks so I had about four
meetings to analyze so that's the
bodyspace user interface and the flash
meeting replay so so when I had this
these chat logs then I had a lot of
problem analyzing them because so first
of all I'm going to show and at serve of
the chat logs and then I'm going to
explain why it's very problematic to
analyze it so I I highlighted in
different colors to show the sort of
different activities that people are
engaged in on the chat logs so if you
look at the traits
blue color there in the activity of they
were using map one of the features of
the bodyspace instant messaging and how
to how to personalize the features and
then the pink one suddenly the
collaborator M is talking about he needs
to log on and off for testing so
actually in the previous history of the
chat log they had presents problem on
the instant messaging so you know Sally
he goes by and say I have to get back to
my previous activity and if you look at
the brown the highlight the brown one
now what happens is that the other
collaborator is asking you know could
you ask me how to add a new user to the
bodyspace but not yet in ellijay so the
problem is why is it ambiguous it's only
because at first you don't know who is
replying to what in that context because
of the multitasking inherently the
multitasking nature of people so the the
beginning of a new subject when they're
discussing doesn't end in a sequential
order so you actually have to go line by
line to actually find what were the
context what were the events that
emerged so again because I wanted to
understand how people induce protocols
in different contexts of communication
and then going further back at an
abstract level it's really hard for me
to find patterns that can explain to me
how people induce communication protocol
and so I had to find a way to capture
this semantics of the activity of people
and make it explicit so later on in the
future we can have sort of like a
machine learning algorithm that can
learn those induction of patterns so I
reestablish my goal that instead for now
to make an analyst sister simply can
help me make sense of the very end
biggest chat logs so if you look over
here that's the raw chat log so what I
mean by to make sense from here you have
an analysis that tells you okay from
time 1106 on this date till time 130 on
this date user m was in the activity of
giving to talk
how to use instant messaging and then
from this time where's my princess so
from this time 1523 on this date till
1450 user M was in the activity of
organizing a trip to Montpellier so from
making sense of the activities we can go
further to recognize events that emerged
during the collaboration so the event is
like saying the sort of activities that
took place in order to ought to say for
example okay if you have the event of
coordinating meeting in Montpellier so
the first activity they do is first they
start chat and then they pause they use
the email and then they go to check the
calendar and at the end they're in they
go to the activity of group chat or
video meeting so you have sort of like a
beginning and opening of events and you
can sort of like understand what they do
in between all those events and it was
from here that my goal was to make the
analysis that to make sense in the first
place was how activity states was
conceived and the analysis was first and
foremost to sort of like reorganize the
chat logs and it was a meant making
sense of the communication activities
and it was based on cognition theory so
I used carnation theory to help me
organize the am biggest data first of
all like what to look for and what do I
do next and again once we have that how
do I capture the semantics of activity
and make it a bit explicit and so stuff
like now you have the observations of
the raw data and you need sort of like a
guideline how do you bring the
observation that you know your eyes can
see and this is how feet by a CL came
into the picture Sophie by a CL is the
foundation for intelligent physical
agents and it's a Swiss nonprofit
organization established in Europe in
1996 so the FIBA ischial organization
aim is to define a full standards of
agent communication their ontology their
protocol and what it was nice that I use
the feedback easier
communicative X because they have
defined the semantics for speech acts
like say inform ref request whatever
query if so I use this as a springboard
using similar idea they used so to
capture the semantics of utterances
using speech XD is belief desires and a
certainty so it's like you have this
guideline and you have the observation
how do you map them back and the FIBA
ACL they have so as I say they have a
guideline on how to specify the agent
messages so this is how I use the format
to sort of like I use the format to
output my analyzed data and the format
is in like you see there's speech eggs
and who is the sender and who is this
listener and there is a content level a
so at the content level a it is sort of
like they give you the freedom to
specify the kind of structure you want
for the content level and for me I use
the predicate level because I want to
enable protocol analysis later on so for
example you have a car which is an
object and then m which is whose car it
is and nice which is to describe you
know your car is nice so overall you
have the raw chat logs and the activity
states sits in between the chat logs and
uses the fee fee fee per se el to output
it as agent messages so the activity
states is like what 24 where to go next
and then you have a string you have a
the output of the raw chat logs sort of
like in a protocol and so before I
introduce the framework because during
the framework I'm going to repeatedly
sort of like use these basic ideas and
since I mentioned that the first idea is
to use cognition theories right and how
do i use it is that I look into
cognition processes as functions for
organizing organizing the data so you
see here i put the function in three
levels to show how from a from an idea
general abstract idea to a more detailed
level and at each of this cognitive
process I it's like you're evaluating
and what is the value what is the value
that you return at different levels so
when I speak about the value i'm not
speaking value of like numbers per se
but rather for example if you ask
conceptualization what is he doing so
you written oh he's coordinating a data
and then you go deeper and you want to
get more information which is calling
contextualization so what is the
activity in the coordinating meeting so
it returns scheduling meeting day and it
goes further down to get more
information about that activity of
scheduling meeting date so then there is
a function reflect and here i use
activity theory from leon tap on object
and subject so it asks you it asks you
to possess a question what is the object
and subject of his activity so object is
like what is the focus at the moment
while it is in this activity and what is
the referential process while he's
conceiving his object his motivation at
this time so then it returns the value
to get the confirmed date by today and
secondly now that you have the
observation where do you go and what to
look next is to secondly to capture the
semantics of the states of activities
which speech egg so here I mentioned
that the object subject is used in the
function reflect so again the object is
the focus at the moment the subject is
the referential process of the object
there so secondly i use the idea of
fluctuation of activity states and this
is actually my observation how they were
doing their activities while they're
collaborating so I use this fluctuation
to resemble the open and the past and
the end of activity to it's reaching a
goal and I identify three states passive
which is they're just starting in the
activity of coordinating a meeting
semi-active there in between of
starting and towards reaching the goal
of the activity and the active is the
near ending state so i used believe
desires and uncertainty to capture this
now why did i do that is this is just to
show you how it is and passive in other
words is just to show the local minimum
and active is the local maximum of the
activity so the reason why I to capture
the semantics and in this way is because
the activities can overlap so let's say
you are jesting the activity of
coordinating a meeting and you're you
know and you're your goal is at the end
of the day to get all the particulars
about the meeting but while you're in
this activity it can overlap with
another activity which is debugging an
instant messaging so you sort of like in
a suspension mode to completion of the
activity so the passive and the semi
active and the active States helps me to
two segments like trying at a
fine-grained detail the moment of moment
that the intention changes in respect to
the intervention of another activity and
the second reason was because remember i
mentioned that feat by a CL has already
a set of all the semantics of the speed
checks but it was a little bit difficult
because it's very close like request
request whenever it's you know the
semantics is a little bit close so by
using this different states sort of like
I'm trying to cluster similar
representation of speech act so i can
easily met them back to the define feet
by a CL the speech x defined and sorry i
guess a little bit about yes was the
passive 77
oh sorry so it's like so the passive is
just to denote an idea that the person
has just started that activity and the
semi-active is just to show that like
saying oh can you please send me that
file now okay so it's like people are
already in the action of executing a
task and the active is saying like you
have okay I already got that it's
wonderful it's perfect great you know
it's just to show that okay the activity
of coordinating meeting has been
completed Center about mapping based on
the speech acts that you like that are
facing from the ball transcript uh-huh
basically map even tis too positive yes
yes oh so actually i just showed this
some line is to show the degree of the
different attention mode that people can
be on silhouettes that the red line is
the intention the SD is the cognitive
state of person reactivity it's like I'm
missing it okay i'm using what are the
units that that's measured in to weather
is passive or semi-active when you draw
a curve like this okay I assume there's
some kind of dimensional measure here
right mm-hmm and then you've got it
looks like you got a broken up into
categories like this region measures is
passive you play your passengers yeah
yeah so I don't get what the y-axis is
how are you what why is that a
continuous curve oh so so the reason
okay why it is a continuous curve is too
it's sort of like to show the sort of
it's not to show actually but it's
actually to capture the flow of people
when they're collaborating in different
sort of activities that may overlap so
the continuous crap is saying like okay
you're in the you're in this in this
cluster of activity in coordinating
meeting so you're just starting okay
you're reaching the maximum amount
you're both executing and you descend by
that okay it's already done we're
finished with coordinating
me but even before you are just about to
finish a new activity two comes in which
is just starting and and you're just now
starting to to about time yeah yeah it's
like a time yeah good to confirm I sorry
I'm still lost on that one so the
confirmed date is really a part of
activity one yes so they reappear again
you don't even do a daughter too oh
we're mean so it's just to show that
they're you know different activities so
is the y-axis basically attention yes
yes DSO the x-axis sorta yes the time
and the line represents for an
individual yes yes yes yes 411
collaborator so it's just trying to
capture like the different shape of
attention in a continuous flow so
they're overlapping conversations yeah
yeah and the amount of active can you
actually measure so yeah that's the
that's a little bit hard to answer if
how to exactly measure that so the way
that I measure was so the way that I
measure that I used the FIBA ACL so they
already have the standards like belief
desire and uncertainty so every
different changes let's say the second
iteration he says oh I've got that can
you please send me again so I sort of
like increase oh he he believed so you
know you go into the definition that you
increase the belief now they it's much
stronger than the previous belief but
now the uncertainty level that the
person doesn't know about this subject
has decreased and then the desire to to
get this activity completed is increased
more so it's actually playing with the
with the belief uncertainty and desire
so this is one of the shortcomings that
I have to discuss later on is how do you
actually you know evaluate that so that
the y-axis is basically
the translation estimated your
understanding of the cognition of
different faiths yes yeah over time of
one collaborator communicating with
another one here oh yeah there are
different focus different like different
subject like in the coordinating meeting
you can talk about scheduling you can
talk about flight when do you want to
come to Montpelier and then you can be
engaged in so corny okay what sort of
equipment should I bring when I go to
the meeting so the dot is to show so you
have this like on a surface you have
this activity coordinator meaning but
there are many sort of like focus our
objective in the meeting to get days to
get confirmation so that dot that little
circle is to show like the difference
type of focus that appears during this
activity um so oh ok nightly separate
activities are you suggesting that
activities some events are part of the
activity yes it could be because what I
not this is for example it happened
quite a lot that by accident by chance
so for example there India there in the
activity of giving a tutorial so the
activity two is just saying that it
overlapped that it can also how to say
it can emerge as a new activity from the
tutorial so what happened was they were
giving tutorial and one of the person
one of the guy not is that hidden are he
noticed that the color of the presence
was different from while listening to
the tutorial and from this activity
suddenly he went to a new activity which
is debugging the tool so actually there
was a problem with the presence so it's
actually crying time to drink keep track
of the possibility that if you're in
this activity what are the possibility
that you know a new activity will emerge
yeah excuse me I have to turn
ikea right so you have three activities
here so they are screenshot oh oh this
is guy in special yes years for a single
activity right I'm passing the same
activity but to this video share the
same curve here right so so I'm trying
to figure out some states here there are
full why activity always for the
performance of modifier it is the
performance at each moment during the
activity I know that that's really I
know a lot of people like this yeah you
brought up the police designer and
chicken uncertainty and you suggested
that you use those to code their
statements therefore determined estate
SJP semi-active a passive yeah are you
going to talk about the mapping from
those three states to these active
versus passive state oh so in this talk
I'm not going to talk about the mapping
perfect from my instance but I can go
that further on it yeah yeah yeah
because actually that's the biggest
challenge how do you map so now that you
have the observation and you cluster
stuff like you're categorizing from your
own observation and then you have what
is defined in the FIFA guideline so now
you have to sort of like merge them you
know how do you know how to map from
your observation to the feedback
guideline and in which categories does
this semantics definition fall into so
it's sort of like trying to minimize the
search space for speech eggs so that was
my idea because I was having problems
you know there's so many how do i know
which speech ike to choose because they
are a little bit the same the semantic
sometimes so sorry so the workflow I
hope you guys can see cuz it's a little
bit small here I tried to fit the screen
sorry so so this workflow is really at
the cost
level and I'm I must move just help me
oh so it's like the framework the
analysis so much yeah I usually yeah
yeah I said yeah SN anÃ¡lisis yeah so
throughout the time I'm drop the
workflow I'm going to mention trips a
lot so trade is just I'm going to say a
lot about present rate and previous trip
so what I mean by present rate is this
one and this is previous trip so let's
say we have a set of chat logs so the
first function is conceptualized so what
it does is you're trying to compare the
activity of the present trade and the
previous street so then you make a
decision is it the same activity so if
you look in this example it's not the
same activity one guy is talking about
sorry disconnection and another one is
talking about which time it's more
convenient for you so if it's not the
same activity if it's a same activity by
all the other hand if it's the same
activity you go to contextualize one
which is to check if the object of the
context in the shower activity is
related so again remember that I said
object is the focus of the moment so
you're trying to check ok are they both
you know more or less sharing the safe
focus but you know here that they're
they're not in this example but if they
do if it is it if if it is object
related then you go further down which
is function reflect one and is to check
if the activity for that task is
complete so why do you have to check
because again you need to know ok in
which state are they in semi-active are
they in passive state so because again
you need to shrink the search state of
the speech X so when you when you when
you evaluate you have to compare them
whether the test is not complete or yet
and then you can sort of like yet the
value of the of the activity states
whether you know has save semi-active or
active and then you return this value of
the activity states to the mark-up ecl
so actually this markup SEL is where the
fifa fifa ACL guidelines and
specification come in
so again it's like trying to fit into a
model and what it does the function
markup ACL is just that you convert the
analyzed trade into agent messages and
then you output them okay so so you want
to end up with an agent a formal yes the
public's yes and and the tree above is
is all the pain you go through in order
tickets the real people's real
communication segments and then
classified inconsiderable up read the
answers yes yes yeah good thank you okay
and and there there is another thing I
have to mention this though why did I
have to go through all the pain to use
the state's concept right so the other
reason is because the FIBA ACL has a it
likes in the in the history it doesn't
look into the history of the
conversation it's just you know it takes
out the context so then so then the
semantics is saying like oh I have my
intention at this moment is than you
know but that's not how it is in real
life so that's why I had two men you
create a bit the semantics but i still
use the feet by ACL to find the
approximation and should i go on with
the 2x bindiya the side of the workflow
or you guys okay i can go to the app
because i'm going to go more detail
after this so all right so--okay to show
you step by step so for example you have
so now we're at please mark could you
explain to me how i can check with
somebody already registered in bodyspace
but not yet in aleejack so the first
thing you to do is ok check the activity
space of the present and the previous is
it a same activity okay obviously
they're not so you go to contextualize
to and then when you're here you
identify the object of the context and
you check is this new activity you know
is this a new object of the moment and
here actually this is when you look into
the previous chat logs and he actually
during the time 1420 the collaborative p
has already asked if he could tell him
how to
but he didn't get the answer about this
so he asked again so you know that okay
this is not a new activity you know it
has really it has appeared in the
history so you go to reflect for so when
you're at the reflect for what it does
is that you check if the task for the
object of context is complete so here
you know that it's not complete because
he didn't get an answer and also use
this example what is the object of
context so the object of context is
check somebody registering bodyspace to
check with somebody how do i check with
somebody so it's like you know the focus
at the moment is the object yeah the
object of the context of 40 years of
activity theory has a hierarchies for
objects right yeah at this level object
is a four person yeah yeah as I
mentioned so what is the object at the
high level for this activity so this is
okay so this is another thing when I'm
referring to the activity theory i'm
mostly referring to leon yontiff
activity theory rather than the more
yeah and the leon tov activity theory is
more focused on object subject concept
which is saying like if you have a tool
and what is your motivation and the
subject is you so let's say you have a
pen and I'm the subject and how does the
the motivation and your interaction with
with what you want to do is go in a
cyclic approach a transformation so
there is also another thing wish I
didn't discuss like for example the
object and subject i mentioned that i
use that right so actually the object
and subject i use that to parse every
every utterance else actually because i
noticed another thing when you're
chatting in one thread maybe I can ok
like say this trip in one utterances
sometimes you can have
you can say something on the same line
right like you say oh how can i check
with some it by the way did you get you
don't bother to go to the next line so
object is a focus the focus at the
moment so it's a bizarre moments that
some say you work on which means right
yeah yeah what yeah you work on label
focuses so it's something you work on
yeah it's like yes you can think of it
like that like you know okay something I
want to achieve my motivation to talking
to you is that could you please tell me
how to add this new person to the
bodyspace so it's like doing so seems
like it should be the sort of so it
should be a sphere or the knowledge to
you and that person to the body space
instead of focus today so if I didn't
get it should be like na jiya so how to
how to do and the person for the
bodyspace yeah yeah yeah that's so it's
so you're saying like it's like
intention right like the object I'll
jump the moment it's a little bit like
intention yeah yeah yeah yeah yes yeah
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true
you can think of it so so then you
return the value and the state of the
test so you know here that the state of
the task is not completed because I mean
you know you don't have he hasn't
replied yet on how to add the body space
and then if it's not completed and then
so if it's not complete that you compare
so the reason this is this might be like
a little bit ambiguous to understand is
because sometimes okay sometimes they
might be talking about the color of the
body space so the prescence so they have
a lot of problem with the with the
presence problem like you know I'm great
for myself but I think
that great that means I'm not online but
I'm actually online so actually even the
color cost a problem for the for the
collaborators so you have to compare
because sort of that you have to know
whether how much is the attention
changing so that's why I say compare
activity States of present rate to the
one that it was associated to previously
so let's say in this example at the
previous trip that you're analyzing in
association the present rate that you're
analyzing an association to the previous
trade you're trying to see has what is
the changes going on here you know what
is and then when i say differentiate is
now that you compare you say that oh ok
he has said it twice so perhaps i will
increase the belief again that means he
wants to get an answer he's getting the
collaborator to get back and focus on
him to give him the attention and then
by differentiating that you return the
activity states finally with that value
you go to the mark-up SEL function which
and then you define the believe the the
desired and the uncertainty and then the
when you return that this is when you
have to map the semantics to the FIBA
ACL communicative egg and then you
restructure them together into the
formalized messages so this is the
output the it's in a set of protocols
and another another thing if you realize
that for example i use ok I shall like
mmm mmm here correspond to this message
so this corresponds to this p 1106 1108
corresponds to this set of messages and
if you notice that the the the speech
acts they're not just one speech ex that
I use because again this goes back to
using the object subject notation to
sort of like parse the utterances so
it's actually trying to see at every
moment even with the how to see even
with the dot while they're chatting how
the attention is changing is he still
talking about the same thing so yeah so
that's why the protocol
looks like you know very a lot sometimes
you can be a lot more than that than the
actual occurrences that that is again I
said that in the utterances you can talk
about many subjects so what is really
nice about this because having this
actually allows me to quickly understand
oh please inform really and then you say
confirm to the message 26 so you
actually can already know at a if you
want to allow later on for the machine
learning to induce patterns fall from
these protocols your you already
associate the context rather than the
chat log so you know that this message
28 here so this is like just giving a
message number it's saying that he's
confirming that he doesn't know about
this situation so the and another thing
which is which is very useful for me to
use this kind of formalized messages is
that I can easily sort of like keep
track you know like okay it's like
you're eliminating all the other words
and you see like query if still there
inform if Shawn green on rooster so
Android already at the level it's quite
easy for me to to to to put to
understand the flow of the activities
and from this protocols I managed to
find I managed to sort of like keep
track of every changes of the sort of
activity that took place during the
collaboration for example first
explained to new user how to use chat
system and when I say action reply with
broadcast option to chat so the user
went online and he asked oh is this
action broadcasting in reply to your
check is this a good way to reply and
because of this question started a new
tutorial on how to use bodyspace and the
guy say okay I'm going to show you how
to use one to one chat and it's just
showing showing on a timeline on that
day the sort of activity that took place
that sometimes they grow in relationship
to previous activities
that's a lot of activity in one top
sorry tell me is this just a coincidence
oh it's all different activities because
I would have expected that there would
also be a return because an activity was
not completed it started out there but
it doesn't end until one week later yes
something so how would show that that
netting you have up there haha dark be
very suitable for showing that no it
wouldn't be fun for the moment this is
just like on a date basis but if you
want to see yeah like if it doesn't end
on the same day and if it ends on the
second day how do you do that mapping so
this disorder is implicitly assuming
that exhibitors are limited in what I'm
yeah within a day is to show the other
may be in love you not only sort of so
oh yes what about two slides ago uh-huh
this sorry for one yeah on the right
side the phone calls that you generated
there this is the language the ACL yeah
is this what you pray where this is the
one that came from the eyes up so only
the content level I created but the the
speaker listener and the speech I be it
all comes from ppl okay so things like
it informative confirm yeah I all come
from ppl and then the content layer
seems to have a lot of the actual words
from the transcription in there yeah so
that's another so that's another
challenge in the predicate level because
if you have four level predicate that
will make it very complex for the
machine learning algorithm for example
to induce the pattern so this is
something that I'm still refining it
because that's another so this is trying
to find the perfect balance into trying
to capture as much as how people
naturally articulate things so that we
can you know understand the cognitive
level how they do work activity but at
the same
time if you formalize too much in actual
fight you're if you're removing what
isn't it you know because the idea is to
understand how people induce
communication protocol so if I formalize
too much then I'm going to lose how
people naturally do that so that content
level is another challenge that actually
I'm going to talk about the shortcomings
yeah so so first of all I talk a lot
about okay where do where do we go what
do we look next but in general generally
even if we have that we don't know the
precise variables to look for yet if we
want to allow learning algorithm to
recognize the same thing and so this is
also another shortcoming is that how do
you formalize the guidelines from the
transition of the activity states the
observations that you have back to FIBA
ACL communicative egg and then you need
to define the rules for all predicate
structures that means for example who
what action where who and there are many
possibilities and what is the best way
to represent that because you know again
if you from lies too much actually
you're just formalizing what people are
saying but in the end you want to learn
what they're doing and so although
although it seems kind of like time time
consuming to do this manual inspection
and real observation but there were many
lessons learned for example using the
cognition theory even at the abstract
level we don't really know exactly what
variables to for right now but we
already have a new formula just to check
and evaluate for communications that's
more contextualized and it works best in
a method of an ambiguous situation and
met so i manually inspected the data for
like six months so that's like 11 my
childhood for it to try and understand
the generality that emerges you know but
also it was very interesting because
there's so many things to capture from
the chat logs and although it's
time-consuming but it's very worth it
because if I don't spend my months in
the chat logs I wouldn't even come up
with at least its framework you know and
trying to capture the different mode of
attention by using activity States and
so now the most important thing is that
now that we have here sort of like a
guideline and the cognizant collation
concepts that we sort of like take for
granted like okay identify if activity
present rate is the same as previous but
how do you let a program do that I mean
for us we have the semantics and we
understand but how do you let an
algorithm recognize it just as we do so
then again I remind that my origin a
goal was to understand how people induce
communication protocols the patterns and
so the framework was conceived during an
exploration so doing it at a time the
main thing was to get even manual method
working at all so but now I've been
working on the same analysis for about
since too so I've even until now I've
been working on the analysis for two
years so I'm at the stage right now
where I have I'm trying to build a
communication analysis model because now
even if you have the observation right
and you have the protocols so even when
you look at the protocols you say okay
inform if but it's it it doesn't allow
yet the algorithm to tie the activities
together saying that from this time this
is about you know from this time to this
time they're in this activity so the
communication analysis that I've been
trying to look into right now it's more
looking into the communication expect of
you know what is a context how do you
relate from the content level to the
speech act saying that okay the
interaction between the speech and the
content level in the previous history
when you compose them it is about this
contact system it's about this activity
how do you allow an algorithm to do the
same so I left this analysis after I
finished my PhD and then I tried to look
for 4 i'm still analyzing data because
so far that i noticed that if you
analyze different kind of work practice
so if you analyze collaborative data
the kind of speech acts you use is
greatly different when you're analyzing
animation meeting so in animation was
which was harder for me to capture the
semantics when a bunch of animators are
collaborating online because they use a
lot of narration so you know hey I went
here yesterday so that's more like
imagination can you imagine this thing
going here a lot of storytelling so it's
even the speech acts that you want to
select it's different to to get the
semantics so now I've seen that I need
to re-establish my goal actually the
family that I I conceived during
exploration is to now to actually put
them into a more concrete method and
deal with all the the connections that I
have to meet for example as you raise
how do you map the semantics you know
how do you find them how do you define
that from passive to semi-active state
that this triggers the semi active state
you know how do you find that how do you
define from semi-active that this is
already in the region of active States
and how do you define the content level
what words to select you know and not to
select so finally again going back to my
first when i say my goal is again to
finish where I started you know so I'm
more or less in trying to make sense of
activities but I need to go there at
recognizing events finally so and nearly
end to my talk and I like to thank a lot
of people who has been very supportive
and very patient my PhD supervises the
final hre so he he's from you know the
agent people and professor a bill clancy
professor my Eyes's that and the leisure
group members and all and yeah thank you
very much for attention
