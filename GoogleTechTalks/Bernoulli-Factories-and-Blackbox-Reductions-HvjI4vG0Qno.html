so so so we always have this question
there's no beer designing algorithms for
non as strategies people or basically no
people at all which is the algorithms I
question and then we have the algorithm
is a question for a strategic human
entities which is the mecca of design
question and I'm trying to look at the
computational complexity question of the
mechanism design through the lens of
designing during polynomial time
reductions or reductions and there's
problem I'm looking at is maximizing
Social Venture so I'm going to define
but maximizing Social Welfare means and
I'm gonna define the type of reductions
I'm interested in so just stay with me
so then one example in this store I'm
looking at something that I find in this
problem but nothing is special about
this problem in the important I'm just
trying to make the techniques
understandable through this problem we
can replace is problem with anything
just so what is this problem so in this
problem in the every second we have
passengers that they want to commute
from their location to some destinations
and then we have drivers that they want
to pick up the passengers and give them
rides to their destinations and we
assume that you know each passenger has
a value for the rise that is interested
in giving you rise has some cost for the
drivers okay now the goal of the links
if lift is a good company
is max rating Social Welfare which in
this example is defined to be the total
by generated value drivers have negative
value so I find the social graph a basic
tool saturated value - photo gentle cost
and here the important part is you know
for the drivers and the passengers their
value for the ride and maybe the design
is perceived to be private information
things that they know but no one else
knows and therefore they cannot
strategize and then what makes this
problem art now let's remove their
strategy component from this partner and
we get to I don't want to be shy coins
the ups pop-ups from every morning you
cancel stores they have packages that
needs to be delivered to the UPS and
then we have ups jobs that they want to
go to these UPS restores get the
packages on the divider onto the
dispatching sentence and then serving an
ester has some value for UPS and has
some cost for the UPS due to the cost of
the truck going from one location to
another maybe the salary of the truck
driver or the fuel consumption and now
the goal of the UPS or the company is to
maximize the total benefit which in this
case let's say so a total value minus
the total cost of units okay so just a
not a strategy problem and you look at
the special case that's for example
there is just one truck and it wants to
serve the UK sister unless the imagine
that the truck can just load one package
this is basically the traveling salesmen
if you think about this for a second so
we know this is that you computation
problem there are extra charge by terms
or maybe fancy people are running
heuristic algorithm for this problem but
this is hard even without considering
the incentive and the original non
incentive problem is also hard right so
then we start thinking what should we do
about the problem
okay
okay you know clear
DBAs would make sense to be enough
showing up to the social justice
okay so the fruits of who she is looking
at this problem with incentive
constraints as an optimization problem
in new optimization problem that now has
incentive constraints condition as
constants basically you have one
constraint for each pointer that says
this video doesn't matter if I miss
before thing but the problem is now you
will have if you add that to the known
as such a problem you will have an
optimization problem that has may be
uncountably many constructs because you
need to look at any deviation and maybe
the astonishia space is continuous
therefore you have uncovered many
constants so the problem is you you you
need you need to design a new set of
machinery so Asahi scheme problem and
this is one mechanism design is a hard
question and this is both transition a
mechanism
and then they write because this is
exactly what's happening here
now if you have been fair if you
right
you know it's for more skating stance
about Lloyd fold they randomized a
stances that's you is actually good now
the question is the following let's get
back to the point that I explained
earlier if you want access to the
optimal solution this reduction very
easy this is the solution of economies
we can visit later so what we feel you
said is the following so if you can't
solve the optimization problem without
incentives I have like a black box let's
say n is the number of coils or number
of people in this system then we n plus
1 calls to the origin you can actually
find a set of crises that together with
the publication rule will give you a
mechanism that is through food I achieve
the Oksana's if it's a growing finger
it's so universal way of transforming
any optimal solution to the problem to a
mechanism now here is a question asking
which is exactly
but monitors and I discussed is a
universal way of transforming any
algorithm in sanitizer so that I
preserve the social welfare and the make
setting I'm looking at is in any
conflicts of my life but I can say maybe
it's a better term the VCG virus disease
like his voice for the most sterile case
for this transform here really means it
means that if I around the original
heuristic algorithm whatever it outputs
you can get the same exact output here I
may actually manipulate be de-allocated
so then why not running a good
approximation or if you have a heuristic
insulative chronic develop how they
defined earlier let's go to three points
suppose V always hard is not hard on VCG
can be done in fundamental to the
message and everything is good the
problem is maybe
VCG cannot be done equal to your time
and again for cystic also if you change
your input in a very logical way and
something and you cannot say I don't
want to like go into this mode and to
find out what kind of a structured
operation in order to make the reduction
possible you know what you're thinking
but now I'm looking at it the emotion
you just give me some pizza sit
backwards
I saw meet the man use case for
allocation that's exactly but the new
artistic currency I guess your venture
say I
okay so good I think now is the right
moment to formalize the plaque reduction
program so let me actually define the
multi parameter setting or the VCG
setting again so here is the abstract
setting I'm looking at I have any users
and agents and each one has a private
type denoted by di and I'm looking at
the Bayesian setting which is very
important here I'm gonna explain by it
which is the setting that you can assume
their underlying current Y or
distributions for del x type of ages is
sample from individuals for each
depending on okay now because are
submitting their targets it might feel
non truthful submission but they just
stopped me some numbers p1 to PN and
their numbers earlier which elements of
diverse places on time spaces or terror
cells so these people from p.m. and then
the mechanism designer that has two
functions the allocation of payments fix
the outcome 1/2 of B and charges each
person is something material so what if
the black box leadership and the utility
of the user is value what is payment the
coordinator now what is the black box
reduction problem it's the following
problem so I have users they have types
they submit their time oh and I have
access the black box on vacation with an
A so what is my allocation operator
is my black box so the input of the
platforms is a profile of types let's
say s1 through SN so basic you use
create the parameter types you give it
to the algorithm and the algorithm is
speed starts somehow it's the way that
you can think of any algorithm right and
I assume that my mechanism has access
since Erica's always concerned as many
queries as want to his allocation now
all players are eating their beats the
mechanism interacts with the black box
allocation better not now fix and
outcome are charges some money and the
promise each have is the following kind
of incentive compatibility which is
called the IC which is the case that no
player of my misreporting if you assume
that the other people are truthful and
their reports are going from their type
distribution so this is a very important
type of solution concept and the other
one which is the terminus start
incentive compactor is not the ball that
works here so if you have any question
about it would be happy to answer so
this is the way you can think of PRC you
are an agent and you have no idea what's
happening in the patient board so you
have C with everyone else is truthful
and their reported time is coming from
their distribution now playing
truthful is your best strategy in this
outcome and Davis or big such as playing
the message for you
this is cognate and we are looking at
the expected bill fair which is the
total expected is advanced by matters
and the expectation is over the
randomness in the x okay so we are
looking at efficient reduction in this
computation to a black box meaning that
the black box our access to some
algorithm that's as I said can be like
any approximation here is speed and now
we need a mechanism that has these three
properties first of all
okay
information-theoretic a No
so you can always do VCG right so that
means if you're allowed to do BCG the
information or don't even of the make
sense right so in that sense it is the
complexity lower box because you can
always do BCG conditional on the
algorithm it's information you don't
assume that and you're able to do non of
your time if you calculate the sample
complexity is information thoroughly but
if you calculate the total computation
is the computational complexity they say
just geyser that exactly gets the
promise that my pockets you don't do it
more than an N and that's for the so the
welfare of a side of it that's where
your that's the heuristic black box
which a is the one that you need to
measure welfare on in that is it any a
is it the one of the many of you query
or is it for the particular query you
mean so it's like queries a type
reference so this is like expectation
when the type report is drawn from the
type distribution type of the videos are
drawn from known distributions now you
can imagine a black box allocation
algorithm we're just drawing types from
you could have a very easy because I
mean if I don't have a proof or upper
bond I don't have an example that shows
that you can for we should get more
minimum solution you're saying anything
so you have to prove that son yeah like
just one anymore you cannot find that
one and you should be able to find that
one
because in the on the and then from
which is interesting photo so my plan
for doing some reduction let's imagine
that you are a user and you focus on one
user and here's what you wanna do you
wanna transform this users file to
something that I call the surrogates
okay so yeah I need draws from the type
history which I call yes
okay and my plans for during the
reduction is the following which is say
I asked the agent to report the time
just just too much in one agent I asked
the agent to report the time and then we
assign more of this
to his times and then granada' using his
time in the application Alberto I just
used this service interrogation Albert
I'm okay
I mean imagine the others or other
surrogates are drawn from their type
distribution and I look at the outcome
that this procedure gives them and this
is going to be my outcome and then I
charge you with a payment that makes
that outcome truth I haven't yet said
how to pick the famous I haven't yet
said what kind of staring at I peek but
this is this is my plan so my plan is
draw any time from the time distribution
called M circuits somehow I saw in the
agent one of these circuits and use that
circuit in our case numbers so then if
you zoom out you have different people
for each one you run a surrogate
mechanism that transforms they reported
time to some surrogates I just plug
those surrogates into the allocation
algorithm for documentation problem just
one card and gives you some outcome and
you all put them out come and challenge
people
so now let's see what type of circuit
mechanical I need to be able to do such
an area
so as the reason why the get surrogates
because we know that discrete type space
how to do it so you cannot want to just
have like a discrete number of
surrogates no so this is obviously not
these kids get infinite number of
the part that discreet matters is when
you are assigning the HIV goods which
I'm going to go through but it's not
like I'm creating if you see many
surrogates like draw some number of
surrogates the number is put new mailing
number and here doesn't matter it's just
putting one over
okay so what is it so what do you expect
from a surrogate mechanism to be able to
do anything meaningful
so the previous reduction that you saw
has one property so for example you you
try to make the reduction and you try to
make the second mechanism truthful for
bond agent and now you expect that if
you make it useful for one agent days
that become truthful for everyone
basically this is going to be a pure
evil yet this is your plan then you need
to kind of decompose the problem into
agents and for that you need the
properties that I call it the type
distribution preservation so you want to
transform the type of region to some
circuits and supposed the way that you
transform the type ii is such that the
distribution of the circuit that you use
is going to be exactly the type of
submission of the agents then you use my
claim so if you I find a circuit to the
agent in a truthful very okay then from
the truth you get here I see in general
so let me explain is more so what do you
mean by assigning a signature agent so I
have my ID draws of the type call
themselves
now let's assume as one circuit let's
say s chilly so the agent has some time
SJ is drawn from the same distribution
you get this random variable that if the
agent plays seriously while others are
playing some Rando strategy from the
distribution how much value the agent
gets under truthful report so his play
said he has type T he's playing as J so
how much value desiccants okay so I
considered to be the value that the
agent gets in the circuit mechanism and
I I find a service to the agent in a
truthful way meaning that I assigned a
circuit and I charge him with some
payments such that the agent benefit by
misreporting okay I have to track this
users reservation meaning that in this
assignment they say with you peach has
exactly the same distribution as the
agent type then the problem decomposes
across it this is basically and now
you're worried that because you're so
originally you put each office eyes from
F so that part is fine but now you are
worried that because whatever algorithm
you are running may correlate TMSI such
that their joint distribution is
basically that means that I mean well so
independent for change
so whatever distribution cognitive a
product distribution but it may not be
the original decision just imagine the
four diamond times by firing the agent
to the maximum variance right so this
asymmetry the diffusion of the maximum
amount is different from the legislation
right so that's one concern the other
countries diverse fur just imagine you
know so you you're submitting these to
the allocation algorithm I'll get some
out then they expected Milford that the
agents rates from T is different on the
expected error that occurs from
submitting less but you have to pick a
specialist to our futures expectation
over this is over the other players so
Tommy's fix t minus is drawn from the
other types and you take it figures so
here in terms of therefore it is clear
what is the best way what is the best
thing to do is like assigning to the
gray that has a match
come on buddy this is the best thing to
do and you hope that if you are signed
to the guy with the maximum value then
the maximum value is close to so by
playing each circuit the circuit
impulses from distribution or outcomes
I mean expectation you get somebody now
the best surrogate is the bond across
the maximum value expectation so that's
the best thing you can apply to the edge
in terms of the buffer you may break the
truthfulness so you have to do this kind
of trade-off like we just figured out
I'll find you later on how to make it
truth and this is the pointer so but so
far it is clear that EPR sign is 32 days
and charged with some payment by the
assignments in this fool you get repeat
the surrogates completely uniform yet
and from there from the talk but the
physical we are finding based on the
type of the agent you know it's not
going to be taken care of so here here's
another pro now I'm proposing I'll show
you how to fix start to get the
reduction so but preserve a chain is
important rather than if I am thinking
about how it's going to fit into the
picture here is the question how to
match the optimal even that is hard
there is the obvious way of doing it
which is basic the following I actually
look at these edges and I find the one
that gets the maximum value I assign it
to the agent charging with zero this is
through school just a maximum Belfer but
what's the problem the problem is
calculating this expectation requires
doing an exponentially large rated Sun
because what is the support of the suit
is the other agents fight issues which
is exponentially so you can of Charlie
this expect
in front of multi and the problem gets
harder when you move from the discrete
time is phases to the continuous type a
stasis because even this is not a
photo-sharing this is now an uncountable
support points so the problem is how to
we cannot calculate expectation whatever
you could just like pick the best I find
to the agent
charging with zero money and even that
wouldn't be complete for the reduction
but I can show you how to but the part
is you know we just can sample from
these values basically the only thing
that can be something from the Friday's
aren't them so many choices so is the
following so you can sample these values
right so for example you can take some
sample from each one let's say you get
whatever is quick sample from each value
and then you get concentration but now
the problem is you won't be able to
match to the guy that has a maximum
value you match the person that is
almost likes how about you you're going
to have the member but you cannot make
that truth and I'm gonna answer I can go
through this question in the next slide
which is basically how to solve this
problem maybe if you haven't followed
the previous I just like stay with me
forever because this is just a separate
mechanism is that question and I'm gonna
show you the complete construction this
is basic the heart of the reduction and
then I show you how to use these hearts
as a building block for the rest of the
so here is the problem yeah I have an
agent let us say agents for each age it
will get some value and then the your
objective is assigning the one that has
the maximum expectation but you are not
allowed to charge expectation we can
just sample from these edges and you
wanna do this assignment you're through
school they basically coming up with a
way of charging these different outcomes
together with civilization okay good
so here are notation I'm using agent
reports on type s and then my McKenzie
is picking a distributor will be
surrogates you know that by Q and then I
charge him with some payments this is my
surrogate McHale and I'm looking at
incentive compatible avocation and
payment which is the case that there's
it doesn't is not better engulfed by
misreporting
equality is the best strategy and then I
expect near optimal welfare the
efficient of the value you get which is
the summation of Q J VJ should be know
as followed on opt minus epsilon opt if
the max flow of the eyes so the first
question that one can ask is the
following one type of allocations or
truth this is the classic question
because of design so you have like a
mouse poop they were not like a fine one
of Santa mr. what kind of pricey
distributions or a adult here at least
we know one you have to be sure and on
f5 maximizers or let's say regularly for
max - so what's the regular max loser so
wait for Maximizer is basically acute at
night so you're watching TV jvj
I think it's going to be points fans on
their arm but this is not the only class
of allocation rules that are implemented
by some payments meaning that you can be
untruthful basically if you add any
regular inner term or the function of
distribution that can make this
allocation algorithm choose and there is
a result boy Moshe and Bobby that shows
as long as these allocation is enough
for Maximizer is like a regular max
winter day of coming up with the
payments but the main question here is
the following
can you basically implement a regular is
very for Maximizer without calculating
the expectations on by only son this is
the type of thing I'm looking ok so I
don't think it's a great every Maxim I
do that I need me optimize so here's the
problem that I have
first I have to come up with a choice
for my regular razor for the bathroom at
Pfizer and then I have to show you why
that choice is bounded therefore you
don't get far from your optimality and
then the third lesson is showing how to
influence now I go to I switch to a
different machinery which is gonna be
the main body I'm using I can't go any
faster
and I'm gonna explain that and then
we'll be back to democratic Wesley so
what is Bernoulli factoring problems
which is in a sense very similar to what
you're trying to solve
so the permittivity problem is a foreign
firm really want to generate a new
random coin from some old coins that is
given to you or in the simplest case
suppose you have access to some random
coin that has some bias P P is unknown
but you can toss the coin as any time
that you want if you can sample from the
car now the question is can you simulate
a new random corn that has a bias F of P
for some known function f without
knowing P by oh Lisa this is the
question that the benefactor is trying
to solve and let me give you some
example some monomials are easy for
example F of P equal to P to the power 4
how do you do that
just flip your coin for number of times
in general if you look at probability
generating function of a discrete random
variable over real number or numbers is
equal to I naught whatever of this for
now I claim these functions are also
easy to implement by using Perona
factory just draw one sample from apps
and city people coin X number of times
if all the coin flips we're heads are
also head otherwise I want to say why
this gives you the probability function
because if you condition on X then this
is the property that you have a head if
they see P to the power X now the
unconditional bond is expected
which is the project approach good know
I generate this problem
I quite multi-phase actually the multi
very very factor you have a couple of
coins given to you with unknown biases
but you can sample from them and now you
have a multivariate function of the
samples are you going to simulate the
same coin for example one can think of
linear multivariable Factory
that's a nice thing to call if you have
a coin which people buy us pizza pies
even a new coin that has biased p1 plus
p2 suppose you know that p1 and p2 are
this is your half something this example
and this is also known and it can I show
you how but this is a recent paper
signed off by Cooper that shows this
combination these are basic building
blocks I'm using my construction and
then this is the most important one
it's the combinatorial generalization of
the Bernoulli facts a problem now rather
than stimulating in coin I have an a
peak a random edge so I have let's say
four coins it's done by a certain I have
and suppose people through p4 they saw
too far waiting in their life vector in
simplex over the coins now the question
is can you pick edge number two with a
probability that is equal to p2 if you
can you pick a random edge by such that
the person that got random edge is equal
to the Viceroy is our CPI okay this is
this is an important building large if
you think you know this is not as hard
to come up with the construction I'm
going to spoil the construction I don't
have time so here is the construction
pick one of the edges going from yes
Rondo feed it the corresponding cone in
it was tails continuing those help fix a
coin and each race so once you as you
can see the way that I'm picking one of
the edges is for portion of a sperm is
he at the end I'm coming up with a
distribution over the edge so that
the positive peak HIV exactly got you
but then you're safe like a geometric
random variable V times R equal to
summation P R divided by M right at each
time the success happens because side by
n n is the number of coins the iPhone
the pro tempore portion Sofia and then
you get the summation this construction
if you rise when they are rottenness
implants you call the distribution but
the approach that you picked alpha is
proportional to play and she's making
client / / okay I call this varies then
this should be no problem exponential I
will be soon seeing why this is very
important so a furniture per room this
is the funny you want to pick the coin
arm with a probability that it's
proportional to e to the P i okay
this is clear now voyage finish already
fathers let's go back to a mechanism is
a question recap we were looking for two
things
first of all we need to allocate one of
the surrogates to the regions so I start
my allocation is near optimal and second
I need the data given to be a regular
inner fat Maximizer because there was
this theorem but said if you have
regulator of a Maximizer there is a way
of making it truthful through something
that's okay I suppose you know how to
solve this pressure better rates problem
how can you relate these two together
here is the way that you can do each
just think about the entropy regular is
welfare now have the welfare objective
and you add Delta times the entropy of
the distribution key now very
interesting me if you solve this convex
optimization then the solution is the
following the queue either
so now you know everything I think you
like the simplex okay then I didn't get
your comment about it doesn't matter
your eyes if we should answer you peek
of this which is going to be for I shall
be e to the power of Y divided by Delta
divided by some okay now so you have the
choice for delta remember the objective
here is not important because this is
not fitting these objectives what's
important is the welfare units so if the
contribution of these parties upper
bounded by epsilon then the maximization
of this optimization problem is going to
be within epsilon range of the and I
know entropy is bounded by log n for
even from distribution what if I was
saying Q prime is of course the long
it's either 0 or is it entropy for a
distribution over m
right because old Judaism for qq5 I
tried to make it boats
HOV started by good so how to do this
financial penalties we know how to do
the Beverly's now now think like what
bottle started you
now suppose somehow from each coin I can
make an exponential coming so my corner
is VI I can kind of do it per unit
factor e to e to the power VI
and so I have my coin so for each coin
and then you okay together
what's distribution has this probability
e to the power t minus 1 for some
distribution the Poisson distribution
has probability function and this is the
function which is okay so this is the
positive function of a possible results
are so all you need to do for this
parolee Factory is the following you
draw text from form a power to power
delta you flip your coin X number of
times if all the constants were heads
around
which functions which is basically
because it is a pension for lumiose you
can do it by just under eyes it doesn't
matter how big your functions you should
give you a function that view about to
zero bond is continuous I can do
good okay so but this is this is now
phenomenal maybe you have noticed fine
but if you think about the running time
of the Bernoulli race so what I said was
the running time is the expected of a
geometric random variable now that these
are exponential so this can be quite big
basically if you count the number of
samples for describe the expected value
of the positive on our Delta which is
affordable but there in the number of
samples you take in the Bernoulli race
is M over the duration of the prophecies
that they have which are e to the power
J minus 1 derivative and now if all of
these values actually match few of them
is far from one by a constant this is
great especially peach so the bad cheese
happens when all of these values are
small if this can be especially now the
question is suppose all of the values
are aslam what can you do so we do some
pre-processing it is coming from
interesting property of the exponential
distribution so if you make an
exponential distribution which is e to
the power of E is normalized then there
is a nice property if you shift all of
the values by some 10 to the D sucia
remains the same
ok but I'm not allowed to have a coin
and shift its bias you can't do such a
thing
but you can mix this with some other
coins that the L has been chosen in a
smart way that kind of pushes all the
and then do the explanation is essential
but here T so we create the coin that
has bias L and L is a random variable
whose expectation is such that cross max
VJ is greater than for myself so you can
think of L as a random Bible that is
filling the gap that you want and now
you mix this coin with the help of the
multivariate Bernoulli factory that we
have for the summation and then so if
you put all the pieces together when you
get a fast expansion bearaoke race that
has a running time which is point New
York in M number of the surrogates and
more works okay you can sample is time
it doesn't know you can take something
from you guys and look at the apricot
meaning and create a run arrival that is
high properties in the range that you
want and then use that new model both
alleys the distribution exactly the same
Sorrento
the first white zebra new leads a
there's not a thing about their original
problem right so these guys are random
variables that are values their numbers
between zero and one right maybe I
should have said at some point that I
assume that the values are between zero
and four
I assume you get a value around 2-0 News
at five yes so they're not coins they're
just like some numbers their expectation
are these numbers you want from beyond
using simple the value and then use
simple Bernoulli's our expectation in
there in the second part is doing is
basically creating it Bernoulli with the
same bias from a random variable that is
continuous so you have machines you have
on and from death you wanna create a
coin which is you know discrete thing
right
mmm that the point is equal to VI that's
easy just draw a uniform random
everything here on bond and compared
with your realization this is basically
the first part but you're right
I tried to trick you guys by assuming
that I have access to coins but yes
we don't have access to corn if you have
access to values around November's you
can sample from and there are believe
there are born you have to create : from
them with the same expectation if I just
copy that spit is your own is that very
important assumption because you know
the problem is kids right we have
additive so then you shooting for
additive bounds then you have to
normalize the values everybody doesn't
make sense or if you twice the value is
no safer or attitude yes I would be
interesting so if someone can't get a
multiplicative power for the general
problem I don't think it is possible but
we don't have an order
so he friends are not between zero and
one you will lose epsilon times the
maximum children but no construction
that we have allowed such a thing
because epsilon should become a constant
at the beginning otherwise you're gonna
break the truthfulness number but you
have a beginning okay so we solve this
equations for circuit problem but if you
remember there were like two issues the
first numbers distribution preservation
and the second one was the fact that you
know okay you are fighting to the best
or the best surrogate gets something in
expectation in terms of therefore
asteroid so this is what they called a
willful for preservation there are a
type description preservation okay and
then here is the way we do it we are
generating the max so the surrogates met
item design problem was our finding the
best circuit is implementing the max
functions through something now we are
generalizing things to a matching
problem so you are finally cannot
suppose they are finite
Matthew imagining by the same machine
let me go through this quickly I think
this is the right way of presenting is
because for understanding you have to
read the paper but here is roughly
speaking what we are doing so previously
we just had the agent and a service now
imagine you have IAD draw from the type
on bonfire call them read the cards and
I have circuits on the other side and
the object that I'm looking for right
now is a matching between the types to
services and actually look at that chain
to one matching K is some parameter in
the reduction the capacity of the
circuits are the right sides and then we
find some matching and then we see who
this guy is gets matched to and the
announcer this is the general reduction
and now here is the Tyrian that we are
using that actually if you can find a
maximum matching win for now for edges
you have expected values for the
expected graph if you can't find the
maximum matching and allocate a
surrogate to the guy is get smashed in
the maximum matching then the welfare
loss is preserved and then there is this
other interesting problems like actually
prove very easily which is that you get
distribution to innovations just use the
principle of deferred decisions these
guys are ILD drawers you piece some
matching here this is a perfect matching
and then this is just enough among them
right so you can do the following we can
basically draw all the types here on the
left side draw the circuit otherwise it
picks up matching and then say the agent
is actually one of these guys uniform
yet round then the science-related is
going to be one of these beautiful dress
random no matter was watching a picture
and because all of the order from the
same is sufficient then you get
description freezers this is like a easy
three and then for a good form all you
need to use that problem but I haven't
shown you how to do the maximum matching
using sample and then this is
essentially the same idea you look at
the maximum actual problem and you are
the entropy regular Izzard objective
function and then the solution is going
to
the exponential rate for all the left
hand side where pieces when their values
are shifted by the optimal orientation
problem and now you have to kind of use
the solution that we had for the single
circuit problem to do this optimal magic
or let's say DS of to a regular is
matching and kind of community service a
physical an online algorithm that look
through these verses on the left-hand
side and we try to learn the debugging
interactions with the left hand side in
a truthful bag and it's like you're
doing stochastic online matching reason
we use techniques that are for the
random permutation bar I see that's why
the skate because you're this bit to
budget ratio 1 minus epsilon
approximation always you got you guys so
we need 1 minus epsilon confusion so we
have to get the online buddies an
allocation would basically take a to our
matching when K is much larger and boy
otherwise if you so he basically right
stead of looking at both rearrange I
told you how to do a Maximizer right
using the parolee factor so my sweaters
are the building blocks of the greedy
algorithms and we knew that for the
maximum matching greedy equations cannot
be better than half right but for the
maximum K to Bonacci
when the left-hand side online site is
already rounded they can do 1 minus
epsilon kind of if you call them using
the dual parameters
you put the right replica the the real
one because if you have that way you
want to put a real replica we don't know
this replica is their true replica right
so you have to treat all your replica
truthfully how do you know what's you
know you have one replica then you have
one real guide you create a bunch of
crap I don't need to know who is that
guy I just treat all the replicas me
truthfully ratio you might need right
for what but approximation ratio you
might need to have to know who is the
right one right now so you mean for
finding it do all by Eva's right the end
of the day you care about who gets
matched with the real one you don't care
about the adults taking care of the
matching doesn't know that right but I
must like put it in a random position
and you put in the end is that like
replicas for other non through agents
and I put my agent randomly founder all
right so that's not the entire typer if
I look like a random draw great so so
we're on this view incentive compatible
online entropy regular is matching for
each agent transform the types to circus
and into the allocation and just once
yes you're on the net - Calder you need
to call that equation for the payment
also you have to call it twice for the
payments that you need to call this guy
three times and also you need to call
this guy every time you take a fountain
remember so what is the sample right
they say value function speaks Thai v6
and then you needed the shooter outcomes
that comes from taking a sample
but after having the you know type of
circuit transformational okay so the
summary is they showed you I don't have
time to go through that but the future
come I want to explain that half time is
there's like some cool problems
very quickly very quickly for you if you
don't like my cousin design this is the
perfect decipherment so what are the
barrier is it is basically you are the
ground set of elements you have access
to marginal sampling or kills are you
wanna pick on a computer the object
object here is like a base of the ball
uniform instrument such that your random
selection matches the marginal constant
if you're familiar it's you know and
show this happening buffering you say
like you want to find a maximum entropy
distribution that matches the marginal
conditions here is exactly the same
thing but the difference in entropy
somebody is here you have access to
marginal distributions so we saw the
proponent for Bonnie inform enjoyed now
the question is can you do the Kagan
form matrix can you do actually the
matching one show you do these four
subsets of the simplex that is having a
nonzero measure so the Moscow is
interesting so now it's definitely a
stochastic matrix rows off the bond
connoisseur perform for each edge you
have access to sampling Oracle now you
are appreciated matching
randomly but you think's happening from
the edges so the project at h pi j is in
the matching is equal to the number this
region on edge think about the number
just like expectations think of each
edge of the sampling oracle that you can
independently sample so you definitely
need to pick your matching in a
coordinated way
yes but again the marginals should be
equal to the marginal properties for
edges but not for the whole matching
yeah I need it doesn't matter whether
you're sampling is formula not just a
way of picking your matching using
sample that'll be interesting
every time I talk
