you see this my great pleasure to speak
here and I like to thank all the
organizers for their hard work
especially in cutting okay anyway so
today I want to tell everyone what is
our plan about a building Conor O'Neill
of rushing to and what's going on in the
quantum Conair lab in terms of building
one annular of course nothing can get it
done without a 114 and I have a great
pleasure to work with what was all the
researchers in Kona a lab as well as
uses in bubber especially I want to give
acknowledgement to all the hard workers
who directly working on the container
project particularly Chris Quintana and
the via coverage as well the Loretto
Shabani was here in the audience today
so here's a quick outline of my talk
after a quick introduction I want to
tell you towards the building the con
Anila working to a point Oh what we
understand so far and what is our
current hardware development and what is
our future plan towards building a
larger scale Conan Mueller
all right so in quantum AI lab in
Hardware group we're approaching two
approaches of focus the fundamental goal
is the ultimate goal is to build a
universal quantum computer with air
Corrections but to what their goal we
have two approaches one so-called
digital approach where we're trying to
explore the surface code architecture
and we use the x-man streamin technology
while Ming time we also explore the so
called analog approach where we're
trying to build a con annealer which we
use the so called Flatman qubit will
introduce you today we think this route
is a really attractive but route because
we think before we actually can reach a
universal quantum computer which you may
take sauce while a while we can actually
use this an analogue approach as a
testbed to test the devices as the order
on order 100 to 500 qubit and most
basically we wanted to build what we
call quantum yield of rushing 2.0 we're
hoping at all a hundred to a few hundred
qubit we can achieve a performance that
is good enough that
one class of computer all right but the
real question is what kind of con
annealer you wanted to build this is
actually is exactly the first question
when we first met our serious and we
when we plan to appeal to our con
annually so the answer for our series is
very simple first when you try to find a
pillow con annealer what you need to
understand is what are the essential
elements for con Anila there's a
kookiness those connectivity as well as
a control a a best con Anila what you
want for which we call ideal con Anila
of course is further along each axis far
away from origin as far as possible and
that's why they give you a long list
they will give us a long list which
includes almost everything high
coherence high connectivity strong
coupling non-stochastic a local many
many things as far as much as you can
think of however as a hardware engineer
we say hey this is a very challenging
because in reality we know that when you
try to build something in hardware we're
facing a lot of practical constraints so
the condom needle we're trying to build
we're nowhere near the ideal con
annealer in in theory however now the
cutting is where you want to locate this
quano newell aversion to in this axis
you want to have more coherence or more
control or more connectivity this is
really a hard question but the other
things you need to understand is the
tricky part is along this three axis
they are not like they're not orthogonal
charge at all there's correlations
between each axis and also different
access the fan element actually affect
the performance
differently so you had to be very
careful because the thing you are trying
to build you need to think about the
system optimization you cannot think
about just individual qubit you have to
think about you're trying to build
something that is suitable for the
building a whole conan-kun corner so
with that i'd like to see in order to
answer that question let's see what we
understand so far i guess all your here
knows quan annealing you can simply you
know simple languages think about
you initialize the system is somewhere
in the energy landscape and then you
involve your system hopefully by the end
of the annealing process you can find a
color band minimum and the power of the
kana Neela it is our common belief that
coming from over this evolution process
if you have a quantum tunneling can
happen and that is where the
computational resource coming from in
order to take advantage of quantum
tunneling so the problem with that is
really favorable for Quan annealing are
those problem with high and narrow
barriers as you already heard many times
in this conference so if you have a high
end table barriers this is where really
the quantum tunneling can outperform the
classical similar activity process so in
other words the optimizing problem that
is favorable for con annealing are those
problem with rugged landscape and with
many plain narrow barriers so to test
like that idea as you may heard
yesterday so we have designed this
so-called Wickstrom cluster problem so
we use a deal with meshing and we choose
to cast her out of the chimera graph in
their machine and we applied strong
field on wamp then and weaker field on
other and we turn the interaction
between the qubit there is a linear
process in order for the system to stay
at its ground state all thus being on
the Wigg cluster they have to flip all
at once in order to for the systems they
have the crunch day and what associated
with this flipping process if you look
at the energy landscape plot on the
right you can see the system actually
have to go from a false minimum tunnel
through a barrier in the middle and go
to the global minimum
it is this tunneling process we think we
can looking for we can found the
computational resource which is a
cooking which is a tunneling process in
this case and we have proof both
theoretically and expertly this process
can be well described by incoherent
inany and that this tunnel near a car be
given by this equation here so if you
expand the list like me and you should
not be scared cuz all you have to
remember is the sweep coefficient here
that will of strongly affect your talent
performance those are related to your
performance so if champey which we call
the reconfiguration Alan G and W online
way
tunneling and ink tada oh my coefficient
we will come back to that
so the first take-home message we got in
terms of how to build O'Conner Nino
explained today is coherence actually
matters
it will strongly affect your tunneling
performance and then once with one pair
of strong weak faster understood so we
go to a larger array of wickstrom
cluster which will cost from castle
network in this case now you can imagine
instead of one tunneling events you have
many many talent events this is the case
we think we can explore the real power
or Condor nearly as many of you already
know the result there's as one show here
on the left
so without it's actually pretty
encouraging the d-wave measuring here
actually good did a pretty good job
compared with similar kneeling as one if
you hear from blue line to the red line
do you wave machine really sure could
speed up in addition you can see a
skinning speed up if you look at the
performance as function on problem size
compared with quantum Monte Carlo which
is the screen I deal with meshing of
course we don't see the skinning speed
up anymore but we see a huge ten to the
eighth prefactor speed-up
so this is a great news however there's
something you need to be aware of is we
know exists other algorithms such as
cell be you can really solve this camera
like problem really more efficiently you
can solve that really quickly and that
can be helped that come out proven to
you in machine so what we know from this
experiment the message is first of all
con annealer works this is really
encouraging at least for certain problem
over certain algorithms however what we
really learn in order to beat other
organisms such as a B we really need to
increase the connectivity of your graph
in other words you really want to build
a graph that is much denser such as you
don't have us you don't have any chip
card in your graph so the second last
one thing is we really want to improve
the connectivity in our graph and
finally I wanted to tell you this
quantum parallel tempering
you have heard from Hartnell yesterday
so without going to too much technique
details
well I want to emphasis this we could
continent parallel temporary but however
it's actually a hybrid annealing process
we combine the classical parallel
tempering with quantum annealing we like
this offering very much because now
Conan alert does not do the whole job it
only do what is good at it's just
whenever you need tunneling it's good
for it so as you heard from Hardin
yesterday we're going to combine the
classical paranoid tempering you run
many copies at different temperatures
you update your system as well as a
local swap according to the metropolis
rule from time to time when you need
help from kana Neela you copy of
information from classical processors to
the condom chip and then you're cranking
up if a quantum fluctuation the axial
and then Clinton back down goes through
a Kaname Kuran hopefully goes through a
contouring process and then you look at
your system and whether or not you're a
ninja configure your system
configuration is better and then you
accept or reject our calling again
according to the Memphis rule in this
way you can combine both the classical
part with quantum part and they all do
its own job in the best product I can
however as a hardware engineer the
lesson I learned from this algorithm is
first of all in order to be able to
update your system quickly and
accurately you have to have a faster
individual readout of each of your qubit
and then you can look at the
configuration and then can do update
properly and second in order to have
information transfer from classical part
to the corner part you have to be able
to arbitrarily initialize your content
chip to different initial state so those
are all the lessons we have know so far
so let me tell you what is our current
development in terms of hardware so
first of all I want to introduce you the
flux Amon cubed which is a building
block of our column near of version 2.0
so it is a stop steel flux qubit as you
might be familiar with so we have a
squid at the bottom here and it's junk
it with a couple on waveguide as this
meander line so this is a equipment that
we built we think it's suitable for con
annealer because
let me show you some features first of
all some of you may be more familiar
with this convention of Street Junction
cubed as once you're here on the left so
if I put this convention of sweet
Junction cubed to our cubed and we skill
them properly you can see this is a much
smaller size compared with our cubed so
the biggest feature over a cubed is very
simple we have a very big cubit so what
we are building a cubit in this way the
reason is we think the number number one
priority in Puritan Quintanilla is
connectivity we really want to build
something such ad is really people
enable us to couple Nana Cuba together
so that's why we distribute our
inductances which is 10 100 peacockin
right over a very long distance which is
200 micron you can easily see this cubed
really just by your eyes so because of
that were distributing duck tens of long
distance we have a lot of room to
cupboard Cuba together we really believe
that you matter conductance is a
fundamental fundamental resource for you
to Cabo Cuba together so give you a idea
what that means is I want to give you a
quick preview above the coupler we just
built and it is being cooling down
literally like right now so of course we
have to verify this exponentially
eventually however if everything goes
correctly as with what we design well
without expecting this coupling between
that could be one could be two to be
order of one to three gigahertz and all
these coupling strengths actually given
by the coupler in the middle which only
occupy a cubic space about 10% so this
is a great news because now we have a
lot of space to Cabo other Cuba together
as well and I also want to emphasize the
design of a qubit is also like flat it's
also very flexible because you can
imagine instead of chunky at York
squared here with one coplanar with guy
you can shunt it multiple of them for
example I can show you two like to the
washer here on the bottom so the nice
thing for this if you shunt in multiple
then you don't lose anything in terms of
relevant energy scale they all stay the
same as a single sleepy couple and a
waveguide however now you just double
your space now you have basic twice's
space to copper other could be together
so this is nice feature we think so our
cubed in terms of control it's also very
friendly in control because it's so big
now you can really put individual
conscience for every qubit and then in
this case we have two of them you can
nicely pull them at the two end of the
qubit really far away from each other
and then we have dynamic control for
each of them at the nanosecond
resolution so to give you and also I
want after so we also put a macro joy
for well then at least right now for the
characterization of our qubit to give
you some idea the control the level we
can have is we did a simple week so and
very simple just single qubit annealing
we go from 0 to 1 in the X pieces and
then we go to 0 1 eventually in the Z
basis it goes through a multiple
processors and light control system so
nice thing for to have a nice culture is
now you can really opportunity choose
any possible one from initial state to
the final state and if you choose a path
that is good you can actually can finish
the whole process within 20 nano second
with high fidelity as I want you here on
the pot on the top so you can see if I
initial on my system either either 0 or
1 we have well separated signals and you
can see some arrow here actually those
airlock are coming from the state
initialization which have nothing to do
with annealing process dissolved so we
are pretty confident we can control the
annealing process in a rapid fashion
with good control no it's good fidelity
and finally I want to talk about
coherence so coheres in turns out it's
actually pretty tricky problem to solve
at least from the 10 years of experience
in our lab to build cycle hearing could
be like eczema or Jima
when there's one important mechanism
lost mechanism to affect fukube
coherence which is dielectric loss
that's why we built our cubed instead of
using lossing amylose dielectric we try
to build our qubit crystalline sapphire
substrate which give us high quality
capacitors in addition we try to get rid
of all the Bellatrix or for the
crossovers in this case we will place
everything with our bridges as one shoe
here and then we check our
qubit coherence performance with at an
aurochs
where is the number I show here on the
right and then if you compare the
numbers with current with d1 meshing
unfortunately I would say this is not a
fair comparison because this is the
number I can only found in the
publication I'm sure they have been
proved this thing substantially in the
current design so but if we take a short
contraries and we found out the only
coefficient which is a one-mile inter
here at the bottom we have substantial
improvement and also the reconfiguration
energy if jumpy will also sees an
improvement
however if we compare the line weights W
here we really don't see much difference
and in fact if you rescale everything
with persistent current this this
languages are actually worse than d-wave
machine so what's going on for those of
you here in the audience might be my
friend I was t1 t2 so we also measure t1
t2 at different frequencies so 41 we
measure from very from 1.5 micros and
all the way down to say 100 nano sargon
depend on the frequency and 42 we
measure only like 45 nano second this is
a nowhere near the most coherent cubed
we have ever peeled so far like eczema
what's the reason actually the actually
the reason is even though we get rid of
the at least we minimize the dialogical
loss now because the way build our
qubits so big to maximize the coupling
we actually have to pay the price of
increased flux noise this is the price
we have to pay in order to do system
system optimization to couple molecule
qubit together so in to understand the
nature of the flux noise we actually did
more careful measurement we measure the
flux noise at different temperatures and
we've actually met was able to measure
post of symmetry part and and it's
metropolitan noise as the one as a
result are shown here in the middle so
for the symmetric part or no noise at
different temperature you really done su
much difference however if you measure
the anti-symmetric part of noise you can
see actually it increases when you go to
low temperature and it roughly follows 1
over T relationship this is interesting
because that means the nature of our Fox
noise having to do with the parametric
spins
you'll see more details in the talk be
given by entering the afternoon of
course we're not happy with his
coherence performance we want to go even
even better so that's two approaches
we're thinking we can do in order to at
least reduce the effect of the flux
noise first approach is you can simply
reduce the sensitivity of your system to
the flux noise
unfortunately that sensitivity is a
persistent current itself and this
president Kuran is one number you
actually don't want to reduce because
this persistent current is also a
resource for you coupled to cuba
together the stronger the person column
will be the stronger your coupling will
be so we think this is another route we
cannot reduce instead as you'll hear by
all carburator Robert in the following
talk we really try to work hard on the
material search we try to remove the
fluctuating spins we're trying to see
where they are and how to remove it so
this is the route which you into to do
and we'll see whether or not we can do a
good job there so we'll all those
understood so let me go to the my final
section and to talk about what is
roughly a future plan about building the
cannula version 2.0 the nice thing to
have a big cubed is now you can really
have a good time to design a graph for
example for fill cubed I can give you a
simple example how to build a fully
connected Network as once you hear the
black line here so is this the loop with
a to cross you can think about the squid
and then one black line we played on one
qubit and then to build a network with
few qubit you can just simply lay down
Cuba next to each other and then you
bend the asipi W and crossing each other
so in this case you can really build a
network which all the qubit couple to
each other the nice thing for this
designs you can really because you have
so much space you can really separate
your control part from your coupling
part as well as read apart it's a really
modular design in addition we have big
Gilbert and small couplers you can
really put your controls individual
chromosome where because you have space
and then you can really place them
spaced out and then to minimize a
crosstalk and finally I want a mess as I
slice that because we have so much
inductors we really think we can't have
kick across Giga Hertz coupling even for
one qubit to couple to multiple others
of course we understand this
architecture is not scalable because you
will quickly run out of your space once
you reach your connectivity degree so
what is the graph we really think to
build this bring me to this side so the
goal of for us to build a connected
graph or condo Neela version 2.0 is
first of all it has to be possible in
other words the graph will be trying to
design has to be possible to building
hardware second it has to be practical
the graphic trying to build can be used
to solve practical problems and finally
this graph had to be dense enough
completely enough such a it's not easy
for the classic algorithm to solve our
series figure out basically four figures
are married to look at this graph you
want to have small diameters large
conductance natural waves of course you
are about spring cost transitions
however as a hardware engineer my job is
keep reminding them look we have cut
away constraints first of all you cubed
is a finite length you have just enough
space for you to cover cube it together
until you reach tolerance you cannot
handle for the crosstalk and second you
have finite inductance for yourself that
means you can only cut out one qubit to
multiple others there's a finite degree
you can cover to so with all those in
mind this is a graph we're proposing to
build for our continuity version 2.0 so
I show you three examples from small
size to medium-sized to large size so
here on each plot here each color line
here represent represent one qubit so
for small size graph as I introduced you
earlier you can really sink hard we can
we wanted to build our auto all
connection when we move to medium size
what we want to build is this so-called
winning like structure you can think
about you have cubed spread out both
vertically and horizontally and
sometimes you have those 90-degree
appended cubed acting as interconnect
when you go to large graph you still
want to keep this women like structure
however now you need to introduce this
low engine interaction somewhere in your
graph we call this neocortex because
some of you may recognize this is
actually the 2d
Graff or contacts and of course if you
talk to the stinkers ha expert hermit he
can tell you probably this is owning to
the arrangement that has a nonzero
transition temperature force pingas
transition and finally for the hardware
we have a parallel effort we're working
on bam bam technology we're trying to
build our cubit 2d planar geometry and
also we try to build our control wires
as well as with our resonator everything
else on the other and then what you
wanted to do is flip them together and -
sweetie integrations and we really think
this is the route we wanted to choose to
screw up to tens or even hundreds of
cubit to summarize I want to say the
intermediate go for us to build a
cannula version 2.0 is really to build
this weaving like structures for medium
sized cornelian of course we have to
understand at a basic level from single
qubit performance to smoke with a small
size devices but the fundamental go is
here it's a nice go because we hopefully
we can hardwire some instance or
instance the optimization problem into
this graph and hopefully we can
demonstrate this Kwan annealer can
outperform the best set solvers and if
we have this working and we can try to
analyze understand the scaling of the
performance of a device we really think
this is a nice go to hit if we can peel
such a continually because for following
reasons if this the nearer works or no
sorry if there's an anode doesn't work
we think this is the flattest I wrote to
to failure because you should not expect
this to work
if you try to other problems if you
think about just embedding overhead and
this is easy to communicate even for the
people outside the community however if
this Anila works we really think this
can act as a step stone all you have to
do is add a bunch of the function such
add it allows you to go to full from
programmable open annular
which is open up to a wider range of
optimization problem and in addition in
even in the presence of universal
quantum computer we're still sink con
Anila
can act as a more competitive choice
because you have less overhead in terms
batting with that and that's all I'd
like to thank everyone
thank you very much and perfect timing
we have time for questions
please so well do you have any estimate
how many couplings you can put on one
flux LAN qubit yes
so let me give you a quick estimate is
this so I said we can achieve this sides
are coupling we're happy with which 10%
so you can take the simpler take-home
message for this plug for this design is
you can report in at least of course
this is our first design we really
didn't push hard on this design so I
think we if we clean up some crosstalk
issue and also go to the pump on
technology we think we can couple more
we're really aiming something force at
least for this single arm design from 10
to 20 and 4 mm hopefully we can couple
more yeah hi thanks for a nice talk what
type of coupling happened tiny and can
you achieve and in particular can you do
non-stochastic
yeah I know yes so the coupling we have
been designed so far basically is easy
coupling unfortunately is not
non-stochastic we also look at xx xx
coupling it is possible unfortunately
there are high order terms so in other
word will never have xx coupling I
naturally have Z Z coupling which much
stronger strengths if we really want
have it you all you have to do is have
this decoupling in the presence and use
another couple to cancel out to the CC
coupling however as I said this is a
very expensive resource unless people
prove this is tremendously useful where
we do it otherwise we'll pick pushing
hard and ZZ coupling but another
question is if I give you a choice say I
can capo say 30 or 40 or copy to
cooperate together to you one of that
these in coupling or you want to spread
it out into 20 z see and 20 X ax which
one is one because we don't know which
one give us a better performance
I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry Oh both sigh
yeah sure no problem it's a couple of
natural gave the post line so first a
quick question could you explain why the
weaving is more efficient in space than
the all-to-all and second question I was
surprised that you didn't say anything
about integrating error correction so I
was wondering if you have any thoughts
about that ok let's go to weaving of
course waving is not as efficient as
Ottawa that's that's for sure the only
thing is when you go beyond certain
coupling degree when we copy this is for
medium styling in other words if you go
young the coupling degree you have to
patch qubit together in a way such a
it's possible for it to build that's why
we were building this way we have to
just slide our qubit horizontally and
vertically and such that I think the
biggest feature here for weaving is you
just want to avoid adding clasp to like
structures we cannot keep building this
auto or for many manicure because we're
gonna run out of the coupling degree
problem that's what we understand for
the architecture and for error
correction right now I have to say we
haven't start thinking about it because
now we just look at like small device so
far but when we have motive ice yes we
will start thinking about our attraction
by going to logical bit yes
one question here tonight yeah okay
regarding the weaving just follow up on
a question or Daniel so is the
connectivity what is the average
connectivity of every qubit increasing
with the number of qubits or not or is
it really one 2d in some sense I mean
well connecting that fixed degree it
okay so you're saying you're asking you
which
can we be very specific like what are
the parameter you are thinking about in
terms of diameter in your in your graph
a coupling degree if you have 100 cubed
for example every qubit is connected to
10 well if you have 200 how many qubits
every single qubit can be directly
connected with is it still fixed degree
the way you destroy America yes wait so
far yes it's fixed okay yeah and it is
fine at spin glass temperature proven
for this graph if we have enough like
low engine action we do believe it's
nonzero yeah so the aim of supremacy
over start solvers do you have any idea
of how many qubits you'll require for
this
that we're thinking we can achieve that
probably on the order of 100 ish roughly
we have to do a couple careful
calculation also independent the
cocaine's performance as well yeah
thanks question about the coupling have
you thought about the win a couple
qubits
I'm sorry have you thought about
galvanic only coupling the qubit cavanna
coupling is no difference than mutual
coupling it's just a coupling efficient
efficiency is higher however you are
facing a more serious problem in terms
of parasitic coupling and crosstalk so
we don't think that that's the way one
ought to choose right at least right now
thank you yeah
