the founder of poof test press as well
as the cofounders of waffle the workshop
on performance reliability so we would
like to welcome him at Google and given
us a talk on testings Thank You Sheldon
and you know I want to thank Google for
letting us be here they've been a
fantastic sponsor this week our host for
the Whopper conference workshop on
performance reliability over the course
of the week we had nearing 50 people
coming in to talk about more or less
advancements in the state of the art of
performance testing and whether or not
any of those advancements in the
state-of-the-art are actually making it
down to the state of the practice always
a fun conversation but so what we're
going to talk about today is a visual
application usage modeling and that
might sound super technical but for the
most part it's not so much going to be
super technical what we're going to do
is talk through some things and I
actually subtitled this organism this
presentation why use calculus when all
you need is crayons so sometimes the
point here is that sometimes us geeks
and I use that term endearingly I'm very
proud to be a geek by the way get caught
up so far in the details that we missed
some of the simple things so that's kind
of what we're going to talk about a
little bit of background so when we're
modeling the usage of an application
particularly when you're talking about
multi user applications we really see in
practice two different categories of
methods right a very rigorous method
mathematically intense they tend to take
a lot of time require empirical data can
be extremely accurate however when used
out in the field especially for websites
when you're on a whole
development and release cycle that
sometimes is short as weeks or days
hours you just don't have time to do
that and oh by the way the people who
are doing it don't have four semesters
of calculus to be able to do all the
analysis and oh by the way it's a brand
new application and we actually have no
earthly idea how anybody's going to use
it so instead what we end up doing all
too often is what I classify is overly
simplistic it's very quick little or no
math it's occasionally accurate and I
stress occasionally accurate generally
by accident and basically pretty much
ignores any empirical data you have
because what good's empirical data if
you're not going to do any math with it
so what we've noticed out in the field
is that there's very little in between
these two methods to help people in a
fast-moving environment in a non
academic environment to get some degree
of accuracy confidence in our usage
models that we're then going to use of
course we're testing for development to
figure out for example what areas of an
application are most critical right the
somebody comes up with a brilliant idea
on a bar napkin it's where most bar
napkins are in the shower right that's
where most good ideas come and we start
developing it but we don't really know
how people are going to use it every
application people build it seems to do
everything but when it comes time you
know to release and we don't have time
to build everything what do we leave out
if we don't know how people are going to
use it it's pretty much a shot in the
dark so like I said in practice the
empirical data is uncommon unless you're
building a second generation of an
application the complex math skills are
rare and even the people who have them
went into software be it developers or
testers or administrators managers
probably because they didn't
to become mathematicians or
statisticians we often don't have the
luxury of time and on and on one of the
biggest problems we found and I'll
demonstrate this is as you talk about
application usage you know it starts
with an idea and then somebody decides
if they can market it so the marketers
have an idea of what it's going to look
like and then they hand it to an
architect who has an idea of what it's
going to look like and then our business
analysts interviewer users on how
they're going to use it and our testers
draw use case specifications and our
developers draw state-transition models
and our architects drawing network
diagrams and but you can't hand a UML
state transition model to an end user to
my mom my mom knows that I pick on or a
little bit she's not a she sees
computers is more of a necessary evil
that's been very nice to her son they're
much of anything else but they're not
going to understand that and when you
ask a user what they do and they give
you you know kind of their thoughts and
then you hand that to a developer they
say how does that relate to anything how
does that map to my classes or my
objects so that communication across the
team is part of what's challenging now
there are a lot of folks who have done
some amazing amazing research on
modeling applications dr. Connie Smith I
don't know if anybody's hurt anybody
heard of County Smith yes I am convinced
she can model absolutely anything down
to the clock cycle it's unbelievable
however it's not particularly easy and
it's speculative it makes assumptions if
you don't actually build out the
application to match the model the
models are meaningless so even Connie
Smith will tell you you have to validate
the model with real usage and real
testing of some sort to make sure that
you really did put it on a dual
processor machine instead of a single
processor machine or
they're things that could completely
mess up her models I'm standing at
Google I would hope that at least some
of you have heard of Alberto Savoia most
of my talks people haven't Alberto
obviously was an executive at Google
before that he CTO of keynote and voila
jerk and back in 2000 2001 published a
series of articles and thoughts that
have become really the foundation for
today's performance testers he was ahead
of his time there are no tools to
implement his idea is we finally have
some tools but savoia says basically get
empirical data if it's never been in the
field do a beta rollout get empirical
data well if you're Alberto fit savoia
you can tell your clients or your boss
see Apple boss to do that if you're
anybody else that's harder than it may
seem Daniel man asked is a professor at
George Mason and very mathematical
modeling mostly for capacity planning
again fantastically accurate I've
managed to read his books even after
four semesters of calculus I don't
understand all of his algorithms which
makes their field application very
challenging JD Meyer works for Microsoft
he wrote a book improving dotnet
application performance and scalability
it is probably the best blend of these
things but he still relies on empirical
data and betas and he doesn't use
pictures so all of these methods require
empirical data two of them require
advanced mathematics and statistics and
none of them are intuitive to a business
analyst or a non-technical stakeholder
or a user so none of these are models
that we can go show to the whole team to
gather input in community so with the
rigorous models I fall back on a quote
for my father was an industrial arts
teacher became a middle school guidance
slur that only happens in New Jersey
folks what sense does it make to measure
with a laser mark with chalk and cut
with an axe so how accurately do we have
to apply models when we don't know how
the users are going to use it anyway the
models might be perfect but they might
be modeling something completely
unrealistic compared to how users are
going to actually apply our systems so
basically the background summary is this
the rigorous approaches are beautiful
but often impractical how much value are
these models if we can't communicate
with them if the only person who can use
them as the person who made the model we
lose the value of communication across
our team and why spend the time to make
a complex model if nobody's going to use
it so what a experts say about modeling
most people have heard this quote before
all models are wrong but some models are
useful a model is a picture it's a
simplification to help people understand
conceptualize and communicate about
something so George box who's not a
software guy it's an industrial column
an industrial statistician his systems
guy and as he built models of systems
like auto plants and whatnot this is
this is what he realized that many of
the models were so incredibly complex
they didn't actually simplify the system
but they made it more complex and harder
to understand so if your models not
useful don't bother and tufte yes sir
zaid a particular kind variance than
trying
in in much of his work the models of
he's doing you know they're very factory
right so it's that the one that I'm most
familiar with is one that he did at an
auto manufacturer plan and the variance
he's talking about is more human
variance right so the machines move the
parts you have the parts all those
things but humans do things humans tend
to do things on normal distribution
curves right statistically right but as
you start trying to figure out how much
time right is that does the car frame
need to sit in front of the person to
make the well right you need to figure
out you know whether it's using some
chai square best of fit method or
observation order you need to figure out
how long to sit there so that you get
the weld but you're not holding
everybody up right so it's those kinds
of variances that he focused on
mathematically mm-hmm is anybody
familiar with that Tufte fantastic i
love when people are familiar with him
ed tufty gives a presentation about
graphical presentation of data that is
probably a single day that most
influence my entire career I walked in
reluctantly I guess not reluctantly
arrogantly what is this guy going to
teach me about making graphs in excel
right but you know it's better than
sitting in the office that was my
attitude about 20 minutes in I was on
the edge of my seat and it's all about
the fact that we can process we as human
beings can process pictures and data
points visually orders of magnitude
faster than we can process words or
tables of data or spreadsheets so if you
can put data in a format that people can
just process with their eyes with a
minimum of explanation then we're going
to be able to do math in our head that
we could never do on pencil and paper my
son is almost seven years old
almost 7 years old he's a fantastic
little baseball player I'm very proud of
him but when you think about hitting a
baseball I've read a statistic that by
random chance if you swing a bat if you
know the ball is going to be a strike if
you're given the ball is going to be a
strike and you randomly swing the bat
it's a one-in-a-billion chance that you
can hit that baseball my boys seven
years old he hits the ball more times
any dozen statistically man I want to
take him out and buy a lottery ticket
right there's no way my son can do you
know parabolic math on a baseball but my
son can hit that ball and it's because
our brains can intuitively do that kind
of math and it's visual it's all visual
so tough tea helps teach people helps
them think about presentation of data to
make it intuitive so we can process it
mentally and of course savoia who I look
up to greatly one of my favorite quotes
of his that I used constantly and of
course we're talking about load but it's
still an application usage model right
if it's not realistic what kind of
useful conclusions can you draw on if
you can't draw conclusions you're
wasting your time and your money so
we've got to find this balance is what
it boils down to between these rigorous
methods and the random chance it seems
to be going on in the field so basically
what the experts are telling us about
models are they need to be useful a good
picture as opposed to a misleading
picture is it worth probably a whole lot
more than a thousand words but you know
that's the cliche right and inaccurate
models leads to wasted time and worse
poor decisions and that's the number one
thing as a performance tester
specifically that I see regularly we
test based on some model we get results
based on some model we make decisions
based on some model and then it goes
into production
and the results from the model have no
relationship to reality so what did we
spend all our time doing so here this is
uh this is kind of a telling part for me
what kind of models are we used to
seeing especially when talking about
multi user applications right and web of
course is the paradigm of that there's a
typical log file there's all your usage
data but you know what if I sit this in
front of almost anybody that you it's
not used to reading log files or who's
not a developer if I put this in front
of a non-technical stakeholder or
business analyst my mom this is not
useful and I'm not sure it's technically
a model it's really a list but you know
if we apply parsing and sorting and math
to it we can get a model from it it
might look something anybody seen that
before come on you guys work here
actually I love Google Analytics it's
fantastic for me I know a little
something about about the web I know a
little something about how people move
on my website but once again if I showed
this to an analyst the first thing I saw
and I know it's a little small but it's
fantastic piece of data and this is just
a snapshot I took the other night the
top in the top ten klicks from my home
page and to my home page are exactly the
same what does that mean does that mean
that everybody who goes to my home page
then clicks on my home page um so it's
good data and I know I can dig in and
get more data I'm not knocking this I've
really did it's fantastic but on a
single page it's not intuitive it
doesn't tell a whole story this is my
first the first time that I was the
performance lead on a project I came in
and I the first question I asked is what
does this application do
and and the test manager came in he says
well you've got the use case specs said
yeah yeah but what does it do so he came
down with 43 wearing binders full of use
case specs said here this is what it
does and since he wouldn't answer my
question directly I opened them all up I
ripped out the page with these pictures
on them and I started laying them out on
the floor trying to figure out a flow of
what what the application did 125 ripped
out sheets of paper later about all I
could figure out was there was a
homepage and people logged in and they
had some account information and then
there were some other stuff I didn't
even know what the stuff was there's a
lot of it I couldn't figure out a flow
just was not useful and putting the
pieces together for me to have a picture
of what happened as it turned out it was
an e-learning site it had courses it
kept statistics you could log in you
could log out you could save where you
were in your course and go back finish
the course take a little quiz yeah and
your managers could log then log in and
see which courses you've taken something
a little bit easier to say that then to
go through what was that 12 inches of
paper to not be able to figure it out so
stick figures and bubbles good for some
things I haven't found them extremely
useful and figuring out how people
actually use an application state
transition models I can look at this and
read this right this happens to be an
ATM an automatic teller machine but as I
looked at this I realized third it tells
how the application can be used it
doesn't talk about how it will be used
and I think that's one of the the
paradigm shifts when we talk about
application usage that some people need
to shift from not how can it be used but
how will it be used
and then of course we get paragraphs
like this from some of our stakeholders
you can read it a couple of
substitutions to protect the innocent or
guilty as the case may be but you know
what i can read that four or five times
i still can't draw a picture or make a
prototype or really know what people are
going to do and then and then this is an
excerpt from one of them in asks papers
and i'm sure i've got some folks here
that are mathematically far superior to
me but I start looking at that and start
thinking about my goodness if this is
what I've got to do on a client to build
a model I'm done because there's no way
that I can communicate you know c0 over
t2 a non-technical stakeholder or an end
user who's converting from a green
screen to the web we've got to simplify
some of these things so what it boils
down to is we've got a lot of models
we've got a lot of standards you've got
a lot of methods at our disposal but
they do not help cross team
communication we're not going to send
all our whole team to five different
modeling courses so we can learn one
another's models really need something
intuitive and I don't know if this ever
happens in your groups but I've seen it
as a consultant right you get called
them when there's a problem so sometimes
you forget that there's really good
shops out there but I've seen more
arguments over whether or not a
particular symbol is being used within
the you know 2.7 version of the
standards then I've seen talk about what
in the world are supposed to be modeling
we're supposed to help one another
understand not slaughter one another for
reading a book that's
a version behind so maybe maybe there's
something a little bit so why it's a
horrible picture but it's real this is a
recreation of real I admit but in 2001 I
was sitting in my office that was I
don't know 40 feet long and 20 feet deep
wrapped with white boards and I'd spent
weeks and weeks working with a client
trying to figure out how the application
is going to be we had a prototype we
could click through it together and we
couldn't agree on how the application
would be used we kept debating and it
was it was intense and finally I got
very frustrated I walked up to the
whiteboard and grad markers and I
started drawing and i drew something
very similar to this probably not quite
as neat because i wanted you guys have
some hope of being able to read it and
he looked at it and he said yeah and he
grabbed another marker and he started
drawing and my office but he grabbed
another marker and he started drawing
now this same went across like 12 feet
of whiteboard and after a while we got
something that looked more like this and
so we've got activities we got what do
people do oh they go to the homepage
some people log in some people register
after they register they're going to go
and do some account maintenance this was
a financial planning application and
periodically throughout the process
they're going to run out of time or get
bored or not have the information they
need to finish and they're going to save
and exit and you know some people are
just going to go to the FAQ and some of
them are going to log into someone who
mark right there is no standard to this
there is no there was no book behind it
there was no training we used markers we
used white boards to talk to one another
and then we started adding these
percentages so what have we really done
does anybody recognize this is something
they've used before it's a Markov chain
it's a Markov chain of frequencies and
probabilities but I promise you that if
I'd have stood up in front of that man
and said let's make a Markov chain this
would not have helped our cause so it's
nothing new but it's simple this thing
ended up picking up a name that was
meant as a joke a long time ago you see
ml user community modeling language
there are nine basic symbols whatever
i'm not here to sell you anything or
sell you on my model but the point is
five years ago a whiteboard accident
literally my frustration and my
inability to communicate effectively
with my client that led me up to the
whiteboard to start drawing lines
instead of verbalizing led to a thing
that now people all over are writing
about and using and asking me to write
books about and frankly i think writing
a book about it would destroy the whole
thing but what they do is they draw
these pictures draw them by hand on
paper and they make photocopies of them
and hand them to the whole team and say
what do you think and everybody on the
team from an end-user to an executive VP
to a marketing guy to a network
technician takes notes on it and says no
no no that doesn't happen eighty percent
of the time that work that happens you
know forty-three percent of the timing
oh no I know the president really wants
everybody to go here nobody really does
that maybe happens two percent of the
time it hey what about that other
activity that we programmed in last
month and they draw their lines and you
collect them up and over the course of
45 minutes you have real data and when
you don't have empirical data to extract
from now you have a place to start now
at least I know oh the marketing people
think this activity is going to be heavy
the users think they're going to do this
the analysts think they're going to do
that and maybe I can't decide what's
right maybe I just use all three
models but now I'm down to three and oh
my goodness if I do have some empirical
data now I can hold what people think is
going on next to empirical beta and I
can say there's a discrepancy I wonder
why that is are we not selling our
application correctly are we not
modeling it correctly are we not logging
it correctly or any number of other
possibilities but simple and crayons is
the kick here right usually it's pens
and markers and as you can see I've
gotten in the habit now of instead of
spending the two hours immediately after
a meeting when I'm ready to go do
something copying it into some format
that's acceptable to whoever the client
may be aware of the stakeholders I just
take a picture and I and I do something
like this with it later it's a little
small to see obviously and I don't know
exactly how if you guys can put slides
with the videos or whatever but they'll
be available that color it's got
percentages you can print it out you can
draw lines on it you can x things out I
sit this in front of people models like
this in front of people all the time for
applications are familiar with with zero
explanation with zero training and they
look at it for a few minutes and they
say yeah that makes sense but what about
this and we've started the communication
and that I think is the key to the model
it's useful to a wide variety of people
people are reading the model and I'm
hesitating is flip the slide so what's
the point when it comes to models when
it comes to modeling users sometimes
simple gets us further faster than
complex rigorous models being able to
use the same model across the entire
team has
value it might not be the only model you
use it might not have all of the
information you need but if it enables
communication you know sometimes I've
seen developers take these activity
models user activity models and start
drawing little arrows with notes about
what classes relate to those activities
I've seen business users right little
arrows about which division does that
activity I've never seen anybody do that
with a state transition model I've never
seen anybody do that with a log file the
feedback loop is good like I said
sometimes I think that a lack of
standards is more enabling and rigid
standards I'm not against standard
sometimes standards are very important
but when we're doing something creative
when we're drawing pictures when we're
communicating is it more important to
communicate effectively or to achieve
some standard that somebody we've never
met says is the right way to do
something and whiteboards obviously
Google understands i have not been in a
single room at Google without a
whiteboard Google understands
whiteboards are easier to use for
multi-user collaboration than an
overhead projector I think we should use
that power and of course we could always
use another excuse to use crayons so
I've given I've given some links here so
they and their in a horrible I must have
clicked them a color but they're there
to some of the people that I referenced
and at the end is my contact information
and I'd like
I'd like to hear your thoughts or take
your questions there are any there
aren't I can go back three or four
slides and start digging into the
calculus and make sure to confuse you
you guys have if you don't know him you
guys have a fantastic modeler who's
known in the testing community around
the world that's Harry Robinson and I
spent a lot of time with him this week
talking about this and you know there's
power there's power in simple models
that people understand intuitively and
if there's one thing that I can infect
people with its sometimes we need to put
away the calculators and just use
pictures I think it's valuable pure cut
you saw something similar in pure
coverage
I think it has the percentages to it
also makes the lines thicker with
we're going to change
you're there are pure coverage is one of
their our code coverage tools that do
something very similar may be identical
and I wish I wish that there was some
tool it then mapped that something that
a user would understand because a user
doesn't understand classes and objects
and methods and so there's got to be
some way to map it I haven't seen a tool
that does that strike that data from
when you get it sure where every page
you got you where the referring page was
create all those things
and to track the user with a cookie or
where
we are talking and when I say we there
are several people talking to me about
building a tool to automatically extract
this information there are people
talking to me about building a tool to
use this for test design to
automatically do test design and I want
there to be a tool I want it to be easy
I don't want it to be complex nobody's
written one yet and I played around with
it a little decided that either I didn't
have the time and energy or the
programming skill to do it the way that
I envisioned it in my head so sometimes
it's kind of like when as a programmer
right you occasionally get promoted and
become the project manager of the same
thing that you use to code right that's
a hard thing to do because you have this
ownership of the code you wrote oh you
can't change my code change everybody
else's code to fix it so i have a
feeling that's part of my problem is
when I can't get the tool to do it quite
right I get very defensive with myself
it's a very bizarre internal argument
but I I hey I'll tell you what this is
all you know the nine symbols and the
article and all the presentations I've
ever done on this are creative common
licenses somebody wants to build a tool
more power to them just reference
reference back to you know I'm the guy
who drew pictures on the whiteboard
instead of yelling at his client of to
have one
well okay so why are the percentage is
necessary if all I'm doing is figuring
out what an application can do probably
not necessary if I'm trying to either
evaluate risk importance if I'm trying
to predict volume frequency then it
becomes very important like I said I'm a
performance tester I'm all about
figuring out how people use the
application kind of in 3d if you can
visualize it that way and if I have a
model that says oh everybody's just
going to go hit the FAQ and I can get
500,000 people doing that over the
course of a minute some stakeholders
going to take that information say oh we
can handle 500,000 concurrent users
we're done but as soon as the first
person goes to login you know maybe it
takes a minute and a half now to get a
page so the distribution of activities
changes the performance profile
dramatically so one of Harry's arguments
actually was I'll just test a lot of
them and he's right except a performance
test run to collect the data it takes an
hour or two to run and then it might
take a day or two to analyze that data
and figure out what it means how many
how many days day or two day cycles do
we have we need need to narrow it down
to a degree so that's what the
frequencies that's the importance of the
frequencies is for risk and load mostly
well I'm not running off quickly now
that I'm done speaking imma like to eat
so I'm happy to continue taking
questions I have no idea how long that
was I don't see a clock anywhere but
