um welcome I just wanted to introduce
our our speaker tonight first I wanted
to let you know that I'm a scrum master
here for the dart rich media and video
teams and I have been for a little over
two years art my name is Amy deca woods
our teams have really benefited from the
scrum process it's helped us to focus on
team collaboration and increase
productivity so we're very excited to be
able to host dr. Jeff Sutherland for
this talk today not sure how many people
are using pure scrum or maybe just
applying some of the practices that
scrum teaches us but I have a feeling
that many people in this room are have
distributed teams and are probably very
familiar with the challenges that those
present to us so we're very very much
looking forward and I think it'll
probably be very meaningful to everybody
here to hear some of the insights and
some of the suggestions from dr.
Sutherland about how we can overcome
some of these challenges and develop our
teams when we have people in multiple
locations so without further delay I'd
like to introduce our speaker for the
evening dr. Jeff Sutherland well we're
here tonight to talk about pretty good
strong you know there's a lot of scrum
out there and some of it is great scrum
and some of it is okay scrum some of
it's pretty good scrum and Scout some of
it is what we call scrum but
unfortunately there's a lot of scrum bot
out there you know we're doing scrum but
we left out this because you know it's
like we're doing object-oriented
programming but you know inheritance was
hard for us so we just left that out and
you know all these other things that
might be difficult in objects we'll just
take our see procedures and compile them
in the in the C++ compiler will call
that objects
okay unfortunately when you like in the
steelbook cartoon recently I was working
with a large consultancy in the
Microsoft area and out in Redmond and
they had visited a company who said they
were doing STP and they said well are
you doing pair programming no we're not
doing that what
well how about continuous integration no
we're not doing that well they went to
every XP practice process or engineering
practice and they said well what are you
doing they said well we're doing no
documentation that's agile well the
thing why that's important is that it
has a significant impact on the ability
to deliver high quality software so one
of the things that they came up with at
Nokia I'm going to spend some time
talking about that tonight pass vote who
is the Nokia trainer scrum trainer in
Finland for many years trained hundreds
of scrum teams came up with this little
test to see you know I need a checklist
are these people that's in Nokia doing
scrum or are they just doing scrum bot
and I'm gonna talk later about exactly
what the Nokia test is but recently one
of the guys did a survey on who's doing
the Nokia tests and there are eight
questions in the test and he found that
74% of the teams were not doing all
eight so he concluded that 74% of the
scrum teams in the world I asked rhumba
so we're gonna find out maybe tonight
how many people in here are doing scrum
but how many people are doing scrum in
here a lot of you okay so let's talk
about that a little bit now here's why
scrum but is important if you do an
excellent strum you might be pumping up
your revenue 400% every year if you're
doing good scrum maybe it's only going
up three hundred percent if you're doing
pretty good scrum it's going up 160 to
200 percent I gave a couple of examples
even Google fits in that category but if
you're doing scrum but
you know it's approving but it's not
worth writing home about okay so how
many people want to move beyond scrum
button here okay most of you who are
doing scrum so we're going to talk about
what people are doing to move beyond
that now one of the things that's
happened in in recent years I do a lot
of work with Jim Copeland Jim Copeland
was at Bell Labs he were in the pasture
project he wrote hundreds of case
studies on best projects he has a very
interesting book on agile organizational
patterns we're starting to do research
on that on scrum teams in Europe and you
know he complains that you know a lot of
these data points that we look at are
really applications that maybe the
quality wasn't so good maybe they failed
it's only one data point it's not really
research and I had to give this talk in
Sweden and he was gonna be there
actually he was the keynote so I had to
answer all those questions in the talk
so I'm gonna go through some of the
thinking behind some of the numbers that
I'm always talking about it's
interesting that extreme data points
often unsustainable for example the ball
and Quattro Pro project delivered a
thousand lines of C++ code per developer
per week for three years running so they
delivered millions of lines of code at a
rate that's never been equalled at least
nobody's ever documented that they can
equal it and compare that to the Windows
Vista team that that delivered a
thousand lines of C++ code per developer
per year so the eight people that
Borland delivered as much as 400 Windows
developers that's a pretty big
difference so we're talking about
differences that are not little
differences they're like huge
differences or a magnitude differences
between teams now the boiling project it
failed Microsoft crushed them so is it
worth looking at if it's failed project
another interesting product project I'll
talk a little bit about was the Suzy
Dynamics project which was half in Saint
Petersburg Russia and half in the US and
Canada and this was the most highly
productive team ever documented
delivered a system over a million lines
of code and they did it at a rate that a
high-performing six person scrum team
co-located in one room delivers code so
at a rate almost an order of magnitude
greater than industry average for a
distributed team now that that project
had quality problems there was some
management problems they were it was
started by the Dining's company which
was acquired by Searcy dying's Searcy
dynamics had a competitive project
product they did deploy it into the
market but you know those a new
implementation the customer always wants
more features so they had problems there
plus this competitive project they
finally just killed the project so
another failed project another extreme
data point that failed so the question
is is that of any use to us looking at
an extreme data point that failed
another fascinating example is from
Motorola David Anderson who was at
Motorola them went to Microsoft has a
complete data set on the second most
productive team in the world that's ever
been documented he never wrote a case
study on it one of the problems was that
when they completed the project Motorola
decided the marketing guys decided that
they wouldn't even use the product they
bought a third party solution and in the
Sprint's that followed Motorola started
inserting bureaucracy on top of the team
that required all this extensive
reporting all this none agile stuff and
the best guys on the team bailed out so
here's a team that was an extreme data
point but died it was like crib death
you know it just went away
instantaneously because of you know they
didn't they didn't feed the baby they
just let it die in the crib so is that a
data point worth working yeah I have
complete data on that many Excel
spreadsheets thousands of data points
I'm wondering you know should we write
up a case study
that I don't know it's really useful to
look at why some of these teams were
extremely helpful but the basic question
is can fail your help us okay and I
argue that it can that it takes a lot of
failures to produce something great and
in fact the whole operation of a company
like Toyota Honda is predicated on
failing as many times as possible as
fast as possible in order to rise to a
level of performance and capability
that's way beyond the norm it's kind of
like training for the Olympic team I
remember I was trained when I was at
West Point I was training under an
Olympic coax the our coach was the
Olympic coach the years I was there and
so I had the assistant coach where
Olympic team members so I was a parallel
car got parallel bars guy so I would
come in every afternoon for three hours
I get up in the parallel bars I do a
flip and the coach would say it's not
quite right get up and do it again and
for three years for three hours every
day even some weekends it was never
right and every once in a while just to
show me it was not right he would get up
and do a perfect one just to rub it in
okay good night but I tell you at the
end of those three years I could do it
better than most of the people that we
were competing with okay so it's that
constantly failing and retrying
and trying to reach for a higher level
that takes people places where no one
ever is gone before it's one of the
reasons that Toyota's winning like a
good example is you listen to the
chairman of the board at Toyota there's
an excellent article in the Harvard
Business Review in June last month
called the something like the
contradictions at Toyota that make it
work and they have a lot of quotes from
Chairman's of the board they're like no
change is bad
it's all good we don't care if it makes
things fail breaks things helps things
or whatever our company is built on
change as fast as possible and we just
select the ones that work and move them
forward and we reject the ones that fail
and move forward when you ask them well
how do we work they say you know do you
guys build a lot of requirements for a
car and the chairman of the board would
say are you kidding we know they don't
know what the requirements are and even
if they did when they looked at what
they tried to build they might not be
building what is needed so what we want
to see is a working prototype of a car
as fast as possible like maybe 90 days
would be good and then when we look at
it we'll know whether we like it or not
and actually we know we won't like it
that's why I wanted to build it as fast
as possible so we can tell them all the
reasons it's broken and then give them
the opportunity to fix it because when
they fix it we'll tell them the next
time all the reasons it's broken again
we'll tell them to fix it again and
after we tell them to fix that thing
about 50 times it'll actually be pretty
good in fact it'll be a hell of a lot
better than any General Motors car
guaranteed okay that's just the way we
work at Toyota fail fast and fix it fast
and do that over and over and over and
over maybe that's kind of the way Google
works right maybe I don't know nobody's
talking what's that ship early ship will
offer this basic yeah of course you know
even Toyota screws up so they've dropped
the consumer reports whoops Consumer
Reports has downgraded some of their
cars now for quality problems so what do
you think that's going to do to Toyota
you think they're going to fail on the
market probably not probably they're
going to even try harder because now
they have this failure staring in the
face they can use that to leverage their
success so one of the interesting ways
to look at failures and how they can
help is during the last year as
so a venture capital group has asked me
to work with them openview venture
partners and I've even moved my company
into there they're a lab where they
support all their companies and so now
I'm a coach to all these 20 of their
portfolio companies it's growing rapidly
and so you know their goal is a venture
capitalist wants one really good company
you know one Google in nine failures is
that's a win for a venture capital
company and they think scrum might take
it to two and only eight failures that
means that their portfolio would be
twice any other venture capitalist
portfolio game that would be hugely
successful and so they've decided that
they're only going to invest in our
agile projects and they're only going to
invest in market leading practices so
they asked me you know what's the market
leader and in agile I said well it's
scrum and XP so they said fine we'll
only invest in scrum and XP and they
said well but we want to make sure
they're doing scrum and XP well how do
we tell that well one of the reasons one
of the way things we can do is look at
the Nokia test we can hold management
accountable we need to train the
management you know if the management
doesn't in distilled
they will never understand scrum so we
got 50 CEOs and CTOs in a room and we
started talking about this and we found
out that none of those guys understood
how Toyota worked and some of them have
NBA's from Harvard Business School I
said you know how did you guys get
through Harvard Business School without
understanding how Toyota works you know
because you guys need to know that
because you're not going to be able to
run your scrum team as well unless you
understand that because you have to do
things that are contradictory in order
to get more you have to work less that's
pretty hard for a manager to understand
okay so we started we gave them all the
Toyota way we had all the CEOs read the
Toyota way and the senior partner came
back to me he said these guys don't
understand the Toyota way I'm like they
went to Harvard Business School they
don't understand the Toyota way
what do they understand well they said
they'd understand toy you CHEO knows
Toyota Production system it's a short
book it's a simple book it's a really
clear book so we said fine we'll train
all the management from from the Tokyo
notebook and now you venture capitalist
who are on the board you're gonna hold
the managers accountable every board
meeting for some of the basic practices
at Toyota
like how many impediments did you remove
for the scrum teams it's the last board
meeting and I can tell you that really
helps a lot when the senior management's
being taken on the board meeting for
this is anybody have that that that
experience you have anybody taking your
management on at the board level on how
many pediments that you're moving at the
scrum I can tell you the scrums
accelerate a lot faster when that's
happening so it's really a lot of fun
I'd like to spend a little time talking
about how we invented scrum because it's
a different kind of thing it's not your
normal normal process that somebody
thought up we were working in a small
talk development environment building an
object oriented analysis and design tool
and we were going to ship it to our big
customers using our legacy products and
a big customer to us IBM had sold our
products all over the world to places
like Ford Motor Company I had a thousand
people at Ford Motor Company using our
legacy products and we needed a new
process for them and a small talk was
very different do we have any small
talkers here not very many very you know
it's not too many left anymore but you
know we thought small talk was the best
software development environment ever
built many of us who are in that world
still believe that and we're very
excited that small talk is coming back
and it's name is you know what its name
is Ruby and we love to see things like
in the in the Java user group saying is
Java dead a big article about how Ruby
on Rails is
adopting more and more uses but ruby was
developed by a small talk guy a
brilliant japanese guy that wanted the
purity the fun and the capability of
small talk in a modern language that
could be used for building internet
applications and so will be i call small
talks revenge it's coming back well the
guy that invented small talk was a guy
named Alan Kay and he was at Xerox PARC
Research Institute in Palo Alto in the
1980s and in about 1992 he was invited
to MIT to get an award for being one of
the inventors of the significant
languages there were 12 of those guys
there but Jon Stewart was there because
of C++ a bunch of other guys and this
was the first slide and Alan's
presentation he said you know here's
what we did at Xerox PARC in the 1980s
we invented the first personal
workstation the Xerox star we invented
the first Windows interface and the
first use of the mouse in that
environment
it's what Steve Jobs saw and then stole
for the Macintosh we invented the
Ethernet the first laser printer and the
first widely deployed object-oriented
language what was the first object
oriented language close it's in Norway
it's not far from your Trondheim group
where I've spent some time there Google
and Trondheim but it was developed out
of our Norwegian Research Institute
similar was the name of the language and
but small talk was the first language
that actually took off and would became
fairly widely used so I looked at that
slide and I thought you know Alan didn't
leave anything for the rest of us I mean
what does anybody using other than
what's on that on that slide maybe an
inkjet printer that was invented by a
friend of mine that lived down the
street from Xerox PARC he was a
consultant to hewlett-packard and he
created the first inkjet printer but
anyway the next slide actually kind of
got me more
more excited because Alan said here's
how we invented all his stuff he said
think of this as a steel plate with
grooves in it and some some people some
research labs maybe most research labs
get in a groove become highly
specialized and they make small
incremental improvements for the whole
life of the lab companies do that people
do that and this is a good thing
but we would never have invented any of
this stuff at Xerox PARC if we did that
now we looked at other labs they would
get in a groove and become highly
specialized and then they look over at
someone else in another groove and they
would say gee you know this stuff at the
in another business domain if we brought
it together with what we're doing we
could make even bigger leaps in
innovation but Alan said you know that
would not have done what we needed to do
at Xerox what we did at Xerox was look
at extreme data points data points that
were off the plate
impossible data points the data points
that scientists always throw away you
know I spent eleven years as a professor
to medical school and I had grants from
the National Cancer Institute to to do
all the analysis and data processing
probably's clinical trials and after the
EMU logic studies and so we work with
the clinicians for years and then they
they'd get all these data points and
draw a line through them we publish it
in the winglet of medicine we got a new
drug or better treatment the only thing
was there were certain data points that
were off the line in fact it was so far
off they were extreme data points so lab
guys would say oh our lab apparatus it
must have been broken that day that's a
bad data point we'll just throw that
data point away you know because it's a
confusing data point we can't explain
that we can't put that in the paper and
maybe there was another data point kind
of lower you know like that patient died
on that drug so we just but that patient
was they were a little different than
the other patients we'll just exclude
those from the study there's a lot of
that going on out there I can tell you
that okay what Alan said is that these
data points are the only data points
that are
worth spending any time looking at
because the edge of innovation is when
you become confused and you can't
explain what's going on and that's where
you should go it's right to that edge of
innovation the see only play the only
spot that it was worth spending ten
minutes at Xerox PARC so I said this is
interesting we need a new process for
these guys at Ford Motor Company let's
look at extreme data points and see what
it tells us well the first thing we did
was we reviewed 30 years of IBM systems
journals we said IBM must know what the
fastest way to develop software is
they've done a lot of research on this
and we found that the surgical team was
the best way at IBM to develop software
as anybody read the mythical man-month
few of you yeah there's still people
reading that it's still a classic as
good as the day was written Fred Brooks
who ran their IBM 3 operate at 360
operating system wrote it you had
hundreds of developers and he learns a
lot of painful lessons and in the middle
of that book there's a chapter on the
surgical team that's a team where one
brilliant person has all the
architecture all the design everything
in his or her head and that person
writes every single line of code it's
like the surgeon in the operating room
you know the surgeon is the only one
that cuts the patient
everybody else is passes the scalpel so
we looked at that and we said definitely
that is the performance we want but we
see a problem at forward with that
because we don't think they have any
surgeons and you know if one of these
guys get hit by a bus the project's over
so it's kind of a high risk way to build
software and and it doesn't scale very
well if you have to build millions of
lines of code I've had one of these
teams and a good surgeon can handle
50,000 lines of code
roughly that may be worth five hundred
thousand lines of code of anybody else's
but even so millions of lines needs more
than one surgeon so we said we need to
figure out a way to get sir
performance with a team so we began
researching all the computer science
literature talking everybody and we
found that the best new product
development teams were described in a
paper by Professor taki youichi who was
at the Harvard Business School in 1986
it was called the new new product
development game and he looked at best
teams all over the world and a couple of
them were in the united states at
hewlett-packard and and 3m but a lot of
them were in Japan particularly consumer
products and automobiles and the way
that those teams were described how they
were set up how they were motivated how
management treated them scrum was
modeled directly out of that paper we'll
talk a little bit about that later the
problem with that paper is that these
were in software teams so we looked
around for the best software project and
we found that in the Borland Quattro Pro
project that I mentioned previously and
Bell Labs had gone in there and done an
analysis of why that was such a
high-performing team and they found out
that it was all about the communication
patterns on the team they had a
cross-functional team that met every day
for at least an hour sometimes several
hours and that enabled them to deliver
this code at you know roughly 40 50
times the normal the norm in industry so
he said well Borland Quattro Pro shows
us how to get surgical performance
takeuchi so this tells us how to set up
the team let's see if we can do that and
in the very first team that we set up
they went into the hyper productive
state now I'm going to talk a lot about
this my definition of high productive is
that the team could deliver so much
software that the management the
Salesforce the marketing people and the
customers would say it's too much it's
like drinking from a firehose slow down
one of my goals with this was to change
the whole development environment
I spent as I said many years in a
medical school and I was hired away from
the Medical School by a big banking
organization who was rolling out banking
systems all over the United States they
had over 150 banks and they said you
know you guys in the medical school you
know you you don't have it hardly any
money and you know you got lots of ideas
but over here at the bank we have no
ideas and but we got all the money that
you could ever possibly want so you know
this this is a great opportunity and
they made me an offer I couldn't refuse
so I walk into the bank and what do I
see I see hundreds of COBOL programmers
and I noticed that their projects were
were always late and I thought that was
very interesting when they were late the
management was upset the customers were
upset sometimes the bank lost money and
because it was the developers fault the
management punished them they had to go
on death marches they had to work
overtime they had to work weekends they
got burnout they quit they got divorced
and I thought something really wrong
with this picture so we started scrum I
said we need to flip this into a team
that creates so much software now that
we got the management on the run they've
got to figure out a way to sell this
stuff okay and we were able to do that
and as scrum went through the pattern
language of programming design
conferences and it is a pattern language
for high productive software development
and it's published in book four of the
series on patterns it's right in there
with all the software design patterns in
those books and so scrum is about not
being good it's it's about being great
and being great is five to ten times
better than the norm out there and so
going from good to great it means Toyota
or better now we this is what we see in
pretty good scrums revenue is going up
just like although Google's we're able
to start to love it off a little bit
right but Google's revel went up like
this
and we see companies driving their
product into Gartner groups Magic
Quadrant where they're out performing on
vision and execution my last company
patient keeper was able to do this in
the first couple of years drove it right
in there and once you get there you know
it's just like Google you can steal
people from anywhere that Google has
even stole some people from us recently
but here we are out competing McKesson
which is the biggest healthcare software
company so anytime we need someone a
good developer a scrum master a CEO
senior VP of Sales we stolen them all
from McKesson it's a lot more fun
working in an agile environment as as
you guys at Google know and if you
really do that well our goal we had a
new CEO coming in 2003 and he said you
know you guys talk about a lot about
done and scrum but the only done that
means anything to me is done that
generates revenue the customers live the
customers happy and they're paying money
so why don't we get that done at the end
of the spread we're live at four major
hospital systems at least there are no
outstanding issues and they're paying us
and what what do you think the
developers said about that now that's
not exactly what they said they said
they said yeah what are you thinking
that's not possible
but he was a smart guy and he said show
me your impediment list
let's work off the top of the
impediments let's talk about why we
can't do that
well the install teams are having
trouble configuring installing the
software well let's fix that well a
quarterly assurance team are having a
tough time testing a software well let's
fix that
well I performers tuning teams or have
it taking a little too much time to
perform its tool well let's fix that it
took us until 2005 to be able to deploy
at the end of every spread and as soon
as we hit that boom the hockey stick
it really matters getting done really
matters now to get there we have to go
back to scrum button okay
bass vote came up with a first Nokia
test in a presentation he did in 2006
I'm going to put it up my website so
people are asked me where did this come
from and in that first slide
presentation he did it was all about
agility so it's about agile practices
and iterations and actually in that he
said there Sprint's must be less than
six weeks but of course in scrum we
always want them less than four weeks so
I've kind of fine-tuned it for scrum
he said the software features need to be
tested and working at the feature level
the acceptance test not just the unit
tests need to be done and the sprints
need to start with an agile
specification just enough because these
guys in the telecom companies you know
they like these big specs like hundreds
of pages of specs with lots of
signatures on they want it all done
before they start okay that was a big
problem at Nokia so he wanted to get
agile so of those of you who are doing
scrum in here how many you can pass this
this part of this of the Nokia test
about I would say about half and that's
what we see typically about half then
later on he he put on the scrum
development or the scrum trainers list a
modified one that included some scrum
pack practices and this one said you
need to know who your product owner is
your product owner has to have a backlog
that's prioritized by business value it
needs to be estimated by the team that's
going to implement it the team needs to
generate burndown charts in the scrum so
that they know where they are on
delivering in the sprint and they need
to know their velocity how many story
points or whatever the measure may be at
the end of the sprint can they deliver
every sprint and you can't have anybody
disrupting the work of the team
so how many can pass that part of the
Nokia test here they were down to about
10% so that's the way it is in the world
and so at the venture group we want them
we want a hundred percent of the pass
the Nokia test we're really working on
that because we need that just to get
started well let's talk about some teams
some of them can pass this test some of
them didn't that are really hyper
productive teams and scalable teams and
distributed teams and it's very
interesting what we find is that most of
these really high performing teams are
running really good engineering
practices and often XP practices inside
the scrum we find that scrum can't
really go hyper productive the first
team that did scrum did all the XP
practices before XP even existed in 1995
Kent Beck who started XP sent me a
famous email asking for everything I had
about scrum he said I want to steal
everything I can I'm starting a new
process so Kent focused mainly on the
engineering practices I began working
with ken Shriver at the time and he
focused mainly on the team process so
they grew up together and they're very
compatible so the high-performing scrum
teams will often run XP inside
test-driven development continuous
integration pair programming those kind
of things and we see find that the XP
teams have a truck a tough time scaling
it's very hard to globally scale an XP
teams a set of teams you really need to
wrap them with scrum to enable the
scaling so I want to talk about two
distributed projects one is a failed
project and it's a scrum project but it
was it is still the most productive
large project ever recorded and a second
one is a project that replicated this in
a systematic way we ran all the XP
practices inside and got similar results
when I was writing a paper on that on
that first project we first started
thinking about how the scrum look when
it's distributed you know you might have
five teams across the world that don't
have any way to communicate other than
email a voicemail
like that's AdWords I asked the AdWords
team and we have the AdWords people here
know AdWords people and Michael and
Martin vo I had all the AdWords team in
Mountain View there and I said well does
the email and voicemail work you know it
looks like kind of like osmosis that's
the way it works the communication they
said yeah osmosis I thought well maybe
Google invented a new way of
communication osmotic communication
maybe we should introduce that as a
standard scrum practice or something you
know if it really works why not but I
asked them if it worked and they all
said they all shook their heads it was
like all in unison evidently there's
some communication problems so if you
ask the scrum Alliance how to do this
they'll say figure out a way to link
those teams maybe a scrum of scrums by
teleconference across geographies that
kind of regularly make sure everything
is synced up but it turns out that that
is not the highest-performing way the
highest-performing way is to actually
have all the teams be distributed across
geographies this is tremendously
counterintuitive but I'm going to show
you an example before I do that I want
to mention something about outsourcing
because you know our board wanted us to
do outsourcing a patient keeper four
years and as long as I wasn't outside
the company running around I could
prevent it but then I was I was out
doing scrum in Europe one time in our
the VP of engineering was holed out
holding down the fort agreed to do it
and so we sent a couple million dollars
to India to a waterfall team okay but he
kept careful track of what happened and
he found that at the end of a couple
years if an Indian waterfall developer
cost 10% of an American scrum developer
that was breakeven
but they didn't they cost 30% of an
American developer so he sent two
billion dollars of software over there
and he paid six million dollars to get
it back now in a venture funded company
that's a pretty dumb thing to do and
when we showed the board that data they
agreed it was really stupid so they
stopped all outsourcing so the the
lesson in that was it's not so much
India but it's waterfall never outsource
to waterfall teams it always pays to do
scrum locally if you have to outsource
as Cersei Dining's did outsource to a
scrum team so here's the Cersei dynex
project a big library system installed
in about 12,500 site libraries all over
the world 120 million users in these
libraries and it was the codebase was
aging and they needed upgraded into an
internet environment and Jack Brown who
was CEO of Dining's wanted to decided to
totally reimplemented so he started in
2002 and you can see the code base is
growing this is thousands of lines of
Java code so it after a couple of years
he's up to 170 thousand lines of code
he's saying okay at that rate maybe by
2020 we'll have a million lines of code
we'll never make it in the market we've
got to do something so here he brought
in some legacy code and wrapped it with
Java and continued along but still it's
the same slope we're still looking out
there beyond 2015 so he said I've got to
do something I don't think he's in based
in Utah I don't think I can hire the
people I need I need to go offshore I
need to find some agile development so
he went to India he went to China he
went to Russia and the first thing he
noticed was an Indian China the turnover
rate was 30 to 35% and increasing and he
decided that he was not going to send
his project anywhere were a third of the
people working on it quit every year
it's just too disruptive but he found
some stable teams in Russia and he
he worked out an arrangement with a
company at that time called star
self-development Labs was acquired by a
company now called exigent services and
on 1 January 2005 they added 25 st.
Petersburg developers to 26 Utah
developers and their velocity
immediately more than doubled now this
is unheard of it's the first time in the
computer literature that anybody has
shown that adding people to a lodge
project did not reduce productivity for
a developer the productivity curve looks
like this but this went like that ok so
this is an extreme data point this is an
unexplainable data point as soon as I
smelled this I said that the CEO of Star
soft we need to write a case study we
need to look at why did this happen
so he flew the project leader in Russia
into my Boston we actually met in the
middle of a blizzard in my my home in
the Boston area and got on the phone to
the the project leader in Utah and he
went through how the teams were
organized and every team intentionally
was set up to be half its in Utah and
half in Russia even if it's a small team
this is the search team had four people
two in Russia and two in say in Utah and
it was set up so that any member and any
geography could do any task on the
Sprint backlog and the cross geography
teams met every day in a scrum meeting
15 minutes by teleconference so in in
the st. Petersburg it was in the
afternoon late afternoon and in Utah was
the early morning they did find that
they needed to send out email answering
the three scrum questions in order to
overcome cultural and language barriers
but with that they were able to keep
these meetings to 15 minutes
they had a central repository for
tracking based on the JIRA tracking
system with a scrum plug-in that they
wrote and they had a dashboard
particularly showed mainly quality data
you'll see some of this data is not very
good they had some quality problems in
that project and at the end of the day
when we did the analysis
I took Mike's Cowen's project in his
book on user stories because he has a
small waterfall project that he
reimplemented with a six person scrum
team a hyper productive scrum running at
an order of magnitude better which is
typical in these high-performing scrum
teams and cersei dynex in a project this
is only when the Russians were on board
so this was just the periods where the
Russians joined the team function points
per munch which are a measure of
features delivered that is comparable
across teams and across companies Circe
Dynamics is doing 15.3 almost the same
as a six person scrum co-located in the
same room now we've got a another really
extreme unexplainable daily point
because the best data on colocation
shows you double the productivity with
colocation here it didn't really matter
so another thing to really investigate
why well as I said there was some
problems with Circe Dynamics they did do
global distributed builds every hour the
code well code base was rebuilt every
hour but the bills weren't stable except
that at Sprint boundaries but even at
Sprint boundaries it wasn't potentially
shippable code and they had the scrum
masters and product owners an
architecture only in the US actually
that turned out to their advantage
because they retained all the knowledge
a side effect of this strategy is you
can cut loose the out lossing people the
outsourcing people without losing any
knowledge
he just goes down whereas if you
outsource the knowledge if you cut off
the the guys on the other side of the
planet
all of a sudden half your brain is lost
okay so that this this approach has some
really unique features they weren't
running the same in Rio towers in Russia
that Utah was not doing XP they didn't
have any face-to-face meetings between
the Russians and the and Utah low test
coverage poor refactoring practice
didn't have equal talent across team
that's one of the things people said all
you know those rushes are such there's
so much better than those Utah
developers that's why you know this they
did so well well it turns out they did
do performance analysis across teams as
if they were one team and it is true the
Russians were in the top 15% I'll every
one of the Russians was in the top 15%
I'll so they were on the average better
that's why they more than doubled
productivity okay when they they went
out and at the end of the day the
company killed the project anyway so
it's a field project so from the point
of view of a research study what does
this mean you know it was a single data
point from a retrospective study as the
study had already happened and then we
looked at it and noticed something
industry interesting in medicine they
say that doesn't prove anything
it could be just chance you can infer
causality was Searcy tonics a lucky
accident or maybe an unlucky accident
they killed the project well I had some
other data from from the star soft labs
here's the last two dozen C sharp
projects this is lines of code in terms
of size of project and this is function
points per person month all of them are
more productive than Searcy dynamics
they're all hyper productive the whole
company has gone into a hyper productive
state so maybe there's something here we
really need to dig into this further
now a lot of people say well what does
velocity mean anyway you know they could
be going fast but they could be
delivering stuff that doesn't have real
value they could just be pumping out
crappy software but I say you know
working with the venture guys we got to
have velocity it doesn't matter how good
you are if you're slow you can't make
any money off of that and if you're a
slow no matter how good you out it's
very hard to fix slow it's just hard to
change but if you're fast then there's
some hope we can start introducing best
practices to drive your quality up and
maybe you go make even a fast velocity
go faster now we've got some leverage so
velocity matters in my book and it's
easy to fix quality that it is to get
hyper productive so Searcy dynamics has
some interesting data some of the other
projects there show some interesting
numbers we should do a careful study we
should do a prospective study we should
set up teams with the expectation that
we can completely distribute teams and
we can replicate local velocity at a
distance and we should do it from
multiple teams and we should carefully
control quality just what we do in a
clinical trial and let's see if this
really works we could actually get
distributed velocity equal to co-located
velocity so a company in the Netherlands
looked at this they said we're going to
try this and see if it works
so they define the distribute team model
they ensure to consistent talent across
geographies established high quality
data gathering and consistent models and
the goal is local velocity equals
distributive velocity local quality
equals distributed quality and scaling
is linear at constant velocity for
developers that's what we want to
demonstrate through a series of pilot
projects
now one of the things that Jim kopelyan
says is Jeff you can't have a
distributed team a team
can't exist distributed a team that is
funky is one unit breaks down across
geographies and so I began going through
the research literature on that and in
general that is true at least 80% and
probably over 90% of distributed teams
are not a team there are multiple sub
teams with different agendas trust
breaks down they compete it's not a team
but it turns out that you know if you
read if you look at the emergency
response team literature in rare teams a
larger team identity is formed where the
team rises to a higher level
conceptually and everybody's driving
towards the same goal so the question is
if you're going to do distributed teams
how do you capture that it doesn't
happen by chance
so what CBO did beginning and a couple
of years ago is they said okay we have a
subsidiary in India let's start a
project and we'll have typically a run
with teams of eight they do pair
programming so they want pairs so we'll
start with four Dutch guys in the
Netherlands and we'll bring four guys
from India to the Netherlands and we'll
run locally as a team face to face we'll
run several Sprint's and we'll establish
a local velocity then we'll move the
Indian half of the team back to India
they'll still run as the same team
meeting every day and the scrum meeting
and we'll see if we can keep the same
velocity and one of the examples in a
paper and this is going to be published
at the agile conference in Toronto in a
couple of weeks is what they call the
Pro Rail project this is the scheduling
system for the Netherlands railway
system does all this runs all the signs
on the railroad does all the scheduling
and zbu was hired there was a
scheduling system for railways are hard
to build okay and a waterfall team maybe
even multiple teams had already failed
and been thrown off the project ZB was
hired in and they put an initially put
an eight-person dutch team on the
project and got a local velocity
established they then said they then got
eight people from India to come and then
they form two teams each team half Dutch
half Indian still running local velocity
and they established a velocity that was
running at five times the speed of their
there were many other vendors on this
big project and they know they're
running at five times the velocity of
any of the other vendors they then sent
the Indians back to India they run all
of the XP practices inside the scrum the
definition of done at the end of the
Sprint is the customer has done complete
acceptance testing on the customer site
and declared the software ready for
deployment okay so a strong definition
of done and defects radar less than one
per a thousand under thought one per
thousand lines of code which are pretty
low some of the lowest in the industry
and they're steadily getting getting
lower as the codebase grows the bug
count is actually the open bugs are
actually going down so the defect rate
is getting better and better here's a
here's a graph of the defect rate these
were these are all the bugs that have
been opened and the purple are closed
and the only ones remaining is the gold
line so you can see the defect rate is
going down as the codebase increases so
the defect rate is decreases they can't
get every single defect found in
iteration eliminated but over 90 percent
of them are within the iteration they do
test-driven development pair programming
continuous integration one of the things
they say is they try to get exactly the
same team conditions in India and
Netherlands that means the same tools
the same environment the same level of
talent the same capabilities they want
the team uniform throughout
the Indians say that it feels exactly
the same as India as it does in
Amsterdam they work exactly the same no
matter whether they're in Amsterdam or
India and another interesting finding of
this is that the CBS CTO has found that
the distributed team is better than a
local team the reason being there is no
difference in quality and velocity and
cost is somewhat less but the reason
that they're better is the Dutch guys
explain to the Indian guys every day
what the customer is thinking and it
keeps the whole team more customer
focused when they have all the guys in
the Netherlands being Dutch they tend to
drift off customer focus so his decision
is that all project we run this way it's
just a better way to do it now how crazy
is that now just to show you how they
resolve cultural differences there are
cultural differences one of the teams
had a local velocity decrease after
distribution the Indians went back to
India and the velocity went down so they
immediately did an analysis of why and
they found that the guys on the Indian
side were waiting for the Indian
technical leader to tell them what to do
which is counter scrum it cuts velocity
so the same day they realize that they
said okay the scrum master is now the
technical lead in India the top of the
impediment list is velocity fixed it in
less than a week boom
it's back to where it was locally so
here's some data that shows this is the
number of story points locally they were
local here and then here they split and
so story points are only going up here's
the velocity
I think this is the price in euros or
actually it's ours here but they measure
the cost in euros per story point and it
was at iteration around iteration seven
that they that they distributed so it
popped up slightly then went down so
roughly the same here it started to go
up and when they started to analysis of
why the cost went up they found that the
team was going faster but in going
faster they were creating more bugs and
the rework was driving cost up so they
actually slowed the teams down and the
cost is coming right back down to where
they want it so you have to be careful
about going too fast so the net effect
of the CBI product is a little bit
smaller than Searcy Dianetics is they
got 15 point one function points for
develop month and Searcy Dinitz got 15
per three point three but this is a
rigorous implementation with very high
quality so I think it demonstrates well
that this was not a lucky accident it's
repeatable now if this were a clinical
trial in medicine we would say now other
clinical trials have to repeat the same
result so now we're looking for other
companies to try this maybe Google would
you want to try this but you have to run
a really good scrum to do this now it's
fascinating
capers Jones who is one of the leading
productivity guys the United States
which has written dozens of books on
this sent me some data recently showing
his analysis of many projects he has
special tools that make teams comparable
it adjusts automatically mathematically
for different environments and all that
he says if you look at function points
per month for a CMM level 3 company on
the average for a small project this is
a very small project so this is high
it's not - it's eight the agile teams
are twice as good and these are not even
necessarily scrum teams they must
probably a lot of scrum but in there but
in general they're twice as good the
thing that struck me was 15.1 came up
again 15.1 is kind of looking like the
magic number so at the end of the day
both Cersei dynamics at Sevilla are
getting and systematic software
engineering in Denmark who is a cm level
five company they see the same results
as teams scale and if you run a really
good scrum you get linear scalability in
contrast to the typical waterfall
project so at the end of the day you
know Circe Dynamics was the first
implementation they didn't have any
administrative costs in the function
point analysis CB it does so it's a
fully burdened cost they had a lot of
quality issues that I talked about ZB ax
fixed all that fully distributed team
replicated across many projects included
all administrative overhead continuous
integration of working bill they do
test-driven development so all the unit
tests are done before code coding
constant refactoring fully automated
daily regression and performance testing
and acceptance tests by the customer at
the end of a spring now it's interesting
what CB a-- is doing now I was recently
at a session every month I spent a week
at open view venture partners coaching
the open view teams because the venture
group runs its whole operation by scrum
they have three scrums the senior
partners that do the investment are
scrum they have a search team that does
a global search for the best companies
in the world and selects the companies
for potential investment they run a
scrum and the open view labs which runs
all the support for all the portfolio
company investments and at a recent
session Scott Maxwell who's the senior
partner jumped out
he said Jeff I want to show you the
Maxwell curve he said you know as
venture capitalists we want to get
people really productive and to do that
we want them to work really hard you
know we know if they work zero hours a
week they get zero done so we want to
drive them harder and harder and harder
until they start to break down and burn
out okay and so our idea of a work week
is it's always 40 hours a week and and
the people in his venture group you know
they're working 60 hours a week before I
came in there he said but you know a
scrum is different scrum requires an
intensity that you can't keep up and
what we really want is to get twice as
much done using that intensity and in
order to do that we need to work less so
now all the guys that are working 40
hours a week they're getting more done
and feeling guilty for not working hard
enough we had a long discussion about
that but the only but the question is
are they working too much even at 40
hours we have data from a XP team where
our set of teams where a manager decided
that he would run a study to see what
was the right work length for XP teams
doing intense pair programming
he tried 40 hour weeks 15 60 30 20 what
do you think was the most productive
work week 20 is close 16 hours so ZB is
saying you know maybe our cost per story
point is too high because they're
working 40 hour weeks we're gonna start
sending these guys home early and see if
the cost per story point goes down
meaning the velocities going up so when
you're running a really good scrum with
that kind of data collection you can
start doing these things why not have
more fun if you can get more done right
so the recommendations out of all this
is you can execute a pretty good scrum
why not why not execute great scrum why
not give this a try now to do it you
need to be able to carefully set up
those teams you need to be careful that
you need to be able to measure the
velocity carefully because you want to
know if you're breaking down as you
distribute the teams you might want to
measure cost per story point and
increasing costs will show you
something's breaking down our quality is
causing rework and the lesson in all
this is if you carefully measure results
you can very quickly correct problems
those who can't suffer eternal
dysfunction you know the companies that
are doing scrum are kind of in three
categories there's those companies that
don't want to hear about their
impediments there what they don't want
to hear about what's wrong and so they
you know if scrum is in there they
suppress the scrum masters you know
surfacing of the impediments and prevent
process improvement you know at the
venture group we say these companies
deserve to die and the faster the better
and we have companies that are coming up
and are going to take some of their
business for them and help then we have
a second group of companies and there
are the companies that will talk about
their impediments but won't fix their
impediments and there's a lot of them
these companies are in purgatory they're
an internal struggle and you know if you
were raised in a good Catholic you know
that people deserve to be in purgatory
for their sins so they deserve it as
supper long enough to learn better so
these companies deserve to suffer it's
okay you know
scrum coaches are worried about that you
know geez what do I do you know the
minute I'm working away and the
management doesn't want to fix
impediments and if I raise too much noiz
I might get fired and it's just ok they
deserve to suffer you know you're like
the Buddha working in you know there's a
Buddha that works in hell his name is
the shitty Buddha spends his entire time
trying to coach those people down there
it's a tough job but somebody has to do
it but then there are the companies that
will look at their impediments and they
will fix him and those companies start
to accelerate and grow really fast and
they avoid eternal dysfunction so this
slide means you know don't try this at
home this is for this is for
professional teams that are really
highly disciplined that we're talking
about but it's a really interesting
model that I think we're going to see
more of and certainly exigent services
now has a strategy of trying to use a
deal agility worldwide they are a couple
of thousand they're not huge but a
couple thousand consultants is enough to
cause some significant trouble and
disrupt the market for pretty big
consulting projects and their their
strategy is to use agility to do that
and we'll be talking about that at the
agile conference in two weeks so those
are my comments tonight I think we have
some time for some questions some
discussions some thoughts about this
usually people are kind of quiet after
that after these data yeah
well what is an effective workday now in
some of the I have a company in that
I've worked with a little bit in
Charlotte where Joe little is with me
comes from and they had a team of nine
people and and they thought that you
know they were doing 60 their velocity
was 60 story points of Sprint I think
they were running two-week Sprint's and
they thought you know 9 was a little big
maybe if they made him smaller they'd go
faster so they broke him into five and
four
and within three Sprint's they were
doing 180 story points they tripled
their velocity and so I was back there
six months later since we had discussed
this and I said well how is it going now
Jason he said oh he said you know the
five person team two people quit and
then we got into some dynamics we lost
that entire five person team and I said
what's your velocity now he said oh it's
the same as it was when we had nine
people tell me now we got four people
doing the work of nine people that had
already tripled what they were doing
earlier so he's multiplied it by six
times and it was already pretty good
scrum to begin with and I said what kind
of problems do you have now he says well
I'm getting a lot of flack for the
management because I tell the people to
come in work hard and as soon as you
feel tired just take off so that's
probably the answer you to our question
come in put out a good effort when you
start to you know feel a little burn out
just go surfing or something at
Trondheim they tell me that their focus
factor well what's your focus factor
here in the New York office they know it
in Trondheim
nobody's answering means you don't know
your focus factor it's really good to
know your focus factor Trondheim is 50%
what's your focus factor hmm when you
come in in the day how many hours do you
really get focused on burning that
backlog down
so any meetings any emails any all that
stuff it doesn't count
only when you're coding on that backlog
so what's your focus factor yeah so you
know figure out what the right focus
factor is it's probably varies across
individuals I always had the attitude if
we had a guy that come in and worked an
hour to and he did more than most people
worked in eight hours that an hour and
two is plenty that's fine
I I've always had people that have like
that that have worked for me I've always
encouraged them to work their own
schedule whatever it is I don't care
yeah there were a lot of other hands up
earlier what what else and so the
minimum expectation is any
recommendations and that kind of
environment how to survive I would even
take like some extreme things in terms
of making large moves to try to change
the relationship so there's for software
developers in a consulting company of
150 and everybody works 60 70 80 hours a
week how can they survive and not work
60 or 70 hours a week
what's your working what's your focus
factor I never measured it what would
you guess it would be 30% oh you ought
to you know get rid of some of those
hours at least bump you bumped your
focus back at a 50% you'd cut a huge
chunk of those hours you could probably
go to 40 hours a week with a focus
factor of 50 percent and get at least as
much done problem is they make money
charging per hour so well this is the
problem you know why would customers pay
per hour
for something that you know they any
customer you know they they just don't
know what they're doing you know I mean
you know they just don't understand but
if they read the literature they know
the difference between the best and the
worst developer is 1 to 10 within a
project this is the Yale University data
and 1 to 25 across a project so now I'm
going to pay you for 10 hours of work
but does that mean I'm going to get are
you going to do that work in half an
hour or is it actually going to cost you
two and a half times as much and going
to build me 25 hours when all I want is
a is a feature I mean it's just crazy
they should pay for feature and in fixed
price contracts they do that and we
spend a lot of time today in the
training class we did talking about how
to work fist price contracts a
consultancy and fixed price contracts
you can drive your margins from whatever
they are today usually 15 to 20 percent
is good you can drive that to 50 to 80%
because if you drive your velocity if
you if you pull a scrum thing will you
drive your velocity up five to ten and
you get paid the same rate as the
waterfall guys get paid for hours well
guess what you get paid for ten times as
many hours so you get money for nothing
then you can go home early and still
make twice as much money so I would say
your consultant she's not thinking
clearly yet okay their body shopping
when they could be making real money so
that's another whole issue that strategy
your strategy of your company really
needs a serious look because you are
leaving a ton of money on the table if
you're doing scrum ton of money yeah
right well the thing is if you can
deliver in half the time of any of your
competitors and you know that and you
can get a business model that allows you
to compete and drive your margins up to
two three four times your competitors
even though it's a maybe a broken
business model to estimate such big
chunks why wouldn't you do it because
right now you're just you know getting
your 15% margin on the number of hours
your guys put in why don't you get 80%
margin that's all I'm saying
and it's possible and there's a lot of
different strategies a number of the
companies I work with the Scandinavia
are very aggressive about this and they
use it in all kinds of different ways
like the CEO one company recently told
me he was going in and a five million
euro project and he knew all the
competitors when a bid five million euro
and they were they were low balling it
and they were not going to be making any
money and they were gonna make it up and
cost overruns but he knew he could build
bill bid five million euro and he was
almost guaranteed he could nail that
number in terms of cost and make some
margin so he was going to take that
project right off the table of the other
vendors another company systematic
software engineering is CMM level five
company now those guys can estimate
pretty well
they have to have very low margins of
error to get rated with scrum within six
months just beginning scrum they found
that they could deliver a project at
half the cost with scrum and 40% fewer
defects so they started bidding on these
big projects they said you can have the
waterfall project you know that's ten
million euro but we'll give you the
scrum project for five million
they're both CMM level five the only
difference is the scrum project has 40%
fewer bugs that's just the way it is we
measured it on dozens of project it
always comes out that way and so I was
there in 2006 and there were 100%
waterfall and I was there in the summer
2007 and I couldn't find a waterfall
project in the company I said what
happened I know the European Union on
their big government projects they
require waterfall and they said well
somehow waterfall just faded away you
know they said well you know I guess it
half the price and half the bugs even a
bureaucrat could figure out what they're
going to buy but I actually dug into
this and I found out they only require
waterfall above a certain amount of
money so the bureaucrats were chunky and
into smaller chunks which is perfect for
an agile team and then they could do
scrum and they could get it done for
half the price and half the bugs so it's
amazing what happens yeah back yeah the
comment is you know a one-hour time
different gets a lot more done that a
lot more our time difference and
typically that is definitely true
people working the same room as I said
there was a the best study I've seen on
colocation a company randomly co-located
some teams they were you know roughly
comparable teams so they took a bunch of
them in co-located and the rest they
left dispersed and within the company
and the co-located teams delivered twice
as much stuff so that's normal so I
would say that effect would play out in
timezone as well so that's the normal
situation what I'm talking about here is
an abnormal situation it's a extreme
data point but you know from a from a
venture point of view you're always
looking at something that's different
that cuts through to go where people
haven't been able to go before all I'm
saying is that this is a strategy that
people have been able to use to do that
maybe back here yeah
well you know the rule of thumb we use
for scrum teams is if you go to more
than one your velocity doesn't double at
one point four is more likely so you're
gonna take a big hit unless you do what
CBO does and that is very carefully set
up a strategy that works a systemic has
done the same thing
demonstrated linear scalability so is so
is star soft labs but you have the
sounds like you have good scrum teams
running XP inside you should be able to
figure out how to do this
it's just has to be done very carefully
and you have to be able to measure it
all the way now as far as your
management improving velocity one way is
to expand the teams and do it in the
best way possible but another way is to
remove impediments no matter how fast
you're going people have already had has
always been able to go faster just by
finger on a better way to do it so that
that's another thing to really think
about is your management really onboard
and they understand scrum are they
systematically getting things out of
your way and all that stuff probably as
a start-up you're probably in pretty
good shape about that crammed into the
same room that helps
there are there are other things both of
the in the Searcy tonics paper in the
CBO paper which is available you know if
you send me an email I can send you the
paper a probably Jo will be sending it
out to the people that are meeting with
us this week anyway but as many things
as we can think of that we're important
we put in that paper now there's nothing
that's going to substitute from having
the kind of culture in the company that
CBA halves the consultants are all
aggressive Suzy astok you know they're
ready to go out and really kick some
butt there they're a high performance
team like a good sports team and so to
do what they did you have to have that
you know build that team spirit in the
organization having master offshore
really worked for that for that team
what would you suggest in a in a
situation wherein you have the
development team itself distributed
across our geography how do you
encourage peer programming
in a situation like that and you have
one person in Toronto one person in
Chicago one person in India if you have
one person in each of many locations I
suppose it would be pond I mean the
technology day you probably do pair
programming because you can use go to
peace go to my PC and come right into
somebody else's screen it's probably a
way to do that and work together but
obviously it's more difficult you don't
have to do pair programming one of the
best teams I had at idx which is now GE
Healthcare was a team that had a third
of the people in Burlington Vermont a
third in Boston the third in Seattle and
the Seattle people all work from home
and that was one of the most
high-performing scrums I'd ever seen it
was like one of the CBO teams but they
had a scrum master
you know talented people on the team and
a scrum master that was really a great
scrum master one of the best I'd ever
seen and he was able to power up that
team and keep them focused in a way that
really helped and you know every day it
was that distributed team meeting really
worked so if you if you have a scrum
that doesn't work very well
well locally and you distribute it it is
even more of a mess when it's
distributed so you have to have a really
good local capability and you have to
have really disciplined performance
remotely to make it the kind of things
I'm talking about work yeah
well what what was noticed on the
AdWords project when scrum was first
started to be implemented by mark
strawberry was that developers that
didn't understand that a lot of work in
progress a lot of open items in the
middle of the sprint was going to cause
big problems at the end cause the date
to tend to slide out so it creates a lot
of desperate measures at the end but if
you if the development team will focus
on finishing the first story first and
testing it immediately and then go to
the next story that means everybody has
to work together all the time to get
these stories done sequentially and test
it right away when you get to the end of
the spread you only have that last story
to finish and test and that's the way
patient keeper works because when we go
live at the end of the Spirit we can't
afford to have a crisis at the end or
things could really blow up I mean if we
so what you see in those teams is the
brac log it'll be slow it'll actually go
up in the beginning because we enter the
sprint with a lot of risk and tasks are
starting to explode a little bit so the
Sprint will go up but then they'll go oh
they'll burn down actually an ideal day
per developer in the middle of that
sprint and then they'll you know a week
before the end their coasts they're
coasting in so they got a nice Coast in
that last week where people aren't
really pressured they do that by testing
things immediately as soon as they're
done so the testing is going on all the
time and they're servicing any
integration problems or any cross you
know team problems right away so I my
guess is that that focus would help the
global teams based on the data I've seen
from the AdWords project environment you
eliminate it why because it may
quality go down and a cripples velocity
so that's what Mark tried to teach the
AdWords team to try to to measure the
burndown of tasks but measure the
burndown of completed stories as well
and if the gap starts to widen between
completed stories and tasks done
immediate problem if you keep both of
those running right together you'll come
into the end much better you think that
really smart people would figure out how
to IO de works and actually incorporate
it into their practice wouldn't you if
you're really smart you would figure
that out and then you and you to operate
accordingly yeah another one over here
yeah the second the second one the more
high-performing the team the less I
wouldn't say the less important the
scrum master is but the less the scrum
master need to do this is definitely
true one of the things that is really
interesting and I'm doing a lot of work
with the agile coach at myspace now
we're doing we're trying to do a bunch
of scrum training in LA and myspace has
a company about a third of it is
waterfall another third of it is scrum
but they have a lot of project leaders
in there there's a lot of kind of
conflict and churn because the project
Lee isn't scrum and another third one's
pretty good scrum and and the actual
coach there is very good at taking scrum
teams and taking them hyper productive
and he does it using a change in
behavior as the team of all so he takes
on a new team and he says ok we are
going to do scrum
we're gonna do it by the book we're
gonna track we're gonna we're gonna burn
everything down we're gonna do stories
in order we're gonna test them right
away there's gonna be no argument about
this for the first two weeks print that
is the way is gonna be I know you're
gonna hate me but I need to teach you
how it actually works you actually have
to do it at least once so you know what
it is okay so they all hate him for two
weeks the next two weeks that they're
actually successful if they're not may
have to suffer for another two weeks
let's say they're successful that two
weeks then he lights it up lightens up
he moves more into a facilitator and
then they start to kind of like him so
he might run a sprint or two as a
facilitator and then in coaching them he
will get a number of them not just one
but repeatedly he will get teams to pop
into a hyper productive state where
they're in that five to ten times normal
range from the waterfall team's at
MySpace and then he will back off and
just let it run and you know if it stays
that way he will then leave it and then
go grab another team so there's a
there's a patterning of behave you know
if the velocity is ten percent of what
it could be
which is where waterfall teams are ten
percent of their ultimate potential you
have to have command and control to pop
them out of that state once they start
to come up in velocity by doing it right
you back off and move into what we call
the standard scrum boat which is a scrum
master as a facilitator now if you're a
really good facilitator you actually
coach them into a really high performing
state where you can do nothing so the
best scrum master has nothing to do all
day those are the best grow masters
what's that point out that you know
using you can't use the associative
property that like the best scrum master
might not have anything to do all day
but just because a scrum master isn't
doing anything all day doesn't
necessarily
there's there's two types of scrum
masters that are not doing anything all
day ones that have teams whose velocity
sucks and the others have teams whose
velocity is ten times normal as long as
they have ten teams ten times normal and
they can consistently produce them then
you want them to work some of the time
getting the team there but not bother
them the rest of the time because
they're actually your Golden Goose
they're laying these golden eggs for you
so what actually happens is a good scrum
master like this will do what the guy at
myspace does well he'll keep on just
taking new teams and then take them up
the track all right in Google's case at
Marc ryback's case I think was your VP
of engineering said mark we've got a
bigger problem that AdWords now that
you've got adds where it's working then
we've got a quality problem in Google is
that what he's doing now is working the
testing and quality side of Google so a
really good scrum master usually gets
promoted and often several levels into
bigger and bigger that's why a good
scrum master is really hard to find they
get promoted so Fasching and never get
it back again another question so I I
bred and I don't want to some of your
dialogues about you know how things work
occasion keeper and I always described
very much like the entire essentially
the entire company is a line towards
from it's not just product development
in sales it's support it's everywhere
right here right in these examples where
you are looking at these and then well
this is really important the entire
company alignment and the management
really on board is essential to these
high-performing teams
I haven't seen anything like what I'm
talking about
without the management being totally on
board and understanding what's going on
because it's so easy I mean send a GM
manager into a Toyota plant what do you
think is going to happen things are
going to get messed up within a few
weeks because they just don't understand
and so management in a well unless they
get on board they understand scrum I
have companies that the CEOs come to the
training I have one company in Denmark
where every single person the secretary
that's answering the phone goes to scrum
training certified scrum master training
so the entire company is certified scrum
masters when they started to do that
their revenue and growth did a hockey
stick within a year from that decision
they acquired two more companies went
public so it's critical and that's it
working with a venture capital group
they all understand management is really
important we actually start there with
those companies and get the management
really primed and then kind of they help
bring the development teams along okay
how are we doing on time Amy we're over
time maybe one burning question if
anybody has one if not thank you all for
coming tonight
