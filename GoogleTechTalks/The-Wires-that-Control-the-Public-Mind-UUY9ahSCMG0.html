the build tools team and I brought
Sheldon here because I think the work
that that he and everybody at the Center
for median democracies is doing is
really important because obviously the
media sort of shapes you know they frame
what we think of as green what we think
of as politically feasible morally
justifiable and of course that's heavily
the media are heavily influenced by
corporations so it's sort of like you
know our ideology is being shaped by
these corporate PR organizations so I
think it's great to be uncovering that
stuff and becoming aware of it and
that's what Sheldon is doing so if we
welcome Sheldon Hampton and CMD is this
thing on Wow
well the title of my talk as you can see
from the screen is the wires that
control the public mind I'll explain the
meaning of that phrase a little later
maybe the meaning self-evident this this
is the organization I work for the
Center for Media democracy our web site
is PR Watch o RG we've been we started
off as a watchdog organization
monitoring the public relations industry
from an almost unremittingly negative
perspective there are there are PR firms
that don't engage in sleazy deceptive
practices but if they do we don't write
about them every so often we'll get
someone from a PR firm contacting our
office and saying could you do a story
about our firm and our standard answer
is what are you doing anything unethical
and then they quickly get off the phone
and say we like you guys we like you
guys so we started doing this about 15
years ago and I'd like to explain a
little bit about how we got into it
spies for hire Mike my co-author John
Stuber with whom I've now written
several books founded the center after
running into this woman Diane Moser
Diane or John is a longtime
environmental activist and back in the
1980s 1990s he was involved in a
campaign opposing that plans by the
Monsanto Company to introduce
genetically engineered bovine growth
hormone into the marketplace BGH is a
genetically engineered hormone that they
that you inject into cows to force them
to give more milk and various groups
were concerned about that there were
environmental concerns that farm groups
were concerned that it was actually
going to be bad for for farmers consumer
groups there were health concerns and so
there was a coalition that that formed
around these these issues and at one
point they received a phone call from
this woman she said my name is Diane
Moser and I'm with a group called the
Maryland citizens consumer Council and
we're also concerned about bovine growth
hormone we'd like to join the coalition
and attend your meetings they thought
nothing of that and and said short held
held a meeting a little later she came
to it and then a month later someone
connected to Monsanto was sort of
boasting to a reporter that they had a
mole in there in the meeting and the
reporter calls one of the the people in
the coalition said did you know that
that Monsanto had a spy in your meeting
and they said no did a little checking
and there was only one person at the
meeting that no one else knew
Dyanne Moser did a little more checking
they discovered that the Maryland
citizen consumer council in fact did not
exist and and the dynamos worked for
public relations firm one of the world's
largest PR firms called
burson-marsteller even though it's a
very large company I'm sure many of you
have not heard of it many most people
have not heard of the PR firms that work
behind the scenes to shape public
perceptions and most of us when we think
about what PR firms do probably picture
some instance your guy in a suit you
know spinning a line someone like
Michael J Fox on on Spin City you don't
think about someone infiltrate
infiltrating meetings of environmental
activists but that in fact is what they
did well John's reaction to all this was
to get quite irate he said I'm gonna get
these people and his idea of how to get
them was to start writing about them and
he contacted me and by then he John had
also gotten some information about the
guy you see in this picture here bud
Wester mark was going around to Anam are
animal rights groups he was it turned
out he was working with a PR firm called
McGovern Bisco and Duchin after they
figured out what he was up to they
managed to catch a photograph of him as
you can see he looks a little bit like a
character out of some film noir and John
had written up this very intriguing
article about about these PR firms
skulking around and spying on people and
he said I'm gonna start up a publication
call it PR watch and ice and I said you
know this is a pretty interesting story
you've written here but you know after
we do the first issue is there really
enough information about something like
public relations are we ever going to do
a second issue and that was 15 years ago
so we've we've been we've been finding
dirt regularly ever since and having
kind of a good time with it after we've
done it a couple of years we wrote a
book titled toxic sludge is good for you
lies damned lies in the public relations
industry the title was intended
satirically we did not really think that
there would be a PR campaign out there
telling people literally the toxic
sludge is good for you until we got a
phone call from this woman Nancy Blatt
who explained that she was with an
organization called the water
environment Federation and she had heard
we were writing this book and she'd
heard the title and she was concerned
that the word sludge in the title might
actually be bad for the image of sludge
it turns out that the water environment
Federation is the main trade association
representing sewage treatment plants
well sewage treatment plants are what
are responsible for filtering everything
that goes into the water when you flush
down the toilet are down the drain
before it goes back into you know rivers
lakes and streams before they started
filtering that stuff out there was a
serious problem with with water quality
one one lake actually caught on fire so
they so the fact that they're filtering
that stuff out is certainly a good thing
but then they end up with this product
the the residue of the treatment process
that combines everything from you know
pesticides to you know human excrement
and that's what sewage sludge is and
disposing of that is a dilemma you know
we're talking you know tons and tons and
tons of material and they've tried you
know burying it in landfills it ends up
contaminating the drum the the
groundwater they've tried dumping it in
the ocean that ends up creating a big
you know problem with fish kills they've
tried incinerating it but then it comes
down to earth again
so the most recent plan the one that
they've been pushing forward that they
were pushing when they when they
contacted us is to use it as fertilizer
and and spread it on farm fields and
they quickly discovered a problem with
that which is that if you contact the
farmer said we have this product we want
you to spread on your on your farm and
it's sewage sludge that it turns people
off so they decided we're not going to
call it sludge anymore they call it bio
solids they actually appointed something
called the name change task force and
had a contest to come up with a new name
these are some of the candidates that
were rejected all growth Puran nutri bio
life bio slurp yeah do I like I kind of
like humanure urban biomass and I like
that one
nutria cake that's getting kind of
optimistic and my favorite personal
favorite of course is rose which is
short for recycling of solids
environmentally they finally settled on
settled on bio solids by the way after
after this first call that we got from
Nancy Blatt asking us she was actually
hoping we would change the title of our
book she wanted us to change it to
something like smoking is good for you
just so we wouldn't use the word sludge
for God's sake after after she realized
we weren't going to do that and after we
got kind of interested in their campaign
to rename sludge she stopped returning
our calls
some of the information we got about
this we actually the the water
environment Federation works with the
Environmental Protection Agency on some
of those projects and so there's
taxpayer money involved so the way we
got some of this information was
actually ultimately we had to file a
Freedom of Information Act request and
we discovered that after they after the
name change tax task force had done its
work from that that their next step was
they wanted to add the word biosolids to
the dictionary so they contacted
merriam-webster the dictionary people
very much they said well you know you
can't just coined a word and we'll put
it in the dictionary it doesn't work
that way they said how does it work well
we have to see evidence of the word
being used we have to see publications
that are actually using it and if we see
those and we see enough of them then
we'll then we'll then we'll evaluate and
at some point if it's used enough we'll
put it in the dictionary so they said
well we can do that and directors went
out to everyone who works in the field
of wastewater treatment saying don't use
the word sludge anymore always use the
word bio solids and then they started
mailing examples of that to
merriam-webster see see it's being used
as being published as being used one of
the memos we got through our Freedom of
Information Act request is from Pete
makhno of the National biosolids
partnership and which explains that
merriam-webster's are going to use the
word and he's pleased that the term
sludge will not appear in the definition
so here's the the definition that
appears now in merriam-webster's
biosolids is the solid organic matter
recovered from a sewage treatment
process and used especially as
fertilizer this reminds me of George
Orwell's book 1984 which depicts a
future in which a totalitarian world
engages in mind-control in other ways
they do that in particulars by
controlling language they've invented a
new verse
English they call Newspeak and in an
appendix to the book Orwell describes
the rules of Newspeak there's a category
of words that he calls the B words which
consist of two or more words or portions
of words welded together in an easily
pronounceable form the usual care was
taken to define them carefully and strip
them of undesirable meanings well that's
a description of mind control in a
terrifying totalitarian cruel
dictatorship and it's not the world we
live in but as the biosolids example
illustrates their parts and moments when
we come uncomfortably close biosolids
you just weld them together and strip
them of undesirable meanings and you've
got a new word so that people don't have
to think about the fact that what
they're spreading on their farm is
sewage sludge well how did this this
come to be to understand the history of
propaganda in the modern world it helps
to understand the career of Edward
Bernays Eddy as they call him in the in
in the PR profession these are pictures
of him at various stages in his life
Bernays lived he was born in 1891 and
lived until 1994 died at the age of 103
he used to say that what he did was
propaganda and he hoped it wasn't in
propaganda he's known as the father of
public relations he was also a nephew of
Sigmund Freud twice-over meaning that
his mother was married to
I think Freud's brother and Freud was
married to an another Bernays so he was
a cousin twice over I've often wondered
where Frei got his ideas about the
incest taboo but Bernays himself was
heavily influenced by Freud's ideas he
arranged translations of some of Freud's
books into English and was the author
himself of books with titles such as
crystallizing public opinion the
engineering of consent and propaganda
and he got a lot of his ideas about
human nature and how to influence it
from studying the example of his famous
uncle Sigmund here's a brief history of
spin Ivy League
I seen the Ivy Lee and Edward Bernays
who together are considered the two main
founders what was that thing what I'm
bumping okay okay Ivy League and Edward
Bernays got their start as wartime
propagandists during the First World War
you may recall from your history books
that Woodrow Wilson ran for re-election
to president on the campaign slogan he
kept us out of war that was because the
second world or the excuse me the first
world war was seen in the United States
is largely European affair there was a
lot of isolationist sentiment in the
United States and people simply did not
want to see the United States become
involved so for the purpose of the
campaign at least Wilson ran on the
slogan of he kept us out of war and as
soon as he got elected said about very
aggressively getting us into World War
one and in order to do that a PR
campaign was necessary in order to sell
the war to the American people a
committee was set up called the
committee for public information and Ivy
Lee and Edward Bernays and other people
went to work for it the the picture you
see the poster that says I want you for
the US Army that's become famous was one
of the was it was created by the
committee for public information they
designed posters they designed movie
newsreels they had people go into
theaters before performances and give
give talks they designed the war bond
campaign and in the process they
developed a lot of the techniques that
became used later on for for public or
for by the public relations industry one
thing that I think is important to
notice about this is that under the
pressure of
of war the very nature of communications
was redefined it became to be seen as a
set of techniques for manipulating the
thinking of target audiences this is I'm
gonna show a little clip here from from
a Department of Defense training film
from the 1950s where they explain their
understanding of this concept of target
Asif indicates that the target audiences
can be broken down into three basic
groups the subversives the government
supporters
and then the big group in the middle the
uncommitted civilians any SIOP effort
will have to income okay you get the
idea
I like the flute in that here's here's
béarnaise talking himself about about
the lessons taught by the war propaganda
was then taken over after the war by
other interested in propaganda became a
well organized part of business Bernays
through his training through his
background through you know in Freudian
theory came to see public relations as a
sort of applied science he said that the
Council on public relations is what
sociologists call societal technician
who he's bade just as a psychologist
helps clients or you know come to terms
with their neuroses his idea is that
public relations is basically a way of
adapting people to society and so you
have these practicing social science
that scientists who who are responsible
for shaping the thinking of the rest of
us the term human heard is a term that
he used himself he would say that people
are heard like people are subject to the
passions of the pack the mind of the
average citizens the citizen is the
greatest barrier between him and the
facts his own logic
he's on absolutism are the obstacles
that prevent him from seeing in terms of
experience and thought rather than in
terms of group reaction so Bernays did
not have a very high opinion of human
intelligence
fortunately the solution was this
special class that he envisioned of
opinion manipulators and you know he
thought you could do it almost
scientifically if you understand the
mechanisms of the group mind you can
control and regiment the masses
according to our will without their
knowing in in certain cases we can
affect some change with a fair degree of
accuracy by operating certain mechanism
just as the motorist can regulate the
speed of his car and he went on to say
those who manipulate this unseen
mechanism of society constitute an
invisible government which is the true
ruling power
of our country he thought this is a good
thing this is a logical result of the
way on which our democratic societies
organized and so you know almost every
act of our lives the relatively small
number of people who understand how to
pull the wires can control the public
mind
well that was Edward Bernays writing you
know 50 years ago 50 plus years ago but
these kinds of ideas this assumption
about the the nature of humanity and
about the need to manipulate people is
still very much a factor in the way
people think today this is a quote a few
from a few years ago from James Linda
Haim who is the worldwide director of
public affairs for the burson-marsteller
PR firm this is the same PR firm I
mentioned earlier that sent Diane Moser
to infiltrate the group that my
co-author was part of he says some very
interesting psychological and
sociological research on risk perception
suggests that the obvious rational
approach is not likely to succeed when
you're talking to the public in fact the
research tells us that people's
perceptions of the sizes of various
risks are based on emotional and not
rational factors ok what he's talking
about of course he's working for he one
of one of their clients is the chemical
industry he's talking about the fact
that people's perception of the risks
from from from things like toxic
chemicals are irrational so you have to
deal with them at an emotional level
rather than doesn't then talk about the
fact we are in the realm of the
illogical the emotional and we must
respond with the tools that we have for
managing the emotional aspects of the
human psyche this sounds just like
Edward Bernays the industry must be like
the psychiatrist rationally figuring out
how it can help the public put things in
perspective but knowing that dialogue
can only begin with a trust on the
public's part that says these people are
taking my concerns seriously I kind of
really like the contrast in this quote
where it begins by saying people are
just crazy emotional that you're like
you have to be
caiaphas just to deal with them and the
way you deal with them is the is that
you win their trust by convincing them
that you're taking their concerns
seriously I just sometimes wonder how
someone can utter these things not
realize how massively he's contradicting
himself this is from the website of
burson-marsteller where they explain
what they do perceptions are they they
say they're in the business of
perception management how important are
they well in in the news just in the
last month or so burson-marsteller CEO
Mark Penn resigned from Hillary
Clinton's presidential campaign PR
people like and PR firms like
burson-marsteller are these days advise
presidents and other politicians Penn
resigned by the way because Hillary
Clinton has publicly been declaring that
she's opposed to the North American Free
Trade Agreement Penn got in a little bit
of trouble because simultaneously he was
working for the government of Columbia
to lobby in favor of NAFTA yeah
he also burson-marsteller has also
worked isn't that has done a number of
anti-union projects and that was
jeopardizing Hillary Clinton's support
with labor unions interestingly although
he resigned he's still working for the
campaign this is perception management
at work you know I guess he's just not
working for them in an official capacity
anymore even though he's still being
paid so that yeah here's another PR firm
Hilton also kind of a legend in the PR
industry again expressing this idea that
when dealing with issues of risk and
public perception it's it's people's
emotions you have to deal with it's not
the hazard itself managing the outrage
is more important than managing the
hazard there's even a PR firm run by a
guy named Peter Sandman that sells a
piece of software they call outrage
I love that a little screaming face
they're outrage is supposed to it does
things like it tells you how to deal
with what people are mad at you and one
of the one this is a screenshot from
from the program they gauge their
critics on two on two axes how much
power do they have and how much passion
do they have and if someone has a lot of
power and a lot of passion well you may
have to defer to them but everyone else
you can you can get rid of in some way
if they have power but not much passion
well deflect them you know just change
the subject they're there their
attention will wander and then you don't
have to do what they want if they have
no power but a lot of passion well then
you can dismiss them oh no no I'm sorry
if they have if they have if they have
no power but passion then you have to
defeat them and if they have neither
power nor passion then you can just
dismiss them so so that's the plan as
these examples illustrate public
relations at least the type of public
relations that that John and I
specialize in criticizing it sees itself
as a methodology for managing an unruly
and hostile public they use terms to
describe what they do such as crisis
management opinion management issue
management and at the same time they
don't really trust the public or respect
its intelligence I think it could just
as reasonably be called anti public
relations so let's get into one of the
most common techniques used to influence
public opinion it's known in the trade
is the third party technique which means
put your words in someone else's mouth
corporations and other people trying to
influence opinion have have realized
that if they if they come out and say
something directly themselves
that's a self-serving message the public
will see through it quite quickly
because it's so obviously self-serving
so what you want to do is put your mouth
please put your words in the mouth of
someone who seems like a an independent
trusted third party preferably a third
party expert of some kind
here's how béarnaise expressed the
technique how can the persuade to reach
those groups that make up the large
public he he can do though he can do so
through their leaders for the individual
looks for guidance to the leaders of the
groups to which he belongs
so you find those leaders do you get
them to say what you want and to that
then you can mold the opinion of
everyone else one of the famous examples
of that from Bernays his career was
known as the torches of freedom brigade
that he organized as part of a 1929
Easter Day parade what happened at the
time smoking at the time was something
that was considered taboo for women it
was considered unlaid unladylike the
president of one of the tobacco
companies American Tobacco went to
Bernays and he said you know we're
losing half our market here how can we
get women to smoke and Bearnaise hired a
psychoanalyst a disciple of Freud to
give him an opinion and the
psychoanalyst told him well first for
for for women the cigarette is the
symbol of the penis and if what you have
to do is convince women that that
smoking cigarettes gives them their own
penis and will will liberate them and in
this opinion that this guy that Brill
rode up he is the phrase for you know
for women tobacco's a cigarettes could
become to come to be seen as torches of
freedom that phrase is the main thing
that the Bernays got out of the session
I think and so he arranged for a group
of New York debutantes to march in the
Easter Day Parade and at the appropriate
moment they they whipped out cigarettes
and started smoking them as an act of
rebellion against the norms of a
male-dominated society
Bernays also arranged to have
photographers from newspapers standing
by to photograph the protest and this
became a topic of instant controversy it
was on the front page of the New York
Times and people began talking about
whether these women had behaved
scandalously
women began demanding to be admitted
into all male smoking clubs and and it
quickly became you know the topic of
advertisements like this one you see
here
an ancient prejudice has been removed
you can now smoke the taboo is broken
you're free this of course then became
the basis for subsequent advertising
campaigns into fairly recent history
like the the Virginia Slims tobacco
brand whose you know whose whole
marketing theme theme was feminism
you've come a long way baby
now you can smoke well as this example
illustrates the third-party technique
where you put your words or even your
cigarettes in someone else's mouth it
does several things one that offers cama
cama flage it hides the the vested
interest that's true sponsor the message
it encourages conformity to a vested
interest while seeming to represent
independence and even dissent and most
importantly I think it replaces factual
discourse with emotional aid and
symbolism so that instead of talking
about the you know something factual or
substantial about things you're you're
talking about how you how people feel or
what these symbols mean here's some
examples of the third party technique
I'll just skim over them during
Microsoft's antitrust case a few years
ago they paid a PR firm Adelman to
actually ghost write letters that were
then published in newspapers around the
country saying that saying that
Microsoft's that the antitrust case was
a misuse of government resources and
should be dropped a number of prominent
econ economists were signatories to a
full-page ad in The New York Times that
was sponsored by the independent
Institute six months later it was
discovered that the independent
Institute
that had been paid to run the ads by
Microsoft boy that's a shock mothers
opposing pollution was a group in in
Australia so this had stuff happen
around the world they campaigned against
plastic milk bottles saying that the
liquid cardboard you know milk cartons
are better for the environment it turns
out that mother's opposing pollution was
a PR front for the manufacturers of the
cardboard milk cartons you can walk into
grocery stores pick up grocery you know
walk now the cereal aisle and you'll see
you know sugar frosted flakes and and
and cereals like that with labels on the
side of them saying that the logo of the
American Heart Association or the
American diabetic Association
what's happened of course is that is
that the the American Heart Association
has been paid some money by by the maker
of the cereal and the the intent that
they're trying to convey with that is
that is that somehow the American Heart
Association has endorsed this cereal as
as good to feed your kids when in fact
nothing is of the type has happened
they've just gotten some money to do it
another example of the third-party
technique it's quite common actually is
ghostwriting for medical journals you
may remember the fen-phen diet drug
disaster it was pulled from the market
after a number of people who took fen
phen were suffered heart valve damage
there were lawsuits and during the
during the during one of the lawsuits a
doctor Richard Atkinson whose name
appeared as the the lead author of one
of the of a study about fen phen that
said it was you know a great thing to be
using it would really help people lose
weight one of the things they found was
correspondence that sent that Atkinson
had written with to the PR firm that was
ghostwriting his study in which he said
let me congratulate you on the great
work of writing perhaps I can get you to
write all my papers for me my only
general comment is that this piece may
make dex fan fermions sound better than
it really is the same doctor when he was
when he was when he was deposed then
they said he said he actually hadn't
known that the PR firm was working for
for the company that made fan fan he
said that kind of makes me a little
uneasy here's another example in the
field of politics there's an
organization that we exposed called
contributions Watch declared itself to
be an independent watchdog organization
the leading authority on money and
politics in the States was supposed to
monitor special interest group activity
and be a resource to journalists about
who's giving money in political
campaigns they wrote a number of studies
thanks to a whistleblower we discovered
that contributions was like itself a
creation of a PR firm secretly funded by
Philip Morris the one of the tobacco
industry's law firms had even written a
script instructing what instructing
people at contributions Watts on what
they could say if so if a reporter were
to call and say who's funding you as a
way to avoid answering the question they
were supposed to say do you have some
question about the accuracy of our
numbers that's the important thing the
numbers speak for themselves
another tobacco industry project called
the white coat project this was a
response this was an attempt to
counteract evidence of health risks from
secondhand cigarette smoke the goal was
to resist and rollback smoking
restrictions to generate the these goals
the plan was to first generate a body of
scientific and technical knowledge the
term white coat in this context refers
to the white lab coats that the doctors
were the problem for the tobacco
industry was they were getting hit by
all these obvious medical research
showing that the smoke cigarette smoke
is bad for the health so I think it's
rather illustrative of what's important
to them that the most important part of
a medical researcher to them is the
white coat that they wear because of
what it symbolizes
Covington and Burling Philip Morris law
firm directly coached the white coat
project act has acted as legal buffer
and they boasted in one of their
memorandums this this gives you a sense
of the scope of this kind of activity
they have created the world's only lien
to learn at scientific society
addressing questions of indoor air
quality it will soon have its own
newsletter in which environmental
tobacco smoke and other environmental
air quality issues will be discussed in
the balanced fashion balance means pro
tobacco to an audience of regulators
scientists building operators etc it
will also have its own scientific
journal published by a major european
publishing house in which indoor air
quality issues will again be addressed
so this is a massive project on which
they spent millions of dollars another
area in which the third party technique
is used in the creation of front groups
there's a project this photograph was
taken by and by a school teacher and a
you know what a huh a trade show exactly
the organization is called Project
Learning tree and they and they you
would think this is a group that's about
preserving trees it's actually funded by
the logging industry and its main
mission is to tell kids that it's okay
to chop down old growth forests here's
another group the American Council on
science and health they've published
books like panic in the pantry where
they say that public concerns about
pesticides pollution and food additives
are just irrational fears here are some
of their funders the American Meat
Institute Amoco Archer Daniels Midland
Burger King coca-cola Coors while you
can read the list shale oil the sugar
Association and Union Carbide rounds out
the list
the Internet is also seen as a tool for
for spin and just as as you know they as
they've engaged in sort of spying I
described at the beginning they also
used the Internet as a tool for
gathering and intelligence about
potential adversaries one PR counselor
said here's how to use the web eavesdrop
all you want learning the attitudes of
specific audiences and the issues most
important to them there are also some
specific web-based front groups here's
one that that was just launched recently
called sunlight scam any guesses about
who this is who who this represents the
makers of tanning booths okay because
there's a concern about about you know
cancer risk from ultraviolet radiation
from baking in a tanning booth so so
what they're saying is that's all a scam
of the dermatologist sir it's a scandal
what these dermatologists are telling
you another one
set up by the same organization which is
basically telling you telling people
that health risks from mercury are all
cooked up and are ridiculous to
my favorite quote from mulder and scully
the truth is out there
from the point of view of the people who
manipulate public opinion however the
truth is a very different thing from
what most of us think it is this modern
scientific era is built on the idea that
the truth is truth is something you can
get at to research and and rational
inquiry according to richard Adelman and
Adelman worldwide one of the world's
larger PR firms in this era of exploding
media technologies there is no truth
except the truth you create for yourself
Marketing is about a perception not
products truth has no bearing on the
issue says someone else so that's a in a
world where that kind of spin is going
on led by people who literally believe
that there is no truth except the truth
that you invent it becomes harder and
harder I think for the public to
separate truth from reality which is why
it becomes possible to lead a nation to
war on the basis of weapons of mass
destruction that did not exist and why
five years later was still fighting that
war to name just one example of the type
of spin that goes on everyday in our
society our solution is imperfect we're
a small organization one thing we
started that will not impress anyone
here in terms of technology at least is
a website called source watch org this
is a wiki that we've been running for a
few years now runs on the same MediaWiki
software as wikipedia and we initially
started this we called it initially
called it disinfo pedia and decided that
name was a little too too colorful
so we renamed source watch and we're
attempting here to collect information
about all these PR firms and the front
groups that they create because one of
the things we've noticed is that when
you expose them the same people shut
down
one operation they created then they
create a new one under a different name
so it becomes harder and harder to keep
track of it so we decided a wiki
platform might be a good way to start
collecting that information we now have
about have about thirty five thousand
articles in here about PR firms
political organizations front groups and
the like and we're always looking for
for help in building that so if anyone
here is looking for a fun programming
project or just wants to do a little bit
of wiki editing in your spare time
please be in touch that's I think my
last slide see yep so I think at this
point of entertain questions and
tomatoes
how do we check the sources for our own
website do you mean for source watts or
for the rest of our work well that's
actually a constant struggle you know
obviously and of course there have been
issues on Wikipedia with Wikipedia
articles being spun by by PR firms or by
companies we have several paid editors
on staff that monitor things our our
editing process is a little more
restrictive than Wikipedia meaning you
you have to fur on Wikipedia you don't
even have to register in order to edit
something we actually require people to
register and you know you have to get a
confirmation email before you can do
your first edit that that that of course
doesn't isn't going to stop someone from
going on using in you know like a yahoo
or other anonymous email account but
whereas we have a smaller pool of
editors than than Wikipedia does so it's
usually possible for us to keep an eye
on new editors and just make sure that
what they're doing is responsible we
also have we try to establish stricter
referencing standards than Wikipedia
generally follows a lot of our articles
on source watch maybe I should go to a
source watch articles so you can see we
have we often have a very long external
links section and and so you can at
least see what the sources are for all
the information but having said all that
I can't guarantee that that everything
on source watch is reliable and accurate
information it is wiki and and we see it
as a collaborative research tool it's
worked pretty well for us overall I
think and I think but but our advice to
people who use our website is you know
check the references
but and but you know maybe if if
information on here something that's
important to you
make sure you verify it and and and and
don't just trust us for it
yeah well it's if if you watch what
they're saying about Iran right now a
lot of the arguments about Iran are very
similar to the arguments that got us
into the war with Iraq right I mean
there are three main arguments in favor
of the the Iraq war one was that said
that Iraq has weapons of mass
destruction so what are they saying
about Iran well they've got a nuclear
program same thing the next thing was it
is that is that the what were the
arguments in favor of the war in Iraq
I'm starting to forget you know another
big one was that will be welcomed as
liberators and I've and I think that
argument was actually mostly made as
support for the idea that we won't be
there very long we will go in we'll be
welcomed as liberators we'll be in and
out in six months regime change
no the other one of course I forgot all
about it
Iraq has ties to terrorism you know that
how could I forget
it's been so long well and and so the
same argument is now Iran is sponsoring
terrorism inside Iraq so we had to go to
the source by going into Iraq now we
have to go to the source by going into
around a lot of these arguments of
course build on the fear coming out of
September 11 and there were enormous
efforts made by the Bush administration
to link Iraq directly to 9/11 we have we
did a book about the build-up to war
called weapons of mass deception and in
which we go through some of that and
it's interesting because Bush never
explicitly said that Iraq was behind
September 11 but he and other people
within the administration made a point
of mentioning September 11 and Saddam
Hussein or Iraq in the same sentence
over and over and over again and by that
sort of repetition and Association the
message got through
to the point that even today according
to opinion surveys nearly half of the
American people believe that Iraq was
somehow involved in sponsoring the
September 11 terrorist attacks you see
something similar happening today in
Iran in which Iran is being made out to
be the sponsor of all that of all the
attacks going on inside Iraq it is which
is really not supported by the evidence
in fact Iran has on several occasions
including the most recent occasion when
when there when when there was the the
violence in Basra Iran actually played a
role as a broker to to to negotiate a
ceasefire between the the government of
Iraq and the Mahdi army so the idea that
era Iran which is located right in that
region wants to see instability that
spills
is then going to spill over into if
they're on borders I think it's largely
being used for the same reason that
during the Vietnam War when the Vietnam
War was not going well you started to
see people within the Nixon
administration saying well we've got to
take the war to the source and go into
Cambodia what happens when they when the
nation gets involved into Quagmire's
they start looking for for quick
solutions and and I think that's
essentially what's happening with some
of this war talk directed at Iran
the question is what what's the future
for green washing green washing is a
term I imagine a lot of people here are
familiar with the term it refers to pr2
aimed at covering up a company's bad
environmental practices okay
sometimes that takes the form of a small
token gesture by a company sometimes it
takes another form a good example would
be the company formally known as British
Petroleum you know now they since
renamed themselves BP and ran
advertising campaigns explaining that
that B P stands for beyond petroleum
over so beyond that you know they did
that at a time when and and and all
their advertisements are aimed at at
selling the idea that you know they're
doing alternative energy projects
they're doing solar energy or this or
that the problem is that the alternative
energy energy projects are still only
about one percent of their of their
business so the 99 percent that's their
core business is apparently the part
that they're beyond you know you know I
don't know how to translate that into
Google terms that that would mean that
your main business I guess is Knowles or
something like that that's Walmart has
done something similar they just
recently announced that they're going to
use environment environmentally friendly
light bulbs and all of their stores and
they're going to be selling those more
prominently that's a very tiny part of
Walmart's business and what they hope to
get from that is a big reputation the
problem with all that that sort of thing
is that these token gestures give people
a sense that more progress is being made
with regard to environmental problems
than is actually being made and and and
people get the idea that if I do
something minor with my life like like
recycle garb or recycle shopping bags
then bigger changes are not needed I I
think what really happens with green
washing is that it tends to be
successful until the problems that it's
trying to paper over become a so acute
that it can't be papered over anymore
and the big area where I'm personally
concerned that that's likely to cause
major problems is global warming because
we've gone to a point where we're
nearing a crisis point with with that
and yet we're still seeing mostly token
gestures and and even attempts at denial
there's a front group set up by the by
this I think was the coal industry
called the greening Earth Society and
their argument is that actually
greenhouse gases are good for the
environment because all that carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere just just
encourages more plant growth so
so you're really depressing me and
depressing yeah depressing me and you
know I see this this sort wasp odd org
site and I think of that and see now you
don't have to see it anymore yeah it's
gone big media second over so like you
know the this is like preaching to the
choir how many people know about this
website versus getting 90 percent or
ninety plus percent of their it was from
Fox News and I I don't I wish I could
see an answer to this beyond well I
don't know I what what do you see
that's a good question they could
everyone heard the question yeah he said
I'm really depressing him and and source
watch doesn't get the kind of viewership
that for example Fox News gets and how
many people are getting this kind of
information aren't we just preaching to
the choir here I don't know I mean we're
doing what we can with the resources we
have I know this is the bay area so
maybe I am preaching to the choir but
Google is Google does get a lot of
mindshare and if you guys would just put
up a link to source watch on every
Google search result problem solved well
we're not supposed to talk about our
proprietary truth truth measuring page
ranking software I mean I think the
internet does offer I mean it's a lot of
promises as a new technology through
which people get their information I
also think that some of the hype about
about the internet changing everything
is still largely unfulfilled hype
hopefully it will be fulfilled more and
more it is changing the way politicians
organize their campaigns it's changing
the way people fundraise it's changing
the way we do our work we used to
publish the print newsletter we reach a
lot more people now than we used to
reach because we had we have a website
and we've been able to engage other
people and collaborating in our research
in ways that we couldn't do before
so hopefully that's you know these
trends are going to accelerate and
continue and that's that's the that's
one basis for optimism so you know don't
slit your wrists just yet
yeah so 50 years back TV you are
supposed to be educational and
eventually only the rich people can
afford that what do you call the
bandwidth do you thing Internet good a
same way that only it'll be auctioned
off their bandwidth and only big
companies that have bandwidth on
internet like the net neutrality act net
neutrality is the question is well the
future of the internet be something
where big companies we control all the
bandwidth basically I think that's in
play that that could be the future of
the internet would be a pretty dark
future compared to what we currently see
emerging in but there is a history of
that sort of thing happening in the past
back when radio first emerged as a
technology it was seen as something that
was going to be was going to popularize
access to the means of communication
everybody would have access to the radio
and be able to broadcast and instead
what we got was were radio stations
around the around the country
broadcasting you know rush limbaugh and
Michael Savage and the you know and and
advertisements and and there are
alternative radio stations but there's a
very small part of the mix and
advertising has taken it over and so it
is possible to envision a future in
which the internet becomes just like
television and radio all over again only
with a few interactive features I hope
that's not the way it goes
there's there's some of the micro did
you so let's say I'm a I'm a good
company and I'm trying to do something
good I'm trying to sell product say
solar panels I'm sorry to hear the last
part of that let's say I'm trying to
sell a product I'm a company and I'm
trying to sell the products a solar
panels and let's say it is a good
product but people won't listen to me
because they're not rational they are
emotional so I I start a marketing
campaign and I get I talk to people's
emotions and so that kind of that kind
of that doesn't spin in itself and it
might not be what I'm talking about so
you're not it might not be exactly what
my product is but it starts selling more
so my question is how do you know at
which point you cross from ethical into
unethical in your opinion the question
is at what point do you cross over from
ethical into unethical marketing or
messaging given that people are
sometimes irrational or and emotional I
would say you know first of all the fact
that people are emotional doesn't mean
they're irrational the two are not polar
opposites on Star Trek
you know you had mr. Spock who who is
completely rational and not emotional
but I think the idea that emotions and
rationality are completely separate is
is not it's not a real model of the way
rationality itself works it's it's it's
appropriate for people to be emotional
and it doesn't mean we're crazy
but having said that in terms of what it
the boundary lines for ethical versus
unethical communications one thing one
reason I always stress the third party
technique when I'm talking about this is
that the third party technique is aimed
at concealing something from the
audience you're trying to communicate to
you're concealing the identity of the to
sponsor the message if there's an
element of concealment in your messaging
strategy that's a pretty good clue that
it's unethical messaging I don't think
it's not ethical to appeal to people's
emotions I do think it's only unethical
to conceal from the
what what your what your true message is
or who it is that's sponsoring it or
other things if you conceal the fact
that that your that your solar panels
leach arsenic into the groundwater when
you're manufacturing them then that
would be unethical and then the other
part of it that's an essential part of
messaging is you can't separate the
message from from the product that it's
selling I don't I don't think there is
an ethical way to sell cigarettes for
example but there is an ethical way to
sell other products if it's a product
that genuinely benefits the public a lot
of companies find themselves somewhere
in a gray area whether they're doing
some good and some harm and their
messaging strategies are also a mixed
bag in terms of ethics take the
pharmaceutical industry for example they
actually do some good for people but
they also do some bad so so you find
examples of good messaging and bad
messaging coming from the industry I am
far from being depressed by what you
have to say it's really heartening to
see that you guys are out here and still
doing the good work what what occurred
to me when I was looking at you and
thinking about you know what your
natural affinity groups would be would
be somebody like do you have
relationships with the skeptic society
which is doing a really remarkable job
of you know getting their message out it
seems to me that you have a lot of
natural allies that you know you could
use to build awareness of your work with
well the skeptic Society I've heard of
them and I think I've been to their
website a few times but we don't have
any kind of formal relationship with
them we do work with a number of
organizations for example the the
sunlight foundation based in in
Washington DC is a nonprofit
organization that promotes transparency
in government and we've worked with them
on a project within source Watts called
Congress pedia which is wiki based
profiles of every member of Congress
where you can find their funding
information we've done some work with
the Legacy Foundation that's the
foundation set up with money from the
the tobacco settlement and we've added
several thousand articles to source
watch specifically about people and
organizations profile you know that are
mentioned in the tobacco industry's
internal documents and we're trying to
build a community around researching
those documents so we do do certainly
are interested in in partnering with
other organizations
a15 any attempts for example for
campaigning for legislation to make this
funny technique
have there been efforts to campaign for
legislation to make the third party
technique illegal norther haven't and
I'm not sure how you could write
legislation that would would outlaw it
meet one of the problems with public
relations as an industry is that the
techniques that they use are mostly the
techniques that were provided for us by
the very act of establishing and
democracy in this country you know
freedom of speech and expression and I'm
personally very nervous about the idea
of trying to restrict freedom of speech
in some way that might might impinge
other types of speech you know I believe
that the PR tactics that I've described
do harm to society but I would not want
to to protect society against that harm
by by doing something that would be a
greater harm to democracy I which is why
our focus has primarily been on exposing
and publicizing deceptive practices the
philosopher Aristotle wrote a book that
rhetoric and and he was sort of dealing
with a similar problem to what we're
dealing with you know he argued in in
the rhetoric that that the rhetoric the
power that the techniques of persuasion
could be used to lead people to make bad
choices to manipulate people and his
solution was that what you need to do to
prevent that from happening is to make
sure that people that the general public
is informed about rhetoric itself that
they they understand the techniques of
rhetoric so they can see it and use it
and see through it and that's to me the
best solution still today to the problem
of the the abuse of techniques of
persuasion if people can recognize those
techniques and see through them then
then I think that it becomes less of a
problem
the question was how does he know that
what we're saying isn't just spin as
well well the absolute proof of that is
that we've written a book called trust
us we're experts and I can assure you we
would not have been allowed to publish
that book if we were not experts I I
think frankly you should take what I say
with a grain of salt - I mean I'm a
human being I'm prone to error you
shouldn't take anything I say at face
value you can google my name and find
people saying critical things about me
you you know that's I I think I'm doing
my best to be honest and candid with
with people but but but you know I have
my influences and ideas I and I I don't
think that I'm above being spun there
are actually a couple times when I found
out after the fact that something we've
published in PR watch was with someone
spinning us and then we always published
a clarification after the fact
but I but the answers were not foolproof
either for that matter I don't think
humanity has ever been particularly
immune to error I mean when do you go
back in history and find a moment when
everyone understood things really well
you know if you if you go back a hundred
years ago people believed in phlogiston
right which is you know and eat and you
know and you know people used to think
that that there are these things called
humors that that that were these
substances that controlled our health
you know we've gotten a little better at
understanding the world and I think
scientific knowledge has advanced
somewhat but I still think there's a lot
of confusion and error and
so I don't claim to be an immune to
error myself so we mentioned we
discussed a couple of the dire
situations for what the internet holds
for us in the future
in the internet right now how do you see
the balance between PR firms exploiting
the Internet to influence people and the
influences or the efforts to counter
that where does the balance sit on the
internet right now as you see it the
balance in the internet you know PR
firms are of two minds about the
Internet there there's has been a lot of
sort of agonized worrying by PR firm
saying things like we're being trumped
we can't control the message anymore
there are all these different channels
you know back in the old days when they
want to influence public opinion there
were three TV networks and a couple of
major newspapers like the New York Times
and if they if they got those everything
else everything else kind of followed
now it's not just the internet but cable
television and and you know people are
texting and and you know there are a lot
more channels of information and and PR
firms are saying it's it's become much
harder for us to control the message the
way we used to and I'll but for them
that's kind of not all bad because for
one thing that means more billable hours
we you know that more work for us yay
the other thing that it means is that
they've got more tools you know they
talk about using the internet to just to
sort of surveil the landscape to know
what what things are being said about a
company before it becomes a big crisis
for a company they're developing new
techniques all the time
just as they used to set up front groups
you know the real world now they're
entirely web-based front groups there
was a campaign a little while ago by a
manufacturer of handbags - supposedly
educate the public about the
about about about how you shouldn't buy
counterfeit handbags so they actually
got a bunch of college students to to
create a fictional blogger that they
named her Heidi see I didn't seek right
as a joke and and they built a whole
campaign around this this girl talking
about how she was breaking up with her
boyfriend and then after a while the
girl says Oh
someone stole my handbag or i lost my
handbag and and then then and it was
given to me by this ex-boyfriend and I
really look and I really treasure it and
they did a whole campaign on campus to
get the handbag back and and then it
turned out that someone brought back a
handbag and she paid her award for it
but it was a counterfeit handbag and
then she started blogging about how bad
counterfeit handbags were and and she'd
done some research and it turns out that
a lot of people who make counterfeit
handbags actually the money is going to
terrorists you know you know do a Google
search for Heidi see and you'll see all
this stuff you know so you know so there
are you know and it was all done on the
internet using blogging and all that
kind of stuff
so there are sort of no and for that
matter Walmart did I think they set up a
website called working families for
Walmart that was supposed to be just
working family talking about how great
Walmart is so so they're also seeing
that the Internet is a place where they
can do new things
companies like Technorati have formed a
partnership
patek Technorati in particulars formed a
partnership with Adelman one of the
world's largest PR firms where they're
getting some money from Adelman to help
them build out Technorati in multiple
languages and in exchange Adelman gets a
bunch of their data so that they can
anticipate criticisms and threats and
head them off early on so i'd say it's
very much a mixed bag right now
the internet you know hasn't changed the
world at least in terms of PR people
being able to operate in it but it's
it's changing the way they work and well
I see that people are sending out so
maybe we should declare victory and go
invade a country or something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
