suggested this would have been a more
attended talk had we called it engineers
gone wild but it was after the fact so
so here we are so what I want to cover
today is I want to cover practical
survival for people who aren't seasoned
wilderness people if you're a seasoned
wilderness person I guarantee you'll
walk away with several things you didn't
know today I think there's a lot of
focus on the survival kits that exist
are in the area of oh you know here's
how to make a fishing line and blah blah
blah and the reality is that if you're
lost and somebody knows you're lost if
there are people looking for you and
that search and rescue so actually what
I want to do is I want to present this
from a perspective of how do you sustain
yourself and how do you make it easier
for us to find you if in fact you go
someplace and you haven't told somebody
where you're going and you haven't told
them when you're going to be back some
of this may not apply so so the first
thing is dressing in the wilderness and
we say in search and rescue all the time
cotton kills and draws a lot of and
there was one right there her raised
eyebrow like cotton kills how can that
be well what you should wear in the
wilderness is 100% non natural fibers or
wool cotton is really the worst possible
thing you can wear when it gets wet it
stays wet and holds that moisture right
against your skin and certainly in this
area the thing you'll be fighting the
most to sustain yourself is keeping your
core temperature up so if you actually
are wearing cotton and it's gotten wet
you might you'd be better off naked
don't recommend that approach but you'd
be better off naked so so first of all
we tend to wear in our wilderness kits
we tend to wear mix Panama's call the
BTU stands for battle dress uniform but
it's not camouflage but it's a it's half
cotton half polyester it's kind of a
blend it's got all this special anti rip
stuff in it and then on the top we wear
completely
polyester shirts because obviously this
is where your core temperature is
core temperature I should actually
define is really not your core people
think this is your core and you got to
keep this warm
it's really this there's really three
organs that you care about in this
context there is your your heart your
lungs and your brain and when those
three you know when they start running
we may start having troubles
everybody starts having troubles so so
you'll often see people talk about if
your feet are cold put on a better hat
because this is where you lose most your
heat from so we'll go into that a little
bit more so we'd like you to we're in
the wilderness looks like this because
when we're trying to find you we want to
know where you are and you know this
might be a you know batteries not
included but actually we tend to wear
ourselves tend to wear things like this
long sleeves that they don't have that
and long sleeve otherwise that would
have shown you that one but we tend to
wear this because the the reality is
when you need to stay warm you need to
stay warm so you need long sleeves we
any time we're doing search searches
they're always where there's more poison
oak than you can ever imagine so if you
want to know how to avoid poison oak
come talk to me later
so and choosing bright colors is really
great it actually brings up an
interesting conflict which is that if
you choose colors that happen to be
similar to the colors of pollinating
flowers you will attract bees so be
aware
I don't know that this color is found in
nature so you may be okay with this so
we do sometimes things called PCR which
is a funny phrase it stands for
preventative search-and-rescue and the
idea behind PCR is a small amount of
education can go a long way to having
people just not get lost so I'm gonna
start with how not to get lost which
sounds really obvious but there are some
things that you don't realize until
you've actually experienced it first of
all things look different
when you left on your walk and it was
the Sun was just coming up things look a
lot different when the sun's going down
so the perspective of the Sun is going
to change the appearance of the terrain
if you're on a trail and I think some of
you probably had the experience to be
walking along on a trail and and you'll
get to the end or you'll decide that you
know you're only going to spend three
hours and it's been an hour and a half's
you're going to turn on and go back you
go back and suddenly you realize there's
a fork in the trail and it's like where
did that come from
I didn't see that fork coming out well
those are the kinds of things that catch
people because then they're really sure
they know which of the two forks it is
and I think you'd be surprised that it's
less than 50% they get the right answer
so the end so the solution is actually a
simple one which is anytime you have a
terrain change so if you're walking
along and then suddenly you're you know
you're kind of going uphill and then
suddenly you flatten out or you're
walking along and suddenly you start to
dip or you're walking along and it
starts to bank to the left or you're
walking along and starts to banku the
right stop turn around and see what it
looks like going the other direction
that is probably the most important
thing if if you don't learn anything
today that's the most important thing
well next to telling people where you're
going and when you'll be back it's
surprising how many people actually
don't realize their loss because they're
sure they know their way back and then
by the time they realize they're lost
it's starting to get dark and then it's
a much much more dangerous situation not
only because of the cold but because
they're not equipped to actually deal
with the fact that it's going to be dark
and they're going to be trying to
sustain themselves so it's often better
to figure out that you're lost and start
acting within two hours from sundown
rough way to check for two hours is you
hold a hand at a distance and two hands
is two hours
kind of a rough a rough way to do it I
suppose if you're in Alaska in summer
that can be your planner no really big
hand maybe so let me look at the my
ordering here
okay so once lost so I want to cover I
want to cover signaling and I'm using
somebody's to get here but I want to
cover signaling and I want to cover it
from a couple of different perspectives
and it wasn't the one I wanted I didn't
go shopping just before the talk started
I swear
so signaling with a mirror is one of the
most effective ways to signal in the
daytime okay and and when the sun
shining signaling with a mirror can
actually get a signal twenty to thirty
miles easily it's not uncommon at all
for people to see a twenty to thirty
four mile signal anybody have any idea
what the longest known rescue was
initiated with a signal mirror just
anyone it's 105 miles those are somewhat
ideal circumstances probably a Coast
Guard Coast Guard makes an especially
you know large and glass flat etc etc
nothing in nature is flat so if
something is reflecting it's man-made
and people know that so before you can
learn how to signal with a mirror first
of all you have to figure out who you're
signaling to and that may be aircraft
that may be hikers that may just be that
you're signaling to an area that you
believe to be inhabited either you know
there's power lines that you can see in
the distance that are there or whatever
because you may in fact not be mobile
you may have hurt yourself and you need
to signal so the first thing is figure
out who you want to signal the second
thing is if you're gonna signal
effectively you need to know if you're
right eyed or left eyed right or left
eyed the longer version of that is right
eye dominant or left eye dominant so I
bet most of you don't know if you're a
hunter and you're firing a weapon you
probably know intuitively whether you're
right or left eyed because if you're
right handed and left eyed you're going
to be a terrible shot using traditional
position so the way you can tell is
put your hands together and make an
opening hold it up pick an object that's
somewhere in the distance whatever and
if you think you're right i IE if you're
right-handed close your left eye and if
the object does not jump out of way then
the eye that still open is your dominant
eye
if you switch you'll suddenly realize
that when you're looking just through
your non-dominant eye the thing just
jumps completely out of the way I think
everybody everybody kind of get that
make sense you got it or are you
ambidextrous okay so okay so I'm I'm if
you're right-handed you're generally
right eyed if you're left-handed you're
generally left eyed if you're actually
one of the crossover positions excuse me
you'll see hunters who are this who are
right hand and left eyed if they look
this way they're actually not looking
with their dominant eye and they're not
gonna hit anything
so they actually to lean across the
barrel and look down with their other
eye so if you ever see somebody doing
that you'll know that there there's
probably a term for that I don't know
what it is okay so if we had a simulated
son here no no chance um so here's the
deal I'm right handed and right eyed so
I'm gonna put this that's okay I think
people get that get that get the drift
so I'm right handed and right eyed so
I'm gonna put the mirror right up next
to mine as close as I can and I'm gonna
make what you would think of as a rear
sight okay and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna I'm gonna close my my non-dominant
eye I'm gonna find the thing that I want
to signal and as I make this as I align
the Sun I will actually see the Sun that
the flash across my fingers and this is
how you aim and though it starts out
little here and ends up being pretty
large over there so the so this
mechanism is quite successful and one of
the things you want to do once you kind
of get it going is you want to do
patterns of three three is actually the
International distress symbol three of
NT anything is the International
distress symbol I'm going to segue that
into this little bit of a tangent a
segue anybody know what SOS stands for
nothing so SOS they wanted to basically
come up with a signal that was three
threes right
and so they na and with Morse code
there's that dashes and dot's so then
they said okay we want these three
threes to be in the smallest space
possible so that means three dots three
dashes because they're longer and three
dots Anders and the idea there is that
anybody who really doesn't know anything
about Morse code is going to recognize
that pattern and somebody later said
well actually if you divide that into
three pieces the first one would be an S
the second one's an O and the third one
is an ass but it's actually not done
with spaces so if you're into Morse code
you won't actually ever hear that space
between SOS is just was some kind of
reverse engineered you know acronym that
came up so so this is actually a really
really good way to communicate to
somebody where you are in the daytime in
the nighttime and and this was this was
something I learned not too long ago
from actually a one of our Special
Forces friends so I love this one this
is let's grab a different one these are
chemical light sticks chemical light
sticks are really wonderful for for this
application this says it expired five of
95 okay so I'm gonna prove to you that
it hasn't expired and I don't know why
they have such aggressive expiration
dates on it but if you're frugally
minded you know they they dump these
things when they get closer to
expiration data and as you can see
twelve years later it still works so so
really embarrassing if it doesn't work
so I am gonna steal something here it's
almost the problem having too many toys
in Freneau you can't decide which one
you want to show okay so by the way does
a how many of you have trouble with your
cordage that it gets tangled this is the
way to go I don't know what this is
called it's probably knitting by some
people standards but it's a really
really incredible first thing I do
whenever I get cordage is immediately
weave it up like that and
never never gets tangled so okay so what
that is out that's call I never really
knew it was called I just know what to
do know how to do it so yeah absolutely
so in fact this this case you can do it
a single or double so in the case of a
double alright and what's it's just
wonderful all I can say is it's just
wonderful and doesn't take long to do so
you know I don't actually have to undo
the whole thing I just started doing it
was fun
so when signaling during the night you
want to be seen you may want to be seen
by aircraft overhead or you may in fact
want to be seen by somebody who is
actually at a pier level with you or
even potentially below you
this actually is quite bright and it has
a nick know the human eye tends to
notice things which are perfect perfect
circles perfectly straight lines they
don't exist in nature right so this
apparently the Special Forces guys
really elongate this thing like the you
know ten feet or something and kilos can
actually see them quite nicely some of
us like to live dangerously so um and
then what's really nice is that you can
make a signal this will also they have
different hours and they have different
brightnesses so for signaling they have
some that only lasts two hours but are
unbelievably bright they make smaller
ones longer ones these chemical light
sticks are your friend and they have a
very long shelf life as you can see so I
will get into hypothermia a little bit
or more than a little bit I'm just sort
of going with the the prop oriented
things a little bit first here so that's
just called Daisy J now I know I know
what that's called
okay the part of what prompted me to
sort of propose this talk was the family
that got lost the Kim family right and
in some of the things I did were you
know in our in our search and rescue
community you can imagine the kinds of
conversations that are happening and one
of the things that he did was he left
but he didn't pick a particular
direction
and he didn't stick on that direction
and he didn't mark where he had actually
been so I thought I was gonna be able to
buy more of these today to show off this
is called flagging tape I actually tell
you the truth I forget what community
uses are Burris maybe I'm not sure is
that what it is okay
okay and this is the friendly kind of
biodegrades in the Sun after a few days
few few weeks few once whatever this is
actually this is really good stuff but
this is kind of a key size right I mean
you don't want to have this in your
survival kit so what we do what we do
with our friend duct tape is the same
thing will actually do with this so what
we do with duct tape and duct tape is
your friend and your soryo kit this is
going to be one of the most important
things in your kit believe or not well
you know you have a big roll of duct
tape which is you know go to Costco and
you can't walk out with more than seven
of these okay we wind off onto something
small and you know you only need maybe
20 25 feet or something what I did here
was I took some post-it notes thank you
who wrapped it on a pencil round it off
is that considered fair use or you know
reasonable I don't know and and so it's
literally just kind of a soft cord
Center but what's really nice is it's
very small so we do the same thing with
this we wind off you know few feet of
this and the idea is every 100 meters
you tear off something and tie it so
that if somebody's following you
they're just every they're going to know
that you're gonna do it every hundred
meters right so you can do that by
counting steps I tend to just count left
steps so and you know what what is it
the turn remember what it is it's uh
it's like I think I think I'm feeling
yeah I'm trying to member if I was like
at 55 try remember the numbers no it was
like 55 or something I forget but point
is it's sometime when you're near a
football field just kind of pace out and
you'll know kind of how far that is
and then you just literally tie this
kind of stuff off and it doesn't take
much and it's pretty bright I really
want them to make it in this color and
communicating where you've been and
communicating where you're going is
really important so the other thing is
if you're in a place in this is
in the in the in the winter but you want
to communicate where you're going or
where you can't release where you think
you're going the directionality so again
nature does not have anything it's
perfect so take a row of something logs
rocks anything and make a straight line
if you make a straight line aircraft
flying over will see it people on foot
if there have any altitude at all will
see it
deuce make something that's perfect if
you want to get the attention because
you're actually in trouble go with
something like a triangle equilateral
triangle that's three of something and
it's a perfect shape okay so so and
these things don't take a lot of effort
in many cases you can you know if you
can find something to build this out of
you can communicate that you know where
you are and what you're doing okay
okay I'm gonna jump I'm gonna jump
around a little bit here so anybody have
any ideas what they do at refugee camps
for for purifying water they have you
know a few thousand people suddenly show
up and they can't give them all and
purifiers anybody have any any idea
pretty close I think I told you this the
other day didn't I and you still got it
wrong
um they literally stopped to a pool
supply store
on the way and they buy 50-pound bags
not this size this is the small one by
the way 50-pound bags of chlorine and
50-pound bags of alum now I've used
chlorine for years and alum is something
new I've never tried this before alum is
a coagulant
who is that to tell me thank you I was
like it makes things stick together and
sink to the bottom so what they do is
they basically take some amount of water
chlorinate it then once they've killed
off everything they put the alum in that
causes things to coagulate settle to the
bottom if your ideally you're in direct
sunlight you give it a couple hours for
the coagulant to dissipate you can give
it up to a couple of days for the
chlorine to dissipate chlorine will if
left uncovered will dissipate so what
you've killed off you know you won't
have to if you're willing to wait a
little while you won't have to drink
water that smells like or tastes like
chlorine what's nice about this is it's
uh you put one of these in your kit oh
that's strong people will never sit in
the front next time will they
you put these in your kit and I bought
and I want everybody to grab one on the
way home um I actually bought like
little tiny Ziploc bags right can you
smell it is it that bad okay I'll put it
away you guys get the idea the size here
this will actually purify about a
thousand gallons so just think about the
space cost
of that versus filter they have to like
you know make sure doesn't get clogged
damp - blah blah blah that is bang for
the buck the best way to go in terms of
how to purify water so then you say okay
great now I've got I've got water
purification mechanism I'm sure there's
like a tricky way to open this but but
you know you need you need something to
actually collect water in so this goes
in your kit this is a very useful thing
that's in your kit because you can make
any kind of shape out of it you're
trying to collect water from an unusual
location if you have a fixed shape item
it's sometimes hard to get the opening
of your fixed shape item in the
appropriate place to catch water be it
water that's dripping or whatever it
also can be used for cooking so again
what you put in your kit is something we
we can buy in bulk why I'm not selling
kits
I'm not telling kids at all I my theory
here is that if kits aren't cheap and if
they aren't small people won't carry
them if they don't carry them if they
don't help them so one of my goals here
is to actually make the kits so small
that they will fit it's a it's a
two-part kit and each part will fit in
your pocket so the and this is kind of
the size I'm shooting for this is the
size that I'm shooting for basically
kind of two things of this size I think
these are like back-to-school you know
like you put your erasers in here
rubbers to some of you so speaking of
that these aren't made for what we're
going to use them for
but they are tough they're made for a
rough environment so make sure you get
the kind without I need the extra
goodies okay these are a great compact
way to carry water once you've collected
it you can put it in here and carry it
and according to the guy at the pool
store this is not so caustic that it
will eat through this you know it will
take a couple of weeks 42 it you should
be home within a couple of weeks so we
like to actually pick things in our
search and rescue kit or in our survival
kit that are multi-purpose okay so let's
talk a little bit about heat retaining
and yeah I can't then so I'm gonna have
you just so I'm open this up and get
into the heat retaining position which
is your you're trying to lower you're
trying to reduce your surface area so
you I don't have to call it fetal
position but when you're down and you
basically the only part of your body
that's touching is your boots your are
wearing boots in the wilderness right
folks
okay now mind you his hands are warm
okay if you wait until your hands are
really cold your space blankets are not
gonna be your friend you are gonna spend
a long time unwinding your space
blankets so these are like you know you
you didn't leave so you know there you
are
what's that by cowering here yeah now
you how you just you know over your head
right on and then you get down into this
yep and so the idea here is that you're
actually lowering your total profile
you're actually these are wind resistant
these reflect your heat back they're
unbelievably light and get a further
back they're gonna get better arm Oh
over the fence and also this has a
reflective side now you should actually
keep the reflective side in
in fact if you have craft or somebody
coming by you can flip this around this
is not something found in nature so this
also draws attention to yourself
thank you and if any of you have
actually experienced space blankets
there is now a new generation not the
ones I threw out are actually ones I had
in my stock but these are these are new
generations we can hand this around if
people are engine it's a it doesn't
crinkle as much it's a it feels a little
more plastic little more it's a little
more durable so it's practical to
actually make shelters out of that so
little it was a little harder with the
pure my lie aren't treated ones because
they were really noisy and really once
they start to rip they you know they
really go so so what I what I actually
intended to buy but couldn't find them
in short order
is this is a scalpel blade and a scalpel
blade is one of the most important tools
in a survival kit is a knife if you know
how to use it and in fact if I can only
take one tool into the wilderness and
and use it to survive it would be a
knife for this kit I wanted to make the
kit so small that you would carry it so
in fact just carrying a blade means that
you can fix it to a handle if you need
to and in many cases you're trying to do
something fine enough that you maybe you
don't even need a handle so what I
brought were exacto blades you know this
uh this didn't seem like there was that
much stuff in it when I started but so I
actually because they're sharp I put
them in a you know special container if
you see me going out out you'll know
what happened so okay they are here and
you'll have to just trust me on that on
your way out I want people to come by
and you know pick up a little plastic
bag pick up their chlorine you know
basically you're gonna be able to make a
kit on your way out of here and I had I
asked REI if they would give me a bunch
of bags when I was there I mean I wasn't
there just before I started to talk but
if I were they gave me a bunch of bags
and and so you can actually make kits on
your way out if I had more time I would
have made them beforehand but instead
you'll get
to be hands-on so the answer to your
question is you use one of these exacto
knife blades and you essentially just
scrape in a very small amount right and
the point is is that if you put in too
much one you won't be able to drink it
because it would just it will really be
truly repulsive iodine has a danger
because iodine doesn't have much of
flavor and if you overdo iodine you can
shut down your I always forget which one
kidney live liver kidney which one is it
one of those organs one of the things
you need and so-and-so I don't like
these iodine because if you overdo it
you don't know it until it's too late
and with the alum I actually don't know
this is a bit of an experiment for me
here as well so so will you know will
will read the instructions and see what
it says
so I'm a little bit old-school in this
stuff so I don't even know if you can go
to a pool store and get bromine and you
can't okay because I actually the the
reason I like this stuff is that it's
it's it's a stable and they've actually
put stabilizers in here so these things
have a shelf life of I don't know five
years or something in the older days
chlorine they didn't have a stabilized
then if it was in powder if it was in
this tablet form it would only be good
for a few months before it would start
to to go bad or whatever chlorine does
when it stops doing what it's supposed
to do so so in that case the so in that
case I don't I don't really know if
bromine is better or not but I know that
if you go to like REI or whatever you
buy all these like individual little you
know tablets now you're in this position
where I've got this tablet and how much
water should I put it in or do I break
the tablet or not it's better to start
with something big and then just kind of
shave off what you need that thing will
last you you know many years so are we
doing on time because you have any of
you here oh so we're halfway okay okay
so finding water I talk to you about
purifying water how about finding it
probably should have done it in the
other order here
so there's several ways to find water
and one of the best ways is to actually
get up early and get take a bandana and
actually go collect it off things which
I like to do that's a very very
convenient way to go about it also if
you get up and think and it's frozen its
water right so that's another way is to
find you know the nice thing about it is
that if it freezes you know only kind of
theoretically h2o freezes so some of the
things that might have settled about it
may not be part of what freezes
depending on the temperature inside so
so another thing is to go grab the ice
that's out there collect it
don't pop ice in your mouth people
people think that when they're in the
wilderness and they find snow that they
need water they just you know pop it in
there if you can melt it first because
it takes a lot of calories for your body
to deal with the fact that you've just
put all this cold water in your mouth or
cold ice in your mouth and and now you
have to replace those calories with with
food and that's probably something that
you're having
our time with at that point in time so
people sometimes call it the rule of
three sometimes I don't really think
it's trees is more like fours you can
last for minutes without air you can
last for days without water he last for
weeks without food so if you realize
four days versus four weeks food is not
your most important priority and if you
ever get a survival kit from somebody
and it has you know sugar or any food
type inside of it take it out the number
of people who've been accosted by bears
because the survival kit they have they
didn't know actually had you know sugar
in it thank God sugars gonna save my
life you know bears bears have such good
sense that they can actually smell the
sweetener in toothpaste and you know so
if you decide you want to brush your
teeth in the wild take baking soda with
you don't take anything it has a
sweetener in it you'd be surprised how
many things sweetener finds its way into
so except for like that tom's of Maine
that stuff not not very sweet at all
so yeah sure and by the way you're free
to interrupt me just as long as you
remember where I was
there are different kinds of survival
kits absolutely strong in some
situations you know epic food is a good
thing are there better foods that don't
have a sweet liqueur
is a very stable change it that you
stick it somewhere you know day out
anything there so we so part of the
reason why I sort of didn't want to
include food besides the bear aspect is
that we have so many really good you
know energy bars and things like that
that you know are sealed and are dry and
you know plug alone they'll last forever
and they have really good carb content
stuff I think that for most people when
they get into a panic situation they're
gonna burn more glycogen and they're
gonna need more glycogen because that's
what your brain essentially requires as
glycogen you if you run out of glycogen
you know if you're working out and you
just run out of sugar you pass out right
you'll never run out of fat so so having
hard candy in your having heart candy
available is a really good thing to have
in a kit if you know I tend to think of
them as you have food and then you have
your survival kit and if you happen to
carom at the same time that's your
choice but you should know which is food
and which isn't food so this actually
brings up the sort of psychology of
being lost your biggest enemy when
you're lost is your own mind apparently
human beings are the only animals that
can like scare themselves the way we can
scare ourselves we you know we
intellectualize about what could happen
what could happen well it could happen
so the the common knowledge a common
wisdom here is that you stay busy right
you always do something even if it's
wrong you always do something that makes
you feel like you're actually doing
something to change this at your
situation the military has a great
phrase they say do something even if
it's wrong not to wrong but even if it's
wrong because if you do something that's
wrong you can correct from it if you
never make a decision you have what's
called analysis paralysis and you go
nowhere and it feeds on itself so be
very active in your own recovery be very
active in thinking about what your
options might be and also don't Bank
ever on one option you know the what is
it all your eggs in one basket right you
know if you signaled and you think
somebody saw you with your signal mirror
don't just use that right use other
mechanisms make sure you don't cover all
your bases but stay busy
and also we'll cover shelters in a
little bit out so is there a board I can
write on here yeah there is okay so when
you build a shelter and when you end up
spending the night in the wilderness and
maybe you can comment on this and by the
way please join me if you have a
different experience if you're in a
survival situation and you're not really
well prayed don't expect to sleep at
night all right
expect to survive and make it to morning
but don't really expect to be getting
comfortable enough to sleep
people have to find that night time is
where their head plays with them and
it's two o'clock in the morning 3
o'clock in the morning you've been cold
for a while your head is just playing
with you playing with you and that's the
toughest time of your whole of your
whole survival experience and then as
the Sun comes up just like oh it's a new
day right you in fact you know you start
to become more you know more optimistic
about what can happen and you know or
the Sun lights hitting your eyes and
you're getting whatever the drug is that
gets released in the brain when light
hits your eyes and and so just think
about the nights as just surviving them
and during the days you'll be warm you
know probably have some time on your
hands so you'll be able to sleep so
don't worry yourself sick by the fact
that you're not really sleeping at night
and and there are some people who say
you shouldn't sleep at night because
sometimes people fall asleep and never
wake up
so so but again it's the attitude is
everything the guy who
yeah-ha-ha
rewind so the gentleman who you know cut
off his own arm because he had to get
away from the boulder that had crushed
his arm and everything so several Sami
scientific studies came out afterwards
to sort of determine what the
personality is of a survival what's a
person who has a good survival
personality and again it was sort of
Sami scientific but but it was
interesting and the the basic premise
was that you have a broad spectrum of
capable capabilities like the person
who's unbelievably passionate passionate
but also really can be really logical
and really you know so if you're if you
have sort of traits that are on opposite
ends of each other
then they sort of say that you have a
wider range of things to draw on so I'm
just gonna say bipolar but that's a
whole different thing but you know you
some access if you're on both ends of
that spectrum of that axis that's
considered to be a really good survival
trait so so don't hold it against us
well part of the reason I got into
search-and-rescue and everything else
was simply that I want more people to
enjoy the outdoors and I want them to
have less worries that if things go awry
that they're really on their own because
the people who are in in
search-and-rescue this is all a
volunteer thing many you know
ex-military and it's really a you know
can be a pretty impressive group of
people this is all totally volunteer
this is their passion if you're into if
you're into search-and-rescue you train
a lot you know if you ever see me in a
grocery store line and I'm waiting I
pull piece of rope out of my pocket and
I practice tying my knots okay because
you need to know how to tie your prusik
blindfolded you need to be able to feel
if your prusik is correctly tied you
need to be able to break the knot and
retie it so so you know I have to keep
my hands busy and this is the safest
thing to do in public
so the next day that out loud so why are
so many toys in here so by the way if
you ever decide to include matches and
by the way I don't really think matches
are that important - believe it or not I
think unless you really know how to
build a fire unless you know all the
very things matches are going to give
you false hope cuz you're gonna be like
I'm just gonna create a fire I got
matches
alright there's more to starting a fire
than matches right so so in the respect
of you stay dry you stay out of the wind
you seek shelter you know it's a rare
situation where you're actually going to
require matches to survive a night it
might make it more comfortable but I
think the false hope of trying to create
a fire not creating it and then having
that big letdown oh my god I didn't
create a fire I'm in big trouble that's
actually much worse so I have matches
but but don't worry about it so this is
an ace bandage and I love ace bandages
and if you're ever in the wilderness and
you get hurt and expanded as your friend
but we like to do things multi-purpose
sometimes we call it highly repurpose
able any expanded just you know kind of
a generic thing the best way to carry an
ace bandage is in the shape of a t-shirt
and you just cut you spiral cut and you
end up with an X bandage so and if
you're lost you should probably be
willing to cut up your t-shirt that non
cotton t-shirt so
okay um I don't know if I brought this
but sometimes and we do this in the
field its we want to actually have a
medical kit I don't know if I brought it
um we want to have a medical kit and the
medical kit is a personal thing right
depends on what you think you'll need
right so if you're in fact allergic to
bees you better have your you know your
something I can't think that it's called
the EpiPen thank you very much which I
was going to bring today so you should
have your EpiPen if you're somebody who
tends to twist their ankles you ought to
have an NSA ID non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug the best way to
build one of these kits and no I don't
think I have it here best way to build
one these kits is to actually go to
Costco get get together with about 20
friends go to Costco and buy the you
know the 400 count you know I don't 800
count whatever they are the many
counting of acetaminophen also known as
Tylenol diphenhydramine which is also
known as benadryl absolutely I forgot is
called with the anti diarrheal medicine
right because if you get diarrhea in the
wild you're gonna lose a lot of moisture
and that's not gonna be good for you buy
all these in the large quantity and then
we buy fly fishing tackle boxes the
little tiny thing like this and you can
put about two days worth of each
medication and you know each of little
compartments and you have you know six
or eight or whatever the thing is and
and the the most expensive part of that
is the tackle box because you end up
paying about $2 for your emergency
medical kit but you know your emergency
you know over-the-counter medicine kit
if you're a parent and your children
have ever had an allergic reaction to
anything and I mean just like you know
hay fever buy an EpiPen and EpiPen is a
synthetic adrenaline it's actually the
up you pin is in a form factor that I
think was designed by them by the Army
it's a self injecting mechanism so you
inject in the leg they make them smaller
for for children and what the active pin
does is the EpiPen actually helps you
deal with anaphylactic shock and if
somebody has ever had an allergic
reaction to something that means that
there's
potentially something out there that
that maybe they've even interacted with
before that will in fact cause them to
have an anaphylactic shock and there
have been lots of stories of people
never been allergic anything in their
life and they ran into something and
never ran into before and boom
anaphylactic shock is where your your
respiratory tissues essentially swell
shut and once they've swelled shut
there's nothing anybody can do for you
you're done so an EpiPen is synthetic
adrenaline which is a vasodilator and
vacÃ­o dilator will in fact cause the
swelling to go down and it's the only
thing that will save your life in that
situation if I can only take one medical
device or medical mechanism into the
wilderness most everything else I can
live without I might be more in more
pain or whatever else but when you need
an EpiPen that is the only thing that
will save your life I don't get just one
because the first one will cause the you
know that it'll stop the swelling from
continuing but after the adrenaline
wears off the body is pretty good at
absorbing that it will actually it could
actually start up again so they say
minimum of two realistically four you
have to get a prescription from a doctor
but as far as I know they're not it's
not an abuse substance so I don't think
you'll have any trouble I don't know how
you'd abuse it but I guess people are
adrenaline junkies so it's possible so
now we are recording so I shouldn't say
this but the there's a it's also dual
purpose so if you've ever seen Thank You
Hollywood if you've ever seen Hollywood
where they show somebody flatlining in
an emergency room but they say oh
quickie flatlined let's shock them okay
first of all that's completely wrong
right you never actually shock somebody
who's flatlined if somebody who's
flatlined
there's only one thing that will get the
heart started epinephrine okay the only
thing that'll get the heart started the
reason you actually use an AED is you've
got the heart is actually beating it's
just out of sync the four chambers have
to all kind of operate in synchronicity
so the hearts actually like working
really hard it's just no Bloods going
anywhere so what the AED does is
essentially you know cause them to have
a muscle contraction
the whole heart to have a big muscle
contraction and then when it let's often
you know that the hope is the part will
sort of pick back up so so you know now
when you're watching with your friends
you can say oh yeah those people no idea
what they're doing that shocked them you
know so so and then so the so the EpiPen
if if somebody's actually had a heart
attack and you're out in the wild and
you know that they're there it's
actually the heart has actually stopped
technically they're dead okay you only
perform CPR on a dead person by the way
they don't tell you that but that's the
that's what it is so we perform CPR on a
dead person so if the person is dead
there's not much you can do to make
their situation worse so if you have an
EpiPen you know and there's no beehives
nearby whatever you know and and and
then you know in the EMT tradition I'm a
I'm a wilderness EMT as well and in the
MT tradition we have protocols so we
can't do that but what we can say is I
thought he was having an afflicted shock
look like that to me you know I'm just
not very good but that's what I thought
it was yeah
so Tori system and that's the the body
tends to diffuse when you put something
in if you you know these things go right
at the muscle and they will actually be
absorbed to the system it's better if
you actually do it closer up to the
heart right but I'm not really
comfortable giving anybody advice on
that so the point is is that you know
yeah if you get the wrong place Robert
said I just stab it somewhere near right
so so they're you know the body the body
will and it doesn't actually take much
for the heart's really strange when I
did my EMT rotations somebody come in
and be like the heart would stop baby
you know and then reason is like and
somebody says okay you know give them I
don't know so many cc's of epi and they
you know beep it just picks it right up
and you're like wow you know and then a
few minutes later it wears off it's like
you know and they're like okay again you
know and so you do that two or three
times and you want the body to take up
take over after a while and if it
doesn't then we call it but so yeah you
know says just one of these things you
want to you know like you can impress
all your friends is that watching
television apparently George Clooney
when he was doing ER kept saying said
EKG kept saying KGB they couldn't get
him to stop saying that so I wonder what
that was all about so let's see so okay
Oh puh puh puh puh bum okay I want to
jump to interacting with wildlife a
little bit because this I think is
something people are interesting so
first of all there are big things and
there are little things in the wild that
you need to know about the big things
are bears mountain lions and what was
the other one I forgot I know well
what's actually what mammal what mammal
other than man is responsible for the
most most deaths in the United States
every year
oh what's that mammal deer yeah I mean
they're not attacking us but you know
it's worth knowing right so okay oh yeah
snakes and snakes bears okay I was just
trying to go with three okay so so I
want to tell you an urban legend if it's
if it is an urban legend and it probably
is it's still worth hearing because the
message is interesting you know we we we
shy away from snakes that rattle because
they rattle and they're telling us hey
you know get away and so apparently in
places like Texas again this may be this
may be an early legend in Texas they
have these things called rattle around
ups where they actually try to get rid
of the you know great huge populations
of Rattlers and the way they find these
Rattlers is by their rattles so what
they do is they are selecting all the
ones that have rattles and they're
killing them and so now you can get bit
by a rattler in that rattler does not
have a rattle so that may be an urban
legend but I think the point is still is
still interesting and still valid so so
you know for what it's worth this the
sometimes think of think of these small
Rattlers I don't know they're at red
lights I don't know what you call it but
um the baby Rattlers also have venom and
they haven't actually they're the
teenagers they haven't actually learned
how to modulate the venom so you can
actually get more venom from a baby
rattler then you can get from an adult
the adult the adults can give you dry
bites they don't want to give up their
venom because it takes a lot of energy
out of them to create venom so so
they're they're you know they'll if they
feeling threatened and you know they
have some some you know depending on the
situation they may or may not give you
venom but if you get bit by a little one
they may not have a rattle first of all
at that point because the rattle is a
function of as they get older so so I
need any snake buy it you should deal
with as if it were venomous in in any
situation in any medical situation when
you are
actually you know if I get a cut of my
arm the rule of thumb is compression and
elevation right this is the one place
where compression and elevation is not
what you do
compression is bad because you're
pushing the venom further into your
system and elevation is bad because now
it gets to your heart faster and easier
so you actually want to do somewhat the
opposite you know you actually want to
keep it below the heart you want to keep
that person calm and you want to and and
you know whether you won't go to the
whole X thing you draw the bottle up you
have cavities um but the but sometimes
actually even getting putting it in cold
water or cold surface will actually
cause that part of the of the body to
actually distribute that poison that
slower rate so if you can actually slow
down the absorption of it depending on
how much you got that's actually okay so
let's see bears you can intimidate a
black bear very easily you can you
should not try to intimidate a brown
bear unfortunately brown bears are not
always brown black bears are not always
black so and the way you identify them
is basically by the shape of their head
etc so you know the the thing with bears
is that you actually want you do not
want to surprise a bear alright that's
the thing so if you're walking through
the wilderness and you're by yourself
and you think you're crazy for doing
this but you know just ever hello mr.
bear anybody out there blah blah just
make yourself known because the attacks
that happen happened because you came
upon the bear you caught him off guard
maybe he's eating maybe he's you know
going to the bathroom right because
they're vulnerable then and they know
other people know they're vulnerable
then so so there's a few situations
where you're gonna really inflamed them
or you know Young's they're moms they're
bad situations so so communicate just by
speaking up or if you have something
which is you know two pieces of metal
just make two pieces you know click two
pieces of metal together some people put
a cowbell when they hike they have a
cowbell it just you know makes this kind
of noise no it's not the dinner bell
it's it's just something that's not
natural and it's not it's not wood it's
not something the wind is creating by
you know cruising through trees so so
and then the other thing is if you
actually come across the bear
first of all don't run because they have
a fight flight reaction so if you run it
chases it doesn't know why it just does
right so and uh and if you're really
dumb enough to run at least run downhill
because they're very tall in the rear so
if they're running downhill they very
easily lose your balance and roll down
the hill okay the bad news is now
they're at the bottom of the hill and
they're really good at running uphill
because of their body structure so don't
run that's the first thing the second
thing is if the bear and animals will
probe each other they'll kind of check
each other out in the wild to kind of
figure out what the territory is you
know maybe your kid maybe bears never
seen a person before or certainly not
with this color you know so so actually
the chokes the bear looks kind of
interested in you start talking to him
doesn't matter what you say obviously
but but the thing is the bear has a
essentially a differencing engine and
you know as he starts to get a little
closer you start getting a little louder
and you start getting a little more
aggressive and you start showing teeth
and the Bears like okay I got the
message right but if you sit there quiet
right you're sort of saying yeah come on
come on over buddy you know so animals
have a sort of way of negotiating and
you need to play by their rules when
you're there so so just you know start
talking to this bear in many cases
they'll be like you know whatever we got
some berries over here I'm gonna go so
so and then you know I think everybody
knows if you're ever attacked by there
you're uninteresting if you're dead it's
dead and so you play that and one of the
key things is you always stay facedown
so if the bear grabs you and kind of
flips you over you know your momentum
carries you all the way around and you
end up facedown again so but you know
those are pretty rare the key thing is
don't surprise a bear mountain lions we
don't know as much about mountain lions
as we as we think it's a it's a pretty
solitary animal they have one mountain
lion 455 about 50 square miles if you've
ever seen him out lion in the wild
you're fortunate if you've ever seen a
mountain lion and he's crouched and he's
looking at you
you're not fortunate so there's a couple
of really important things to know here
first of all if you know if you kind of
see you know when you siscon
you can kind of get in profile it's all
good okay but we've all everybody's had
are seen at least the housecat okay
if you've seen a housecat the way they
sort of stock I think you'd be surprised
how similar it is to them online so so
it's the mountain lion and they have
incredible vision by the way if a
mountain lion is in that position and
he's looking at you
predators by the way I always have their
eyes on the on the for on the on the for
there's always face forward excuse me if
you're a prey your eyes are out here
like rabbit you know the bottom of the
food chain eyes are out here right but
predators eyes are for the mountain lion
is looking at you and you make eye
contact with them essentially you've
been made and it knows that you know can
tell based on the angle I mean it knows
that you've spotted it the worst thing
you can do at that point is look away
because what happens is if you go hey
Joe that was the opening it had right so
what you do is you're like oh crap now
you know Joe come here you know and you
bring your crowd together it does anyone
have a jacket I couldn't borrow I'll go
in and just show thank you so you bring
your crowd together and wow that's a
jacket my god are you from Southern
California
so you bring everybody together so you
create and and you bring the little ones
behind okay and I'm outlines model of
the world is everything's a deer of some
derivative of a deer right so and the
deers got a big neck and his his jaw is
entirely designed till it's literally
perfect you know through evolution if
you believe that stuff that actually
causes I had to say that that actually
can separate the the vertebra so so to a
to a mountain lion the more you look
like a deer the more you're you know
you're more you look good and by the way
some people have salt licks in their
backyard because they want to bring the
the deer close to the house because
they're so beautiful with the deer comes
the Predators so if you put a salt lick
out and your family pets start
disappearing
you know why so one of the things you
want to do is you want to make yourself
bigger
something like this makes you bigger and
it also starts to break up the pattern
where's the neck okay because that's
what they're all about I need to know
where the neck is where's the neck okay
get together like this if you actually
have a space blanket there make a lot of
noise I got a weird kind of shininess to
them those are great for the same thing
as well tell you're here you don't have
to run that faster sets out run your
friend so so then the other thing is we
don't really know why but there's a
really an unbelievable affinity for
children like mountain lions have been
known to go past you know like old
decrepit adults right there really easy
targets on the edge of the woods to go
out into an open field which is much
harder much more risk to go after a
child we don't know if it's the sound
simply the size we don't know but they
but they're especially interested in
children but what you don't want to do
you make eye contact and what you don't
want to do is bend down to pick up your
child because what do you starting to
look like here anybody kind of seen the
pattern here so this says oh yeah I
could I could be a deer sure why not you
know and and the mountain lions that
tend to attack people as far as we know
and we don't have that much data they
are the really young and they haven't
quite figured out what they're doing
they're the really old or there they've
been injured in some way and for
mountain lions one of the worst things
they can do is break a tooth prick they
call canines on a cat I don't know this
is a dog name right but they break one
of their four teeth they're
substantially their ability to be a
successful predator has been
substantially reduced
so in that case sometimes I'll go after
easier prey and we look pretty easy so
so yeah so but mountain lions are pretty
rare and if they if an attack ever
occurs they get really fixated on who
they're attacking right so if you're
there with your buddy and he's being
attacked and you're thinking to yourself
okay if I try to help that thing's gonna
turn on me and I love my friend but I
you know I don't wanna be on the
receiving end of this
we don't know exactly why but they're
unbelievably fixated so if you go up you
know and kind of help pull it off the
mountain lion will just feel like yeah
you know and he'll go right back to
where you know who is trying to attack a
very successful strategy is ice go for
ice that's true by the way with people
and anything you know eyes art you know
predator if it gets a damaged eye
suddenly is seriously at risk so don't
like try to pry the jaws off or you know
do pick your knife and try to figure
where the heart is those are you know
you could be there for a while like
where's the animal Anatomy you know so
so what you want to do is you actually
want to you know and they'll they'll
give up real quick when their eyes are
in danger so we're running out of time
and there's always so much more to say
yeah childs are put a whistle on your
kids anytime they head into the
wilderness International distress symbol
is three of anything three whistle blows
three gunshots I don't think you should
send your kid in the wilderness with a
gun but send them in the in the illness
and parents on your way out come see me
I got whistles I got lots of stuff by
the way so on your way out and then kids
have a tendency of hiding they feel like
they're in trouble so search and rescue
on ik child is actually extra
challenging as a family you need to have
a family secret a family secret some
phrase that it's a secret in your family
and only your family and friends of your
family know this secret and it could be
anything it can be like you know you
know Barney's left-footed or you know it
could be you know what your favorite you
know your favorite pizza type or just
some crazy phrase they tell us then
we're in the wild we're walking around
and it could be a little funny Barney
has a left-footed you know Barney's
left-footed you know and the kids will
actually then say okay this person knows
my parents and okay I'm not in trouble
and roll along kids are actually really
hard because they literally try to hide
from us just it's just the way kids are
so come up with a family secret and make
sure it stays secret and then you'll
have something to give to search and
rescue should that ever happen
I'm gonna talk briefly about getting
found you'll hike downstream via tree so
so so first of all has anybody been
watching man vs. wild so I have a lot of
respect for him but he does a couple
things in there which are just crazy you
do not go down a mountain by going down
the face of a waterfall on vines okay
most injuries in the wild actually
happen near swift water okay and so you
know you have this love-hate
relationship with water when you're in
the wild because you need it you want to
get to it you want to get your water you
know where it's fast-moving and cold but
at the same time you know it's easy to
get hurt too easy to get pulled away and
if you get pulled into the water and you
find yourself floating downstream in
some River feet up your feet forward and
feet up of course but be forward and if
you come across something that looks
semi-submerged do not ever try to swim
under it because there's a good chance
you'll never come up because there are
sweepers they're essentially trees that
have fallen down and then pull down and
if you get in there you'll get stuck and
you'll just be held down and you'll
drown so we go through all this like
crazy training we're like we're going
down the river and we see this thing and
we try to like push ourselves and like
jump over swim over not really gel but
and it's hard it's really hard so stay
away from the water if you can it's the
most dangerous place if you're
completely in the absence of all roads
going downhill and following the river
is the quickest way to find civilization
with with children they have a program
called a hug a tree program where if a
child is lost we tell them to stay put
that's where the hug a tree idea comes
from because they have a lot of energy
and they can climb a lot of places we
can't and they don't tend to follow the
profile right like adults would be like
okay what's the easiest way is like I
can go up this hill or I can go down
this trails like I'll go down the trail
kids are like I'll go up the hill you
know so it's much harder to find them so
we just sort of say stay put assuming
that somebody knows they're out there so
so anyways there's a lot more detail to
cover sergei has actually asked me to
give a talk on starting fire with simple
wood tools so I think we may have
another talk at some point in the future
and like I said I have a lot of gear
here and I kind of would like people to
come by and pick things up
you know we have plastic bags which are
part of that should be part of
everybody's survival kit I have to show
off this one thing if it's here and this
is the coolest flashlight I've ever seen
there's been a lot of advances in in LED
technology so this is the flashlight and
it snaps on to a 9-volt battery and you
know depending on the battery and such I
think this is like has like 100 hours or
something it's unbelievable and in fact
what people often say is a you know they
pull they replace their smoke detectors
every year and they pop it in you know
they pick it out this motor tech put it
in here and it's amazing and this is
actually like the most expensive part of
York it's gonna be like fourteen dollars
but everything else is like $2 $1 $2 so
again I'm not selling anything I just
some sort of saying that these kits when
put together correctly can be very
inexpensive and very small and thus
people will actually carry them than
some of you um so so yeah so we're
always learning and in particular when
it comes to interacting with wildlife
because you know there's only been like
you know 50 cases like you know
worldwide where we have actually any
data data on mountain lions for instance
so so yeah but would people be
interested in some kind of follow-up
something more technical or you know I
actually kept only done about half of
what I really could cover here today I
really didn't cover the kid as much as I
was hoping
well everybody knows about whistles I
tell them what the whistles three things
and the oh yeah one last thing
direction all you really need is
something teeny like this this is a this
is a four dollar watch band compass okay
and the nice thing about it it's small
you can carry and you really when you're
lost you only need to know within about
one-eighth right I mean you know you're
not gonna if you're off by 10 degrees I
it's not really gonna make a huge
difference but if you actually you know
note your direction you leave let's say
you leave whatever the car the house
whatever and you head someplace and then
you decide you know lost or I'm not sure
where I'm gonna return and come back and
you think okay went do sort and do
Norris and I'm going to turn on go due
south if there is actually a if it's
like on a road or something like that
don't try to go straight
because what happened is you go straight
back and you'll get to the road and
you'll say okay so it's either to my
left or it's to my right so the best
thing is do is to just aim off by you
know ten degrees so that you know when
you hit the road you have to go right
you'd be surprised how many people you
know they hit the road they turn the
wrong way they go for a long distance
the wrong way because they're sure it's
just around the corner just around the
corner must have been really awesome
it's been real about time they turn on
and come back they've really kind of
lost their the mental edge that they
have and you know these kinds of
decisions surviving as a lot to do with
your your mental your mental position
and so a lot of the advice I'm giving is
things that you know don't practice self
what's the phrase I want don't don't
practice the ability a debilitating
behavior don't practice self what's the
phrase I'm looking for help me here
thank you that's it what you guys said
so so I would love to do more so maybe
we'll set up another one and thank you
your patience and please come by and
pick up stuff because otherwise I have
to carry it home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
