here and what I've done is I've put
together a few slides because it tends
to be easier to show slides than screen
shots at times but I don't want to be
bound by that so if people have
questions along the way feel free to let
me know and otherwise I hope to have
plenty of time at the end for open
questions about things that I'm doing
with chilling effects right now I'm
teaching as a visiting professor at
Brooklyn Law School before that I was a
staff attorney at Electronic Frontier
Foundation and throughout the whole time
I've been concerned about the problems
of the takedown of online speech and the
did the legal threats to it and so the
chilling effects clearinghouse over at
chilling effects org is one response
that we've put together over the years
to help people resist those threats and
to help warm the air for online speech
so yes clearing the air for online
speech so a Google and for many of the
rest of us the internet seems like a
wonderful tool for information sharing
and for gaining access to the
information that we and other people
make available online and Google of
course does great things to help people
make information available with search
with tools like blogger groups that make
it easier for people to express
themselves online and at the of course
there are others who aren't so happy
about the flourishing of expression
online who see it as a competitive
threat that others are able to discuss
their products and places that they
might find better prices or better deals
or talk about companies in ways that
don't portray the companies
in the best light and so some people see
the this internet expression as
something to be fought against rather
than something to be celebrated and many
of those people use cease and desist
letters legal nasty grams against the
content that they find online and to
their distaste I know lots of these are
just Bluff lots of people send letters
wanting something taken down and Miss
state the law no the law but Miss apply
it claiming that a a website is
infringing copyright when in fact it's
merely posting a photograph and
commenting on it and making a fair
non-commercial use of an image some of
them are malicious some people find that
sending a legal threat is what a great
denial of service attack against their
competitors if they can send a claim of
copyright infringement to an Internet
service provider that's far more
effective than sending a gentle request
that you please talk about my company in
a better light and plenty of bullying
going on and not to to go too far
there's also plenty of unlawful activity
online and plenty of people who use
legal cease and legal threats and cease
and desist letters to to get that
unlawful activity taken down and yet
whether the the legal demand is correct
or incorrect is not so often correlated
with whether people respond to it many
people are silenced by cease and desist
letters even if those letters are over
broad and make claims of sorts that the
law wouldn't support so because they
don't know their rights because they
don't have
lawyer because they don't have the
resources to hire a lawyer because they
don't think that their little personal
website is worth hiring a lawyer about
because their risk averse because they
get scared of the consequences of legal
action they see something coming in on
letterhead and don't want to face
lawyers in court and and then finally
some of these cease and desist letters
are sent not to the individual who's
posted the material but to their
internet service provider or their
internet search provider because the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act safe
harbor but i'll get to in a bit
encourages the sending of cease and
desist notices to internet search
service providers and the providers of
information location tools including
this one here and in that case the the
poster and the internet service provider
and the internet search provider don't
all share the same incentives while the
individual who's posted the material may
be very interested in having that
material stay online and stay findable
by the world the for the Internet
service provider it's one of thousands
of customers perhaps not even a paying
customer for the internet search
provider it's just one of millions of
websites that appears in the search
results and the cost of further
investigation and fighting takedown
demands may may be more than it's worth
to to allow that one additional site to
remain public so the chilling effect
site we set up to help these people and
anyone who is curious about the law and
concerned about the law
and its impact on free expression to
understand how the law actually applies
to their online conduct and what their
legal rights are in response to cease
and desist letters they might receive so
chilling effects started it up around
2002 it's a collaboration among
Electronic Frontier Foundation and law
school clinics around the country so law
students get some real practical
experience analyzing cease and desist
letters that come in and the legal
problems that they face and among our
hopes is that students who've worked
with the project go out to become
lawyers who have a well-rounded sense of
not the the threats and benefits of
online conduct so if you get a cease and
desist letter you can come to chilling
effects dot org so a few years ago
somebody who called himself I Bo patch
hacked his robotic dog Sony's I Bo
hacked the the memory stick and found a
way to make his dog dance a few new
dances and posted this online so that
others could share in this excellent
feet of reverse engineering and the fun
new things that he could do with his I
Bo toy um well of course I say of course
as a lawyer because as a lawyer I come
to expect that the response to anything
fun and innovative will be at some point
down the line a legal threat uh sorry
Sony's response is to send a
cease-and-desist letter arguing that
reverse engineering the the format of
the memory stick and the programming for
I Bo's dance movements is a violation of
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
anti-circumvention provisions
because part of what sony says they were
doing with their formatting of the
memory stick was copy protecting the
dance moves in their programming
copyrightable material the DMCA forbids
hacking access control measures and
descent trafficking in the technology to
hack access or coffee control measures
so sony claims take this down you've
circumvented our copy protections and
redistributed some of Sony's copyrighted
works well if you're confused when you
get one of these letters you can come to
the chilling effect site report
receiving a cease and desist notice
brings you to a web form here where you
can enter in information about the the
notice and about yourself and not quite
that quickly but after filling out the
form it goes out to one of the law
school clinics where students add these
annotations to the notice each one of
these yellow highlighted points links to
some frequently asked questions and
answers on the chilling effect site so
copyrighted software with links over to
some explanations about what kinds of
things are copyright of all and what
kind of coffee is permitted sony claims
that this infringes it's right what are
the rights of the copyright holder what
are the some of the exceptions in even
the DMCA anti-circumvention provision
has a few exceptions it doesn't ban
absolutely everything and among those
exceptions is an exception for reverse
engineering for interoperability which
it's quite likely that this reverse
engineering would have fallen into
and so here some of the the frequently
asked questions and answers below and we
build up a collection of these faq s so
that as new letters come in we can tag
them with with references to these faq s
and you can also just go to the site and
browse what are all of the questions and
answers in the reverse engineering or
anti-circumvention section so even if
you haven't received a cease-and-desist
letter you can find more information
there and then after this I bow past
posted on his website I bow going to law
school to learn to read EULA's on
another of Sony's claims was the fist
reverse engineering violated their end
user license agreement that at some
point during the process of getting the
I bow working they claim you would have
had to agree to ah so gramming to make
the the legal process more
comprehensible maybe not down to the
level that a robotic dog could
understand but at least so that users of
the internet can get a better sense of
what their rights are and and make an
informed choices about whether they want
to comply with a takedown demand or
respond to or leave the website up and
wait to see whether the lawyers will do
anything more than simply filing a
complaint so how does this tie in with
google well Google is an information
location tool provider and as as such it
gets complaints from people who don't
like some of the information that may be
located through the information location
tool so early on
several years ago now the Church of
Scientology complained about a website
operating at Xenu net the operation
clambake site that posted criticisms of
Scientology found Scientology's theology
of alien invasions to be rather
implausible and posted some of the that
theology the writings of l ron hubbard
along with their criticisms of it on a
website along with some of the more
modern material that scientology had
produced to try to recruit others to its
to its religion and operation clambake
posted this material to help people make
educated decisions about whether they
believed the tenants of scientology well
in in their posts they included
quotations of the scientology material
and that was enough for scientology to
make a copyright infringement claim
against them claiming that they had
copied Scientology's copyrighted
material and thus they claimed were
infringing copyrights held by the church
of scientology now if you go all the way
through the copyright analysis that's a
highly likely fair use of the
copyrighted material copyright
infringement too has its exceptions and
one of the most important is the
exception for fair use including for
educational commentary and critical and
news reporting purposes fair use looks
at things like the nature of the use
that's being made and the transformative
nature so a site that's using snippets
in quotation for the context a purpose
of criticizing is quite likely to be a
fair use
night that simply ripped off Oliver on l
ron Hubbard's books to save you the cost
of buying them in a bookstore probably
would be infringement but Scientology
saw this a copyright claim as a nice way
to make their critics less visible so
sent a copyright infringement claim and
sent it to Google as an information
location tool provider and Google's
response was to remove the links to
preserve its safe harbor status under
the dmca and but in order not simply to
remove it and disappear it with no
record of what had been done they chose
to send the complaint over to chilling
effects and then to link to chilling
effects in in the bottom of the search
so on this search for Scientology
leaflets and you get the the notice at
the bottom that in response to a
complaint we received under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act we've removed
seven results from the page if you wish
you may read the DMCA complaint for
these removed results and clicking on
read the DMCA complaint brings you right
over to the chilling effects page where
you can read the complaint that's been
made and even read the URLs that
Scientology has demanded be banned from
the search index because the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act requires that
you indicate with specificity the
location of materials that you want
removed from search index and chilling
effects it heals the for complete list
we include the entire complaint that's
been made including all of those URLs
that have been included
is this season is this glitter itself
copyright sure everything under the Sun
that is original and fixed in a tangible
medium of expression is protected is
protected from the outset by copyright
will no longer require registration of
the copyright in order to protect it but
here too we are relying on fair use we
think that there is a thin copyright in
that letter that you sent with the text
of door threat in it but the public
interest in access to the texts of legal
threats that have been made and
information about the legal threats that
have been made we think warrants
publication and although we've had lots
of people send cease and desist letters
with little footers at the bottom that
claim this letter is copyrighted you may
not reproduce it without permission
nobody's brought us to court over that
uh so I think I should skip ahead for a
moment to some of the mechanics of the
digital millennium copyright act the
dmca sets up the safe harbor for
Internet service providers who fit any
of these categories the transitory
digital network communications caching
information residing on systems or
networks at the direction of users being
web and file hosts and information
location tools search engines and the
way that the law is set up is to say
that as a trade-off between the ISPs in
the copyright holders saying if ISPs
follow certain notice and takedown
procedures they can't be held liable for
money damages for the copyright
infringement done by their users so it's
saying there may be copyright in
rangement out there but if you when
you're given notice of infringing
material expeditiously take it down or
disabled access then you won't be held
liable now if you notice the way the law
is set up it doesn't say you will be
liable if you don't follow these
procedures it simply says you can be
sued and that lawsuit would work its way
to completion and at the end the the
judge would determine if you hadn't
settled it earlier whether merely
hosting material or merely providing a
link to material claimed to infringe a
copyright was enough to make you
responsible for that copyright
infringement and in many cases like the
automated provision of a link to
material that at the end of the day
infringes copyright I think a search
engine wouldn't be liable for providing
that link but the safest way not to get
entangled in lots of litigation and
which is costly even if you win in the
end is to remove the material
expeditiously on notice of a claimed
infringement and so that's what most
ISPs and most search providers do they
set up set up the procedure that the
DMCA requires designate an agent for
service of process with the Copyright
Office and accept these note notices
claiming copyright infringement and then
upon obtaining such notice or awareness
act expeditiously to remove or disable
access to the material that's claimed to
infringe so that that's for posting
providers for information location
providers the situation
is similar they shall knock your light
so their ex explicitly excluded from
liability for referring or linking users
to an online location containing
infringing material or infringing
activity on if they respond
expeditiously to remove or disable
access to the material that's been
identified specifically enough and so
that there are a tremendous incentives
in this system to send the Copyright
Office your notice of a DMCA agent and
to accept the notice and takedowns and
then to remove material when you get
these claims of infringement and for the
for the ISP and the copyright claimant
that works out pretty well for the
individual whose material has been
removed it works out a little less well
the law specifies things like you must
leave the material down for 10 to 14
business days if you if you want to
claim the safe harbor and the
requirements of the DMCA counter
notification are more onerous than the
requirements of the initial dmca
notification ah so other well do people
have questions at this point or want to
see a selection of other funny and
amusing cease and desist letters are the
letters
sometimes there or something use the
laws is is it illegal to misuse the law
or to make false claims but there's a
wide spectrum of misleading and false
but in the dmca context there is a
specific provision 512 F that gives us a
pretty good way of going after claims of
false claims of copyright infringement
so let me briefly tell the Diebold story
which happened around the the elections
a couple years ago when electronic
voting was becoming a hot issue and a
group of email messages leaked out from
diebold with things like the admission
that testing releases go out to
customers when they shouldn't and new
features get added to stable branches of
the code when they shouldn't sometimes
the bug slips into a stable branch
things that wouldn't give you an awful
lot of confidence in the security of
electronic voting machines and as those
messages got out people like the indie
media organization students at
Swarthmore College posted them to their
websites and citizen journalists started
analyzing them and newspapers and
magazines started analyzing them to talk
talking about insecurity as an
electronic voting that these revealed
one of them another of them said things
like the certification requirements
require that voting machines run a
system test as they start up our machine
doesn't run a system test that's why
we've got this little batch file in here
that prints out system tests complete
when it runs a memory
test again not exactly the sort of thing
you want counting your votes in a in an
election and so students posted them
indymedia posted them what do you think
Steve olds response was uh well dmca
these these email notice messages our
our our copyrighted property and it has
come to our attention that you appear to
be hosting a website that contains
diebold property and they sent those
takedown notices to snort more college
to online policy group that was hosting
the Indy media server that was linking
to the emails on yet another server and
when online policy group took said no we
won't force our customer to remove the
link to the materials they went up to
online policy groups upstream ISP
hurricane electric with yet another DMCA
complaint and and at this point i was
with Electronic Frontier Foundation at
this point we decided to sue diebold for
knowingly materially misleading claims
of copyright infringement and would that
that now the judge agreed with us that
no reasonable copyright holder could
have believed that the portions of the
email archive discussing possible
technical problems were protected by
copyright and so in that case d both
ended up paying our clients damages and
attorneys fees for online policy group
and for the Swarthmore students who'd
had to take down their website with this
this is an interesting case but I don't
think is actually responsible the
question I think the question was really
there are there any sanctions against
intentional misrepresentation of the law
and I'm saying that in this case the law
provides specific sanctions for
misrepresenting a claim of copyright
under the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act and I
am using this example to make the
counterpoint that in most cases there
are no there are no remedies if you are
not in a contractual relationship or you
can make an ethics complaint to the bar
and you might be able to if you're if
you're economically harmed enough by the
conduct make make some claims but there
is not a general cause of action I'm
suppose you're in a situation where
hurricane electric did take down the
content fortunately maybe they listened
the cover of Time knows what I end up
you know what we saw her with this means
wants it doesn't I mean who is liable
for falsely called pain down content on
their coffee yes so we sued diebold but
for making the misrepresentations in
most cases hosting providers will have
contracts with their end users that
basically allow them to do anything they
like and say you may not hold us liable
it's generally going to be a matter of
contract and unless you have a lot of
money and a very none a very powerfully
drafted contract on your side the
average person is going to have a
contract that says we can take down
whatever we whenever we like him for any
cause or no cause at all so why so
someone issues a system this is to
google for posting a link to copyrighted
material see some this is close to
chilling effects and now chilling
effects is hosting a link to copper
why don't they then go after showing
interesting question nobody has chosen
to send a takedown notice to chilling
effects in that way claiming that we're
providing information location tools
that are leading people to copyrighted
material a couple of only a couple of
people have complained about the letters
that were posting and even they have
gone away after we remind them that we
are a non-profit organization of seven
law schools plus Electronic Frontier
Foundation do you think there's people I
mean obviously these people have proven
that they're sort of reckless in their
aggressiveness are they just scared of
creating bad law or like life if they
are so recklessly aggressive why I'm
dancing you think it's just it's a bad
PR yes it could be partly legal strategy
partly PR a question why aren't they
threatening chilling effects and I think
it's still the case that a lot of cease
and desist letters are sent out because
it's cheap and easy and because it has a
high compliance rate so if you see your
company being criticized and want to get
some of that criticism taken down send a
letter claiming it infringes your
trademark to use your company name on a
website and if most people comply that's
a pretty cheap and easy remedy going out
and sending a second round of letters or
suing is more expensive and by the time
it gets to that point many people
recognize that it's not worth their
while we do I another of the aims of the
site is to show people that even that
first degree of sending the letters has
costs that
sending an over broad or silly cease and
desist letter will make you look silly
and isn't something that will overall
enhance your brand reputation and I
think people are starting to get that
message to they see a question back here
so for the Scientology Center it was
really very useful well you did that's a
more question for your lawyers than for
me but there there are lots of reasons
that a provider might decide to remove
links after making just an initial
investigation yes there appears to be
something here it might simply be
expensive to look through every every
page that's claimed to infringe to
determine whether there's an
infringement at the other end as anyone
trying harassing the MC letter centers
because a seaplane you have 14 days
window so you could just take them down
for 14 days and immediately put it back
up are they completely send the DMCA
loans right is with that the wheel or
that you exclude intended on the same
barber so the service provider would be
protected by the safe harbor if it
allowed people to put things up 10 to 14
days later and so but we also Wales and
if they receive a counter notification
we also see very few counter
notifications which is another we're
trying to puzzle out why it is that so
few people proof take advantage even of
the limited rights that the DMCA gives
them part of its the difficulty of
swearing to jurisdiction in a US Court
particularly for folks like the
operation plan
make who are located outside the United
States they might not want to send a
counter notification agreeing to US
jurisdiction no there's more room for
thinking about creative ways to to work
with the DMCA process you have numbers
on how many letters chilling effect sees
and how many of them will see I've got
some place in here numbers of of dmca
notices that we've seen and perhaps I
can pull that up so here's notices that
Google has forwarded to chilling effects
and has risen dramatically over the last
few years to 642 in 2006 very few of
them are ever see even counter
notifications and very few of them
become court cases and that could be of
for a range of reasons it could be that
this material really was infringing and
the infringer doesn't want to test his
luck by filing a counter notification
and by no means when I put up all of
these numbers am i claiming that most of
them were illegitimate a huge number of
these are talking about pages that are
just going out and slurping up somebody
else's content and putting it on a site
and trying to steal traffic but there
are also a bunch of them that are not
and instead are people engaged in
political commentary a blogger who
borrows an opponent's campaign logo in a
post that's talking about the opponent
gets a takedown notice because that
campaign logo was kicked copyrighted
and so we get a mix of those things this
chilling effects take a view on whether
copyright law in general is in need of a
perform or is the goal to save here's
the existing framework of cadre of all
that sort of art the public with
information so that they can propagate
their way through and so too does
chilling effects take of you know
chilling effects as a website is is
trying to be a relatively neutral
discussion of the law and within the
context of current copyright law pushing
it at the bounds of fair use for
commentary and cultural discussion and
criticism but not a wholesale reform
other organizations and other projects
at some of these law school clinics
other projects of eff other things that
I'm involved in all do work towards the
reform of copyright and changes to the
law to make some of these abuses less
likely and to make it easier for people
to engage in a fair discussion even when
that discussion involves copyrighted
material on on the website we tend not
to do that because there are complex
rules about the practice of law and the
giving of legal advice and the site
can't give legal advice to everyone who
sends in a notice and so instead of
trying to do that we do these analyses
to help people draw their own
conclusions again some of us write
papers or weblog and fries or other
things and some of the weather reports
on the chilling effect site do describe
not some of these issues and take more
opinionated stances but that that's the
line that we're trying to walk is there
any requirement that you notify the
person we're trying to find person
actually created McMuffin who created
the comedy content what did you just
notify the ISP and Google and young
ladies when you send a DMCA notification
to the Internet service provider there
or the search provider there's no
requirement that you notify the
individual or try to google in its in
its dmca request form I believe asks the
the person who's sending the complaint
to identify the person who's on the
other end of it so that Google and I
hope is trying to notify that person
that a complaint has been made against
his or her content but but otherwise
that the DMCA tends to push the dispute
between sort of out and the individual
might not learn about it until he sees
that his content is disappeared or is no
longer ranked let's grab a few more of
the things that we've gotten lately at
chilling effects one of my the amusing
ones recently was the Federation of
American scientists put together the
site really ready dot org to criticize
the job that the government was doing
with its website ready.gov sorry here's
ready gov and Federation of American
scientists thought that they weren't
doing such a great job with ready.gov
and put together this analysis at
really ready don't work telling you
here's how you can be really prepared in
the event of a national disaster and yet
again we get this time our federal
government department of homeland
security choosing to address this not by
improving the content on their ready gov
website but by claiming that their
trademark interests in the terms ready
and ready America and agree in an orange
check box means that Federation of
American scientists can't post this
critical website because it will cause
confusion as between the government
website and their own I know it works by
the government unless produced by
contractors we're not covered by
copyright um that is correct this is a
trademark claim that they're making and
the government can hone Fraden can make
economic it can own trademarks and it
can even own copyrights if they're
transferred to it so you're right that's
probably why there's not also a
copyright claim in here but but if its
trademark is it covered by dmca sorry
this is not the MCA now this is just a
cease and desist letter sent to the
Federation of American scientists
directly you're right sometimes we see
people misusing the DMCA just send
trademark complaints but for the most
part the trademark complaints are sent
directly to the individuals on the other
end so this one DHS tells them they
can't be really ready and they send back
a letter saying sorry even trademark has
its exceptions and one of them is for
the use to refer back to the original
organization and we think nobody is
likely to be confused by the provenance
of this site
a claim I agree with that doesn't stop
other folks from sending silly cease and
desist letters so a few years ago the
Republican Party of Texas sent a cease
and desist letter against the website
that had Enron owns the GOP taking the
Enron logo and the elephant logo here do
we get a trademark claim you have
misappropriated our elephant logo and
caused people to believe that or
potentially caused people to believe
that Enron and the GOP are really
associated please stop that if if anyone
really believed that they have more
problems than just a trademark
infringement from this little website um
yes who was not too pleased about this
picture of Lynne Cheney at White House
org the office of the vice president has
sent a nice friendly cease and desist
letter to the owners of White House org
claiming misuse of the presidential seal
the presidential seal doesn't really
have a vulture in the middle of it
and a misuse of an image of the vice
president's wife of roller clown nose uh
how did it die jmark evolution claims
your view of the season this is because
there aren't you trying to protect
something slightly different than pure
misappropriation ok so to trademark
dilution is relatively new law on the
federal level protecting famous brands
against dilution of their mark or source
identification value and that the pre
dilution trademark has been used to
protect source identification against
consumer confusion so nobody else can
call their beverage coca-cola or bottle
it in a red bottle with a swirl because
then consumers wouldn't know which they
were getting when they went to the shelf
to pick one up dilution goes beyond that
to say nobody can call anything else
coca-cola because if somebody saw a
coca-cola piano then they'd have to
think twice every time they saw the word
coca-cola wondering what it was that
coca-cola referred to so famous brands
get this protection against dilution I
think that dilution claims then get
overused because if somebody has made a
market and and and are used to shut down
all sorts of interesting parodies and
other kinds of commentary I my personal
feeling is that if somebody has made a
mark part of the language by attaining
fame for his brand then the public is
entitled to criticize that and to use
that in parody because
that that's the give and take of
becoming famous so yes please be aware
that the US Code prohibits knowing
reproduction of any likeness of the seal
of the President except us for the
official use of the government and they
didn't think that vulture seal was
approved the onion has gotten a similar
notice of our its rebroadcasts of
presidential speeches again for misuse
of the official seal again is this the
best way for the federal government to
be spending our taxpayers money hmm
here's here's another dmca claim
remember during the the last election
the photograph that appeared and was
circulating of John Kerry and Jane Fonda
John Kerry sitting in anti-war rally
where Jane Fonda was speaking and
bloggers and other commentators were
circulating this photograph and
discussing it and some using it to claim
that this showed that John Kerry was
really a radical who shouldn't be
trusted others to say this showed that
other people were misrepresenting the
photograph because it really there were
all sorts of people there and being
pictured in this photograph didn't mean
anything about your political leanings
and certainly not about your current
political leanings well right here the
the photographer who took this picture
started complaining to websites
everywhere not necessarily about the
political content of their sites but
about the fact that they weren't paying
for the right to reproduce his
photograph and so charity was sending
dmca complaints to folks including
Google for hosting the blogger service
demanding the removal of that picture
from various websites that were using it
and here
you're too I think people could have
raised fair use claims if the
individuals had wanted to to counter
notify for the use of this image in a
non-commercial political discussion but
in most cases that they simply removed
it now the last point I wanted to to
note on things that the chilling effects
project is doing beyond the receiving us
and analyzing us-based cease and desist
notices we've we've got these varied
goals of helping people to understand
and know their rights helping people to
understand the costs of sending cease
and desist letters researching these
problems it's also got some interesting
things because beyond sending us the the
takedown notices that they received in
the United States google also said uses
these same links or similar links in its
international searches of the United
States no matter dmca aside the United
States is a pretty good place to be an
Internet service provider or web host
you're insulated from liability for most
state law claims that somebody might
make against content that's posted
section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act says you're not liable for
user posted defamation and so in most
cases ISPs and search providers can just
ignore those complaints abroad the law
is less clear and there are all sorts of
regulations that foreign nationals might
call upon asking for information to be
removed in Germany there are laws
against various kinds of pornographic
content against hate speech against
speech that glorifies
the Nazi Party against defamation and so
lots of people come to international
versions of the google search and find
results removed and here too they can
link over to the chilling effect site
and off and not see the same level of
detail but they can find at least that
it wasn't just that results disappeared
but that a German regulatory body in
this case has demanded removal of
material on body modification and so the
last bit of fun that we've had over a
chilling effects is linking people over
to a little search comparator where they
can run the results of that search in
both the Google de and google.com sites
side-by-side and see that there is some
difference to those searches and start
to figure out what's being censored from
their search results since just since
January first of this year so in eight
or nine days more than 50,000 people
linked over to chilling effects from
international sites that had had
something removed from them so there are
most the most being from Germany Belgium
and then France so there are there are
lots of places where people have even
less access to content than here in the
United States and chilling effects is
hoping to bring a little bit more
transparency to those removal processes
so I think I will since it's getting to
the end of time i will let anybody leave
who's getting anxious or hungry happy to
take further questions there there law
firms like and watch Jason's chases
specialized way insurance wise there are
other law firms and seem to specialize
in silly Patrick or is there a growing
business firms that specialize in
copyright or more specialized in fending
silly cease and desist letters or in
responding to them seven and are doing
this in the same way these are parallel
to that long we got socially my control
um we've got it I I don't just I haven't
identified any trends I haven't
identified any law firms that seem to be
immune from sending silly claims or any
of that seem to be sending a whole lot
too many there are also the search
engine optimizers who have found that
sending cease and desist letters is a
good way to get other people bumped out
of the search results so our friends at
muir internet have sent a whole lot of
claims against websites that clogged up
there their clients search results and
they want people removed for potential
customers are searching for on the
internet being there claimed copied
phrase and they found that a if the
search engine removes our competitors we
get listed higher
so are these deal and people would seem
to be doing their thing sort of better
or are there others as well um it's hard
to identify because we don't have a big
enough set of all of the claims being
sent and received and it's hard to get
other Internet service providers to to
give us information so I should
absolutely thank Google for being as so
open with the information that it sends
on to chilling effects I think it's
something that benefits searchers using
the google search engine and researchers
trying to figure out what's happening
here the people get to see that see why
it is that their search results are
being reshaped from the most relevant
material and but it's hard to get others
to follow in those steps to give us more
data to see the scope of the problem
polygon so richly investments sorry it
was my eye surgery angles who did the
fourth-biggest Annette dark had someone
develop a myspace page pretending to be
her and posting personal information
about our different location Oh like
that is how is she how is possible be
protected against just going on saying
oh
a lot to appear at all so she might have
claims under or somebody in that
situation might have claims under
defamation and privacy laws in
defamation if somebody is making false
statements about her claiming to be her
sounds like a false statement that's
right my and myspace is protected by the
CDA 230 provision from any liability
under the defamation or privacy laws so
the claim would have to be directly
against the individual now it's also
possible that not a legal threat but a
general complaint of your site is
contributing to the misrepresentation of
my identity well I know I don't have a
legal claim against you as a general
good practice don't you think you should
remove this might work better than miss
stated legal threats most sites don't
have an interest in motion contribute
publishing the address would be against
law in some kind when here I'm good I'm
sure to try to use European pending to
shut down west side um if a European
Court decide wanted to take jurisdiction
over that kind of claim my guess but
yeah I I think hey from what I've read
outside this context I think there are
no I think that bands and other
celebrities and other and even not so
celebrities have had success just asking
myspace to remove misrepresenting pages
well maybe we can turn off the mics and
I'm still happy to to talk chat with
other people about other related
questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
