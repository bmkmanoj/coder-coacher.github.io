Patrick was saying we can open this up
to questions and take this wherever you
guys want to take it but I'm going to
spend a few minutes talking about how a
new technology coming out there the tin
can API is reshaping how we're thinking
about learning systems and we've been
very fortunate to be able to work with
you guys here at Google to kind of put
together some some leading-edge systems
taking advantage of a lot of this new
thinking and it's really great to see
some of the things that were just ideas
and concepts a few years ago validated
in practice these days and so as patrick
said my name's mike rusta see I'm the
founder of rusty software we're a
company that has spent the past decade
working with elearning standards and
figuring out how this since all the
software players in this industry make
all their software work together and
it's been it's been a very rewarding
ride but it's also been very fresh
drinks we haven't had a lot of change
over that last decade but that's that's
happening right now we're and during a
period of kind of momentous change I'm
going to talk to you about so how how
that's being catalyzed and what some of
the new thinking around those things are
and so you know we when we start to look
at learning systems we're recognizing
the fact that so much of who we are as
individuals and as employees and
professionals is informed by what we
know and what we've learned what we've
learned makes up who we are it's it's an
important thing that people want to be
tracking and so we have systems across
the enterprise set up just to do this
very things that are called learning
management systems LMSs and if you're
bothering into this talk you probably
know what one is but when I I'll ask you
even within the context of one situation
say your employment here at Google how
much of what you've learned in that
context is your LMS aware of a couple
percentage points maybe even just what
you've learned in the years you've been
at Google how much does your elements
know but it's tiny it's a tiny fraction
nevermind what you've learned at school
and in your personal life and all these
other contexts we have these systems
that are set up to track and understand
what we know as people as individuals
but there were fully inadequate at
creating that larger
picture and so why is this what's
missing we have the motivation seemingly
to want to be able to do this and much
of what I'm talking about is predicated
upon the fact that we do in fact want to
understand how people are learning what
they're learning what they know we also
have a lot of the technology to put in
place we have very very innovative ways
of delivering learning and we have very
innovative ways of tracking what people
are doing this is happening more and
more so why is this so difficult and I
contend that interoperability is one of
the big factors that are holding us back
for us to be able to understand what's
happening across many different contexts
in many different systems it needs to be
a way for all of that data to flow into
one place or to flow together seamlessly
and right now we don't have that the
existing standard that governs our
industry the only standard that allows
systems to interoperate squirm the thing
we've been working with for a decade now
it was a great 13 years ago but it's
holding us back now it's it's far beyond
where we need to be and a lot of what
I'm going to talk about is also
predicated upon the assumption that
interoperability creates markets and
markets drive innovation and so these
charts up here a simple way to visualize
it put yourself as a vendor of a new
tool that wants to enter into a market
if you don't have an interoperability
standard or an API or standard way of
making your system work in that context
you've got the graph on the Left where
you go build something and every time
you need to go sell it or deploy it
there's a high variable cost to doing
that when you do have an interoperable
Easterner when things are plug-and-play
you get the graph on the right you build
it once you work out a few kinks and
then from there on out every sale is
easy when every sale is easy you have a
market when you have a market you have a
place where people can go try to make
money and go and introduce new tools in
here it's episodes it's my contention
that once you have the ability for
somebody to with an innovative tool to
come into the market a whole lot easier
that drives and spurs a lot of
innovation and so without that right now
what do we have we have a series of
monolithic system
and this is this is natural you know
because learning isn't going to stop
because we don't have these tools and
there's still this demand to try to get
this holistic picture of what people are
done so what's happening over the years
the learning management system started
out as a simple way to deliver elearning
and track who did what but then people
said oh I also want to know what's
happening I want to have social learning
in my organization and the LMS vendor so
what we can do that will put a social
component into our learning system and
you know a dozen other things like that
but that doesn't really fit you're never
going to drive everybody into a single
learning system where they want to learn
something learning isn't something that
can be confined learning happens
everywhere it happens and increasingly
now it happens in all kinds of new
technologies you know mobile devices
simulations games whatever it might be
learning happens in the in its context
it's not going to be isolated you're
never going to drive people to a single
system to understand learning and you
guys understand this better than anybody
else or at least you should we work for
the past decade we've worked with
leading-edge world-class best-of-breed
massive learning systems but putting
together all of those learning systems
they're dwarfed by the learning that
happens on to tools produced under this
roof or one of these big roofs around
here you know when you want to learn
something what do you do you go to
Google you search you go to YouTube you
watch a video
there's tons of others Coursera Khan
Academy you know Linda all these places
plenty of opportunities for learn you're
never going to when you want to learn
something go hey let me go log into my
LMS and see what I can find no learning
happens in the moment of need and in its
own context but it's not trapped in that
LMS you're never going to get that
picture of a person's learning
experiences through a monolithic system
no matter how monolithic you make that
system even Google as monolithic as
Google is isn't going to big Google I'm
talking isn't going to give you a
complete picture of everything that it's
happening for a learner but yet that's
all we've been trying to do make this
bigger and broader and we don't even
come close to approaching double-digit
percentages of how people are learning
and what they're going on learning
really happens in the moment of need in
in the context that happens and you know
I like to share a story sometimes but
when this really sunk in for me a few
years ago I had to my daughter's window
was drafting so I needed a weatherstrip
I think I know how to do weather
stripping so I went to Home Depot and
bought a roll of weather stripping got
back I'm sitting my daughter's room
isn't what do I do with this stuff now
and what I do I pulled out my phone and
I went to youtube and search some
weather stripping I found it two and a
half minute video this guy told me
everything I ever wanted to know about
weather stripping and went there and
figured it out started with the weather
stripping rewound when I got confused
and figured it out it was right there
and it was done and that was a great way
to learn it was in the moment that I
needed exactly the information I needed
to know I didn't have to leave my job
site I didn't have to go remember my LMS
password I just got what I needed
and but the information the fact that I
know this is now it's not recorded in
anywhere it's gone and maybe this is a
trivial example who cares that Mike
knows about weather stripping or maybe
five years from now I'm gonna be working
on a habitat build and the build master
will want to know who which of these
volunteers here are you know have the
ability to do many of these things and
so you know I contend also that in
learning it's important to embrace the
fact that every situation is different
and this happened I'm talking about both
in the providing of a learning
experience and also in the tracking of a
learning experience and I I can give you
some great examples as well and I think
it's pretty self obvious that itself
evident rather that the providing of a
learning experience is much better when
tailored to the specific context
tailored to the specific individual and
plenty of plenty of ways we can go with
that
but I also contend that you know the
tracking and the managing and what we
want to do with this learning data is
different across many different
organizations across industries across
contexts as well so you know this notion
of having a big monolithic system that
tries to do everything seems to be
flawed for the learning industry what
instead we should be doing is
I'm embracing a set of best-of-breed
services tailored for different
different needs and in our experience
here with Google we've seen you guys are
great at this you guys are a bunch of
really smart innovative people who when
they see a problem they go you go solve
it and the problem is often tailored to
that specific context and you wind up
with best-of-breed solutions scattered
around your organization and not many
companies do that not many companies do
that because for them the tracking is
more important than the actual learning
and to me that's that's upside-down
that's the inmates running the asylum
right there three oh yeah yeah so the
question was for remote folks you
couldn't hear you know to what extent do
you want everything to be tracked is
tracking in and of itself can be
disruptive people knowing that people
are watching what you're doing is
potentially problematic and I don't
disagree with that notion and you know
one thing one thing I tried to make
clear when I started is this is what I'm
talking about it's predicated upon the
notion that we want to do this and
that's not going to be the right
assumption for every situation now going
back into specific individuals if if I
want to go learn about I don't know
something that might be politically
sensitive or whatever I might not want
that tract because a big brother or
whatever it might be but I contend that
generationally we are shifting towards a
era where we you know the quantified
self movements and you go look at all
the social network sharing that people
are doing we're heading towards an era
where people want to track what they're
doing want to know what what they don't
want to record these things it's not
going to be right for everything
yeah absolutely some the point was more
concerned about faking it making it look
like you're doing the things that are
actually done and so yeah there is an
absolute need for the biggest problem as
you get into this stuff is trying to
make sense of the data that you're
capturing about learning events and so
you know it's yeah it's very easy to go
say I did this and I did this and I did
this but I think then that just
increases the need for more robust
assessment and validation of those
things and yeah I often get questions
about well the person who just goes and
says I I read this I learned this bla
bla bla bla bla bla bla post a bunch of
junk out there how do we make meaning
out of that and I don't know the exact
answer yeah that's still an unsolved
problem however you know I like to use
the analogy of looking at somebody's
facebook wall where if somebody goes and
posts a bunch of junk onto their
Facebook wall that's a bunch of junk
it's pretty useless but you still learn
something about that person by reading
that wall yeah and you might I don't
know what it is but the fact that they
have a bunch of crap up there is often
indicative of them so that that's that's
a big topic we could kind of go to
anything but very valid valid points so
where was I we were talking about how
you know Google and some other companies
are bringing together Best of Breed
services that are specific to individual
context but there's still something
missing there
we're missing a thread to tie them all
together you know not within systems we
want to know what has happened in other
systems you know we look within a single
organization if we're trying to tailor a
learning experience to somebody what has
happened in their prior learning
experiences are very important to making
this determination about what the best
current learning experience is going to
be furthermore we want to tie things
across not just within an organization
but across personal life's and education
in all contexts at our company ruston
cease off we've been using this phrase
for a long long time now we call it we
want
system that is tightly integrated yet
loosely coupled we want the system
spheal to bring information together and
talk to each other when necessary but we
want them to be segregated and able to
evolve independently swapped out best of
reeds it's an architecture that seems to
make a whole lot of sense especially as
we're trying to look at these these
learning systems and you know we've we
kind of come to the realization over the
last few weeks actually that we've in
we've embedded this concept we woven
this tightly integrated loosely coupled
concept into the core of the tin can API
this next generation learning standard
that we're going to be talking about now
that we've that we invented a few years
ago and that is now causing a lot of you
wait new ways of thinking about learning
systems and so getting now into kind of
the heart of what what is tin can that
I'm talking about here now we've set the
stage of some of the problems we're
trying to solve and some of the you know
some of the issues in our industry 10
cants coming along and it's creating a
very disruptive and in fact thing it's
opening the doors for a lot of
innovation so what is thinking tin can
is the next generation of SCORM if you
want to think of it that way they're
part of the next generation of SCORM to
be a little bit more specific and this
was born out of a government research
project about three years ago to go
create an experience API like and the
experience API captures learning
experiences SCORM and and thinking are
both born out of a government research
lab called ADL the advanced distributed
learning initiative and tin-can itself
was invented by my company rusty
software as part of a research grant
where they said hey you know go out and
try to figure out what gather
requirements gather use cases see what
what am I elegant way for capturing
these learning experiences might be and
so over the last couple years it has
evolved from early-stage research
project to something that is now being
embraced by the industry it was it a
formal 1.0 version in April of 2013 so
about nine months ago now and it's
starting to take hold within the
industry and this represents you know a
big opportunity
for us remember that earlier point
standards confine and enable
marketplaces and so what we're seeing
now is we've got an industry that's been
largely stagnant for many years now
because it's been held back by an old
interoperability standard the market was
defined based on 13 year old technology
now all of a sudden were removing those
shackles we're removing those
constraints and opening up all kinds of
new capabilities into the market so
we're starting to see a lot of change
happening really fast and we're going to
talk about some of the word it some of
the new capabilities that we're starting
to see and some of the new trends coming
into the industry over the last really
last few months last year so new ways
people are thinking about things and
what I like to when I described thinking
some of these capabilities I like to use
a layers of the onion analogy will well
look at what's interesting on the
surface and then we'll kind of dive down
peel off the layers of the onion look at
some of the deeper implications and so
layer one think what's what is tin can
on the surface on the surface tin can is
kind of that let's go fix all the
problems we know about SCORM and
introduce some straightforward
requirements you know things like it was
hard to do mobile I mean really it's how
long we had iPhones and Android phones
and smart phones in our pockets right
now but yeah and the learning industry
it was really hard to do that not that
we couldn't be done it's really easy to
create an app that's learning but then
to tie that into our learning ecosystem
was very problematic other things like
your taking training offline or
connecting into games and simulation or
hosting content and remote locations all
of these things should be simple but
they were hard because we were working
with you know a decade-old
interoperability standard so at the
highest level this is what tin can
enables it removes a lot of those
constraints to allow us to use modern
learning modern technologies in our
learning programs since this is since
this is a tech talk we'll talk a little
bit about the technology and what it is
from a technical perspective the tin can
API is a rest or rest ish for the
purists API that allows for systems to
exchange
statements about learning experiences so
a statement about a learning experience
is of the form I did this actor verb
object
Mike past course Mike scored 80% Mike
finished simulation Mike graduated
Vanderbilt University
Mike answered question 2 and so you see
there's a very broad range of learning
experiences that can be defined this is
one of thinkin's greatest strengths and
also one of its greatest problems going
back to the question from earlier about
you know a bunch of junk coming into and
we'll talk a little bit more about that
this might be familiar this I did this
construct might be familiar to some of
the more technical people around it's
based on the activity streams
specification which some folks again on
this campus had a hand in creating which
is a specification for capturing general
data about what's happening on social
networks and we'll get into a little bit
more about why that's interesting here
in a few minutes but you can think of
from a technical perspective
tin-can is a profile of activity streams
a specific for capturing learning data
along with an API that allows for this
data to be exchanged among systems and
those systems can be either the system's
providing learning experience or
tracking a learning experience or they
can be many the enterprise the LMS is
the learning record stores the things
that are tracking systems and
synchronizing data across and so we'll
talk a little bit more about that later
so peeling back that layer of the onion
to the next layer layer two I call this
anything is learning any learning can be
tracked and people like to talk about
this as informal learning as well in in
our prior world we were only able to
track formal elearning courses that were
imported into an lms known about ahead
of time and taken by a known user at a
prescribed time a very small subset of
what we learn but 10 can those
constraints are removed we can track
things that are both virtual or in the
real world
I assume that this tech talk had a RSVP
system we can have that RSVP system make
statements to the learning record store
say you all attend the one the best Tech
Talks ever given a
in Canada tin can API we can track
things that happen informally we can go
track that you watched a YouTube video
or you read OU webpage or attended a
conference or read a book all of these
things can now be learning events that
we can digest and seek to form a much
more comprehensive picture of what
people are learning what they're
interested in what they know now again
your brain probably goes to some of the
problems with us how do we make sense of
all this information how do we ensure
its authenticity
there are some big questions to be
answered there we're opening up the door
to enable all of these things to happen
creating opportunity which also creates
big challenges so the question was how
much could you do in terms of
evaluations versus just presence or
attendance and yeah a tin can statement
allows you to capture not only presence
in attendance but also you know pass the
test or it could say expert watched
subject successfully do tasks or it
could it can also say can also
differentiate between the statement
might graduate from Harvard says Mike or
might graduate from Harvard it says
Harvard there's a concept of signing
statements and strongly validating who
has made the assert er of those
statements and so there there is there
are a lot of facilities for that built
in again though there are challenges to
that how do i how do I decide whether I
trust Mike or if I trust Harvard you
know it's easy in that context but you
can easily imagine some of the more
subtle problems there so peeling back
that next layer of the onion getting it
to layer 3 you know we have a kind of
new class of software called a learning
record store you've heard me throw out
this term LRS a few times now and the
learning record store is kind of
something that's been invented by
accident but is really taking hold of
the industry as a concept
that's changing the way we think about
our learning systems and so the LRS was
born out of the fact that in tin-can one
of the core requirements is that the
data is inherently open what goes in can
also come out data can be exchanged
across different systems it's portable
it's free to move about this was a core
design tenant of the specification from
the beginning Patrick who might need a
power cord here so the term LRS came
about when we were creating the
specification itself we needed we needed
a word to describe the thing that was
tracking all of the tin-can data we
don't want call it an LMS anymore
because LMS is they're calling
themselves talent management systems and
other systems right now so we made up
this new term we called it the learning
record store and the learning record
store was the part of the LMS that was
tracking all of this data but as we
started talking about tin-can to the
world in presentations like this people
started gravitating towards this concept
I want an LRS give me a learning record
store and so this notion of an
independent software application that is
inherently open for gathering and
sharing data about learning events has
kind of presented a solution to some of
these problems it's presented a place
where we can have a standardized API
supported by many systems that allows
data to come in from many sources
form a cohesive picture of an individual
and then let the data go out to other
places as well and so this changes the
way look we look at things all of a
sudden now we can have something that's
inherently open that allows us to share
data across many different places take
this to its next level we start to think
about the fact that data is now
inherently portable and we don't have to
confine our data just to within an
organization anymore why don't we have
what we call a personal data Locker
which is your way of capturing data
about what you've learned across many
different contexts across many different
expiry
across many different organizations a
place that allows you to capture your
information and then share subsets of
that with the world this is another one
of those things that is now all of a
sudden that we have since we have a
technical standard that enables a state
to flow freely across systems all of a
sudden else is very technically possible
without a lot of effort now there's
plenty of political business
bureaucratic type challenges to figuring
out how to make something like this work
but it's the right model our data should
be you are learning data it forms who we
are it's kind of like our resume in a
sense in fact as an employer I care more
about your ability to learn and what
you're you do it your demonstrated
capability of learning than I do about
you your resume in a lot of cases and so
this is a really interesting model that
is now all the Sun suddenly enabled that
some people are starting to take a look
at so learning record store allows us to
reshape how we think about our
enterprise learning systems get rid of
that monolithic system instead have
best-of-breed services tall tied in
together allows us to exchange data
across many systems lots of interesting
stuff to go into there layer four of the
tin can onion provides for the ability
to correlate not just are correlate the
learning day that we've captured with
actual job performance and behavior data
and the key technological enabler here
is that focus on the activity stream
specification the fact that tin can is
based on an increasingly popular and
pervasive specification for capturing
data not just about learning but about
activity in general I did this can be I
learned to this or it can be I did this
I actually went on the job and did it
the the ability to have these types of
data all in the same formats all in the
same system starts to make the ability
to correlate the outcome we were looking
for in the training to begin with with
the actual training system really really
straightforward
and so you know that I often will show
this slide up here without the two
things on the right just with that
vertical access and that vertical access
is a transformation way of looking at
our learning systems all of them we've
got many different sources of activity
that are all independent sources of
learning activity all independent
feeding data into a learning record
store that shares data out with
potentially different learning
management systems or reporting tools or
with other learning record stores
allowing you to kind of have this
tightly integrated let you let yet
loosely coupled architecture for your
learning system and that's great that's
transformational but introducing this
horizontal access access is even more
game-changing all of a sudden now we can
start to feed in the job performance say
the things we are training people to do
we can say did they actually do them and
then feed that over into business
intelligence tools to say okay let's go
look we tried training this way and we
got this result we tried training this
way and we got this result we can now
make strategic decisions about how we
are training that directly impact the
bottom line this now moves learning from
a cost center to a strategic function
especially in an age where if Talent is
what matters where we have an
increasingly knowledge-based economy and
the ability to grow and develop people
in your organization is there anything
that's much more strategically important
than that to knowledge-based companies
it's fundamentally important we can
start to now quantify that development
start to measure it I'm not claiming we
can instantly measure everything you
know and learn but there's a lot of
things that are directly measurable
we're starting to see and a lot of our
early pilot projects people jumping
right in and doing this with some really
phenomenal experiments and and
correlations that we're starting to
shine we'll talk about a few of those in
a minute so I want to just kind of
summarize and what what are the big
three
implications that tin can is having on
how we think about learning systems
first one instructional designers are
now freed from their limitations no
longer
the technology required to track
something ie the LMS driving the design
of a learning experience instructional
designers people who care about training
or teaching are free to use whatever
technology be it high-tech or low-tech
like a book whatever technology or
modality is best suited for the learning
experience
the tracking then takes a backseat it
sits in the background it happens
seamlessly in in the background it's not
requiring you to go to a specific place
and do something a specific way just so
you can record stuff and in so many
cases not all cases in so many cases
that tracking is important to
organizations and it gets in the way of
learning experience right now we flip
that and that is a major step forward
for being able to truly embrace the
power of technology for education which
is it's a I would contend it's sorely
lagging behind where where it's possible
right now
so implication number two the
specialization of learning systems no
longer do we need to have everything
resolved revolving around one gene Eric
learning management system that does a
hundred things but only a couple of them
really well in the way that you want
them done for your specific context and
again I contend that learning is so
contextually specific both in the
delivery and in the tracking and
understanding of learning events that
the specialization of different systems
it is very important and going back to
that analogy about social systems the no
matter how good it is the social system
in a learning management system is never
going to be as good as some of the
social systems produced by some of your
neighbors over here in Silicon Valley
that's all they do and so let's use the
company that does that's all they do and
make a really good social system that
does not just learning socialization but
it's your general internal company
social network there's plenty of other
examples like that you can easily
imagine the third big change the tin can
is bringing about is a focus on an alert
analyst
into the learning departments I think
this is something that we all know we
should be doing we should be wanting to
measure the effectiveness of what we're
doing but it's hard right now because
it's hard to get that data from many
different sources but that is changing
and this is to me the most exciting part
of what's going on here is now all of a
sudden the ability not and even it's not
so much the ability that is exciting to
me it's it's the change in mindset say
all of a sudden now that this is easy
we're gonna go and actually do it and so
many other you know industries and
technologies this is just mainstream you
guys produced Google Analytics and so
many people just fine-tuned their
website and they they realize that the
analytics are important so they can go
change what they're doing all the time
but we don't do that in the learning
world and I contend we don't do it
because it's so hard to get the data we
need to make informed decisions about
that the the change of that dynamic to
make this day the easier to get at and
to correlate with the outcomes this I
predict going to have a very profound
impact on all of our jobs over the next
future so well another thing that really
excites me about this is we've been
talking a lot about the corporate
context but this doesn't apply just to
corporations this is also starting to
bleed over into the educational contexts
as well now I've got a couple elementary
school-age daughters and I see them they
come home and they'll grab it it's an
iPad that we have at home not an Android
tablet I'm sorry that they'll come in
there and they'll play these educational
games I mean just stupid games we're
just doing math problems or whatever but
they get to dress up a princess or blast
a asteroid or something along those
lines and they're engaged they love
doing it and then there's two or three
systems as the school provides for
reading and math and they'll they'll
come play these games for hours and
hours and they're engaged in their most
need to take them off of the reading
practice yeah but they're they light up
and they get to do these things and if
you go look at any of these app stores
there's just thousands of these apps out
there but there's no way for Miss
McMurray my daughter's first grade
teacher to go see all that she's done at
home but would it be fantastic if Miss
McMurray had a simple dashboard that
said
yeah I know Amelia has already
demonstrated that she can do three-digit
addition in hyper blaster
let me move her on to something else in
the classroom walk into a classroom and
say we're gonna have a bad day all the
kids are happy cuz are playing iPad
games the whole time and mr. MacMurray
sitting up there with her dashboard
saying oh look
you know Amelia's doing really well let
me go challenge her a little bit more
Jen Johnny's over here struggling with
something let me go give him a little
extra help that kind of interoperability
it's the same stuff we're talking about
in the corporate world and starting to
be embraced across that sector and that
to me is exciting that starts to change
how we look at things and so where are
we today I've talked a lot of painted a
lot of a big rosy picture but I'm
talking about the future it's the near
future it's a future I'm confident we
are heading towards but we're not there
yet today this is all early-stage I
mentioned Tim Kaine came out in April of
last year we've had about nine months to
start to see adoption but we've already
had a massive set of early adopters
jumping in and a massive set of
interests in all of this for our
industry that's been stagnant for a
decade seeing all of these vendors
jumping in and already supporting Tim
Kaine has been it's been a huge win
we're starting to see a lot of the
existing vendors jump in and support
this specification for their existing
tools but we're also starting to see a
lot of new upstarts that are producing
very innovative tools that were on the
fringe of the industry jumping in and
doing some really cool stuff introducing
new capabilities to the industry and so
we're starting to see a lot of early
momentum we're also starting to see a
lot of organizations not the e-learning
vendors but actual companies like
yourselves piloting new capabilities
within the organization a lot of them
are going on they're trying to do more
with simulations now that we can track
them and have visibility to them there
we're seeing a lot of people just doing
simple performance observation checklist
which is something we talked to one big
retailer and they still do these
performance out the performance
observation checklists are a huge part
of their learning and assessment
programs but they're all stood on the
clipboard and I clip the paper then just
goes and gets filed away sometimes just
this simple ability to bring the data in
of a manager looking and saying did this
person stock the show
correctly bringing that data into the
learning ecosystem is a huge step
forward for a lot of these organizations
seeing a lot of people doing things with
with mobile tying in a lot of the
performance stuff one of one of the key
insights we've seen for companies
looking to tackle these problems right
now to start to experiment with these
new technologies is to be starting small
and to connect narrow things and solve
specific problems there's it's so
tempting to look at a lot of these new
capabilities and try to boil the ocean
do it all at once but that's a very very
very hard problem this the successful
early adopters are focusing on
introducing narrow slices of
capabilities at a time focusing on often
on answering a specific question
conducting an experiment where they have
a hypothesis about by train this way I
expect to get this result increased or
decrease or whatever let's take a look
at that design the experiment and see
what happens it's funny I share a few of
the kind of stories of the things people
are doing with tin can early on right
now we've got a telecommunications
company that's going out and they're
looking for a better way to do
compliance training where they're saying
okay we do compliance training in the
normal boring page turn away that we're
all familiar with that puts us to sleep
but what if we go spend a little money
and create a really engaging simulation
that you know connait creates emotional
empathy to the situation to show them
why the compliance rule that we have
here is important how it affects actual
people so they design an experiment
we're gonna go deliver these two
training things to actual two different
sets of people and then we're gonna
measure their engagement throughout the
training exercise remember measure their
retention of the knowledge later on but
then at the end of the day we're also
going to measure the reports of
incidents to our compliance tracking
system to see did we generate more
awareness amongst the people that we
spent them more money to train to go see
it is it worth spending however many
thousands of dollars could create this
better training did we get an actual
business result out of that thing today
we can easily start to then justify
whether this is a good idea or not a
couple of these others are projects just
getting started right now we've got a
disaster relief organizations that's
looking to do something similar where
they're correlating the effectiveness of
their training but there
looking at training before a natural
disaster happens and then looking at the
actions of their staff during that
disaster to go see how things were
looking there's a government Health
Organization they're putting together a
system that will consolidate data from
many different learning management
systems award badges based on
achievement of many different goals and
then use a simulated patient exercise to
go measure people's effectiveness in a
bunch of different skills I've got a
dementia initiative that they're working
on this year there's a credit card
company that's using a bunch of sales
training and then tying that data in to
what's happening in their CRM to go say
okay were these different sales training
modalities effective and actually
getting people to increase leads or
conversion rates or whatever it might be
from their CRM so and closing up over
here and you know this this is starting
to happen it's slow it's early but this
industry is starting to change these
trends are kind of unmistakable right
now I use the analogy with a bunch of
people it's kebbeh
the introduction of a new standard is a
chicken and egg scenario you gotta have
to have enough vendors out there
supporting to you get it to be
self-propagating and I think we're there
we're on the early stages of a snowball
that's continue to build but there as
we've talked about a little bit there's
a lot of still unsolved problems and
challenges but a lot of the momentum and
the trends are unmistakable this is this
is happening it's happening quickly and
it's you know it's about time or our
industry is long overdue for for a lot
of change here so I tried to leave some
some time here at the end for questions
if we wanted to talk with people in the
room or remotely this is a bunch of
websites and contact information feel
free to contact us any time was a few of
us who spend our days doing nothing but
talking about these problems and
opportunities with organizations all the
time or our slogan is ask us anything
really and so we were happy to have
these conversations at any time with
anybody from Google or from anywhere
else thanks for thanks for paying
attention and I'll answer any questions
if you have them yeah
yeah said the question was we talked
about attribution how we can strongly
sign a statement to say who who asserted
that statement he wants to know about
how privacy is managed as well he
doesn't want his employer to know that
he knows PHP but the cats out of the bag
now and so yeah that is an interesting
question that is something that is not
you know part of the tin can API itself
that is up to the learning record store
to implement in terms of giving the end
user control over what he or she wants
to share and doesn't want to share and
so you know these systems are all too
new to have industry norm around this
yet but you can it's easy to imagine the
personal data Locker
having you know different classes of
statements that you might want to choose
to share with different groups or not
similar to your Facebook wall has the
ability to share things publicly or just
with your friends and those kind of
things like I look at that as you know a
definite challenge for the system
vendors to deal with but I don't look at
it as a new challenge specific to
learning or tin-can it's just it's the
same problems the rest of the industry
the tech industry's social industry has
with collecting all of this data and we
just need to deal with them in the same
way that everybody else is by giving the
user the their controls that they need
and the you know technical integrity the
technical security solutions to maintain
this as best as possible and there's a
temptation to move to tracking that
rather than the Harvard thing which is
figuring out how much they learn
this person sat down pretending thought
about it versus that person so I guess I
worried that this might push you know
pushed more towards just yeah it's a
great question so the question was are
we are we encouraging people just to
track the simple things based on your
effort things you've done versus really
understanding what you've learned and
because that's a much harder thing to
try to measure and track and understand
you're absolutely right
yeah there's lots of low-hanging fruit
that is meaningless that we can capture
that's really easy but the harder stuff
requires a lot more thought a lot more
consideration and you know deeper
measurement and analysis I don't think
that any technology can change that all
we can do as the technological providers
is provide the ability for people who
want to put in the effort to not be
stymied by the standard right now those
people are signing they have a hard time
to do those things we've now enabled
them to do it but we can't make them
we're never going to be able to make
somebody you know wait just like you
can't make somebody produce good
training and we've SCORM this gets a bad
rap sometimes because there's so much
crappy training and you know that's not
scores fault it's just most SCORM
training is crappy not because SCORM
encourages crappy training it's because
people make crappy training cuz it's
easy and I think I look at that is the
same problem very valid concern yeah
it's a good question the question was
that when you're validating an assert or
of a statement does that go through many
different servers or is it just one a
certain I honestly don't know the
technical answer to it we can find out
for you if you want any other question I
don't know if we can have any questions
remotely can are you guys in audio
now shaking heads okay all right well I
guess we'll wrap it up then say thanks
for coming and you shoot us an email
find us on Twitter go the website if you
want to talk anymore we're happy to do
it any time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
