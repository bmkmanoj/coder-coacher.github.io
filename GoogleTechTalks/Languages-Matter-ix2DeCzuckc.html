coming for this event macauhub a
business advisor for the foucault
Government of Japan I think we're
running a little late so I think when i
get going with this first of all I
believe mr. Matsumoto will talk a little
bit about the ruby 1.9 I believe
actually I'm not going you're going to
talk about 19 and I I just arrived here
so my fries arrived one now on the goal
Oh about two hundred two hours ago so
I'm kind of my brain is screwed up so so
I just give a short presentation about
the languages programming languages and
and I i will accept the questions so if
you have any questions so you wait until
my short presentation so i'm going to
talk about the language matter so the
world is driven by computers like a
google with his huge number of computers
and everyone has personal computers and
the even the kids in their elementary
school they use computers but and then
and and a computer's becomes more and
more important these days but the most
people just use computers they don't
love computers unlike us right and the
computer is a mere tools for them so my
children is the by my oldest children is
going to high schools and they they use
computers just to to watch the youtube
videos and then the search wikipedia for
their lab reports and i don't think they
love computers
but the few people love computers and
that people will change the world so may
you the don't change world we do so we
are kind of privileged people and
language matters program lang is a very
important for us the every software is
written in some kind of language even
assemblers and or C C++ Java or Python
or Ruby and then computers don't work
without where so so to write a soft
software we need to write it them in
programming language so that so in
directory the the programming language
is a very important but few love like
programming language few the most
programmers just use languages you know
its programming language is given like
that so most of us don't done designed
the programming language so the most
programmers have something they they
want to do with the computers so they
they have something what to do in by
programming but there are very few
people who screwed up the purpose and
the means like the programming language
to that Mary a mean or tools but some
people who really really love to and
even create one so I'm one of them
now that few people change the world
language help program is to think think
and the language give inspiration to
programmers like when I was very young I
started programming in basic and does
that that language didn't take tell me
about the recursion and the the
structures programming but after that I
started learning about the Pascal who is
instinct language but and the Pascal
taught me about the recursion and the
structured programming and I was
enlightened by the language after that I
learned scene and Lisp and small talks
and a lot of lot of languages and I
started love language and but if ever
language I learned that taught me
something new then so language even even
though I don't programming in past hour
44 I don't know last 20 20 30 years but
the the things i learned from Pascal is
still living him inside of me so
learning language and the language
itself and light programmers and the
language language affect productivity so
11 languages I'm language geek I'm
language lovers so I love Ruby of course
and allow Python I love java I love C++
even though I have bad memory with the
c++ and I want everyone feels happy with
languages so some people helps some kind
of trouble or grief through the
programming language yeah and then I
want to
to reduce that these kind of the bad
impression about the programming
language I want to be part of better
world via programming language the
providing better programming language to
to make the world better so I don't want
people feeling grief by languages so but
i don't think i can change the Java
language or the Python language so i
change the Ruby language to to make
world better better place so I will
polish my language so and these people
working up behind the other language
will do the similar things I hope and I
will encourage others to choose better
languages and or make existing one
better or create one new one let's go
locks Oh is your name so as a conclusion
a code will be be happy well whatever
language you choose be happy and that's
all for ma for my short presentation and
as coach here who is a terrorist who is
responsible for the 19 vm yeah we have
translated here so as coach about one
and internals and if you have any
question about one a release plan so we
the the release manager you agree we're
coming to the Rubicon so ask her about
the release is done not me and any other
question I will answer so thank you for
thank you for listening
I no no no llego no speech de acuerdo yo

que debes una dos más daijoubu desu
communis on you know with a text oh hi
hi yeah I'll get the glass ILS any
questions yes tomamos Iannone
homeostatic ago no katani to yo get
estimates earlier go ahead
I use a ruby so I want I want it be
faster if possible but it's not my
primary goal just because I'm a language
designer and the making fast language is
my first priority but still so no one
complaining about the faster language so
i would do and yeah he will do actually
I know you get Scott Harrison and Olivia
his own ego so can again go nice routine

well i don't i don't think the people
who choose Ruby voluntary is not
suffering about the language but you
know the the real comes in sandy you
know there are some people who were
forced to use Ruby even though they
don't love the like language so some
some people just don't like Ruby
language you know this you know there is
something like the dog people and get
people in the programming language too
so like a Python people and in Ruby
people so some Python or scheme scheme
people they're forced to use Ruby so
they feel some kind of grief and yeah I
don't think I can do anything about that
but still so when when someone needs to
use Ruby in very huge project like a
hundred hundred people with teens or the
very complex software like a millions of
millions of lines code so they sometimes
feel some kind of grief so like the one
can modify the core language very easily
in Ruby's so so I'm I'm vaguely planning
about the some kind of the modularizing
the namespace so so that the one can one
can isolated his changes into this some
kind of the namespace or module so
that's kind of my big clown for will be
too old hey Sonu do Aaron dacono desk at
