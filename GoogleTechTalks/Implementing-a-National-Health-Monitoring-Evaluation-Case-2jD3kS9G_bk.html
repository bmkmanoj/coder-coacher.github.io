the room and on the VC so this was
organized very impromptu got an email
from Alice who had met Kurt in on a trip
to Haiti recently and said okra it's
going to be in town on Monday can we
organize a tech talk I said what a great
idea and and so here we are and from the
perspective of Google Health in
particular which is in some sense the
host this is a particularly interesting
because it's outside of the normal zone
of what what we think of as a health
project it's not part of the PHR you
know what exactly is it who knows but I
think it's important and sort of deeply
related to the overall health mission
and I think one of the reasons that I'm
sort of encouraging all kinds of
conversations is to is to sort of
broaden and expand our thinking of what
health really is all about so with that
note Alice to introduce curtain on
things so as Mark mentioned actually
wasn't a cheapy to Haiti few weeks ago
and I was there with some friends who
know I'm a software engineer i love
technologies and they told me you cannot
leave Haley without meeting people from
solutions so I said ok so you know who
are these people that you know everyone
is excited about and so I went to the
office and I met them and solutions has
been created in 2001 by for engineers
and Kurt was one of them and these
engineers have this vision for the
country where this you know new
technology we can do something with new
technology in Haiti even if the
situation is is complex and hard in
Haiti new technology can really be the
vision for the country and even if Ryan
a new technology are not very well
developed it actually may be an
advantage maybe you know because there's
nothing right now we can go wild you
know everything is open we can decide to
do things however we want so it's it's
very open for new IDs for
vations and it is pretty much what
solutions is trying to do so right now
there's maybe 20 engineers if I'm
correct and today card is going to talk
more about at all they developed to
monitor HIV in in Haiti and you know
what are the challenges and the results
that they have so Thank You Curt for
stopping by in New York and giving this
up for us thank you very much for your
introduction my name is crucial as Alice
told you I am the co-founder and CEO of
solutions it's a company that we've
built in 2000 01 and who's offering a
software custom software development in
many different areas and I've met Alice
back in power plants with we spent ten
ten minutes maybe because she had she
had she had met my other partners and we
had a very interesting talk about the
project that we are doing in health
system in Haiti and more precisely in
with HIV so I'm going to give you a
little idea about what we're doing i'll
try to do it in less than 40 minutes so
that we can have time to ask questions
discuss together and share some some
ideas we have actually well less than 20
i really like that to any engineer to
have more fun in solutions with me where
we are 15 and we are well you know we
are very passionate people people that
really try to get themselves into what
they're doing and will then do it with a
lot of passion so I'll going straight to
my presentation here I won't give you a
lot of slides I'll try to give you a
little demo of the system that we have
built in Haiti
so before that I want to give you some
quick facts about Haiti just to know
where we come from and what are we doing
in this kind of environment will talk
about the messy project native messages
for monitoring evaluation and
surveillance interface regarding what we
have what we had in health information
as elephant formation system in Haiti
what was the basic battle plan the basic
vision when we started back in 2004-2005
and the actual implementation what we
had as challenges and what really worked
and what didn't work at all we'll also
talk about the next challenges that will
need to face in the health information
system in Haiti and then try to prefer
to get the last 20 minutes for question
and answers and other interesting points
that certainly you'll have to share with
me the haiti quick fact sheet you know i
will try to invent anything i'll try to
reuse as much as possible so you have
the the link from wikipedia let me try
to find it wikipedia here oh okay that
gives you a basic information basic fact
sheet about haiti the capital which is
the largest city a population of more
than 9 million people 27 27 thousand
square kilometers the capital
port-au-prince with more than two
million people in it and one of the more
challenging countries I will say the
poorest country maybe it is but it's one
of the most challenged well it's a
country where we have a lot of
challenges and it
the in it's difficult to find that much
challenge in the northern hemisphere and
you so you have a gdp of per capita of
five hundred and seventy dollars which
is not a lot and very serious situation
difficulties between the a lot of people
that do not have access to information
access to basic infrastructure Alf and
any kind of infrastructure that should
be taken as granted so this is basically
a country where we the official
languages are French and Asian feel most
of the population speak speak Creole and
we have been the been more than 200
years since this country's independent
so it's been a lot of there's a lot of
history a lot of very interesting
culture aspect in Haiti added really
encourage you to you to maybe go further
on the web and see what's going on there
and I also give you an idea with some
some basic figures i took from some for
example for the world work world bank
that gives you an idea of the economic
and social context and it's it's also
interesting because it gives you a
comparative come it's a it gives you a
comparison between haiti and the other
countries in the Caribbean for many
different aspects for example economic
and social context you see this is the
line for the late in america and
caribbean region and you see how 80 is
performing for this you see also MIT mir
aspects about telephone lines
per hundred people in two thousand we
have 0 point eight people with a
telephone line and in 2007 was 1.1 but
one thing very interesting you can see
that for example in two thousand we have
0 point six for 100 people with access
to a mobile mobile phone and it gemuk it
change it change a lot since 2007 and
you can see how this line really got a
lot of improvement in the last one
basically the last two to three years if
you look at this at this figure here so
in haight it's basically a population
where you have more than thirty percent
more than thirty five percent of the
population in 2005 that had less than
fifteen years so it's a very young
population where where you can have a
lot of opportunity to create a totally
different countries but it's also a risk
if you don't take it accurately so we
many people are trying to think to find
new way to be innovative to not only in
444 technology but for many areas to try
to do to come with and another vision
another another way of envisioning the
future for haiti and that also what
we're trying to do in solutions well in
the technology part so that basically
gives you an idea I'll share I shall I
share this this this information with
you about about the facts in Haiti also
i also i also tried to take this is
tabled this gives you an idea of the ati
ati is an indicator that was used by
UNDP to evaluate the human development
factors in
many different countries so this gives
you an idea where Haley stands up in
four compared to many different region
of many different countries this is
basically a country that that is is at
the same level as other countries that
are in Africa and this says saurian area
and this tables gives you also some idea
of the positioning of Haiti concerning
the many specific factors for example in
2005 Haiti was in one 146 position while
Iceland was in the first line and you
see the difference of this you can see
also the life expectancy which is well
actually it's 16 now it's conching it's
improving that good news for me and also
the revenue that is unfortunately it's
going down but we are sure that somehow
it will improve in the future we can see
also the human poverty index adult
illiteracy people without access to
water children under eight on the
weight-for-age so these are very this
odd kind of indicators that are very
good gives gives a lot of headache if
you can take it like this so this are
some table just to give you an idea of
the other population I'm should tell you
as we're going to talk about information
system and things that you have to keep
in mind that it is a country where we
have very low access to infrastructure I
mean road access not even talking about
electricity access or broadband access
and things like that so you have to
imagine a country where for example in
the capital
we have less than 12 hours of
electricity in the metropolitan area so
you have a lot of areas where there's
basically no kind of services as water
or electricity or or internet but we had
a very interesting success stories with
mobile mobile telephones for example
you've seen how the population got got
into this very quickly and and this is
the same trim we are sure that can be
used to improve many part of the life of
the everyday life of people ten years
ago you had places that were totally not
connected to the rest of the world well
today they are still not connected
because they do not have the world but
you have people with their cell phone
that can have access to anyone in the
world this is the first step will have
other steps to do with building roads
providing broadband access that can all
kind of activities that can connect
people and give people access to new
opportunities so this is the kind of a
way that we see the future we try to
envision better days for what the father
future so this was to give you a basic
idea I'm certain it's booths that
complete but that gives you an idea of
the projects while 80 I'll get back to
to to the the main point of the torque
where I wanted to present you them the
monitoring and evaluation project for
HIV first I'll have to talk about how
the health information system was in
Haiti when we started we started in two
thousand 04 and we had basically an
information system which was paper-based
tell you that maybe in in in the 70s
there was a very important structure in
the public health system there was
motivated people and they have succeeded
in building and information system that
worked without technology it worked and
when we started to lose that people that
were involved in creating the system we
also lose we've also we've lost all the
know-how that they had and all the the
capital that they did they build with
with was there with their drive and
their and their and their vision so you
had basically a lot of investment mainly
in HIV programs where many people were
concerned by the fact that the the level
of infection was very important in Haiti
so we had a lot of investment in this
area but everybody was concerned because
it wasn't easy at all to actually
measure what was going on really and how
the money was used what was the effect
under under under country and every time
that you had to provide a report it was
like a very important project to launch
something on the movement like that and
it took for example more than three
months from three to six months for
example to go and gather that up to
every site that we're providing services
in it in HIV as I told you the road are
not very good sometimes you have to to
to go to some places where you have to
work many hours because your your car
won't bring you there you have to work
many hours and get to the site get the
information get back to to the capital
have someone compile this information is
in own box is a known system and
eventually shared
information six MOS or eight most later
with people that were interested so that
was basically the kind of environment
that that we we had but we had the
chance that people they were concerned
by this situation and they had put in
place mechanism using data collection
tools paper data collection tools to a
collect data and provide and provide
reports after that so we started with
what they have as a as a system what we
wanted to do was to first try to provide
aggregate data that could be useful to
give a clear picture of what is going on
for people that had to make decisions
and for people that had their
responsibility to improve the system and
be accountable for the money that the
country was receiving so we started from
from this point and today it is we we we
had a very interesting projects where
all the sites that are providing
services in the HIV areas are connected
to the electronic system and all the
side that are providing HIV care HIV
drugs and things like that also are
using an electronic electronic medical
record we're mainly at ninety percent or
or more patients enrolled in HIV care
have their own electronic medical record
so it's it's and now we are one of the
country we are also one of the country
of the PEPFAR program the PEPFAR program
is an initiative lunch by by by the
United States to
finance HIV activities in many countries
in Africa and and an 80 and we are one
of the countries in the PEPFAR program
that can accurately provide a good
reports on a monthly basis so the basic
the basic the basic battle plan that we
had when we we wanted to launch this
project it was to make sure that we can
build something that can enhance public
awareness and improve data analysis
kapatic capacity for the people that
have to make decision and that were
countable for the the money that was
injected into the system it was
important to build a reliable system
that would work with no possible excuse
not forget that we are in an environment
where you do not have electricity you do
not have the best access to to internet
and you have a very high level of
illiteracy so I won't even talk about
access using computer and we needed to
make sure that the service that were
provided at the the health facilities
wouldn't be disrupted by anything that
we wanted to introduce as technology
we're not doing technology for
technology and we also needed to build a
scalable system that could be reused for
other health area and it was very
important for us because there was a lot
of resources in before for HIV but there
is also a lot of concern for other areas
in health and 80 for example I think
Haiti is one of the last countries where
many people are dying from malaria and
so we need a system that could be easily
used by any other kind of health
information infrastructure that could be
needed so that was the the idea behind
this I'll show you
quickly what we've done and for the
first point enhance public awareness and
improve data analysis capacity it was I
think a very bold move because we
decided to put any non sensitive data we
decided to put it available to anyone so
anyone who can have access to to the to
the Internet can see actually what is
going on in the in the HIV service in
haiti so i'm giving you okay so if you
type wwewhc you you'll get this this to
this website here and we try to put as
much as much interest as possible to the
report and do any kind of information
data that you can gather from from this
from this system so if I go quickly to
to the the reports you I have reported I
can show like tables and I have
different areas different services that
are provided for HIV related to HIV for
example p it's actually in french i told
you that the language that the official
language was French in Haiti but PTM e
is is for pmtct is for it's a program to
prevent transfer of HIV from the mother
to the child and we have another area
like VCT it's like voluntary counseling
and testing so we have basically
different areas whether you have you
have a specific step of we report up or
available for example if i go to v CT
and i go and i want to know how many
people are tested for a specific period
in 80
I can go to this report and have it
available and make some analysis at
different levels because we try to
provide a transparent system for the
site at the site level the the the unit
that is providing the care service at
the regional so at the regional level to
know what is going on for a world region
and also at the national level to build
the national awareness so if you look at
this if you look at this at this report
here you see for example number of
people tested and I we've launched a
system in two thousand 04 and you can
see how this is that the numbers have
improved in in many years we started
with 58,000 here in two thousand 04 and
now we are more than 450,000 people that
we have for it we have tested for 2008
so you can see with one trend you can
see how to analyze it I can choose
another another report all the report
all the reports use basically the same
approach if I go there I want to see the
number of a pregnant women tested in HIV
positive you see I can have this view
where I see all the information for
specific period there are chosen october
two up two up to august and i can see
all the institution how they are
performing this is actually the number
of pregnant women that have been tested
in this site for this period and this
information is public so if i have
managers health managers that what you
know exactly what is going on in their
area they can do it side by side and
they can do the analysis even side by
side so i have this
kind of table here where I see all the
sights of course I can choose my own
parameters choose the the period choose
a specific region or choose a specific
set of health health health providers
but for each of them I can click here
and see the trend of the specific
indicator that i'm following for example
it's it's interesting to look at this
kind of of graphs because you can see
how the level of service offered by the
site for specific indicator for example
if I'm trying to see what is going on on
for for pregnant women in Haiti I could
I should ask myself for example what
happened in March why did we have such a
drop a bit between two months and you'll
have person well I've learned a lot
meanwhile you have person that could
easily interpret that for example in
march this is the the carnival time you
have people that a lot of free free days
and you have people that are living the
area to go in indian in in other places
so you have less days of services or
things like that they can interpret and
they can figure out maybe we should add
some more stuff or we should change the
they have the ability to take decision
and that is the basic the basic thing
that we want to do provide with this
kind of system we have also the
possibility to see all the reports that
this specific site have have a half have
provided for the period example if I
want to make more more more analysis I
just have to click here and I'll see for
this site all the reports this is the
I'll get back to it too
to show you that all the reports are all
the information that are available on
this on the site or in fact collected
from the health facilities that provide
monthly report using the internet every
month and I can see they're all the
aggregate report that this site of
providing so I can actually look at the
wool reporter for each month I have with
Chism from october to august but the
last information available is from july
and this gives a more larger idea of
what's going on i can do the same
analysis by region because maybe someone
who has to make some decision at the
central level doesn't have to go side by
side to see what is going on but it's
very important for this person to be
able to to see what is going on in the
region and there we take the same basic
approach where we use all the reports
that the aggregate report that are given
each month by the sites to compile the
information by any kind of aggregation
for example here for four with general
information we can do it also by by
health networks or by by specific health
facilities and there for example I can
make the same analysis at the site level
that I can do at the regional level for
example I can see the trend for the
specific indicator for the period I've
chosen and with this I can have many
different kind of analysis that I can
make example if I want to see the how if
I want to analyze only one specific
indicator I can see graphically the mean
the median and the standard deviation
and things like that for one specific
indicator and make some more
analysis and finally take some decision
for the future and see actually how the
decision is impacting the reality so you
have all the reports if you understand
how one report works is the same for all
the other the reports we also try to
provide the same the same visibility
access to information using maps and
this is one one thing that were working
as a prototype to see how we can use for
example Google map to do to do that now
we're we're not having google map yet
but we can provide we can provide this
kind of for example for if i wanna see
information about tests provided for the
different regions there i have the the
country and i see the different way
we're regions how the the testing is
distributed and i can click on one
region to see to our access to more
detail for this region and see link it
to two other kind of graphical
information for example where i can see
the location of the site I can see the
roads and I can see compare the level of
access to other kind of information like
population like infrastructures and then
and take like that so this is basically
open to a to as to everybody I didn't
have to enter any access code here and
there's also an interesting part this
was a little tricky also we still wanted
to make sure that everybody could have
access to this kind of feature is the
fact that you can actually see all the
site who's
a who's late in info for for data
collection who's providing data with
errors and you have this kind of tables
for example here where I have for one
department let's say I'm responsible in
one in one region and I want to see if
everybody is on time if everybody is
providing the reports correctly I can go
to this kind to this screen and see
exactly that for example this
institution did this institution hasn't
provided is report for the last two
months and I can compare it to other
kind of institution so that means there
you have a tool that that can empower
people to make some some some follow-up
to know exactly what's going on and to
be able to take some action about about
what's going on and this is this is for
example we have many different data
collection tool and all this is is is
very flexible in the system you can
easily add a new a new data collection
tool or modify an existing data
collection tool and have this this kind
of monitoring screen as as as we we call
it so this this is very interesting
because it also helps see the status of
the data collection with color codes and
also the the forms that probably have
some error on them so you see what this
department there will be definitely a
validation session where people will go
actually to the sites and verify what's
going on at the site level so this is
all this is open and is available this
are theirs are not sensitive data in a
non sensitive because they do not
concern private information
personal information they could be
sensitive because it's really important
for the site performance but making it
public makes makes it make them more
responsible rhythm more responsive also
and that was at an important point for
for what for the for the system the
other part so this is where you go to
actually see the data the other part of
the system is actually the people that
goes to enter the information so i'll
i'll try to login as user at the site
level there i definitely need to get
username and a password and the security
the definition of the users link the
users to their specific sites so once
they enter their data they are directly
they go directly to their own area which
is secured and where we are sure that
everybody is responsible for the data
that it is provided under under system
so the person who's entering that I see
this kind of a screen he has the his
pending reports and for the pending
reports he has all the areas that he
should be reporting and if I go to the
one specific area you see the function
is very simple with two buttons want to
it to edit and save and the other to
validate the data so the principle is
very basic they had to do the same thing
on paper before now we're asking them to
do it on paper but also on the
electronic system this are none
sensitive that I means that of course we
try as much as possible to make sure
that all the sites has electricity they
have access to the internet but we are
also trying to build in
system with no excuses so if you do not
have act rissa t if you have a problem
well you'll put this on your piece of
paper and you'll go to the nearest a
internet internet shop or you'll send
the paper to the nearest regional office
so you have many different way of
providing your report but you are
responsible in that that the basic thing
that's a basic thing that we're trying
to promote to the system you are
responsible for the data that you're
providing so this is very simple I just
click on the edit button so for this
this user was a link to a specific site
so he doesn't have to choose which site
is going to work for which report is
going to use all the reports is
automatically generated on a monthly
basis for example if the site is
providing testing and counseling you
will have access to the testing report
is if the site is providing for example
drugs 4444 for HIV patient you will have
access to to the to the and all this is
managed at the central level so it's
very easier to to make sure that
everybody has access to what you can
actually do so if you just have to click
on the edit button and then makes make
the changes and then save it okay the
system is also configured to detect some
basic errors for example the number of
people HIV positive cannot be more than
the number of people tested it would be
strange so we have this kind of a simple
analysis that is also done basically by
by by the system and then he you have
someone entering the data and saving it
it's very interesting because when you
save it it's in one database were used
to that
before because each region has had its
own database before we're trying to do
have one one single database now and the
second button is very interesting
because it allows them if you are not if
you you do not have to fill the report
when you have all the information you
can start to fill your report and then
keep it in your area but once you you
you have finished with your reports and
you click on the validate button it's
like that what they have before it's
like the fact that you take your report
and you send it to another level so if
you send it to another level you cannot
make changes to it anymore and this
other level will have to make some
analysis some validation to approve it
or return it to you if there is some
some error it's also important because
they won't change your data because you
are responsible for your data if they
detect that something is wrong they'll
send it back to you to make sure that
you can provide some comment and the
comment is also interesting because I
can actually add a comment for for each
information that entering so it's also
easy interesting to have met that
information to the the actual numbers
that that you are entering and you can
share this kind of comments between the
validation level at the regional level
at the national level and at the site
level so all this also stays in database
so so this person this I entered as a
person who has only access to two data
entry so you can only see the pending
reports and the report that have been
rejected we turn because someone at the
validation level found that they were
dead there was something something wrong
with with the poodle boy so it's
basically only when we're training these
people is basically training them
know how to use these two buttons and it
goes very fast and we want to make it as
simple as possible i will now log in as
an administrator the system i won't have
time to to go to spend a lot of time
under the hood of the system but we
wanted to make sure also that it was as
much flexible as possible and all the
data collection tools even all the
reports are things that an administrator
can just design in the system one one
important thing also that we we have
learned in building and putting in place
the system is that we wanted to make
sure that we were asking the people at
the site level that the health providers
to make the list as possible because it
was definitely adding to what they had
to do before and for example this led us
to consider the opportunity to link our
aggregate data system to the EMR system
were all the patient records were
maintained so that the electronic system
could generate the monthly report by
itself so so then you wouldn't have you
wouldn't need someone to actually go and
spend some time computing the aggregate
reports and it can also be used as a
comparison system between between
comparison of validation system also so
i'll well we're running out of time
today we have more than 150 sites for
HIV but what we're trying to do now is
trying to use the same system you see
it's basic to expand it to more things
so that will mean that much more sites
will have access to this and we could
use it for we're making we may
we're launching something for TB and
malaria so we have three health program
and then we will be able to expand it a
little more not all the sites had them
we have I think less than twenty percent
of them with the capacity actually but
we started also with the fact that we
needed something that would work even
without it of course we had succeeded in
in providing all the sites with the the
environment that was needed and I I must
tell you that this project was piloted
by the CDC office in 80 and they've put
a lot of your effort in in creating the
environment providing electricity
providing internet access and it has
been a wool machine but we also keep in
mind that it does have to work even
without all this access to do to
technology yeah
exactly or or he goes to a cyber an
internet coffee shop internet cafe and
you can he can enter or you can go to
the original and they have many
different way to to to do that I think
that we're running out of stock we
started in 2004 and we started to gather
the first set of data at middle of 2004
and well it has evolved a lot since 2004
we add a lot of new features and letter
we also learned a lot in and it could be
more more more efficient I think I think
I've been running out of time I see
there that the word our is are almost
gone so I'll go quickly to say that we
have made basically a system with many
different layers this is the layer where
we are manipulating aggregate data there
are other layers for the electronic
medical records where we have more than
90,000 individual medical records in
Haiti we are also trying to introduce
well it has already been done case
notification or HIV where we have a
unique central database where any HIV
case detected is reported to and we are
also trying building all this kind of
infrastructure to make sure that we
build a consistent system keeping in
mind that we have many challenges like
person personal identification how do
you make sure that you can identify the
person who may be basic but we have
fifty percent of the population eighteen
eighty or may or may be more that is not
identified and we have also
all different kind of challenges where
we what we can improve the system and
make sure that it is much more available
much more easy to use and much more
interesting much more efficient so I'll
stop there just to make sure that we
have enough time to to get some
questions maybe firm from people that
are not also in that in the end aside
with us people on the on the VC if
you've got some questions please pipe up
hi I've got a quick question how does
this stuff integrate with projects like
openmrs or dhis okay that's an
interesting question but because it's
been challenging for us well we have
basically three different EMR systems in
place in haiti and one of them it's is
the easy-open is is really an adjusted
version of the open source system and to
build the case notification as most
other people who are receiving care of
over four for HIV now have a medical
record we're trying to build a layer on
top of the EMR for the case notification
where the the EMRs sends electronically
the the case notification to the
national database we use for this the
hl7 standard to communicate between
between the that between the EMR and the
new layer that we are building for case
notifications and we also well we also
we're also using hl7 to to share
aggregate information from the EMR em
each team that each team working on
on a specific EMR works develop the
specific reports that we need on a
monthly basis to send it in an xml file
format the list other question from
remote sites questions in New York of
one question you talked about you know
bringing up having all this aggregate
information eventually lead to like a
change in the policy of these people or
you know create a sense of
responsibility for all the like the
different stakeholders as well as have a
place where it's all aggregated so that
people who are able to affect the policy
changes are able to make good decisions
is there a way for you to see whether
that's actually you know actually that's
like playing out the way you imagined
well I must tell you that we did it we
took a lot of time to build a trend
around or around the system to actually
have the people understand that it is an
interesting system at the national level
we had a strong involvement in the
management thing to make sure that you
have follow-up to make sure that there
are each region and for each site
basically someone who is responsible to
provide the information and also at the
at the decision level someone that at
least goes to see what is going on and I
can see in the trend for each indicator
what must be improved and actually
measure at the at the at the end of each
period what what went wrong and what was
good and one interesting thing that I
didn't have time to show to show in this
system that is that there is also
performance analysis schema where at the
beginning of the year each site has to
define his objectives and they do that
with the decision-makers at the regional
level and at the national level and then
with this system you can automatically
compare what the objectives with the
results and you can have session
discussions around the real facts and
this is I think one thing that helped
change a lot the perception of the
system of course well it was easier at
the aggregate level then at the EMR
level but any level which are also not
to disrupt the normal activities that
you have on the site and we use the
people resources that are available but
you make sure we make sure that they
understand that introducing this or that
makes them work better make them make
make them more efficient in what they
have to do and we also try to listen to
them also to understand what works and
what will definitely not be acceptable
and we've had this kind of issues in the
last four or five years so we've adapted
a lot with learn a lot from the
technology part and we succeeded in in
having enough enough with learning from
them and building something that was
really adapted to what they needed so we
were only enablers not people that were
coming with a way to work a new way to
work that definitely wouldn't work then
I have one last quick question at the
beginning you said you mentioned that
actually when you study your project you
know for there was almost no cell phone
and now we went up to i think you should
twenty eight percent of people having
cell phone Coon yet could you use it as
a way for people to enter the data yes
we're actually thinking about this how
we can use well to two aspects oh how we
can use the GPRS of acidity to for
network access to and for access to the
internet because it costs a lot to to
provide the access to the internet as in
very remote location now that we have a
good coverage with with the set cellular
this is one thing how to use the GPRS or
to access the internet and second how to
use the phone itself to provide either
helpdesk facility where you can actually
call and talk to someone or send SMS or
other a kind of communication using
you're using your your your cell phone
so this is definitely a way that we want
to explore reflecting reflecting back on
starting the project almost five years
ago now or more than five years ago if
you if you were doing it over what would
you do differently that's a tough
question
the may be the first thing that we
didn't figure out at the beginning was
that we wanted to we had to make sure
that the system was as much flexible as
possible when we started we thought that
the data collection needs they were
fixed and they wouldn't change so we
built a system with the data collection
tool that were provided and when the
first time they they they called us to
to tell that the data collection tool
has changed well it was was tough and
but we took with a good lesson from that
and and we've tried to build the system
as much flexible as possible so we have
many parameters that we can change and
adjust to make sure that the system fits
any kind of situation that that you can
imagine that for aggregate the data
collection system there's also maybe
that we are very concerned about the
performance and we are actually seeing
well from the techno technological side
how we could improve the performance of
the of the of the site and also improve
the data usability make it more more
user friendly to people that are not
into the system and this is well basic
challenges that will have to face and in
the next the next month
thank you very much that's fascinating
thank you very much has been a pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
