I'm running user experience over for CCC
well across the street and building 47
and thanks for coming
Peter and I have been friends for a long
time I just want to take this take a
second to introduce you to him we in
fact we were just talking about how we
knew each other and couldn't quite
pinpoint it going back many many years
he's done he's really one of the fathers
of the discipline of information
architecture and I'm gonna let him give
you a lot of background on himself and
the work that he's done but I've seen a
version of this presentation before and
it's really fantastic and incredibly
appropriate to what we're doing here so
please help me welcome Peter morville
thank you thanks Jeff and thanks
everyone for being here this afternoon
it's my first visit to Google so it's
very exciting for me what I'm what I'm
just a couple of sort of housekeeping
messages one there is a URL at the end
of the presentation where you can access
the slides online and secondly I will be
mentioning Google and showing Google
screenshots and that's not especially
for you I do that all the time with all
sorts of audiences so I'm actually a
great Google sales person out there my
my background is in library information
science I went through the program at
the University of Michigan back in 1992
and 3 and since that point I've really
been doing what started out is taking
sort of showing that the principles of
librarianship could be applied in the
online environment but that very quickly
morphed into a more of a multi
disciplinary effort and and and and so
as Jeff mentioned what I ended up doing
is helping to pioneer and shape what
became known as the field of information
architecture and my my sort of bias or
perspective comes very much as a
consultant working with a lot of large
companies and government agencies and
helping them to make sense of their
websites and intranets
what I'm going to talk about today is
sort of briefly information architecture
and some issues that we're dealing with
in the present and then sort of launch
off into ambient findability in the
future now in the first edition of our
polar bear book we managed to write a
whole book and not provide a single
concise definition of information
architecture and so of course our
friends and colleagues would make fun of
us and say you know we really don't know
what this information architecture thing
is so in the second edition we went
overboard and provided four definitions
and of course people still complain that
we don't really know what it is when I
explained it to my mom I just say well I
organize websites so people can find
what they're looking for but of course
information architecture isn't limited
to the web and it's not only focused on
findability as I'll explain one of the
messages that I find myself repeating
over and over to folks in business and
government is the importance of
providing multiple ways to find the same
information and this example from
Stanford sort of shows that you know
they don't they provide a topical
organization but they don't stop there
they also have some good starting points
for some of their key audiences they
don't rely on the org chart but they
don't throw it away either and so we've
got organization by department in school
and we've got an alphabetical index of
sites and a search interface right so
multiple paths to the same information
this example from Consumer Reports sort
of another issue that that we sort of
grapple with in designing websites is
you know how do we use the kind of one
or two word major category labels to
represent a massive collection of
information that's a lot of pressure to
put on one or two words and this example
from Consumer Reports sort of shows you
know the presentation of sample sub
categories helping to bubble up to the
surface a few sample sub categories to
improve
sent of information help people who are
kind of visually scanning the page to
recognize what they're looking for and
move in more quickly now I've always
viewed information architecture is a
sort of an element of the user
experience and many of you are probably
familiar with Jesse's diagram which kind
of shows the importance of recognizing
that we're not only dealing with
software challenges but also information
challenges and there's a variety of
perspectives and methods we can put on
the table from from both sides and the
importance of of layers of recognizing
that we can't just dive in and design
the interface but we need to build on a
foundation of understanding user needs
and business goals and developing scope
and structure and strategy and so forth
I like this recent recreation of Jeffy's
Plains diagram which puts strategy along
the bottom and kind of shows the
importance of strategy formation being
informed by not just you know scope but
also structure and skeleton and surface
and the importance of the folks who are
forming strategy to have a pretty good
understanding of the various elements or
building blocks the raw materials with
which they're creating a user experience
and then there's my sort of contribution
to the the definition of user experience
this is my my user experience honeycomb
and you know a few years ago I started
to get really sick of the word usability
that's a good word and folks like Jakob
Nielsen did a great job in the 1990s of
blasting that word and everybody's heads
and when I talk with executives about
their goals for the redesign of their
site without fail when I say well what's
your goal they'll say well we want to be
more usable I'll say great what does
that mean right the problem is that the
word usability has sort of grown and
grown until it's almost synonymous with
quality so I used this honeycomb diagram
to try to tease apart some of the other
qualities of
user experience that we should be
striving for and I argue that first of
all is as practitioners as people who
are intimately familiar with the medium
and the technology and the behavior of
users we need to have the the guts to
ask the tough question is it useful
could it be more useful or are there
other ways in which we might try to
achieve these goals we still need to
worry about usability and do testing on
our own products and prototypes but we
don't want to stop there we also need to
strive for desirability and we have to
worry about issues like image and
identity and brand with respect to
findability anybody who's developing a
website and I sort of invite folks to
ask three questions can our users find
our website can they find their way
around our website and can they find our
products and services and information
despite our website and thanks to Google
that third question is sort of
increasingly the most important one
accessibility is our site accessible to
people with disabilities and and by the
way by folks with mobile devices
credibility is BJ Fogg at Stanford has
done some interesting work looking at
what are the elements that influence
whether people trust what we're telling
them on the web whether they believe our
information and sure enough visual
design and information architecture have
a tremendous impact on people's quick
snap judgments on should I trust this
information and then I include valuable
in the middle just to remind folks that
while we need to be designing for the
experience and the user we also need to
be make sure making sure that that
experience is advancing our mission or
our business goals and you know this
diagram invites us to sort of tease
apart these elements and if we are
redesigning a site we may we may say we
don't have the budget or the time to do
a full scale redesign so let's do a
credibility audit and look at what are
the top two or three ways we can improve
the credibility of our information
also invites us to look at ways in which
these qualities influence one another
and let me provide an example so you
know this is the web's equivalent of
location location location where do I
come on a Google search for the keywords
that are meaningful to my business and
it goes without saying that you know you
increase you get up in the top view hit
the results on Google you're gonna
increase your traffic or a number of
hits what's less intuitive but it's been
shown through research is that people
tend to trust the results to come up
high in that search they assume hey this
must be the expert these folks are the
authority I can trust them can give them
my credit card information so find
ability and credibility are increasingly
interwoven and by the way I showed this
slide at Harvard Business School last
year and there were audible gasps in the
audience they were horrified to be only
number two so let me kind of just
provide a real quick case study here
over the last several years I've been
doing work with the National Cancer
Institute and the first project I worked
on was the most important a redesign of
the cancer gov portal and when I started
working with these folks it became
obvious they had a very traditional web
design or user experience design
perspective they wanted to improve
people's ability to get from the
homepage to the key destination content
and to their credit more so than many of
my other clients they've done a lot of
research to understand who's visiting
our site and what are they looking for
and they knew that despite the fact that
doctors and researchers are very
important political audiences more than
95 percent of the actual users are
members of the general public people who
have been recently diagnosed with cancer
or their friends and family and these
folks as quickly as possible navigate to
what they call their cancer type home
pages really rich sets of links
assembled around more than a hundred
cancer types
now being a findability fanatic i
started asking questions like well how
do people get here in the first place
and they said I don't worry about that
you do a search on Google or Yahoo on
cancer and we come up as the number one
or two hits so people can find us but I
did worry about that I did a little bit
of digging and I found that that sure
enough the single most common search
term was cancer but they're an awful lot
of searches being done on cancer types
in fact more than 70% of the searches
were on specific cancer types and the
problem was and still is to some degree
that when you search on melanoma for
instance NCI is content which is very
comprehensive and authoritative often
does not come up in the first page of
Google results we get special
specialized sites like melanoma com
sponsored by a pharmaceutical company
pushing their drugs so I sort of argued
to my clients and I'm still working on
them that they can't view that their
mission is not to design a great website
right their mission is to make all of
this valuable information much more
accessible and findable to the citizens
who ultimately paid for and need that
information but in any case we went
through a redesign we focused on
findability internally and externally
and the site was was quite a big success
another project worked on the last
couple years was with a sort of one of
the library database vendors Cambridge
scientific abstracts and this was a fun
project for a couple of reasons one was
we started with such a horrible
interface that there was a great
opportunity for improvement and and
secondly it was the the first time I've
actually been able to design at least
one interface for librarians and
basically be able to design for people
who speak boolean the problem that these
folks had is is a problem that occurs
throughout libraries and library
databases and that's that they very
often force the user to select the
database before they
form the search and most users don't
know which database their answer lies in
so we you know sort of designed a much
simpler google-like search interface
that that that certainly has been a
success but throughout the project as we
sort of thought about the challenges of
designing for a vendor of information
that is purchased by libraries and
accessible only within particular
domains is that these folks just have
all these massive barriers that are set
up it's not you know how does the
student or the faculty member know to go
to CSA's database in the first place and
know the library has that information I
was working with another vendor talking
it at their event last week
Thompson Gayle and they'd come up with a
pretty innovative solution to this
problem they created a website called
access my library comm and what they did
is is basically published you know these
kind of placeholder pages with
abstracting and indexing information and
a sample paragraph or two and these are
sort of you know just put out there on
the public web so they get indexed
somebody finds this placeholder and they
can then type in their zip code get a
list of nearby public libraries and if
they're a member of any of those
libraries they can type in their barcode
number from their library card and then
get access to this information through
their library it was a really a smart
strategy that made a lot of sense
because it's sort of a win for the user
and the library and the database vendor
unfortunately when I started trying to
actually find some of these articles via
Google I couldn't and you know I sort of
ultimately discovered by searching on
like keyword phrase plus the access my
library domain name that most of their
stuff has been relegated to what the
search engine marketing industry calls
google hell the supplemental result
index and so I was sort of talking with
these folks and saying you know your
strategy made sense but because of
issues of duplication of content that
other folks have access to the same
information there still have some more
more barriers to break down and then
finally I was I was also last week at
the University of Michigan's conference
on called M library 2.0 how many of you
folks will have heard of web 2.0 maybe
not so many of library 2.0 but what was
really exciting to me is not so much
that librarians are starting to become
more comfortable with the technology and
the concepts of web 2.0 but that there
was a genuine enthusiasm for embracing a
lot of these technologies and approaches
and the sort of the openness and for
really innovating and the ways that
libraries serve their customers and and
so that to me is very exciting so now I
want to sort of shift and talk about the
future and I would argue any architect
whether physical or digital systems has
to have one foot in the past and one
foot in the future we've got to learn
from the lessons of those who have gone
before us in our own painful experience
but we're always designing for the
future we're designing systems that may
not be launched for 6 or 12 or 18 months
and we're designing systems that will be
used much longer we're designing the the
legacy systems of tomorrow
and for me findability has provided a
sort of an interesting lens through
which to to sort of examine the future
now learning from my own experience in
the first edition of the Lemur book I
provided definitions and you know let me
just tease these apart a little you can
talk about findability at both the
object and the system levels so we could
take any object whether physical or
digital and we can ask what are all the
different ways that somebody might find
this object and
how might we make it more findable
across channels and platforms and so
forth and then we can also talk about
the degree to which a system or
environment supports wayfinding and
navigation and retrieval and here you
see that we're sort of we're seeing the
intersection of information retrieval
with wayfinding in the physical world
and I and I think those are coming
together in some real interesting ways
now ambient Rifat refers to surrounding
or encircling or enveloping and and so
ambient findability refers to a world in
which we can find anyone or anything
from anywhere at anytime and this is not
necessarily a goal there are a lot of
scary privacy implications we're already
bumping into and we'll never quite reach
the destination for all sorts of reasons
such as the ambiguity of language we're
never going to achieve perfect
findability but we're certainly headed
in this general direction and it's
interesting to look at some of the
signposts along the way now back in the
good old days of the Middle Ages we
didn't have so much information people
really treasured their books they
chained them to desks and if you
borrowed a book and you failed to return
it or you damaged that book you didn't
get some measly library fine you were
cursed forever okay like I said these
were the good old days when librarians
had real power okay now many folks are
still living in this sort of world of
information poverty there's a real
inspiring book called leaving Microsoft
to change the world in which a
high-flying Microsoft executive gets
burned out goes out hiking in the
mountains of Nepal comes across a little
schoolhouse and sort of bustling with
kids and the teachers they're really
welcoming and they kind of give him a
tour of the schoolhouse and they kind of
end with a quick look in the library and
he doesn't doesn't want to be impolite
but there were no books and so he says
you know excuse me but but where are the
books
and teacher says oh let me grab my key
and he runs and he kind of opens up this
little cabinet and inside are three
books one of which is a Danielle Steel
romance novel and the sad fact is that
the only books they have are ones that
have been left by travellers and so he
sort of vows
you know I will bring back books and he
does more than that he goes on to found
a very successful nonprofit that's been
bringing libraries and schools and
computers and books to developing
nations and so it's kind of worth
remembering that you know we're not all
living in the quit in the same world for
most of us you know we have different
problems right we're drowning in
information we're suffering from
information anxiety we're creating
absurd amounts of information every year
and it just gets worse and I in this
world I think that Herbert Simon's
insight a wealth of information creates
a poverty of attention is really
important or if you prefer Dilbert's
version information is gushing towards
your brain like a fire hose aimed at a
teacup now folks in advertising and
marketing may see this as a challenge we
need to have more winking blinking
banner eggs we need gas stations to talk
to us while we're filling up our cars we
need to fight for people's attention you
know I would argue that you know we
should be asking a couple of questions
one practical and one philosophical on a
practical note in a world where it's so
hard to get our customers attention
shouldn't we do everything we can to
make our products and services and
information findable so they can find
what they need when they need it
shouldn't we shift our investment from
push to pull and on a philosophical note
in a world where we can increasingly
select our sources and choose our news
what is this doing it to the ways in
which we learn and make decisions and
are our decisions getting better or
worse as a result of course it's only
gonna get stranger I was at a conference
a few years back and David Rose the
founder of ambient devices gave a
wonderful show-and-tell presentation in
which he first
of all showed off the ambient orb okay
this is a attractive orb it's a wireless
device you can sit it on your desk at
home or at work and via the web you can
customize it to pay attention to various
channels of information whether it's
local traffic or weather or your stock
portfolio and so you can tell your orb
if my stock starts to fall past a
certain point I want you to pulse bright
red and I'll know what to do the ambient
pinwheel is a really interesting
proof-of-concept they hook these things
up to people's desks and then wirelessly
to people's email inboxes and so while
you're working on a presentation or a
spreadsheet is your inbox fills up this
pinwheel starts to spin faster and
faster until you've got this sort of
hurricane force coming at you and you
say hey I better check email and see who
needs me you know what's interesting
here is that we're just at the beginning
of starting to see all sorts of
alternate interfaces to digital network
information right just in the last few
weeks we saw announcements about
Microsoft Surface and this sort of
notion of a interactive digital tabletop
and we're gonna see all kinds of you
know what we think of now is as weird
and wacky interfaces simultaneously
we're importing just incredible amounts
of information about the physical world
and physical objects into our digital
networks and of course Google is sort of
leading the charge in this area we
there's already a tremendous amount of
metadata about the physical world at our
fingertips and you know via the glory of
mashups you know there's even further
aggregation happening as these masses of
data are put into really useful
applications
we're also I think at the beginning of a
really interesting convergence where we
serve our mobile devices our
BlackBerry's and trios which are great
for you know checking email while you're
speeding down the highway at 75 miles an
hour you know they're gonna become even
more interesting as they become location
aware and I think we have yet to really
figure out exactly what we're gonna do
with devices that know where they and we
are this is my favorite device for
scaring people about the future it's a
it's a wristwatch that until recently
you could buy on Amazon you buy it for
your child and with a little key fob you
can lock it onto their wrist and it's
got built-in GPS unit and so via the web
you can track the location of your child
and it's even got a nifty bread crumbing
feature so you can see the path they've
traced over the course of the day now
what's interesting is the product was
temporarily discontinued if you look on
Amazon and the customer reviews you
don't see any concerns about privacy
mentioned these are all complaints that
the product doesn't work well enough all
right which makes sense because it's
sold as a product for making keeping
your kids safe and yet GPS doesn't work
indoors the battery doesn't last very
long okay but what's what's interesting
to me is there is a real market demand
for these kinds of products the
technology is just about there and we
are going to be forced to make decisions
about how do we want to use this
technology and what contexts do we feel
comfortable with it now this guy Tim
feels comfortable by with everyone
knowing where he is 24 by 7 he's sort of
showcasing the technology and anybody
can watched him drive to work and move
around during the course of the day and
I wouldn't be surprised if most of us
are using this kind of application
within the next three to five years but
only if we can control who has access to
the information and what's the degree of
precision or specificity right because I
might feel okay with my colleagues
knowing
which building I'm in but not which room
I'm in right you don't need to all know
that I'm in the bathroom right now
and I think that you know all of this
stuff you know is kind of tangled up in
the excitement around the the Apple
iPhone this idea that we're you know
finally really gonna have the web in our
pocket right not some crippled version
but a full-featured version of the web
and that before long Tim's gonna be able
to wander around with his iPhone and
kind of watch himself move on Google
Maps or Google Earth I was at the
O'Reilly emerging technology conference
last year and Bruce Sterling the science
fiction writer gave a great keynote
about the Internet of Things and he
argued that because the amount of time
it takes technologies like RFID to sort
of propagate throughout society it's
it's gonna be probably 30 years until
the Internet of Things is fully realized
and I agree with Bruce it's it probably
will be about 30 years until he can lie
in bed and Google his bedroom to find
his socks but the Internet of Things is
already starting to happen all right
we've got products like Cisco's wireless
location appliance of you know within a
wireless network area you can use RFID
to tag and track high-value objects and
we're seeing cases like this one in a
hospital environment where apparently
they're always losing their wheelchairs
they're not stolen but they're misplaced
in the wrong room or a closet and they
spend an awful lot of staff time
searching for wheelchairs right so
they've been able to you know save a lot
of money and improve customer service by
tagging and tracking high-value objects
and you know I said things you're only
going to get weirder we've got this new
phenomenon of body hacking this is a
couple who had RFID tags embedded in
their hands so that they could open each
other's apartment doors and turn on each
other's TV
sets and they really viewed this as what
they call a modern declaration of love a
real you know room romance story and
then we've got Google Streetview which
you folks have probably heard about and
you know again you know we're seeing
this tension between you know some
tremendously useful and interesting
applications of technology but also some
some real privacy concerns that people
are raising and you know with respect to
privacy I'm not going to go any further
on that but I will refer you to David
Brin's book the transparent society it's
a wonderfully provocative treatment of
the subject in which he argues that the
rich the powerful already have the
ability to track our every movement and
the only question is do we want to be
able to watch the Watchers do we want a
transparent society but that's not the
real question that I'm here to talk
about today what I'm interested in is in
a world where our information haystacks
you know grow and in number and size how
do we create bigger needles how do we in
a world where for every object there are
hundreds or thousands or millions of
very similar objects how we describe the
unique about 'no so this object and
who's gonna help us with these these
massive findability challenges well it's
not gonna be Microsoft Bob or any of
Bob's children or grandchildren I'm a
big skeptic when it comes to the
potential of artificial intelligence or
intelligent agents to solve mainstream
information retrieval challenges and I
don't think it's going to be information
visualization either been some really
smart people create some fascinating
companies and some really beautiful
products that are fun to play with but
they haven't actually been useful for
finding what you're looking for and no I
don't think it's gonna be Don Rumsfeld
either although in this amazingly
articulate
a quote here he does he does hit on
something important that you know the
future is not going to be solely about
directed searching where we know what
we're looking for we're also going to
need tools and approaches for
identifying the unknown unknowns and
there are some really interesting
applications coming out of the national
intelligence industry and sort of
bleeding over into business intelligence
helping us to identify trends and
patterns and and and sort of find things
we didn't even know to look for but
who's really gonna help us the
librarians of course I wrote a article
back in the 1990s called revenge of the
librarians in which I argue that the
internet would turn everybody into a
librarian and I think it's already
happened if you followed the blogosphere
in the world of social software and
Tecna at ease you know that these people
can't shut up about metadata right the
stuff that used to live on the and the
library card catalog has now become sexy
right but of course this is not your
mother's metadata this is the the free
tagging and the folksonomies of Flickr
and delicious and there's almost a kind
of religious revolutionary zeal that's
kind of wrapped up with this notion of
free tagging right get rid of the
librarians the information architects
the taxonomy is the controlled
vocabularies and just let the users tag
stuff with anything they want and in
that sort of spirit David Weinberger
who's got a new book out called
everything as miscellaneous said the old
way creates a tree the new rakes leaves
together right so the old way it was
about taxonomy x' and tree structures
and the new is about these wonderful
self-organizing clusters when I saw that
I thought you know that's the perfect
metaphor because we know what happens to
those lovely piles of leaves we shuffled
through each fall
they very quickly rot when they return
to the ground where they become food for
trees which come in many shapes and
sizes and live a very long time okay now
I actually think David's book is
brilliant I think he's a really smart
guy I'm not sure he's totally fair to
librarians but I'm of course a little
biased and you know but I actually think
that the answer lies in in the genius of
the end and figuring out how do we bring
these traditional and and novel
organization approaches together and for
that I find insight in in the work of
Stewart Brand and his notion of pace
layering the idea that all complex
adaptive systems have it's important
that they have layers that can evolve or
change at different rates or paces right
and the the more stable layers of nature
and culture and government right they
provide us with a lot of stability we've
got the fast-changing layers at the top
that provided Jilla tea adaptability
learning and I think we need to we need
to think about our information systems
and environments along these lines with
the the tags and the folksonomies as
quick changing learning tools and
taxonomy x' and other traditional
approaches as as ways of providing some
stability and we need to look for
feedback loops to kind of tie those
together and we are starting to see an
increasing number of sites that find
ways to bring traditional taxonomy x'
together with tagging and if they're
smart they're creating those feedback
loops between the two systems of course
tagging doesn't work everywhere we've
seen it hasn't been super successful on
Amazon but it's not the tagging books
doesn't work because library thing has
has been tremendously successful the big
difference here has been that people
have been tagging their own books and
the social benefit is sort of secondary
and and the founder of library thing
actually wrote interesting our
just kind of teasing apart this this
question of when to tags work and when
when don't they okay my sir take on the
whole web 2.0 thing there's an awful lot
of traditional information architecture
that goes into designing the most
successful web 2.0 products a lot of
traditional ia and Flickr for instance
at the same time most of the world is
not doing web 2.0 right now and and so
there's still an awful lot of
opportunities outside that space so
what's the future of finding I still
think that 10 years from now we're gonna
be starting entering a few keywords into
a search box and hitting go and it
really is incredible
that in such a short time this kind of
search interface has become so
ubiquitous and and really has become
kind of a a prime interface for business
for government for health but does that
mean the end of browsing and navigation
and information architecture of course
not because at the end of that search
might be a page like this on Amazon
right at the other end of the design
spectrum right Amazon has you know
probably the the most dense information
interfaces on the planet an Amazon's
done tremendous amount of innovation
exploring what are all the different
ways we can enable people to browse and
navigate and personalize and filter and
so forth so there's not going to be you
know it's not going to be a
one-size-fits-all future when I'm
working with my clients you know half
the goal is can is sort of helping them
understand that the search is not just
about the software but it's a it's about
the whole system from understanding how
users search and what they're looking
for all the way through to scoping the
content describing the content and
designing the results interfaces so
people have a next step
you know I think it's important that we
look at both the long tail and the fat
head
you know distributed algorithmic
approaches work well in grappling with
the long tail certainly on large
websites we see that solutions like best
bets more centralized editorial or human
solutions can actually make a big impact
and have become really a best practice
probably the the the kind of work that
stands out to me from my library school
days has always been marcia bates work
on this kind of what she called the
berry picking evolving search model
where she showed that you know for any
important information seeking challenge
it's not about enter a few keywords find
something and you're done
the search process is very iterative and
interactive and the query evolves over
the course of the search and and so it's
very much a learning process and i would
argue that in today's sort of age of the
knowledge worker searches perhaps the
most important way that we're learning
so it's dangerous to think about just
optimizing for speed or for usability or
for time to find we don't want to lose
the opportunities for for a sort of
associative learning through that
process that's why i've really liked and
Decca's guided navigation model which
builds on faceted classification coming
from the world of library science which
allows people to get started with two or
three keywords but then gives them on
the left-hand side we see lots of
options for narrowing or refining their
search helping them to get a sense of
the scope of the stuff that they found
and giving them good ways of filtering
and you know that sort of guided
navigation approach has become fairly
ubiquitous in e-commerce environments
we've seen it increasingly on enterprise
sites and even library catalogs have
found ways to
create sort of a new catalog a new way
of exploring the catalog and then
there's good work at at Berkeley by
Marti Hearst showing how people actually
use guided navigation systems and some
of the the benefits over over other
models of search of course doing this on
the public web is pretty tricky because
of the massive scale of the challenge
and I'm actually pretty skeptical of
approaches like plus T where they're
sort of you know fully automated
categorization approaches because the
top-level categories you end up with
they're probably more confusing than
helpful I have been seeing and some of
my clients some real success stories and
hybrid solutions where humans create the
text the taxonomy and work closely with
the automated tagging software defining
rules doing you know sample example
based training and they've been getting
some really you know high kind of
quality measures out of that and of
course Google is you know experimenting
with guided navigation of various sorts
the you know the web images video is
sort of a form of that the refine
results for diabetes here you know in
the health areas another sort of form of
guided navigation of course you know the
tricky thing is that you know figuring
out where to fit this on the page
without overwhelming the user and I've
got a real simple suggestion you take
get rid of all these ads and I've been
really impressed by Flickr and their
automated clustering instead of trying
to derive some major category label they
let some of the sample tags speak for
themselves you know the important thing
is we're going to need to have
innovation right because the challenge
is just growing and growing and growing
right
google book search is just one example
where you know okay we take millions of
texts rescue them from these dusty old
libraries and make them searchable right
so there's there's an one more expansion
of what we think of as the searchable
web every Xing formally pod zinger is
pretty interesting service we're using
automated speech to text translation
technology they're able to take audio
and video podcasts and create a rough
transcript and then make that searchable
they've got a real nice interface where
you can scan through the transcript and
click on any word and start playing the
video or audio clip from that very point
on and when I first saw this a year to
ago sort of had one little light bulb
going off experiences where I thought
you know it's only a short matter of
time before the vast majority of video
and audio content becomes part of what
we think of is the searchable web it's
another dramatic expansion and of course
it's not going to be just broadcast
audio and video it's going to be you
know the YouTube generation user created
content it's going to be the sort of the
Wikipedia's articles of the world and so
you know we just keep seeing you know
sort of step changes and how much stuff
we're trying to provide access to and
it's not going to stay limited to
digital information people are already
experimenting with all sorts of crude
hacks enabling the placement of tags on
physical objects and in physical spaces
and you know I think this is going to
accelerate pretty rapidly in the next
few years and so we're gonna see an
increasing interconnection between
physical and digital experiences and
that's going to create some real
interesting challenges and opportunities
in that vein we've got delicious library
which allows you to scan the barcodes
of your music and videos and software
and games and so forth and then create
not automatically create a sort of a
personal library with you know be a
dynamic web lookup and what's
interesting about that is part of their
vision is to make this as a sort of a
social application so that we can create
a neighborhood library or a corporate
library so you know where everybody
knows you know where who's got that book
at this at this moment in time if you're
interested in kind of reading more about
this whole Internet of Things thing I
recommend taking a look at Julian
bleeker's work and and especially his
manifesto for networked objects where
you can learn what a blog jekt is also
Bruce Sterling's shaping things is a
really interesting look at what he calls
spine objects that are precisely located
in space and time that are where of
where they are and aware of their own
history and everywhere by Adam
Greenfield
where he really looks at the the sort of
the design challenges faced by
ubiquitous computing and I give him a
lot of credit for being brave enough to
tackle the ethical challenges of
designing for ubiquitous environments
now and sort of thinking about the
future you know it's a very tricky issue
because we all recognize that we can't
accurately predict the future and yet in
order to to sort of develop strategies
and make commitments to sort of really
kind of move forward aggressively we
have to make some big bets and in sort
of in that sort of course of strategy
formation I think it's important to you
know utilize a lot of different methods
for exploring possible futures I would
argue that the user experience design
actually has a lot of really valuable
methods because gaining insight into
what the users really want and how do
they really work and where are the gaps
and current solutions can really kind of
give you an advantage but but but we
should also be thinking outside the the
user experience toolbox and looking at
all sorts of methods from scenario
planning to forecasting and back casting
and and so forth to kind of help us
think a little more creatively I was at
the the interaction design Institute in
of RIA
and they sort of practiced this the sort
of notion of future design and you know
they threw up this image of a futuristic
Whirlpool washing machine that's you
know very organic and green and sort of
the slow washing movement and you know
it's it's it's amazing how an image can
stick in your head none of you will
probably ever forget that that washing
machine now you know as far as the
future of search there's all sorts of
candidates vying for you know what's
going to be the next breakthrough and
you know it seems like the future of
search was in certain respects was the
same back in the 1990's as it is today
people talk about personalization and
artificial intelligence and
visualization and natural language
querying and so forth but we've you know
we've seen some additions to that list
and you know
what I think's interesting is is you
know not only looking at all of these
possibilities but also looking at the
question of framing and I've been just
starting to take a look at it kind of
one of the earliest books on the subject
of frame analysis you know should we be
asking what's the future of search or is
that the wrong question right or is it
more what's the future of learning the
future of knowledge creation the future
of communication other couple of books
just related to this issue of thinking
about the future the Black Swan is a is
a kind of book that'll make your brain
hurt and scare you about the future
because he really talks about you know
the the impact of the highly improbable
events that we we don't expect we can
barely even see coming and yet can
dramatically change the landscape and
then the strategy paradox is is a real
interesting look at this this challenge
of developing a strategy and making the
big bets and moving ahead with at full
speed you know but but the the problem
that that really reduces your
adaptability your ability to respond to
change in the marketplace so just to
kind of wrap up as we head further into
this kind of mobile Wireless age I think
that Steve Krug's lesson don't make me
think is only going to become more
important right when we're hurtling down
the lot the highway at 75 miles an hour
we don't want to be you know you know
reading instructions or you know
scanning Google Maps we really just want
an arrow or an audio signal saying turn
left up here at the same time I think
it's really important that we don't stop
there that we don't just optimize for
efficiency or usability
that we sort of strive a little higher
and so let me kind of wrap up with a
quick story to illustrate that it's a
story that Peter Drucker the famous
management guru likes to tell and I like
to think of him as the other Peter
it's the story of three Stonecutters so
guys
wandering in the wilderness and he comes
upon a quarry and he's and he's not
really sure what's going on so he walks
up to to a stonecutter and he says what
are you doing and this guy says I'm just
making a living this is okay that's
that's not so helpful he walks up to a
second stone cutter now this guy he's
got his head down he's chiseling away he
says what are you doing
this guy can't really take the time to
look up he says I'm doing the best job
of stone cutting in the county I mean
he's a specialist a professional a
perfectionist he's focused he walks up
to a third guy and he says what are you
doing and this guy sir takes a moment
and stands up and with a bit of a gleam
in his eye he says I'm building a
cathedral so he's got the ability to
step back and see the bigger picture of
how he's contributing to society and and
you know what is motivating him to do
this work
and you know I've always thought of
libraries is more than just warehouses
of information and I've thought of them
to some degree as cathedrals of
knowledge sort of lifting is up and and
kind of inspiring us making us aware of
the human potential to create and share
knowledge and work together and my hope
is that as we move further into the the
Internet age that we that we that we
take some of those values with us and
that we also create and and share with
one another new sources of inspiration
right that we are kind of seeing the big
picture and what we're doing and that
we're not just marching forward with
this sense of some preordained kind of
techno utopian future but they were
actually taking the time to think about
a future that we want to create and that
we end up working towards desirable
futures so with that I'll wrap up and
thank you for your attention
yeah so I think we got five or six
minutes for a few questions so for that
washing machine how does it work they
actually kind of explained it vaguely
but it was very much set like way in the
future where they felt no responsibility
to fully have worked that out yeah so
should we all become search engine
optimizers and women that's just caused
an escalation and make for search engine
optimization job harder for new people
I mean it's there's there's definitely
you know a sort of a continuing
escalation in terms of making yourself
findable right you know used to you know
back in the early days of the internet
if you just you know followed a few
basic rules in terms of making your
information clear and not locking it all
into some giant image file then you'd be
pretty findable but now you know the
competition is pretty fierce
you know I'm not I'm not really sure any
way around that because we're just
dealing with an expanding information
environment and we need a variety of
algorithms whether it's you know I mean
you know I mean popularity is one but is
a variety of algorithms for trying to
figure out what are we going to show
people first so but now I wouldn't say
we should all become SEO experts there's
a few other jobs that need doing in the
world I have a quick question for you
yeah do you think about search an awful
lot if you had sort of a magic wish and
you could change one thing about Google
what would you what would you want to
fix well that's that's kind of easy
because Google just rolled out the
universal search I'd like to fix that
because because I you know my my sort of
and I've only played with it a few times
and of course you have to do certain
searches to really get the full
universal experience and I don't like
the full universal experience at all
you know I sort of saw the you know the
sort of the rollout and some of the
talking about the thinking and this idea
that well people didn't know that you
know they could click on images to find
images or you know well I knew that
right and I can I used those tabs when I
wanted to but you know most of the time
I don't want to you know have you know I
want to be able to sort of choose which
kind of information I'm looking at and
so you know it's funny I was it I was at
Yahoo research in Barcelona few a few
days after Google Universal launched and
so we were talking about a little bit
and I said yeah I don't really like it
that's not maybe there are folks out
there may be the mainstream likes it but
you know me as an early adopter kind of
internet savvy person it doesn't work
very well for me and they said yeah
we're really confused we think it they
might just be kind of teasing it you
know they're sort of trying to get us
all to copy them and then they're gonna
kind of pull back on it
so you know I'd be real interested you
know to hear all the secret stuff about
you know the why and the how is it going
stuff but you know I guess my my
thinking is that it provides a little
bit of a window into the future of
search and in my opinion one size is not
going to fit all I'm a little skeptical
of whether personalization is really
going to solve problems and so I kind of
see a bit of a divergence where the
googles and the Yahoo's have to make
some choices over which audiences or
demographics are we going to please and
you know it may be that Google decides
we're going to go with the really big
audience but if in doing so Google may
lose the the kind of the early adopters
the folks who are like me who you know
knew that I could click on images to
find images so that's my answer I hope I
didn't offend anybody but
hi what are your thoughts on keeping
found things found I think that's a
really interesting project at the
University of Washington if that's what
you referring that specifically and I've
actually been serving as a tech reviewer
for a book that William Jones is writing
by that title and so it's been really
you know it's been interesting to kind
of look at all of these information
challenges really through the eyes of
the individual in this kind of notion of
a cloud of information that surrounds
each of us either and there's various
categories information that we have
created information that we own or have
in our possession information about us
that maybe we don't own but we you know
would like to have access to and so it's
just it's sort of a way of shifting how
we think about information and but it
also kind of forces this tricky issue
with respect to personalization you know
every time somebody does a search I
don't know they looking for something
they are they trying to find something
they've already found before or they
trying to find something new and that's
kind of a fundamental question to
disambiguate queries that I think
everyone has a tough time with okay well
it's four o'clock Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
