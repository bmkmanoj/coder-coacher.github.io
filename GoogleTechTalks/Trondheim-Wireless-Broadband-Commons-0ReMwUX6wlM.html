hello please welcome our new solberg is
a professor of computer science at the
Norwegian University of Science and
Technology in Trondheim he also brings
with him his wife in gulberg who is also
a professor of computer science at the
same place she works on digital
libraries and information resource
management so if you have any questions
about that you can catch her later
meanwhile dot Solberg has some very
interesting things to tell us about
things he's been doing with Wi-Fi in the
city of trondheim so please welcome him
hi we've been very very interested in
getting in contact with you guys are
Google's after we saw all of the nice
writings in the newspapers about the
Wi-Fi net in Mountain View not to speak
of San Francisco and it's very hard to
get anything out of the newspapers
because they are short pieces you know
and and so we are very curious have been
very curious to see what what the
technicalities are what you're really
doing what and because we are trying to
do things in Trondheim and we are trying
then to to put a a wireless network in
place wireless broadband in place in the
city and I'm going to tell you a little
bit about that now and and also to talk
a little bit about some of this sort of
the political questions that that
naturally will arise because this is a
new dis new stuff and and I think
everybody are a little bit uncertain
about what the future will bring on this
we see that the telecoms for example
reacting in interesting ways sometimes
and
so on let me place ourselves on the map
and sound by a couple of a few pictures
first trondheim as your pops can I have
this work yeah is in Scandinavia it's on
the Norwegian coast it's 63 degrees
north so while I think Fairbanks is
Anchorage is fairbanks i think is 60 or
is it Anchorage it's a great place and
and I'll show you some pictures they let
me first say then that the way I mean
one of the reasons I came up here now is
that my wife and I spent a sabbatical
UCLA that the department computer
science still so we are there for the
screen so it's very convenient than two
so this is tron hein and here is the
main building or the university why is
not this way yeah as seen from downtown
downtown in a region is called mid town
or meet Ian / b is the norwegian term
for town so it's Middletown there was a
river gone through and we have some
high-rise buildings here and the next
picture then shows you the one of our
two main campuses as seen from the
opposite side so this is the main
bailing again and we got to got campus
buildings here and Midtown is basically
area down here see an a little bit out
here so Midtown as we define it is
around half a square mile
now the faculty of information
technology mathematics and electrical
engineering where I am serving as a Dean
Oh is situated here and we also got one
or the high-rise buildings here the town
looks something like this you say what I
just showed you i made a picture I mean
where the main building and university
campus is out up here then the picture
that I showed you cover most of Midtown
which is here which is around said half
a square mile then we have we have the
campus or a technical university which
is here we have student dorms which are
here and here and we have a campus for
the humanities which is up here we have
marine technology which is here and we
have some other facilities some other
buildings around here the distance from
the humanities social science campus
down to midtown is around for miles it's
six kilometers there is a bus the public
bus go one here where the yellow stuff
is and it takes around 20 minutes then
from from downtown and and over here I
mean if traffic is not too heavy and
traffic is never heavy we plan then 22
to build wireless network ten along this
route here to cover downtown
and they're also and a lot of students
living in the area here and we are also
negotiating them to have to have sort of
extended d the stuff the net over there
we know that there is there is no real
solution yet for vehicles in motion
there is the vibro experiment in your
pilot in South Korea but but it's not
sort of ready to take so there is we are
we are planning them to do this but but
it's not in the first I mean the first
thing that we'll be doing there is
another the green stuff here it reflects
plans then to to implement an
instrumented road I mean an IT
instrumented road for experimental
purposes but but that will be so so
there will be a little bit more advanced
and then then the bus stuff that we
otherwise would go to go plan to do in a
sort of more rough rough rough start
okay so let's let's say that what we
have now is plan stand for wireless
broadband in downtown Trondheim yes
approximately half a square mile of
outdoor area we want there to be
integrated with the wireless broadband
or the campus or of other campuses the
campus is altogether are around two
square miles outdoor and n5 million
square feet indoor areas as I hope it's
five million it's half a million four
hundred thousand square meters which I
think will translate to 25 million
square feet we have around quarter of
that covered already with Wi-Fi and the
goal is hundred percent Wi-Fi so we may
view the downtown Outernet as a
technical extension of the campus net
the long-term objective
is that we we have that everybody should
have will then be broadband for all
which would mean 30 to 50 megabit per
second access everywhere the constraint
of course as we know is that radio
frequencies are scarce which means that
we have to be to to base the Wi-Fi net
on on white backbone and we are sort of
in our thinking thinking that that the
wireless part would would only sort of
take the maximal with current technology
50 to 100 meters how to to the user from
the access point only on the white
background because if traffic is not to
have it and Emma can also sort of
substitute the white backbone weight
with a radio frequency communication but
but if the load sort of gets up 10
decimal question so we need a lot of
access points we could be the current
technology so question now is why now
and this is the sort of print out or the
traffic statistics of the campus and
shows them how they have the volume of
wireless internet traffic has increased
and from from
204 to 205 so it's approximately doubled
and it's going to double now also next
year so students are sitting everywhere
hand and with it their laptops and using
the facilities that we got already so
this coming is coming very fast we also
know that the development and of these
small stuff I mean the smartphones
everything is going very fast and and so
that's the way that's the way things are
we just have to do this and we have to
do it fast and and things will change
very very fast in the next years to come
because we have to realize this in
several steps with different
technologies so we are using like I
suppose most people would do now the 802
11 the technology and license frequency
garbage ban because users already have
Wi-Fi compatible devices this is what
the way we can can reach to uses the
complementation replacement on new
technologies for example wimax or the
802 16 technology brothers will of
course be a be done as they become
available and as they be as as the uses
equipment and will be able to take it
this is downtown and from I don't know
it as Google Earth but but and so
downtown here the river air and student
Welling dwellings up here or student
dwellings they have bought apartments
and stuff like that so it's pretty full
of 20 year olds very few 2 year olds and
even fewer 60 year olds
so this is the situation and what is
what we do them is to sort of course
building then with with a couple of
hundred couple of hundred access points
in this I'm a for those of you
interested in history this place here is
the harbour from which llave ericsson
started out his journey then to to
discover discover new fountain in
America he had spent the winter in
Trondheim with relatives and in the
summer of in the summer then he set out
to to go back to Greenland he stopped
them for for a couple of days in Iceland
and then came out into this terrible
storm which brought him them to new
founder I mean just for a digression
tacos but the next stage here what will
go something like this that we would
extend and we had to cope with the
technology available then the wimax why
bro all you're familiar with vibro no
okay why bro is a South Korean pilot
which they set up then for mobile mobile
situations for cars or auto stand to to
to to be able to take Bob and it's a
it's an animal right now I heard and the
reason is that they got into quarrel
with with the state's owned and
controlled television company in order
to have economy in the wild and they
have to offer downloading or television
to be able to charge for that and and
the state on television companies sort
of exerts their right and to my monopoly
on all television
it'll take a year or two I think then to
work this out most of the end result
cdma which is another another technology
and UMTS which you know cause then most
of the city now is covered by UMTS so so
so we already have a sort of half
megabit megabit coverage of a lot of the
city you see in the country there is a
very very high penetration of the adsl
broadband I would guess that that sixty
seventy eighty percent of all homes then
have have wired broadband in their homes
most of other kids are going around with
cell phones if you go into a fifth grade
i would guess that ninety percent of the
kids have a cell phone and people sort
of giving their decade cell phones in
order them to I mean they feel secure in
way so so it's a very very broad and
deep penetration of the technology
already among the population in general
okay so so this will be the next stages
and of course what we try to do then the
challenge is going to have a seamless
roaming with social mobility what does
this cost seems to us that the outer
investment is approximately 1 million
u.s. dollars per square mile it's a
little I mean maybe 1.2 million
something like that program I the indoor
investment is approximately ten times as
much annual operation and maintenance
the way we look at this will be around
fifty percent of the of the investment
cost if we now look at Trondheim
wheelchairs around 250 square miles
hundred seventy seventy thousand persons
we see that this translate stand if
everybody at live form if everybody pay
from from babies of six months until the
the old ones then
then it'd be sixty dollars per month and
of course this is impossible I mean it's
it's way too much maybe in mountain view
it will be ok because you have got
70,000 or something like that and a
couple of square miles I suppose and you
know this will then translate to
something which is achievable and okay
it does it doesn't because we have to
have a mixture technologies which brings
down to the price and we also tend to
believe that in order to have this to
really take off it isn't there is an
urgent need for for new network research
pretty much then on the radio technology
level into to be able then to to use the
frequency bands that we have in a much
more effective way but because this is a
sort of five six seven year yeah stuff
that we are talking about now what do we
want we want to go with this we want to
contribute to the future on a region
trade and industry with cutting-edge
expertise expertise and violet services
and programs as obvious we would like
them to try to create a world-class you
intubated laboratory for research and
development and wireless technologies
products and services and we would like
to make Trondheim and intend you more
attractive to students and technology
based business so so the last one here
is very important to us because we
suffer as all of the rest of the world
from the effect stand or the dot-com
collapse where the young ones are not
that interested in in they don't dare to
go into IT in in the way that they did
before we have to turn this around in
some way and this is one of the things
that we are trying to do what is unique
with what we are doing because we of
course we have we know that there are
many efforts it just now saw that arisen
is a new effort and in the City of
London where they also go out for one
square mile of wireless broadband we
tried them to to come up with
duality between rd and commercial
utilization we want to have a stable
network running on state-of-the-art
technology and so that we can implement
commercial services on that and
experiment with that and we want also to
have a platform for R&amp;amp;D and new products
so what we are doing then is 22 when we
are setting up what you call it the
brand kits I mean where we put the
access points up in the light poles and
brax I don't know the india england you
see breaks I mean okay we are making
room for four four parallel networks so
that that people who come in with a
great network idea we great new new
stuff okay come put it up make it
available make it available for for for
the people around and and if they want
to chance take a chance in using it
without having without being guaranteed
a sort of level of support that it will
have on state of the art and fine so so
we make provision then for three
experimental networks in to envelop the
other side we will build a service
platform on the on the normal to draw
the guaranteed state-of-the-art
technology with mobility positioning our
users and security I mean we know of
course that that we can pinpoint the
users to within five meters or something
like that with this technology and if
they are willing than to be pinpointed
and they have to have a say of course
then then we can provide positioning
information sister sex advantage of
localization security is of course a big
problem and
the thai groups nomadic and mobile users
we want to provide outdoor coverage at
an indoors at malls and cafes so so we
the intention then is to have a seamless
net which is sort of going from inside
the buildings and out and and everything
hanging together when we can achieve
that it's not a question of course so we
but they already talking to mall owners
in downtown where were interested in
having their mods covered in the
seamless network with the outer areas so
so so we'll see what happens we do not
intend to compete with xdsl or over dsl
alias telescope with us and whatever
comes and cable I mean this is not our
intention I'm not quite sure where the
other guys believe in that but but it is
not our intention we start out with with
the customers that we see the tiger is
now our R&amp;amp;D companies who want them to
do experiments and also big users like
our University we have we have around
20,000 students in the other colleges in
town there is another 10,000 soul to get
there is a sort of student population of
30,000 in our faculty for information
technology Electrical Engineering there
we have around two and a half thousand
masters students five hundred a year on
a five-year program we have we have 250
400 PhD students and of course so all to
get a 3,000 something like that because
these are then early adapters they are
they are people that we would have them
to to recruit and 44 okay so the next
word and we will give this for free to
them
the next would be serviced developers we
would like 10 to develop new services
and and her company is in to do that and
then private individuals and businesses
so the applications research and
development business model use a pattern
services production and so on and so
forth we are very interested in painting
the way them for doing your research on
services and information services yeah
those will be standard services like
everybody will do location-based
services mobile services nomadic
services and of course in this would be
then the opportunity then to do you
things we have some planned elearning
projects we have a number of projects
that we are not trained in to to sort of
get on the way we try to develop
cooperative projects than with the city
the county one is then for trying to use
the city as a digital learning arena
cooperation with the elementary school
district we also developed in
cooperation with local high schools and
our school of education we develop try
to develop a context in a band
information system for the new students
when they when they arrived in in the
autumn and and and so on and so forth so
this is just one of the strands now the
open questions coming here now and it is
which services with people pay for I
mean with a high penetration that we
already gotten in
in the broadband in the homes then then
four people then to pay something extra
for for for having this motive this
wireless downtown the most bit mother
must be some extra services which makes
it worthwhile and I think this is
because we do not have the situation
that that you have for example New
Orleans New Orleans and Philadelphia and
so on where you try to really try them
to build a wireless network which will
reach into people's homes from the
outside we have the other situation
where we have broadband network in
people's homes and we want to use that
to reach to to the exterior of the
building so which kind of services will
live with people pay for when we don't
know certainly there must be something
which which makes it worthwhile and for
for mobile and nomadic employees which
kind of ICT products would be happy know
that we will have to build up a help
desk for the population I mean because
we know the trouble that we get into and
we get when we take our own laptop and
try them to sort of go into the wireless
network in a motel here or there is not
easy and and so we are planning then to
build up a help desk and based on
students and starting this summer and
serving the population then for for at
least a year or so which kind of
business model can we build how can we
get in money enough then to be able to
sustain this and we also have to look at
that what we are planning to do now is
to offer everything for free for the
first year what about citizens privacy
protection we know all of these problems
who owns the Wi-Fi broadband
we know that the telecoms owns the wired
networks but the property owners owns
the building's networks in my home I
mean the responsibility of the telecom
operator stops at the world they will
not take any responsibility for what is
the inside a house then I have to start
to ask them if they will come and fix
things up and I have to pay them which
of course means that they say this is
not our property so it's my property so
who owns then the air above my garden by
my house is it me when my wireless
access point is sort of radiating out
possibilities tend to my neighbors tend
to to attach themselves is that my
property we are getting into a sort of
discussion of ownership here which I
believe will will will bring about you
new regulatory regimes and and we don't
know really what they are going to be so
so when we start and n is sort of Billy
of developing this I believe that we are
defining new competition areas arenas
because what we bet I mean the way we
have had it until now with the telecoms
has been that the telecoms they have
tried in a way than to be vertically
integrated to control everything from
the couple in the ground to the services
on top and then they make possibilities
then for service for people coming in
with the content services than to make a
deal then with those who own the copper
I I think too I mean it is I don't
believe that this is a sustainable
sustainable model I mean not with with
with players like Google and and skype
and and others then in on on in the game
so but which kind of model what we have
then III would certainly like them to
see a kind of horizontal organization
with service provision in value chains
and and then wait wait wait the
definition of new competition arenas for
the different kinds of services and then
which net new network technology will be
will be half the way we organize the
project n is that we have an energy and
infrastructure project we have a net
laboratory project and an information
service development project the
infrastructure project is a call then
turn my fibro been comments the concept
of Commons is known okay so so and I
think the concept of common sort of in
some way says that that the air above us
in the streets and so on is the public's
owner ship the public I mean the
population owns this so it's in a way a
con a commons area and so we start out
with that philosophy in in anybody the
owners here will be an tinh you invested
a city of trondheim the county and the
Chamber of Commerce so we are organizing
the dos and the akadi come in with a
quarter of the money necessary knowledge
we have a net a bullet or e which was
about to start and we will own that in
cooperation with the industry but an
inviting in whoever wants to come in and
rent a part of the backs Rex brackets
okay we are setting up also then for
information service development projects
then where we are talking into companies
like Accenture and so on to to come in
and do whatever they feel like like
doing the success criteria we believe is
the early mobilization on many users the
early mobilization of many users and we
come up then with the first priority
will be then the 30,000 students that we
got because they are the easiest to
mobilize second priority will be the
elderly those over of an HR more than 27
years and but the younger ones first the
younger ones first so we are also then
trying to make this to cover the high
schools and junior High's then in in the
area depa cover trying to involve the
kids then in in in doing things their
projects based on this and so on and so
forth if we succeed okay we don't know
but again this I believe is is is very
very important in in order for us to
have success we also believe that we
would have to develop new information
services adapted to mobility home or
movie lose I mean I don't have a sort of
classical background in Greek and Latin
but I mean Homo habilis we need to have
new network technology for lower costs
is too expensive the way it is now we
will never succeed unless we
get across town and we need to make
students and grown-ups have lots of fun
with the new technology if we can't sort
of achieve that and we will not be
successful the progress plan is my last
lab we take lower part of the river them
and the lower part of the river is this
is leif erickson's start point this is
an old shipyard which has been converted
to to restaurants and stuff this is the
sort of part of the the small boat
harbor in the river and so we are taking
out this now and this will for a small
pilot to see then I mean what what are
the noise ratios I mean because this is
the garbage band and and there will be
noise and so on and happy if we can have
it but to work or not so this pilot is
is today is Monday and it is dude then
on Friday I mean to to to work so I'm
going home to Norway to Trondheim on
Thursday arriving friday second match
and I'm going to inspect it and on the
six of us cents imagine so I hope then
that petalburg the next one is fifteenth
of August when the new semester starts
and the new students are coming so we
tried then to have Mick pin then as an
extension of the campus network member
to run access points down in mcbain and
and to have this work them and then it
just cross our fingers and then hope
that that seems to work out and again
this is the worst his logo the city's
logo the county's logo and the logo of
the Chamber of Commerce which go
together them for the infrastructure and
we invite them everybody then to come in
and join in if they feel that they would
be part of the fun that's it thank you
any questions any lame ass yep so so
sound like you're very positive planet
so
how are you controlling access is it
just open wide open access points were
in capture or what what we're going to
do is to to have the lodge users behave
like their own is peace so the
university will will serve as nice p for
for the students and the employees at at
university will use the VPN we can type
a channel so that everybody who wants to
go into this have to have some some Dean
I mean either way the normal ISP of
which the valley is be a witch i thinked
about three or four five active ones in
in the city or they have to have a VPN
connection to their their employer so we
are going to do it that way also because
we we need to be very careful not to
start a head-on competition with with
those who make a living out of selling
internet services the way it is this
through
get any points in your studies
peoples inhabitant of patron hi
access portico as partner dash yes we
had that was the first idea that we
started out with half a year ago or nine
months ago to try to create a sort of
Commons based and on the goodwill other
people after having having sort of
pondered a little bit with radius and
looked at the organizational
complexities we gave it up because of
organizational complexity and well there
are some legal complications also maybe
because we also recently got a law which
is saying that it's a crime than to go
into your neighbor's X wireless network
unless you you are invited in and i
don't know why i think if we got 70,000
homes in the city then it will be a job
really to try them to organize all of
these at this 25 / at least twenty
percent of any population will protest
to anything the way I see
if there are the wireless heart was
accessible by the organization that is
putting this together in the
organization takes that yes but we also
have to consider that that there is no
software available as we knew half a
year ago that will be a bit that will
gives seamless roaming over a number of
different technical brands what we can
do today is to buy by an area with one
brand of equipment we can manage roaming
within that brand of equipment but but
then for a city of that size no we gave
it up maybe we believed that would be
will be beyond our capabilities the way
I saw the way I see
the individual would actually get me
organization so everybody would have
this app with it and they would be
equipment in this change from getting
your writing actually have access see
yeah but we haven't have a much better
much better model no and that is that we
will offer this for free than to all of
our students and so on as an extension
of the campus network until we have
developed services which which makes
this economically feasible because it's
quite clear that we can do things now
for the first year maybe two years
without having income to cover the
expenses but they can't do that for five
years I mean we we need to develop a
sustainable business model for this so
so so well I mean that was our decision
seems to me that if you let 30,000 views
on to a
if you let 30,000 students on to an open
wireless network all kinds of hell will
break loose in terms of excess bandwidth
usage so how are you going to keep the
network well I mean I mean we already
have 30,000 students on our campus
network so or maybe not 30,000 we have
we have every week we have sixteen
seventeen thousand sort of active IP
addresses and not more than then 1500 of
those will be serviced and things like
that so so we are already in that
situation so so this doesn't make make
very much of a change because we have I
mean also all of the dorms have have
broadband not wireless though but what
then because some of some of the
students there are sort of plaguing the
the rest of the population by
downloading masses and masses and masses
and okay they get the word that behave
or you're kicked out so I think this is
this is manageable this is manageable
people are generally very sensible if
they are given the chance to to be so
okay
if there is nothing more than them thank
you very much for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
