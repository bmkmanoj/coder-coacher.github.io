Libra is an instructor of Medicine
and member of the Sanford vascular
medicine biology program he holds
degrees with honors and chemistry and
medicine from the University of Chicago
and completed his internal medicine
training at the University of California
San Francisco dr. Lieber joined the
clinical investigator pathway at
Stanford University in 2005 and served
as the divisions chief cardiovascular
fellow in 2007 today he'll talk to me
Lee around cardiovascular disease tips
for prevention in the future of
cardiovascular technology so with that
i'll headed to dr. lee / well thanks
Mina and I wanted to thank the American
Heart Association and Google for having
me come talk today and as she said we'll
try to have a little fun today talking
about cardiovascular medicine past
present and future and so I thought we
would just start with little bit of
background about the disease itself why
should we care about cardiovascular
health and then have some fun going over
the major historic advances over the
short window from 200 BC to today and
then we'll spend a fair bit of time
talking about how you can manage your
own cardiovascular risk and ways to
think about improving your own longevity
and wrap it up with the future of
cardiovascular medicine where I think
that we're heading how we're going to
leverage advances in genetics and
technology to uncover the hidden risk
that we still can't address and this is
it going to be an informal talk
hopefully nothing is too technical and
please it's a small enough group if you
have questions this shout them out I'd
be happy to field questions as I as best
I can as we go along so a little
background why should you care about
cardiovascular disease well it's the
leading killer in the world and since
1990 more people have died from heart
disease than any other known illness it
claims nearly a million American lives
per year
and when you look at some of the other
leading causes of death it's obvious how
important Cardiel cardiovascular disease
is in that it accounts for more deaths
than cancer HIV and AIDS
and accidents combined and the National
Institute of Health estimates that heart
disease costs upwards of half a trillion
dollars per year and that's just the
direct cost things like hospitalizations
and surgery and the medications we would
take and it doesn't even begin to
capture the indirect cost so time lost
from work decreased productivity time
lost due to early death and so all in
all it's an incredibly important problem
but it's also an area where we've made a
lot of progress and the data on the
right is a study from Scotland showing
all 5 million residents of the country
from 1975 to 1994 and basically we've
made major advances in the risk of dying
from cardiovascular disease has fallen
by about a quarter over that time period
and this is due to both earlier
diagnosis but also more aggressive
treatment and you can see that we've
made advances in pretty much every
aspect of cardiovascular medicine
whether we're talking about heart
failure heart attacks smoking cessation
etc and so really we've come quite a
long way in just one generation but we
still have quite a lot of work to do and
sadly these curbs have really plateaued
over the last decade or so and in fact
we're getting worse in some areas so
people are surviving what would have
been the Widowmaker heart attack but now
they're going on to survive with
congestive heart failure and heart
failure admissions are actually
increasing in the United States and it's
now the most common discharge diagnosis
for all hospitalizations according to
Medicare and there continue to be a
number of socio-economic disparities so
men still have far more heart disease
than women blacks have far more than
whites and perhaps most depressingly
there are some estimates that heart
disease has now overtaken even
infectious diseases as the leading cause
of death worldwide so now Philip Morris
and McDonald's are killing more people
than tuberculosis and cholera and so
that's a fairly depressing fact so where
are we today I thought we could try to
appreciate the past to understand where
we got to in 2011
and so we'll go back just a few years to
200 BC with the first cardiovascular
therapy this is the medical leech and at
that time this was used to treat an
imbalance in the four humors which were
blood phlegm black bile and yellow bile
and this was given to people who were
sanguine or were red from their
inflammation or their congestive heart
failure for example and this really
isn't just a historical artifact we
still use leeches today to help with
wound healing and microsurgery and it
turns out the leech is able to stay
attached because of a small amount of an
endogenous anticoagulant in its saliva
and we now use a medicine called her
Rudin from the Gerudo medicine Alice
every day in our cath labs as a way to
prevent blood clotting and people that
are having heart attacks so this was our
first cardiovascular drug essentially we
then had to fast-forward 1,800 years to
the first great anatomic description
where we had William Harvey's de moto
cordis in 1628 this was an amazing tour
de force where without the benefit of
the microscope which hadn't been
invented by Lewin Hooke he was able to
describe arteries and the veins and even
though he couldn't see them he
postulated the presence of capillaries
connecting them and he for the first
time I was able to say that we do not
produce 540 pounds of blood per day
which people previously thought the
liver I was responsible for but actually
that it circulates throughout the body
round and round and this was a major
triumph but he really couldn't pin down
the intricacies of the heart itself and
he was quoted as saying that it was only
for God to understand the heart but at
least we knew about the circulation
within a hundred years the heart had
been fully described by the anatomist
divison from France we now knew there
were four chambers four valves two atria
two ventricles and he went on to even
describe the first cardiovascular
condition which was mitral stenosis
shown on the right where there was
narrowing of a heart valve from
rheumatic fever and so now we really
understood how the heart and blood
vessels were interconnected and had our
first pathological diagnosis within 30
years blood pressure was met
shown here Stephen Hales is inserting a
glass tube into the carotid artery of a
sedated horse and within the next
hundred years
physical examination became a priority
and in 1816 Rene Olynyk invented the
stethoscope and up to that point the
physician would press his or her ear to
the chest of what was often a frail old
man and Lunik had been presented with a
young woman and he was too embarrassed
to ask her to disrobe and press his ear
to her chest and so he had been
observing children holding tubes to the
ears and scratching to transmit noise
and thus we had the first physical
examination tool and to this day Lamech
was responsible for many of the physical
exam findings that we use in our daily
practice by 1903 the EKG was invented I
think this is one of the more hilarious
pictures I've ever seen it was known
that the beating of the heart was
accompanied by electrical activity but
it was too faint to be measured and so
we'll hem Eindhoven in 1903 used a
string galvanometer powered by two
powerful electromagnets to operate the
600-pound machine and I look this thing
he's going to get electrocuted at any
moment but now we have the
electrocardiogram and the beginning of
the field of electrophysiology within
ten years
James Herrick was using this EKG to
diagnose acute heart attacks so it
became clear that the electrical
activity was deranged and people having
an acute heart attack and he called for
the use in people with chest pain and to
this day if you go to the emergency room
the first thing they'll do is look check
your EKG but Herrick went further he was
the first person to describe
atherosclerosis as the build-up of
cholesterol and fat in the coronary
arteries he described the blood clotting
that occurs during heart attacks and
that laid the groundwork for many of the
therapeutics we use commonly today a
hundred years later now it gets even
more fun and people became really
focused on delivering drugs into the
heart itself and there was one young
surgical resident who had just graduate
from medical school that was obsessed
with catheterizing the heart and his
professors and mentors told him that
this was not compatible with life and he
was forbidden from doing this so late at
night he actually anesthetized his own
arm and snake this plastic tube up
through the vein over his arm and into
his heart and so he walked downstairs to
the basement of his hospital where the
heat where the x-ray machine was and you
can see the first x-ray of the human
heart catheterization with the plastic
tube coming up and over and going down
to the heart so he showed his boss the
results the next day he was fired on the
spot for self experimentation he was
actually ostracized from the field he
never practiced in cardiology again
but luckily 30 years later he received a
Nobel Prize in medicine for this
pioneering work and we use this every
day so you know but this really allowed
us to do more and more invasive
procedures and in 1952 we had the first
open-heart surgery and this was before
we had the cardiopulmonary bypass
machine
but John Lewis was taking care of a
five-year-old girl with an ASD which is
basically a hole in the heart and he
knew that she couldn't survive and so
without being able to put her on bypass
he induced deep hypothermia and made her
quite cold so she wouldn't suffer from
the lack of oxygen and blood flow to the
brain he basically plugged off the
venous return to the blood so no blood
was going through the body and rapidly
opened her heart so the hole closed and
she went on to lead a normal life so
this was the first successful open-heart
surgery quickly followed by the first
mechanical valve this is Charlie
Hufnagel who had been working on
plastics as a way to replace blood
vessels and he developed this ball cage
device which would basically have a
plastic tube with a plastic ball inside
and he put this into the heart of a
woman dying of aortic stenosis or
narrowing of the heart valve which keeps
blood from going out to the body and
when the heart would contract it would
push this ball forward and allow blood
to be ejected into the body and as the
heart relaxed the ball fell back down
and blocked the opening so blood
couldn't come backwards into the heart
and so here we have the first mechanical
heart valve of course we do many of
these every day
and later that year the heart-lung
machine was invented allowing even more
and more aggressive open-heart surgeries
yeah later that decade even cooler
device was invented the portable
pacemaker and I think this story is fun
about Earl back and who was a
self-described nerd so he had been
picked on as a child and he invented
electroshock device so he could fend off
the bullies when he was getting beat up
growing up and he went on and studied
Electrical Engineering and started this
small company called Medtronic out of
the garage near his house in Minnesota
and he developed a friendship with one
of the surgeons at the University of
Minnesota and that time the surgeon was
operating on a baby who required
external pacemaking to keep his heart
going but at that time the pacemakers
were the size of a refrigerator and were
plugged into the wall and that night the
power went out in the hospital his
patient died and so the next day he went
to talk to back in about finding a way
to miniaturize this technology and it
just so happens that back and have been
reading a copy of Popular Mechanics that
had a description of the circuitry of
the metronome and so using this as a
framework he invented the first
transistorized pacemaker shown on the
bottom left and later that week it was
being used in children to keep them
alive throughout their open heart
surgery so pretty amazing and I don't
think he got picked on too much later in
life as you know Medtronic has gone on
to become the world's leading pacemaker
and defibrillator companies so I think
he did okay at the end of it all in the
next decade mechanical assist devices
were invented and these were mechanical
pumps used to support a failing heart
and this is a picture on the left of
Mike DeBakey who's one of the most
famous cardiac surgeons of all time with
an early device and on the right hand
side you can see the type of impeller
based design that we use today which is
no longer a pump it actually has a
rotational Impella that drives blood
through the same way that a submarine
engine is used to propel a submarine
through the water and he was responsible
for a number of amazing advances but now
we can keep people
who had failing hearts at least with
these mechanical devices but the next
great innovation was Carnac
transplantation and this is norm Shumlin
the left two is the great father of
transplant surgery he worked at Stanford
I had the distinct pleasure of getting
to know him before his death a few years
ago and Shumway was not only an amazing
surgeon but he also really fought hard
to understand immunosuppression and how
to develop therapies that would keep the
body from rejecting the transplanted
heart and you can see he did a number of
surgeries on his hero dogs here with Sam
one of the first dogs to receive a heart
transplant and the politics got
interesting one of his trainees
Christian Barnard
actually left to go back to South Africa
and did kind of an eleventh-hour first
human transplant in his home country
that patient didn't do too well he only
lived for two weeks and there actually
was a lot of push back in the late press
but Shumway persisted and as you all
know there have been over 60,000 heart
transplants performed worldwide now and
largely due to efforts of this amazing
pioneer and just another word on
transplantation Stanford this remains
one of our major focuses we of course
perform the first heart transplantation
in the United States the first heart
lung transplantation in the world and
this is a picture of one of my early
patients at Stanford and this is a just
a neat story about a bloke named Joe
Matthews who came over from England to
study college and play high-level rugby
and he came in to see me when he found
that he couldn't continue to outrun his
teammates wearing flip-flops something
that he could always do beforehand and
it turns out that compared to the normal
heart on top which is you can see
contracting with the valves opening and
closing his heart looked like this and
you can see that the heart is barely
moving the ejection fraction is probably
less than 10% of the blood volume in the
heart is being pumped out with each
cycle and his heart had been attacked by
a virus and I'll never forget we
basically had to tie this kid to the bed
you know he wanted to keep going up and
down the stairs to maintain his fitness
and we started putting on the new Metis
trying to help strengthen his heart and
wasn't getting any better and we went to
put a defibrillator in him and he
actually died on the table
and through the heroic efforts of our
head of surgery Bobby Robbins they
opened his chest on the table they put
in one of these mechanical hearts and
actually two weeks later he got a heart
transplantation and now Jodha sent me
these pictures from last week this is
his first full contact rugby game four
years later and he's now completed
College started skydiving he's run two
marathons and he competes in the
Transplant Olympics and you can read
more about him at English Joe net he's a
really fun kid and he didn't give me
permission to show his pictures here so
this maintain remains one of our major
expertise is at Stanford and things got
less and less invasive after that
andreas Grundig performed the first
angioplasty 1977 he used kitchen
appliances so he took apart his toaster
and his his blender I think it was and
created this balloon basically which he
used to open up the artery of a patient
with angina and sure enough I mean these
are fuzzy pictures compared to today's
standards but the blood flow was
restored he had no more chest pain and
within ten years he not had any signs of
heart attack so this laid the groundwork
for balloon angioplasty and stenting
which are some of the most common
procedures we do today the first fully
mechanical heart was implanted in 1982
another fun story about a dentist named
Barney Clark he lived for 112 days
without the benefit of a human heart
it didn't go swimmingly well for him he
bled several times he was confused quite
often he actually asked to die at one
point but these devices have been
improved on quite a lot they're getting
miniaturized and at the very least are
being used now as a way to bridge people
to transplantation and with the hopes
that one day we can fully replace the
human heart and the hits have kept on
coming yes
that's a great question so we used to
think that you had to have a heartbeat
you know you had to have a systolic and
diastolic blood pressure but it turns
out that now we use these Impella
devices which have no blood pressure so
if you try to feel the pulse of a
patient who has when he's in you can't
feel anything and we thought that oh no
the kidneys need to have that pressure
head coming and going but it turns out
they don't so actually more of the you
know recent designs use these which
don't have ball bearings they don't have
they have fewer parts that can break
down and fewer places for blood clots to
form the stroke is a major complication
of these things you can imagine with all
the back-and-forth pumping okay and then
I was just going to wrap up the history
by saying that things have gotten even
more and more exciting you know in the
last two or three decades the number of
pharmaceutical discoveries have been
incredible giving us statins and blood
thinners and hypertension drugs and even
now we don't use the balloon we use
metal stents to open the arteries and
they even can elute drugs so two of the
most common drugs we coat these stents
with our paclitaxel and sirolimus and
the one on the Left paclitaxel was
discovered in the bark of the Pacific
yew tree which only grows in the
northwestern United States and the other
is found in the cell wall of a bacteria
which grows in the soil of Rapa Nui in
Easter Island so you can just see that
it's a incredible history with a number
of people making very astute
serendipitous observations which have
led to rather remarkable advances but
like I said we've made a lot of progress
but we're still not perfect and we've
come a long way since 1891 when these
famous painting was first first created
and we're not quite in this era where
you see the caring physician gazing
intently on his sick patient this is
before the era of antibiotics but we
still have quite a ways to go and as the
american heart asked me to talk about we
can talk now about where we are today
and what you can do to protect yourself
and so it turns out that there is some
good news and we can now identify
several risk factors which drive disease
and in this large study across 52
countries there are basically nine risk
factors which all told can account for
as much as 90 percent of your chance for
having a heart attack and many of them
are the ones you would kind of guess
like being a smoker being a diabetic
having a sedentary lifestyle but I think
this is positive because not only are
these identifiable but many of them are
reversible and it turns out that clean
living actually does help in the Nurses
Health Study which looked at over 80
thousand nurses I believe who they
followed prospectively for 20 years if
you are able to remain thin and eat well
and exercise regularly and not smoke
these nurses could reduce their risk by
up to 85 percent but the other hand is
that only five percent of this
relatively conscientious you know health
focus group was able to maintain all of
these lifestyle changes for the full 20
years so the question is what can you do
today and we'll start with diet and
exercise and of course we all love our
our funny fat men and I miss Chris
Farley quite a lot but I want to start
by showing you some depressing slides
this is data from the CDC and it shows
the obesity map in America in 1985 and
so in light blue less than 10% of the
state was obese and that meant 30 pounds
or more overweight give or take and the
kind of periwinkle blue was 10 to 15% of
the state is overweight okay here's 1986
here's 1987 here's 1988 here's 1989
here's 1990 here's 1991 America's gotten
so fat we had to create a new category
where 15 to 20 percent of the patients
are overweight 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996
1997 another category now over 20
percent of the people in the state are
overweight 1998 Alaska joins The Fray
1999 2000 2001 now over a quarter of the
population is obese 2002 2003 2004 2005
another category over 30% of the entire
state population is obese that's every
third person 2006 2007 2008 and the last
year we have data for is 2009 so it's
pretty depressing
data and I really do worry about this
this is a hilarious cartoon but you have
to wonder if a lot of the benefit that
we've been able to achieve is going to
be undone by the obesity epidemic which
is a very real phenomenon so what can
you do well it turns out that exercising
does reduce your cardiovascular risk and
the lower right hand study is I believe
yes sir yes the question is why's is
happening if we're becoming more and
more health-conscious and I'll talk
about that on the next slide if that's
okay about the dietary changes that have
been going on and I agree that we are
more aware of it but I think that we're
being sabotaged by the advent of very
cheap large portion processed foods
whether you eat out or even just get
things at home and I think high fructose
corn syrup is probably the
the element we now know that 20% of our
daily caloric intake nationwide is from
high fructose corn syrup and I think
that's just a thing that we didn't have
a generation ago but it's a great
question so before we get to diet we'll
talk about exercise and the take-home
here is that exercising can reduce your
risk and the blue slides show that even
if you do occasional or light exercise
you can reduce your risk by about 12%
and you may say well if you exercise
more you're probably also less likely to
smoke and so how do you know that you're
controlling for all these things the
upper study is from Finland where they
looked at twins where one twin was
sedentary and the other performed
exercise and as you can see that if a
twin even did occasional or conditioning
level exercise they had a market
reduction in their cardiovascular risk
and so that takes away all the
confounders of genetics or other things
and this is pretty robust evidence that
exercising will help and so taken
together the Department of Health and
Human Services recommends 150 minutes
per week of exercise and that doesn't
have to be training for the next
marathon it can just be gardening
dancing whatever it is you can do to get
your heart rate up yes sir so it's a
good question and you know we don't
really know is there too much you know
can you overdo it you know it's I'll
show you some examples of other athletes
in a minute but yeah it's an astute
observation that maybe you can do too
much but as of now I don't ever tell us
people to not go particularly a young
group such as this you know I think that
for elderly patients who might already
have heart disease we do have to be more
conscientious about not overdoing it and
putting yourself at risk that's a great
question and so here this slide talks
about the diet and I I think one of the
points that's worth making is looking at
just the serving size compared to the
1960s and today the average bagel has
gotten twice as big you know the average
cheeseburger the average french fries
the size of our soda are big gulps it's
all gotten way out of control and while
we could spend the whole hour talking
about the merits
the Mediterranean diet or the Atkins
diet or whatever I really do think it's
mainly about common sense and portion
control and I really tell my patients
don't try to go nuts you know using a
sensible approach if you can go hungry
by a hundred calories a day so that
means skip that nutrigrain bar in the
morning or maybe don't have that yogurt
in the morning that will give you half a
pound a week and a half pound a week is
twenty-five pounds a year and that's
enough to get you down into the lower
risk group based on the obesity trends
that we saw earlier so I think a
sensible healthy diet is a useful
approach what about smoking you know in
California we think that smoking is a
thing of the past but it's it's really
not I mean basically a quarter of
American males are still smoking and
over half of males worldwide are smoking
in developing countries and we know that
smoking worsens basically every aspect
of cardiovascular disease it makes your
cholesterol higher makes your blood
pressure higher makes your vessels more
inflamed and it raises your risk of
heart attack six-fold and the risk goes
up with the more cigarettes you smoke
but on the other hand quitting smoking
is incredibly helpful and no matter how
old you are what sex you are where
you're from how long you've been smoking
how many cigarettes you smoke a day if
you're able to quit you can derive a
dramatic benefit as much as 47% in some
studies and the good news is that the
benefit begins to accrue as quickly as
two years after you quit and if you look
out to the right if you're able to quit
smoking for a full decade your risk of
heart disease goes back down to the same
level as patients that have never ever
smoked so I really do tell my patients
it's never too late you can get benefit
very quickly and if you can really kick
the habit you'll derive remarkable
benefit and now I couldn't help but
notice there were some smokers outside
on the way in today so I know that even
at Google there seem to be a few smokers
and so in contrast to when I was trained
and people said oh it's mind over matter
you just got to quit get serious we now
know that there are clearly neuro
chemical changes in the brain and there
are genetic predispositions which make
you more likely to smoke so don't go it
alone I would
say if you do smoke or you know
something that does have them work with
their doctor to get counseling and also
to try pharmacotherapy which can alter
the neurotransmitters in the brain to
reduce this very real phenomenon of
habitual craving okay hypertension high
blood pressure this is probably the most
important thing that you can do as a
group because you are probably the group
that's most at risk of having a
borderline blood pressure and seeing
your internist and them saying ah you
know we'll check it next year and
blowing it off
you really cannot accept this when you
are taking your own health into account
first off it's an incredibly important
problem a third of Americans are now
hypertensive it probably has a lot to do
with our diet and the increase in salt
intake from the processed foods but it's
also an incredibly silent killer
so remember people that are hypertensive
often don't feel it so they'll go
through their whole lives and then one
day they'll have some huge clinical
event and that can be the end of it all
over two-thirds of people having their
first heart attack are hypertensive 80%
of people having their first stroke or
hypertensive and three-quarters of
people who have congestive heart failure
have a history of high blood pressure so
remember you can go all the way through
your life accruing this risk and then at
the end you'll have a sudden event and
just to highlight this is a picture of
FDR our 32nd president and I want to
tell a lot of fun facts my wife wouldn't
let me tell all my fun facts but anyway
that in addition having polio FDR had
blood pressures in the 215 over 110
range remember normal is like 130 over
80 and this is with access to the US
Surgeon General and the best care in the
world but they didn't want to treat his
blood pressure they were worried that he
I would have side effects he was not
having any sequelae from his high blood
pressure and here he is at the end of
World War two he's sitting for a
portrait the portraits half done and he
fell over from a massive hemorrhagic
stroke and died and that left us with
the so called unfinished portrait and so
this is just to highlight the point that
you can't ignore this every time your
blood pressure goes up by 20 points your
risk doubles but if you can
lower it even marginally five or six
points you can have a 20% reduction in
your risk of heart disease yes ma'am oh
you're so lucky I wish I had your blood
pressure the question is is can you go
too low I think not 90 over 60 for a
young woman that's fantastic you do not
need to worry there are some you know
intricacies about blood pressure as we
age as the blood vessel becomes more
stiff and you'll see a widening gap
between the systolic and diastolic and
that has some ramifications about the
amplitude of the reflected waves I won't
get into all those intricacies but for a
young woman good for you that's great so
you do not need to worry you can have as
much salt as you like the rest of us
maybe not so much
okay okay dis lipid II me a high
cholesterol everybody knows cholesterol
is bad for you
whether you have heart disease or you
don't higher levels of cholesterol lead
to worse outcomes and again just to
highlight that our cholesterol levels
things that we consider normal are
totally artificial and a result of the
Western diet I mean my babies in the
back of the room babies are born with
LDL cholesterol zuv 70 and so you know
think about the last time you had your
cholesterol measured was it near 70 so
this is really a reflection of our diet
and sedentary lifestyle and you can get
a significant benefit by exercising and
you can improve your lipid profile with
red wine intake for example but if you
do have high cholesterol and you have
risk factors you're probably going to
need to be put on a statin one day and
statins are drugs like lipitor Crestor
etc they also have a fun story they were
discovered by Japanese scientists in
this mold Penicillium Citroen em which
grows on orange peels and this astute
observation led to the first statin
being developed by Merck but suffice it
to say that there have been now dozens
or maybe even hundreds of trials showing
that statins will provide market
survival benefits
that have heart disease and even this
study here is looking at 17,000 healthy
men that are 50 or over and you're
seeing that being put on Crestor can
reduce your relative risk of heart
disease by maybe 50% for people that
don't have documented disease and yes
sir so side effects of statins well on
the whole they're fairly well tolerated
on a population level people can get
what's known as Myositis which is
basically inflammation and injury of the
muscles so people will sometimes say ah
you know my large muscles ache and in
some rare cases that can be serious and
life-threatening and an even rarer side
effect is that it can affect the liver
but we you know tend to start these
drugs with relative impunity and we do
screen for these things down the road
but on the whole you know ninety nine
and a half percent of my patients take a
statin with really no no untoward effect
so pretty well tolerated I will say that
this study the Jupiter trial was picked
up on by the lay press and you know the
first thing is you know should this
really be put in the water and you know
what are the health economic
considerations there and even Stephen
Colbert I didn't want to I tried to get
the link up but here he is debating one
of the Stanford cardiology faculty that
I work with about whether or not crest
doors should be given to all healthy men
and he'll say Stephen Colbert pretty
handily defeated my my my coworker but
but basically I think that if you do
have a lot of risk factors you have a
strong family history have high blood
pressure and your cholesterol is high
most likely you'll need to get it down
and statins are the most effective way
to do that yes sir
yeah so the question is you know can you
adjust these parameters with extreme
lifestyle modifications and um you know
maybe I'm just kind of a young jaded guy
and I just think you know that doesn't
work you know I think you know let me
let me let me rephrase I think that
there are clear studies showing that you
can lower your blood pressure by going
on the - diet but you get about two
millimeters of mercury okay if you are a
heavy drinker and you quit drinking that
can lower your blood pressure for about
four millimeters of mercury cholesterol
if you do get really serious about your
diet and you do exercise you can in some
cases reduce your blood your cholesterol
by maybe 20 points and whether I'm jaded
or I just you know haven't seen enough
motivated patients I haven't yet seen a
single patient in my clinic that was
able to get his blood pressure from 160
down to 130 just by giving up McDonald's
french fries and you know maybe the
people out there and to be sure the
guidelines still suggest that you should
start with lifestyle modification
tonight it's probably fair to give it
the old college try for six months and
then recheck it but what I'm imploring
you to do is if you give it the college
try and six months go by and you're
still you know in the risk range then
you need to get serious and get on top
of it with pharmacotherapy that's just
an opinion sir okay well that's great
well good for you and you know and
that's great and I hope you're drinking
some red wine to help do that as well
yeah you can get these marginal
increases and you know congratulations
to you I'll use you as my first example
of a person that was able to do it you
know I've been practicing that long but
in my you know seven or eight years I
haven't haven't seen a patient yet so
that's great news oh yeah oh wow
fantastic sir
yeah I'll talk about the questions about
wine and I will talk about wine in just
a moment so it's my favorite topic okay
all right oh yeah yeah yeah turns out
there are probably dozens of different
fractions of cholesterol but we mainly
focus on LDL being the bad cholesterol
and HDL being the good cholesterol so
the question is what what are the
differences and without getting it into
much detail HDL is kind of like it's
like a vacuum it sucks the bad
atherosclerosis out of the blood vessel
wall and LDL does the opposite it
carries very inflammatory cholesterol
products and deposits them there and
that's how the plaque gets build up so
as a general rule you want your LDL to
be as low as possible and your HDL to be
as high as possible and LDL can be very
effectively lowered with statins HDL is
a bit harder to raise you can use niacin
which is an older drug you can use
exercise you can use red wine and then
there's actually a new drug that has hit
the market which brought HDL levels up
as high as a hundred and it was the
first study it was just published last
year in the New England Journal and
those patients did fine but you know it
remains to be seen you know that's
that's an unbelievably good level well
you know time will tell if raising it
that high it's you even more benefit but
at least in that first trial this new
drug which has a totally different
mechanism from statins looks very very
promising so yes ma'am
questions about avocados I have no idea
I don't you avocados so I don't know I
haven't heard that before so out that
I'll to look it up but I can I can email
you with the with the date I find great
yes sir oh my I got two examples now
this is great maybe the Google guys are
a bit different you know they were more
motivated so okay but one that we can
all agree on I think is alcohol right
and and this sudden of the heading of I
knew I was on to something in college
and and so now there have been
meta-analyses with over a million
patients and it turns out that if you're
a moderate drinker which means one drink
per day for a woman and one to two for
men you can reduce your risk by about
18% which is incredible now you don't
want to be out on the right-hand side of
this curve you don't want to be four or
five drinks per day but this is a
remarkable benefit and it probably
explains the so-called French paradox
which was first made famous on 60
minutes some years ago but it turns out
that French citizens eat four times the
amount of butter that Americans eat they
smoke far more commonly they take in a
hundred and eight grams of animal fat
per day which you know just blows us out
of the water and despite this they have
a much lower rate of cardiovascular
death and the answer is probably because
of red wine and it is red wine not white
wine it's probably more Cabernet than
other varietals and the answer is
probably an agent called resveratrol
which is found in red wine and many drug
companies are now actively trying to
develop this but at least tonight when
you go home you can have your Pinot Noir
and know that you're helping your
yourself out yes
a grape juice I don't know I haven't
heard anything about that so I don't I
don't think so no yeah yes
yeah
so the question is you know is there a
yin-yang with alcohol and certainly
alcohol raises blood pressure and so
you're always dealing with that versus
the play atrophic effects you know all
these unknown effects I think on the
whole because the French are so
unhealthy and they do so much better I
think that you'd have to surmise that
maybe it's a net positive okay so the
some refer that where we are today is
that you can control your risk and but
only to a point and this was a paper
that was written it's fairly
tongue-in-cheek and it talks about the
poly pill where they will put you know
several drugs you know a very low dose
of aspirin a very low dose of
cholesterol medicine a very low dose but
blood pressure pill together and they
jokingly said they can wipe out 80% of
cardiovascular disease if you add
together all these benefits and we know
that we really can't do this in real
life but by taking account to the things
we just talked about you can control a
large portion of your risk and so the
question is you know how can we find the
remaining risk where is this hidden risk
and where is the future of
cardiovascular medicine and you know
it's Stanford and elsewhere we are very
interested in understanding the
difference between these two types of
people and you know I think on the left
air by nose Churchill you know and this
is an incredible figure in world history
but you know for us you can see that he
was always smoking
he drank very heavily and had many
hilarious quotes my favorite of which
was that I have taken far more out of
alcohol than alcohol is taken out of me
you can see that he's morbidly obese and
he led by you know most accounts a
relatively disgusting lifestyle but he
also lived into his 90s and for the
runners in the room we can look at Jim
Fixx and anybody that recognized this
guy he was a member of Mensa he wrote
this book called the Complete Book of
running and this actually featured his
legs on the cover you can see what a
specimen he was and he would go on talk
shows and he was really kind of the
grandfather of the modern American
fitness revolution
and so he would go and tell people that
if you exercise you can live forever and
this you know provide all these salutary
benefits but in fact you probably know
where the story is going he went out for
a run when he was 52 years old and he
fell down and died and an autopsy was
found to have between 80 and 95%
blockages of all three of his main
coronary arteries and so we're very
interested now in understanding where
this hidden risk is what are the
genetics behind this where you can be
perfect from every known risk factor yet
still have this unbelievably aggressive
form of coronary heart disease and so
we're using advances made possible by
the human genome project which was
completed in 2000 2001 to get at these
questions and so again I won't torture
you guys I know you're mostly you know
engineers and you know but remember high
school biology of every cell has 23
chromosomes the chromosomes are made of
DNA DNA is transcribed into RNA and RNA
is translated into proteins and
therefore you have a human being and the
Human Genome Project has taught us that
if you look at all these chromosomes we
have 3.1 billion with a B billion
nucleotides base pairs okay that of that
how many genes do you think there are
and man anybody want to guess 3.1
billion base pairs how many genes Oh
how'd you know that it's yeah 24,000
people usually say I don't know a
million or you know something like that
but that's incredible right you know so
for example the worm has 30,000 genes
and the rice rice has you know I think
50,000 genes so we have only 24,000
genes in our entire human genome so 3
billion base pairs that's like one base
pair for every two people in the world
but only 24,000 genes that's like the
number of people and you know packed
Bell Park you know on a Sunday afternoon
so that's amazing to think that you know
all this complexity can be derived from
that small number and you know even more
interesting the inter individual
difference between us the genetic
difference is
less than 0.01% of those base pairs so
me from you from somebody else across
the world its 0.01 percent so if I could
know the sequence of just a quarter
million out of your three billion base
pairs I can tell who's who and that's
just a remarkable factoid but it's also
a discovery that we've been able to
leverage to like make more insights
about cardiovascular disease and so
using technology developed just down the
road Affymetrix is here in Northern
California its competitor Illumina is
down in San Diego
we can now simultaneously genotype all
250,000 of these DNA base pairs and then
collect huge populations of patients
with and without disease and look for
differences where does one person have
an A and another person has a T where it
is a G more common in heart disease and
a C is common and so using this approach
which is known as the genome-wide
Association study G wass we really have
made quite a lot of headway just in the
last few years and so here's the kind of
data you'll see and so just look at the
bottom first this is what's known as a
Manhattan plot because it looks like the
skyline of New York City and the way
it's laid out is the chromosomes are
along the x axis so one in red two and
blue three in green and so on and
they'll look between cases and controls
and anytime a variance is more common
we'll call it a mutation for now so
anytime a T is more common than at C
you'll see an increase along the y axis
and the thing I want you to note is that
you're kind of going along from
chromosome 1 to 2 to 3 and there's
really kind of nothing on the horizon
and you get to chromosome 9 and there's
this huge spike okay all kinds of action
going on here and we've now studied over
a hundred thousand patients with and
without heart disease this has been
showing time and time again and so if I
really want to scare you guys it turns
out that up to 20% of the population
carries this variant so every fifth
person in the room carries this and if
you have this it raises your risk of
heart attack by 21% and it raises your
risk of early heart attack like Jim Fixx
had by 31%
and so that's really remarkable and the
other killer point here is that this is
totally independent of all known risk
factors so whether or not you're
diabetic or whether or not you have high
blood pressure whether or not you're
obese whatever having this risk
correlates with disease and you can go
down and and for a few hundred bucks the
23andme will swab out the DNA from your
mouth and you can know whether or not
you carry this risk allele it's very
good yeah yeah that's a great question
so the question is you know if you have
this and it's so common was it an
adaptive response that was given to us
by Mendel and and Darwin along the ways
and I think that you're probably making
an astute observation that having sickle
cell disease for example protects you
from having cholera so that's why sickle
cell disease was was a cholera there's a
malaria I think it was malaria so you
know malaria is endemic to Africa so
having sickle cell disease which puts
you at risk for all kinds of
complications protects you in your youth
and makes you more reproductively viable
so it's a great question we don't know
why this might have been selected for
evolutionarily but that's very good sir
yeah I was wit thank you for that I was
wishing nobody would ask me that
question because I also understand the
23andme is run by sir gays wife or
something along those is that right okay
so so here you know you've asked me an
impossible question right I can't answer
this honestly the question is what do
you do with these results and I think
that we don't know this gets into more
details you know we've got very good
risk scores so we can take a person and
look at their family history and their
blood pressure profile and they're the
size of their waist and do all these
things and and reclassify your risk and
and we use that really to decide if
people should be put on drugs like those
statins I was talking about or an
aspirin
or whatever and I think that this really
I'm not sure it's ready for prime time
yet and I think that this is going to
evolve rapidly but we're learning more
and more so I think for now I'm not
sending this my patience to get this
test done but I think it's interesting
and I might do it for myself just out of
curiosity more anything else but I
wouldn't then put my still on a statin
at my age for example so I don't think
we're ready to do that just yet but I'll
tell you where we're heading with this
and we may find new biology which will
allow new therapies so and so again just
you know this isn't a statistical fluke
you know in science we use a p-value of
0.05 to prove significance that's one in
20 chance we found this association by
chance the p-value here has something
like 16 zeros so there's just no doubt
this is a very real association it's not
well that's that's the thing it's not a
gene so this is the most exciting thing
to me at least is that these variants
are occurring in the gene desert in
between those 23,000 genes and this when
I was going through my schooling I was
taught this is junk DNA you know why is
it there who knows but the body doesn't
use it it's just DNA that's there in
between the genes that we actually care
about but we know that that just can't
be the case anymore and that's one of
the real advances from the human genome
project so 9 p21 that's the area in
chromosome 9 where these mutations occur
is totally in the gene desert and so
we're trying to find that Oasis now and
I promise I wouldn't give you too much
hardcore scientific data but suffice it
to say that we are working very hard
thanks to the funding provided by the
American Heart Association and we think
we found a mechanism a new mechanism by
which this non-coding DNA is actually
controlling the expression of a gene
that's very far downstream 100,000 base
pairs away and we found that knocking
out that gene which had never been
implicated in heart disease before can
dramatically alter the expression of
cholesterol and atherosclerosis here's a
knockout Mouse who doesn't have the gene
on the right and one that has it on the
left and you can see far more about
green cholesterol in its blood vessel
more cholesterol building up around the
a or
valve and they these videos didn't play
but you can also see a larger abdominal
aortic aneurysm which is the fifth
leading cause of death in humans which
this has also been associated with by
the way in relation to this gene so
using this technology which we call
agnostic because we started by saying we
have no idea what's going on we know
about hypertension we know about
diabetes but we're going to say we don't
really understand the intricacies of the
body we're going to look across the
whole genome and using this approach we
found this totally new pathway a new
gene and we hope that this can lead to a
new therapy so very exciting stuff and
it's going to get even better you guys
will know Moore's law the price of
computing going down you can see the
price of sequencing just far
outstripping this the human genome
project costs three billion dollars in
took 13 years now if you call Illumina
and you agree to sequence 50 people
they'll give it to you for 850 bucks per
person and you can get done over a
weekend and that's pretty amazing
considering that the human genome
project was basically a decade ago and
so the hits are just going to keep on
coming and we can all be like jack
that's the plan so in conclusion
cardiovascular medicine has come a long
way and I think that it's always fun and
interesting to start with the history to
really appreciate the fact that we're
standing on the shoulders of giants and
many of these incredible advances were
due to serendipity and astute
observation but really have laid the
groundwork for amazing surgical
technical and drug discovery advances
but I think the future is can be based
more on this agnostic approach where
we're going to liberate ourselves from
our preconceived notions and be able to
make even more interesting discoveries
about the disease itself and not merely
risk factor modification and then for
you if you didn't have the foresight to
choose your parents wisely the advice is
pretty simple eat right exercise more
ride your bike to work most important
don't blow off your blood pressure
don't let your physician blow it off you
know this is something you have to take
seriously never smoke unless you want to
have a cigar with me outside afterwards
and keep your cholesterol in check and
explore Napa Valley and if you can do
your best to support the American Heart
Association and their remarkable goal of
helping stamp out cardiovascular disease
so thanks yeah yes you sir no there's no
problem doing that the question was can
you come off of a statin and yeah
there's no rebound effect and it's it's
very safe to stop it if you so desire
the questions about insurance and
certainly we deal all the time with pre
consist pre-existing conditions which is
concern but I think that the most
concerning thing that least from my
perspective was discrimination based on
genetics because you know we're now
learning all this information what if
you sequence your whole genome looking
for this heart disease thing but you
find out that you carry a risk for
sudden cardiac death and the chances are
that you're going to die unexpectedly in
your 40s and should you should the
insurance company be able to keep you
from getting life insurance for example
and there's actually an
anti-discrimination law passed just a
couple years ago I think it was Gina
where's forget the acronym but basically
you are insurance companies are no
longer allowed to make any type of
discriminatory behavior based on the
information that we're getting from our
genetic research so that's very
important yes sir
yes yeah that's a great question so how
much of your risk is genetic and how
much is from the environment and it's
probably 50/50
and so the identifiable risk factors you
know blood pressure cholesterol smoking
it's about half and then your family
history and the kind of unknowns that
attack a guy like Jim Fixx is probably
another half so that's why we I think
it's so important to study this from a
bare-bones genetic approach going back
up yes sir in the back
yeah the question is you know how much
of this is a simple pump and how much is
electrical and how does it break down
and to be sure we're just simple
plumbers you know everybody makes fun of
cardiologists and they're poor they're
probably half right but you know we take
care of all kinds of disease whether
you're having a heart attack and you
have a blockage in your artery whether
your heart muscle has been weakened like
my buddy English Joe or whether you have
an electrical arrhythmia problem and so
you have atrial fibrillation and we
didn't even talk about these but they're
all you know there's tons of heart
disease from multiple causes I think
that these risk factors that we're
talking about probably impact your risk
of developing a heart attack or a stroke
more than your risk of having an
arrhythmia for example but there's been
a clear association with the amount of
alcohol you drink and your risk of
developing arrhythmias we call it the
holiday heart where people will drink
heavily all weekend and then go back to
work and they actually have an
arrhythmia on Monday so that's a very
common phenomenon so it's all
interrelated but they actually are very
distinct sub specialties within
cardiology any other questions all right
well thank you so much for coming guys
it's really pleasure and dr.
