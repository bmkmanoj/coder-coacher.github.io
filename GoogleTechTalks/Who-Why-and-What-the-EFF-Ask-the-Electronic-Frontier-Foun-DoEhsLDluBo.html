policy team here thanks everyone for
coming to hear who what who where and
what the eff that we're calling this
please welcome the Electronic Frontier
Foundation three of their four of their
attorneys here and several other staff I
had the great pleasure of getting to
work with these folks before I came to
Google and I can say from experience
that they care more about the free and
open Internet as just about anyone have
been fighting this fight since 1990
before most of us were on the internet
or the web or before there was a Google
and continue to be among the leading
lights in this area today on
intellectual property law innovation
privacy free speech government
surveillance you name it they are in the
thick of things with relatively free
resources to do pro bono litigation that
is really stellar and they depend most
of all on individual contributions from
folks like you I think I'm going to be
passing around a sign-up sheet for the
mailing list and also special little
contribution flyers for those who want
to become eff members they really depend
I think sixty percent of their funding
from individuals like you with that I'll
turn things over to Fred Vaughan lohman
senior staff attorney intellectual
property law de to kick things off we
also have Kurt Opsahl Marshal Hoffman
and Cindy Cohen legal director to talk
take it away Fred thanks very much Derek
thanks very much to google for this
invitation and thanks to you guys in
advance as we pass the Hat as it were so
I want to talk a little bit about all
three of us actually are going to talk a
little bit about the work that eff is
doing now and maybe a little bit about
what we've done in the past and
hopefully answer some of your questions
so the big news today on my front I work
on intellectual property issues a lot of
copyright related issues I'm sure all of
you have seen a lot of the copyright
battles that the Internet has created
including some that Google is involved
in directly but today actually eff sued
on behalf of a wiki provider Apple
Computer excuse me I guess now it's
called Apple
inc they gave up the computer part and
so let me say a little bit about that
lawsuit give you a sense of the kinds of
things we care about and the kinds of
cases we get involved in how many people
own and I touch her an iphone show of
hands yes yeah I can it's not Microsoft
for god sakes does anybody sink your
device with something other than itunes
the software winamp songbird gtk pod oh
you guys are all part of the iTunes
monopoly universe well what happened is
sometime last year during the summer
when the new apple iphones and ipod
touches came out apple took a step to
change basically to hash a particular
file that lives on your device to make
it impossible for software other than
itunes apple's own software to
successfully sync your ipod and there
are other products out there that have
traditionally been good for this
songbird is one that's cross-platform
open sores pretty popular also winamp
some of you may have heard of popular
Windows Media Manager and of course the
entire Linux universe depends on other
pieces of software because there isn't
an itunes for linux and so what happened
is a bunch of hobbyists as you would
easily imagine if anybody's followed the
internet you know how this the rest of
this story goes right a bunch of
hobbyist said hey well let's figure out
how to reverse engineer that change so
that we can make all of the ipods work
again with other software instead of
just itunes for people who want to use
something different and they posted on a
wiki they start a discussion basically
saying okay guys you know call to the
world here's the project here's the
problem here's the first couple of steps
that maybe we'd need to undertake just
talk no tools they haven't actually
succeeded in the reverse engineering
just talking about what it might take
and they got a lawyer letter from Apple
Apple said talking about reverse
engineering our products is against the
law and
ultimately this is a wiki site blue wiki
it's a non-commercial basically a
hobbyist wiki platform young
entrepreneur engineer named Sam odio
runs this as kind of a side public
service he doesn't make any money from
it totally non-commercial he just thinks
it's cool to have public wiki's where
people can talk about whatever they want
to talk about so today in fact this
morning in fact about two hours ago we
sued apple on behalf of a blue wiki the
wiki hosting service basically saying
hey it is not illegal to simply talk
about trying to make your iPod work with
software other than itunes and that's
sort of a classic example of kind of an
eff case that brings together new
technology the Internet you know wiki's
the importance that wiki's have for free
speech with the sort of technical issues
interoperability competition all of the
things we care about and so we'll see
what our friends in cupertino say about
that another area that I've been working
a lot on I see there's a sub folks from
YouTube here we've done a lot of work
fighting for free speech and fair use on
YouTube I'll admit sometimes we give our
friends at YouTube a hard time as well
but I like to think we give an even
harder time to the copyright owners who
have abused the DMCA takedown process in
order to take down perfectly lawful fair
use speech some of you may have seen
that we've we represent a young mother
named Stephanie lens who took a video of
her young toddler dancing to a prince
song let's go crazy apparently ever
since the Super Bowl her little toddler
spontaneously breaks out into dancing
every time that songs on the radio and
one time that happened she put the
camera on him uploaded that video 29
seconds of video to YouTube to share
with her friends and family and lo and
behold that video gets taken down by
universal music group saying hey that's
its kind of a miracle given the fact you
can barely hear the prince song playing
in the background but they say hey
that's our is that have to come
down so we sued universal music group on
behalf of ms lens basically saying hey
happening to catch music playing in the
background for 29 seconds while your
toddler is dancing that's as clear a
fair uses you can imagine it's certainly
not copyright infringement and you
certainly shouldn't be entitled to take
video down just because of that kind of
use there are of course thousands of
other examples now we've been trying to
highlight warner music group doing some
similarly bad blanket censorship on
youtube and that's another area will be
working more on and then finally let me
mention another one that is
apple-related just it's it's not that we
have anything against our friends in
cupertino in fact as you see up here you
know we use Apple products all the time
fact I've been running OS 10 now for
eight years i think i've forgotten
entirely what windows looks like but
Apple has been at the forefront of some
pretty bad practices out there one thing
how many folks have iPhones just 0
android huh that's what it is it's all
the android stuff you guys don't to
admit it okay well if you do have an
iphone and you've jailbroken your iphone
in order to run applications of your
choice of which there are many that out
there apples view is that that's against
the law they take the view that
modifying your iphone so that you can
run your own applications as opposed to
running only applications that you get
through apple's own app store is illegal
and that's an issue that we've taken up
at the copyright office to say hey you
shouldn't be allowed to use copyright
law to basically lock customers into one
and only one app store we don't mind if
Apple wants to pick and choose what it
run has in its own store that's its own
business just like you know if best buy
doesn't want to carry a product I don't
have a problem with that but what I do
have a problem with is Apple telling you
you can't go to any other store for apps
and so we're going to the Copyright
Office actually on Friday they'll be
hearing at Stanford Law School and we're
going to be squaring off with Apple
about that there so that's just a quick
over
you some of the stuff we're working on
and on the intellectual property front
and I'll turn it over to Kurt Opsahl my
colleague at eff Thank you Thank so I
work on the privacy and free speech side
or that's one of the things I'm going to
be talking about today two different
situations one is the warrantless
wiretapping our litigation against the
against the telecoms and against the
government for a massive dragnet spying
program and the second thing which is
part of our coders rights project
concerning the free speech and
disclosing security vulnerabilities from
a case that we were dealing with last
summer let me start off with the the NSA
surveillance litigation now some of you
may know in December of 2005 the New
York Times broke a ground breaking story
eventually they won the Pulitzer for it
that was exposing a program to conduct
warrantless surveillance of domestic
communications internet and phone calls
that was being conducted by the NSA in
violation of the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act the program is a
Content dragnet where the entirety of
communications transmitting over
domestic community telecommunications
facilities is diverted to the government
and then it's placed into NSA databases
and then they look through this
information they do pattern matching and
link analysis on the data in order to
determine which ones to take sort of
further along the chain and they using
sophisticated computers to analyze the
metadata which includes some content of
communications and what we thought that
was illegal and this led to a lawsuit
January 2006 against the
telecommunications companies and one of
the reasons that we went after AT&amp;amp;T in
particular was we had a whistleblower
who came in our door a former 18t
engineer who had helped install
some of these surveillance architecture
at their Folsom Street facility in San
Francisco and he described and find a
declaration and some documents that
showed a fiber-optic splitter that was
splitting the the cable one path went
along on its merry way as the
communications of structure ordinarily
does and another cable went into a
secret room that was controlled by the
NSA so we filed suit and some initial
battles with AT&amp;amp;T over whether or not
because they contended this spying
infrastructure documents were trade
secrets whether they should be returned
in every copy of them destroyed and
never spoken of again but they failed in
that initial attempt eventually in May
of 06 the USA Today broke a story or at
least some that information have been
out earlier but they popularized the
story showing that the cold detail
records of well everybody we're being
transmitted also to the government as
part of this program call detail records
are the records of who you called when
you called them and for how long you
spoke and as opposed to the content of
communications which is more about the
meaning substance or purport of what
you're what you're trying to say this
led to a lot of different lawsuits being
filed against all sorts of different
telecoms and these lawsuits were
eventually consolidated into the federal
district court here in San Francisco
before judge vaughn walker as a
multidistrict litigation where all the
cases from throughout the country
transmitted to one court we litigated in
that court for a while the government
came in to try and get the case
dismissed actually they started this
process before the MDL came together but
they were contending that the state
secret privileged prevented any
litigation the state secrets privilege
is a common law privilege that
developed by the federal courts to say
that certain information if it is too
sensitive national security wise cannot
be used as evidence in a case and it's
stemmed from a McCarthy era case
involving the plane crash where I was a
plane being used for military purposes
to test out some spying gear and
electronics and such and it crashed the
government successfully squashed the
lawsuit brought by the family members of
some of the crew members of that plane
case went all the way up to the Supreme
Court the Supreme Court said no the
information about this crash will be
properly held from the court and the
Supreme Court never actually looked at
the information they said well we're
going to we're going to take the
government's word for it and this
developed the the state secret doctrine
now as it turned out that information
was eventually Declassified and lo and
behold it actually was not secret
information and it was actually the
government's negligence that they were
covering up but be that as it may the
the case remains good law and that is
the basis for the the government state
secret privilege motion they took a
little bit further than it had been
taken previously rather than push for
particular pieces of evidence not to go
before the court it was the
administration's position that even if
nothing was disclosed other than the raw
fact of a decision on the merits of the
case because you would infer from that
decision that well they wouldn't have
been been found liable if they hadn't
done anything that would reveal a state
secret and therefore the case could not
proceed in any matter now this seemed to
be a bit much especially since the fact
of the telecoms cooperation had been
reported in daily newspapers and on the
TV and discussed in Congress and and was
really not very secret but nevertheless
they took that that position and then
eventually Judge Walker denied their
motion to dismiss the case and the case
went on to
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this
apparently made the government and the
telecoms very nervous because they
started a campaign to get a statute
telecom immunity statute that would
attempt to get rid of our litigation
which is very flattering I've never
experienced before a case in which that
they actually wrote a statute just to
kill our successful litigation but
nevertheless they did that we fought
that out in the in the halls of Congress
for quite a while and surprised many
people with how long we were able to
keep telecom immunity from from passing
became a hot-button political issue but
eventually they Congress passed the FISA
Amendments Act of 2008 which contained a
provision for telecom immunity a couple
months later the government invoked that
provision we challenge that as being a
unconstitutional interference with the
separation of powers that the Congress
shouldn't be telling the courts had a
rule and shouldn't be interfering with
constitutional Fourth Amendment claims
of millions of ordinary Americans and
right now we are waiting for the judge
to decide whether or not telecom
immunity is constitutional in the
meantime we filed a second lawsuit first
one was known as a happening litigation
the second one is the jewel litigation
just because that's the named first
named plaintiff during the dispute over
telecom immunity one of the things that
they kept on saying there are our
opponents as well we're only immunizing
the telecoms you can just go ahead and
sue the government and that's the that's
the better way to go so we said okay and
we sued the government it's the same
basic scenario that these are 18t
customers whose communications have been
diverted to the government we are
showing both the government
as an entity and some of the individual
players who were behind these policies
and then they've recently filed their
motion to dismiss that claim this is now
the Obama administration and they yet
again made the same state secret
privilege arguments that had been raised
by the Bush administration this was
despite some rhetoric about how the
state secret privilege had been misused
by the Bush administration on the
campaign trail but nevertheless when it
came to filing the actual legal papers
they went back to the state secret
privilege and then they actually went a
little bit further and came up with a
new argument that was based on the
Patriot Act and contending that a
provision of the Patriot Act which
allowed people to sue over disclosures
of information gathered by the
government sort of silently and by
implication meant that they couldn't sue
about the gathering in the first place
so that under the Obama administration's
view no one can sue the government for
illegally wiretapping only for
subsequent disclosure of the information
that was wiretapped so we're going to
answer more questions about that if you
have it when when we get to the Q&amp;amp;A
session but I will move on to our coders
Rights Project our quarters rights
project is designed to help coders
especially security professionals who
are trying to I'll take take a look at
things reverse-engineer them find
security flaws disclose those security
flaws being able to take advantage of
the technologies that are available to
them and be able to talk about it in
particular one situation which came up
was at Def Con the the conference in Las
Vegas for hackers last summer and three
MIT students were prepared to disclose
some security vulnerabilities and the
MBTA the Massachusetts Bay transit
Association they run what's known as the
tea or the subway there
in boston and as it turned out they
didn't have particularly good security
with their electronic fair ticketing
system and the students had discovered
this as part of a class at MIT and we're
going to present a paper about it they
had a conversation with the MBTA before
going to defcon and left that
conversation thinking that everything
was going to be okay but then the friday
prior to their conference whatever
during the conference a friday prior to
their talk they found out that the MBTA
had gone and filed for a temporary
restraining order in the massachusetts
federal court they did so in the evening
and so it went to a temporary duty judge
that night and what they were asking for
the MBTA was was fairly broad they were
asking for the whole talk to be Squatch
but other things I was going to read
from their their complaint what they
were initially asking for to stop the
MIT students from publicly stating or
indicating that the security or
integrity of the charlie card passed the
Charlie ticket past or the MBTA's fair
media systems has been compromised and
from from declining to provide the MBTA
and its vendors with information
sufficient to replicate test and repair
the reported security flaws and fair
media system they asked for a number of
other things as well but I want to
highlight those two things one was the
the free speech aspects of the first
magnis dis and not even be able to
indicate a truthful factual matter which
was which was a bit much and the second
one was a you know because you have
found a security flaw their assertion
was that there was an obligation to
provide all of that research to to the
company now these these are that
actually not the law and the the next
day at what was our time but six or
seven in the morning there was going to
a hearing held in in Massachusetts to to
go over this restraining order and
ultimately the court did issue a
restraining order now didn't go so far
as the MBTA asked did not prevent them
from indicating that there was a
security flaw but nevertheless it was
sufficient to stop stop the talk and the
courts theory and the mbta's theory was
was an interesting version of the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act this is the
anti-hacking statute and it is designed
to prevent people from hacking and
causing damage thereby and it says first
of prohibiting causing the transmission
of a program information code or command
and the result of such conduct causing
damage and the interpretation of that
which we had was that was like
transmitting a program to a computer you
know sending in your malware to do
something but their interpretation was
the transmission of information included
talking to people at a conference and so
therefore it actually talking about a
security flaw was the equivalent of
hacking itself so this was a bit of a
rush job on the part of the court I
think it did not have a good chance to
see the full facts and this was the
temporary duty judge not the not the
judge who had the full case we were very
disappointed in the initial result but
had to move on to try and get that
restraining order lifted and so there
was for the next ten days there was some
heavy litigation trying to deal with a
number of things one is to get rid of
the prior restraint on speech in our
traditions here in the United States
prior restraints are considered to be
very bad things that someone might have
to be responsible for whatever speaks
they have said but you let
first speak and then hold them
responsible later rather than actually
preventing them from speaking in the
first place and the second important
issue is to make sure that the
understanding of the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act did not include the notion
that talking about a security flaw was
equivalent to doing the hacking itself
and for what it's worth the students
were not intending to provide the full
information necessary to replicate their
hack they were going to describe it
while leaving out some key information
that without which someone would not be
able to to actually replicate their hack
and go get themselves fare cards so
after ten days of contentious litigation
were some 60 different papers and
whatnot were filed on the docket of the
court you know several coming in per day
the MBTA was really going all out but
nevertheless in the end justice
prevailed and the court lifted the
restraining order and situation has now
been resolved and with that I will turn
it over to Marsha almond there I'm so
glad you all came out it's um it's great
to see such a such a strong turnout we
appreciate the support my name is Marsha
Hoffman I'm a staff attorney at eff I
work generally on civil liberties stuff
but one of the things that I spend a lot
of my time on is government transparency
work we have a project at eff called the
FOIA litigation for accountable
government project or flag project what
we do there is we use this federal law
called the Freedom of Information Act or
FOIA for short which gives everybody the
right to request records from the
government and as a general matter the
government is supposed to give you
anything you ask for unless there's a
really good reason to withhold it like
it would compromise national security
it would compromise a proprietary
interest this sort of thing the type of
things that we tend to ask for our
records involving matters that relate to
technology and national security or law
enforcement that tends to be sort of the
the Nexus that were most interested in
and you know basically we we ask for
records sometimes we get ideas from
stuff going on in the news sometimes
people approach us and give us some
suggestions about what to ask for and
sometimes we read things in government
reports that make us wonder I wonder
what's going on there and we'll ask for
records and and see what we get and as I
mentioned we we tend to be interested in
things that often implicate national
security issues or law enforcement
issues and so not surprisingly we often
are told that we're not going to get
everything that we asked for and so when
that happens we often will litigate and
go to court and see if we can get more
out of the government than the
government is willing to give us
voluntarily another thing that we do
with our FOIA litigation is try to help
draw information out that relates to a
breaking news story and so this is kind
of a fun fast-paced litigation that
often involves you know going to the
court in a very short amount of time and
trying to get information that will help
contribute to to breaking news to give
you a couple examples of the sorts of
things that we've done over the past few
years sometimes we ask for things to try
to illuminate public understanding about
the government's technology so for
example back in 2006 I was reading this
government report and I saw a passing
reference to something called dcs 3000
and that that that made a little light
go off in my head because there is
something in the past that we've known
about called dcs 1000 also known as
carnivore which was a controversial
government internet surveillance system
that
it really really stirred a great deal of
public interest in the past and i
thought dcs 3000 i wonder if that's you
know a more advanced version or what is
that i did some research couldn't find
out much about it and so we did a FOIA
request for all information about that
the FBI has about dcs 3000 and it turns
out that this is a government
surveillance system that is very
comprehensive used to perform wiretaps
not only of phone lines but also cell
phones and text messaging and we got a
few thousand documents that really
fleshed out what this technology was and
how it worked and it formed the basis of
several news stories you know in in
which some reporters like Ryan single
from wired did a really excellent job of
discussing exactly what this technology
was and how it works and it was a pretty
cool outcome because before that nobody
really knew what this was or that it
that it really existed apart from some
you know quick references and obscure
government documents so that was a
pretty exciting outcome along those same
lines we have done another Freedom of
Information Act case to get more
information about an FBI database called
the investigative data warehouse and
Curt actually recently drafted a really
cool report that really fleshes out what
this database is and again this is
something that was mentioned at times in
the past nobody really knew much about
it but you know we know at this point
that it's a massive government database
that has close to a billion records
probably more than a billion records
these days billion records as of
September 2008 by way of comparison the
Library of Congress has about 140
million records and we were I did a
little research this morning to try to
come up with a Google centric basis of
comparison and I found that I found on
the google blog that google had
identified in two thousand about a
billion unique web pages so we're
talking about a government database that
is comparable to the internet in two
thousand so it's pretty vast
FBI agents call it an uber google but
I'm not sure that that's really a very
good comparison because so um we are
going to be releasing that port this
that report this week and if you're
interested in learning more about that I
think at this point we have the most
comprehensive discussion of what that
database is and what it includes that is
available that will be available so um
that is one example of the type of work
we tend to do we also use Freedom of
Information Act work to facilitate other
issues that were interested in and for
example last spring we were involved in
a lawsuit we weren't we weren't
litigating on behalf of any of the
parties but we were a friend of the
court watching this lawsuit very
carefully in California that involved
the issue of whether the government
needs any suspicion to search a laptop
when it crosses the border how many of
you have taken a laptop over the border
so at this point the courts are pretty
are pretty clear they've decided
uniformly that the government needs no
suspicion whatsoever to search your
laptop when you cross the border and the
Supreme Court is likely to take this
issue up well we hope the Supreme Court
will take this issue up there in the
lawsuit we were involved in California
the the Ninth Circuit unfortunately
reached the conclusion that other courts
have reached which is the government
needs no suspicion and the the
defendants lawyers in that case have
asked the Supreme Court to take a look
at this so we're hoping that happens but
at any rate we were looking at this
issue pretty pretty closely it was on
our minds and we realized that there are
people who have approached us who've
said what can I do if I'm taking
information across the border to make
sure the government can't look at the
information that that I've got and we
thought about it we realized we didn't
know much you know we know the state of
the law but we don't know what the
government's practices are what its
policies and procedures are for
searching laptops that come
the border so we filed a Freedom of
Information Act request for this
information didn't get anything so we
filed suit against the Department of
Homeland Security and the lawsuit was
really fascinating because it acted as a
catalyst it drew a lot of public
attention to this issue and it became a
very prominent in the last legislative
session several other were there was an
oversight hearing and several several
members of Congress introduced bills to
basically try to bypass the courts and
make sure that there is some legal
protection for information coming across
the border the documents that we got out
of our request we got several hundred
pages they showed that over the last few
years while the Department of Homeland
Security has in the past had some
internal standards to to help to help
protect information specifically by
requiring that agents have some
reasonable suspicion to really go
through documents that's that's
seriously eroded in the last couple of
years at this point agents can take
electronic devices or make copies of
electronic of information on electronic
devices and take it off site and keep it
for a reasonable period of time in order
to perform a suspicionless search and
it's completely unclear what that means
reasonable amount of time there's
there's nothing that actually spells out
what that means and furthermore we found
that when an agent is looking at a
digital information and finds that it's
in a foreign language or is protected by
a password they can actually bring in
other agencies to get around those those
those problems even if there's no
suspicion that the information itself is
indicative of a criminal activity or
anything like that so you know it's it's
troubling certainly and we were glad
that those documents were able to really
draw public awareness to the fact that
this is a big a big legal loophole and
we're hoping that Congress steps in and
also
at the Supreme Court will step up and
really take a look at whether this makes
sense in this day and age 22 have the
state of lobby as it is another thing
that we've been doing lately as you will
see on our website is keeping an eye on
the Obama administration and its stance
on transparency as you may or may not
know on the very first day on his very
first full day in office President Obama
issued a memo ordering the government to
be more transparent in its execution of
a Freedom of Information Act which was
really exciting because as I'm sure you
all know the Bush administration has
been infamous for its its secrecy and
the the FOIA policy under that
administration was was probably the
worst that's ever been basically the
policy was if you have a legal reason to
withhold things feel free to withhold
them and the Department of Justice will
will back you up and it certainly was
not in favor of discretionary releases
and so in our I don't six or so active
lawsuits we've been watching very
carefully what happens and really
pushing to to try to have you know
President Obama's presumption in favor
of disclosure applied we've had some
mixed results which I won't get into
unless you all are really interested
maybe in QA but you know I just wanted
to flag that that's one thing that we've
been working on quite a bit too so I
think at this point we should probably
do some Q&amp;amp;A hook up to the mic there if
people want to line up and while people
lining up all those Tech moderators
prerogative and ask one myself so eff is
an organization is generally very
nervous about legislation or regulation
that could impact innovation and one of
the areas where it seems like this is
trickiest among privacy advocates has to
do with new with advertising and data
retention so there is now talk of bills
that would make certain types of
advertising op
in others would be opted out or would
otherwise limit data retention that you
know search engines or web providers
collect from users so how does have a
look at the reconciling those issues in
its thinking well data retention is
something that we care very deeply about
and for the reason that the less data
that is retained the harder it is to get
you know if our primary concern is
trying to make sure that the government
doesn't have access to people's personal
data and one of the issues that comes
with having it stored with a third party
is that there are some supreme court
cases that provide a lesser standard of
protection when that information is held
by a third party going back to sort of
the notion that your home is your castle
this for the caller a to that is if
you're storing your data outside of your
home you have less protection so we have
been very much encouraging private
parties who store and retain data
including Google but and others to adopt
best practices for keeping that
information for the minimum minimum
amount of time necessary to to for their
business purposes and then get rid
getting rid of it thereafter because the
so the the easiest way to respond to a
subpoena for information is I'm sorry I
don't have that information anymore and
then you're pretty much done with it if
they are looking for the information
that you do have and you don't want to
give it up this can lead to court action
what one of the things we really
appreciated from google a while back 20
oj was looking for search terms in an
effort to bolster their case about the
copa legislation and a children's
protection from indecency legislation
and they wanted to know about the nasty
sex terms that people were searching for
and they trying to get that from various
service providers a lot of them rolled
over instantly and handed over the data
google did not ended up in
a very significant court case and so
that was a good example but if that
information didn't exist then it would
be a lot a lot easier and so there have
been various proposals in Congress to
require people to companies to retain
data for longer periods of time because
law enforcement wants to have access to
that information and they want to not
have to have a reason to to preserve it
under the current law the law
enforcement consent of preservation
letter to request information that they
they plan to seek in the future and had
that be preserved but some of these some
of these proposals are for requiring
service providers to hold on to the data
just in case the law enforcement needs
that in the future and we've been
opposed to those to those efforts yeah
the question was so then there's there's
regulation of forcing you to collect
less data or watching you to only do
advertising if it's opt-in or only
collect certain data if it's often and
that obviously could impede innovation
in certain ways so my question was how
do you reconcile those competing values
you have of one to keep regulation and
legislation out of what innovative
technology companies do not just google
but startups all over while still
thinking about how do we have a legal
regime that protects privacy well these
are these are interesting tensions right
that you know the goal that we have is
is to have both less data being retained
and also to have legal protections for
that data such that if it is retained
then it is protected from being
involuntarily disclosed through through
subpoenas so what you're asking about
our proposals for legislations that
would require
opt in property in advertising yeah I
mean we think opt-in is is great and if
you want to do opt in that would be the
right way to go I don't think we have
taken a position on any of these
legislative proposals that are being
bandied about and generally you know
somewhat of a libertarian a-type
organization we don't ordinarily go into
having legislation or regulation be the
answer but I mean something that should
those combat will take a look at what
they are and see what web say about them
hi this is this on should be okay um I
wanted to congratulate you on your third
is um congratulate you on your success
is with the Patent Office in your patent
busting project and I was wondering you
didn't mention it today and the list of
targets has been the same for a while do
you have plans to expand the list and of
course if you're in need of targets I
can certainly help you there yeah well
um yes I didn't there's a whole bunch of
things that were working on that i
haven't mentioned just two mistakes for
the sake of time but patent bussing
project is something that we've been at
for a couple years now we started by
identifying ten patents that we thought
were number one bogus shouldn't have
been granted and number two actually
being used to shake people down people
who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford
really to defend themselves as some of
you may know this is a common problem
these days with patents that are over
broad or that should have been granted
then being used in legal threats against
people who for whom paying off often is
the only kind of economically sensible
thing to do because if you hired up a
lawyer to fight it would cost you way
more than what they're asking you to pay
this problem is generally known as the
patent troll problem right the troll
comes out of from under the bridge
shakes you down and you know that's the
idea so um we have had great success
with our patent rusting projects so far
we've had a number of those patents
re-examined and we decided to take the
10 and
to make our way through that list we're
thinking right now about what you know
whether we'll add more patents after
that we're certainly open to hear if you
know of any that sort of meet the
criteria of both being bogus and being
used to shake down smaller players who
couldn't afford a defense we're open to
that we're also watching really
carefully there have been some efforts
legislatively maybe to curtail the
ability to bring these re-exam so that's
an area where there might be some
pressure we've been watching as well but
quite frankly right now in terms of
there are plenty of patents we'd love to
go after it's sort of a delicate
question of resources how many we can
take we're always looking for volunteer
help from lawyers to help with that
project so if you know anybody also
technical people because to find prior
art to find that that patent actually is
not new is something that someone
reasonably skilled in the art would have
been known at the time it was granted we
need a lot of help from engineers
technologists people who have that kind
of backward looking knowledge so you
know we're definitely open to it but
right now we're not imminently going to
add more patents unless we find a lot
more resources Thanks I just wanted to
plug your project on their website they
have the ten patents and if you guys you
can scroll through it and see what it is
and submit prior art on their website
yes absolutely and you'll see that
there's a bunch of those patents that
are you know they should have been but
they shouldn't have been granted in the
first place hi um what are the penalties
for fraudulent or ignorant dmca
takedowns and how come they seem so
ineffective that is a great question
unfortunately the digital millennium
copyright act which was passed 1998 that
created all of this notice and takedown
counter-notice the kinds of things
certainly the folks at YouTube live with
every day but probably many of you have
heard a little bit about that was
written essentially by and for a bunch
of entertainment industry concerns right
I mean that really was the driver there
were some folks in the technology sector
there were some public interest folks
involved at the time but I think it's
fair to say that a big chunk of that
law bears the imprint of lobbying from
the entertainment industry side and so
what you have is a situation where a
service provider like YouTube for
example or like blogger or like any
other or for that matter the search
engine itself you have a strong legal
incentive built into the law to respond
to these takedown notices when you get
them a copyright owner but on the other
side there's very little punishment
available if a copyright owner abuses
that process there is a provision in the
law that says if you send a knowing
misrepresentation so you knew when you
sent it it was bogus that can create
liability you can be sued for that in
fact that's the law that we're suing
universal music group under but it is
one of those things to use that law you
still have to find a lawyer you have to
be willing to go to court and when even
if you win you can get your attorneys
fees paid which is great but other than
that you know you get your damages and
your attorneys fees and in contrast of
course if a copyright owner wins a
lawsuit they get statutory damages that
they basically get more than what they
actually lost so to some extent there's
an asymmetry there and it's something
we're very concerned with the
entertainment industry by the way has
been arguing vigorously in court to try
to basically make that Miss
Representation provision that punishment
for abusing the process even more narrow
right in fact the universal music group
responded by saying as long as our music
is in the video it doesn't matter how it
was used you're automatically not
allowed to sue us for misrepresentation
because all we have to say is our music
is in the video unfortunately in our
case we fought that and the court agreed
with us and said no you actually have to
think about whether that's a fair use
before you send it but it is something
that the content industry has been
trying to eliminate those protections
and quite frankly another thing that
worries us is you know YouTube and
YouTube isn't alone a lot of the hosting
sites are moving toward voluntary other
filtering fingerprinting mechanisms
which are sort of totally outside
this legal process and what recourse do
you have if a copyright owner abuses
that there's nothing in the law that
said you know that applies to stuff
that's done voluntarily by service
providers you know for their own reasons
and so we're in some ways we're even
more worried that all of this stuff will
migrate out of the sort of traditional
notice and takedown process and into
these automated or voluntary filtering
schemes so it's a real to real tension
and in the meantime of course there are
a lot of fair users there are a lot of
people who make great videos who are
finding their stuff getting taken down
and either lack you know the resources
or the the knowledge to fight back so
we're doing what we can but it's a big
problem thanks hi I'm I've got a couple
questions um the first one is about
warrantless wiretapping I was wondering
if you had any theories on why the Obama
administration has proven to be
different than what they initially
indicated several months ago and if you
have any sense as to the timeline of
when all this is going to be resolved
and then my second question is a lot of
what you do as an organization you know
copyright privacy under under US laws
you know you have a clearly defined
domain of what you're working with but
one thing I noticed on your website that
you didn't talk about was
internationally how do you deal with
free speech in situations where there's
an authoritarian regime so forth well I
mean let me first with your warrantless
wiretapping it's very disappointing that
the Obama administration after starting
out the campaign trail being very
strongly against warrantless wiretapping
agreeing that it was illegal at one
point senator Obama said that he would
join in a filibuster to prevent Patel
community legislation
later after he had secured the
nomination and was contesting the
general election he ended up voting for
the immunity legislation at that time
saying well it wasn't you know what he
wanted but nevertheless there were other
good things about the law and you know
perhaps needing to take the national
security issue off the table and then
once in power you know there's some
question well well what is he going to
do could for example could have
withdrawn the request for telecom
immunity or at least ratcheted back some
of the contentions about the scope of
executive power you know in in the
context of this litigation courts have
ruled that for example the state secret
privilege is a common law privilege that
is not something which is a
constitutional power of the president
rather something that arises from the
common law nevertheless the bomb
administration like the Bush
administration continues to assert that
it is a constitutional power of the
commander-in-chief so what we've seen is
you know on the one hand the Apollo
administration has said some some very
nice language their promises about
transparency and openness we're really
really good but in terms of what we're
seeing in the actual legal briefs filed
it is a lot of the the same arguments
that were done before so I I mean it's
hard for me to speculate why why they
are doing that I mean the I guess one
stated reason is you know to look
forward instead of back but I mean some
of the purposes of these laws the reason
why there is liability for the telecoms
in the first place is because it's
really just the government and the
telecoms in the room when they were
doing the ask they're saying would you
please allow us to wiretap your
customers and the customers aren't in
the room privacy advocates aren't in the
room
and the the reason for the telecoms to
say no this is illegal we can't do it is
is the possibility that they might later
be found liable and in and when you when
you change that paradigm and add telecom
immunity in then the the that check on
government power is is not there so it
is very disappointing on the timeline we
have any day now we'll get a ruling on
the constitutionality the hearing was on
December the second there was a
follow-up briefing in February so I you
know it's whenever the court feels like
ruling and in the jewel case that's
against the government the hearing we're
currently talking with the with the
government about an appropriate hearing
date would probably sometime in july on
the international question that's a
great question certainly companies like
Google and a lot of the major Internet
companies know firsthand how difficult
it is to try to figure out how to run a
global enterprise with all these
conflicting laws at eff we have been
focusing on international issues
particularly in the intellectual
property front and we have a team of
folks that are working on that
particularly on things like free trade
agreements where US copyright industries
are basically pressuring the American
Trade Representative to push a
particular form of intellectual property
on all of our trading partners thereby
you know basically ratcheting up all of
these laws in unison all around the
world at once so we've been focusing a
lot of attention there we also work with
a lot of local grassroots organizations
around the world we've heard from lots
of folks in Europe folks in Asia who
said we really need eff here and what
we've said to all of them is absolutely
and that needs to be an organization
that grows up organically right we can't
just parachute in our model elsewhere
you know litigation works in the United
States it doesn't necessarily work the
same way you
or in India so we've been very happy to
see a number of organizations grow up
around the world in the UK Germany
Finland Australia so the good news is
that those kinds of organizations are
there and we do all we can to try to
help them and you know support them to
kind of bring some of these issues to
national attention in their own
countries and you know i'd encourage
folks to seek those those organizations
out if you have these kinds of issues in
in other countries so we're now at a
time but for anybody else who wants to
ask a question or continue the
conversation we're going to go head down
to No Name for lunch with these guys so
you can come and sit with us if you like
can also of course go to their website
get more information sign up for the
newsletter with katina in the back and
become a member so you can both support
their work and keep learning about the
important really important work that eff
is doing everybody a round of applause
thanks for coming guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
