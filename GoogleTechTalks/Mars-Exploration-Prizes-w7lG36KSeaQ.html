introduce today Chris Carberry of the
Explorer Mars foundation and he's going
to introduce the foundation and what
they're doing in advancing the human
exploration of Mars Chris Carberry is
former executive director of the Mars
Society he held various positions
related to space exploration and
advocacy and please give him a warm
welcome at Google thank you for ours is
great to be here and great to be at
Google which I know has always had a
great interest there's a company in
space exploration and innovation but
first said we've started a new or this
is a new organization explore Mars
Incorporated which was just founded
about three months ago the whole purpose
of our organization is to stimulate
innovation private sector innovation
with stimulate Mars technology and space
exploration technology and trying to
bring the different parts of the space
community plus detective community
together and trying to find new ways to
promote space exploration and we know
for a fact as I mentioned Google has had
an interest in Mars You certainly have
you know with the April Fool's joke a
few years ago Fergal you know teaming up
with virgin and Google and having the
Mars mission and then Google Mars of
course which is turned into one of the
more spectacular tools out there that
pretty much anybody in the Mars
community needs to use if they want to
you know instantly find imagery of Mars
so we know that Google has certainly an
interest in Mars and as I mentioned the
technology innovation in space we also
know that Google is a natural audience
because of your input your participation
and the Lunar XPrize owner x prize which
is a really spectacular program if
you're not familiar with the program
that you're sponsoring 30 million
dollars going to trying to land lunar
Rovers on the moon which is believed the
largest prize other than a small another
prize at Robert Bigelow is running this
is the largest prize ever offered for a
space exploration so
we knew we wanted to come here and talk
at Google because of the intense
interest your company has in space
exploration in front trying to move the
process forward now one of the big
things we want to promote with explore
Mars is the concept of Mars prizes now
this concept has been around for years
people like Robert zuber and the
president of the Mars Society back in
1996 proposed the concept you know via
20 billion dollar prize trying to
motivate private sector to send humans
to Mars other people like former Speaker
of the US House of Representative Newt
Gingrich has also been a proponent of it
and he's actually been a proponent of it
fairly recently within the last few
years he's been pushing it hard and the
concepts come out in popular science
fiction as well well with Gregory
Benford writing an entire book about the
concept of a Mars prize with a 30
billion dollar prize in the Martian race
thing is the concept hasn't gained a lot
of traction probably because it involved
everybody was proposing 30 billion
dollar prizes and nobody was quite ready
to pony up 30 billion dollars to get
this thing moving but as we were
starting to create explore Mars we
realized we don't need 30 billion
dollars to start Mars prizes we can do
it for substantially less because we
don't necessarily need to aim for
getting the people to Mars immediately
there are a lot of things that we can be
doing right now technologies that are
going to cost a lot less than 30 billion
a lot less a billion there are things we
can do right now that cost between tick
we could motivate between 10 and
$100,000 and onward as I just said in it
one of the first things we're going to
do is create a series of these prizes
the first of which the technical prizes
is the in situ resource utilization
challenge and the premise of this is you
know if you're going to go to Mars you
can have any sustained settlements on
Mars or if you want to send a mission to
Mars without bringing everything with
you and if you brought all the oxygen
the water the fuel even and the food
you're going to have an amazing amount
of mass and that's going to add to
mission complication and a lot to the
price tag in the mission
so one of the things we want from mode
is trying to get the private sector
working on in situ resource utilization
so we're going to start this year
probably within a month we're going to
do a pre announcement in the fall to the
formal launch of a fifty-thousand-dollar
prize to start off with to try to get
teams around the country teaming with
universities to come up to build
reactors that will use a simulated Mars
atmosphere to create fuel now once they
do that we're going to have that pumped
into a rocket motor that one of our
sponsors will revive and will fire the
rocket now this concept has been
discussed before Robert Zubrin and
others have created these devices these
reactors and the concepts been around
since the 19th century but what we want
to do is start pushing the technology
forward we're not going to reinvent the
wheel here but there are a whole bunch
of utilizations for this over time the
first of which is something that nASA
has been considering it's the sample
return mission there's a lot of talk
about doing a sample return mission
between NASA and ISA and problem with
doing that is to do a sample return the
concept sample return is to send a
robotic probe down or Lander down the
scoop up some Mars soil and rock and
rocket it back up into the Mars up to
orbit and send it back to earth problem
is you have to land a fully fuel if you
don't have n situ resource utilization
you have to land a fully fueled rocket
on the surface of Mars and anybody who's
followed the history of robotic probes
landing on Mars no it's been probably
fifty percent or less than a lot of
complications and when you add the whole
the problem of landing a fully fueled
launch vehicle and landing it on the
surface that adds to the complication
and the hazards tremendously should be
much more useful if you could actually
create the fuel where when you're on the
surface that will reduce the launch mass
that will reduce all the complicate not
all the complications but a lot of the
complications of actually landing it on
the surface so our concept is for our
prize to have teams actually focus on
this
challenge we want them to create
reactors that are small as possible
utilize our consume as little energy as
possible and try to match the
specifications that will be required for
a sample return mission so this one
we're going to be launching in the next
few months we'll have more details about
the specifications and teams will need
but you know it will be opened pretty
much everybody in the United States Yves
but they all will also be required if
they are not a university team to team
up with university students so we can
make sure we also get students involved
with this involved into real projects
things that are actually needed you know
in the near term with NASA NASA hopes to
do this in the next one to two decades
hopefully within the next one are
slightly more decades we're hoping this
will speedy speed it up but one of the
ways to speed it up is for groups like
us and private groups around the country
to start doing the innovation because
one thing I've learned in doing space
advocacy for years we can wait around
forever for NASA to start doing things
one of the big arguments about against
going to Mars is we're not ready for
Mars is so much we don't know about it
we need to learn about we knew learning
know how to do this we need to learn how
to deal with radiation issues we need to
learn about how to counteract
microgravity problem is a lot of it
isn't being done or being done
adequately so that's why I think this is
the perfect time for the private sector
to start at least taking off challa
challenging themselves to address some
of the issues and technologies that we
can do for a limited amount of money so
we're going to start off with this sort
of mission and kind of ramp up over time
we're kind of trying to figure out all
the different technologies that we think
we could or we could challenge others to
accomplish oops that was going the wrong
way sorry and of course is are you for
this challenge is just vital for sending
people you know without this
we're going to set to send everything to
Mars that's not practical if we ever
want to actually have sustainable life
settlements on Mars we can't rely on
everything being sent from Earth just
going to be ridiculously expensive and
complicated if when European settlers
were coming to the New World and if they
had to rely on your European ships
sending all the supplies here in order
to settle the new world obviously we
have never been settled the only reason
you know the new world was settled is
because we could live off the land and
we can do that on Mars and that's you
know what we're really hoping to
stimulate over the next year or so once
we get this project going first stage
we're going to do a phase project and
hopefully in the next stage will
actually be able to Steve eight teams to
create flight-ready hardware that's the
goal and you know whether it's being
used by NASA or some private entity and
there are a lot of private entities out
there right now who actually want to do
this sort of thing we will be able to
create the technology that's needed to
do it another one of the concepts are
doing right now now get some more of the
technical ones in a moment another thing
we're launching within the next two
weeks is an education initiative we're
teaming with companies like Aerojet
narrow jets also sponsoring the is are
you challenge but also space NASA space
were bound over at NASA Ames Miles
O'Brien the former CNN anchor and
probably the National Science Teachers
Association to create a competition
amongst science teachers one of the big
problems these days you know when people
are trying to promote space in the
school districts is they come up with
these wonderful pieces of curriculum but
they can't fit within existing
curriculum standards they're very rigid
and you just can't take a giant segment
on Mars and stick it in because they
won't have time there's no way of
getting it in there even if the teacher
wants to so in our talks or the National
Science Teachers Association we've been
kind of brainstorming how can we get
Mars curriculum into existing curriculum
stand
so we're going to launch a surprise
starting and then it's actually next two
weeks and Artemis westenberg here I
should have introduced her earlier who
is the president of explore Mars will be
running this education prize we're going
to see if educators around the country
can actually solve this find ways to
sneak it not sneak it and get it
legitimately into the curriculum and one
of the ways to do this is focus on the
science is already being taught geology
chemistry biology physics computer
science all of those things are taught
in schools right now well you need all
those from Mars as well so it shouldn't
be that complicated you know from a
teacher to figure out how to work Mars
into a geology class you can use Mars as
an analog and say well this is how
erosion happens also on Mars and all you
know we know we by looking at Mars we
can also understand how processes happen
on earth so there's wonderful ways of
doing this so you not only learn to find
new ways of teaching topics that are
already being taught and perhaps making
it more interesting the students and I
think we all know that we have a need of
stimulating science and engineering and
our school districts in this country but
they can also making it make it more
relevant to the students because right
now when space exploration in general is
brought up in school districts it's not
necessarily they might be excited by it
but the relevance isn't necessarily
brought to them than not they don't not
quite sure why this is relevant to their
lives but if you can show how the same
sciences on earth are required on Mars
and you're not necessarily going off on
some abstract diversion by studying Mars
you can you know focus that back on
earth if you want that might actually
help us kind of promote space
exploration but also just promote
science and technology education which
is vitally needed so we're going to be
launching this in the next few weeks
we're going to have prizes a
five-thousand-dollar prize for the
winner plus is you the international
space university is uh donated a
scholarship to their summer program and
Oscar
next year plus they'll be four or five
regional prizes of a few thousand
dollars but all the winners will also
have opportunities to do some cool stuff
like the opportunity to go do some field
research with well-known planetary
scientists like Chris McKay over at NASA
Ames or penny Boston and New Mexico Tech
the lots of opportunities to go and see
some rocket launches and other things so
we're hoping this will really catch on
and you know working with National
Science Teachers Association will be
able to really start stimulating space
exploration the school district in new
and innovative ways other things we want
to do is just kind of brainstorm about
what technologies we can do when we what
would be exciting there are a lot of
things we know are fairly natural like
medical challenges you know we know
there are a lot of medical issues out
there you know if you're going to send
people to Mars it's going to be a long
trip in a weightless environment so
there's going to be problems by the
muscle mask and bone mask and yeah and
muscle tone radiation exposure and other
things like that so a lot of all these
things need to be addressed in detail
before we send people to Mars and these
are the sort of things that private
sector can start addressing as well
since mar nasa hasn't been doing it
adequately neither has most other space
agencies you know finding ways to
utilize the web to promote space
exploration or use it in space i know
that they're actually google has been
involved in creating Network Deep Space
Network but there are ways we can
utilize this dust mitigation simple
things like this that can also have a
great benefit here on earth a lot of
dust on Mars it can can be kind of wreak
havoc on equipment and other things if
you breathe it in it's going to be
hazardous to astronauts but same there
are same same challenges here on earth
as well you know with people working or
the military in the desert or anybody
else things we need to figure out before
to go we go to Mars but also have a
benefit here on earth so we want to try
to challenge people to think about this
and Mars agriculture very similar it's
also another form of in-situ resource
you
zation if people go to Mars they're
going to want to eat Chad you know we
need to find ways figure out if we're
going to be able to grow food on Mars
it's going to be a big it's going to
really hurt our efforts to settle Mars
if we actually can't produce food on
Mars we can't then the game is up we're
going to be limited to just small based
research basis and so studying this sort
of thing right now is vital if if we're
going to send people to Mars by 2030
which I hope we can do and in Artemis
and I we're looking at all the
agricultural love plots out outside in
the lobby and kind of efforts you've
been making there it was very relevant
to what we were thinking here on
different ways of producing food
efficiently so we're hoping to do things
like this try to push this technology
forward oops wrong way another thing
we're doing hoping to create a larger
kinda connect the Mars community part of
this yeah we're starting a magazine is
an online magazine but it's not going to
be a typical magazine yeah it'll have
articles with cool people in it but what
we want to do is find different ways of
connecting people within the space
community and the broader community
right now even within the space
community people are off in their own
little silos and they don't often
communicate you'll often have a group of
scientists over here wondering where
they can get volunteers to help out you
know with various projects but Artemis
and I went to the astrobiology
conference in Houston a few up about a
month ago and it was kind of funny
because in their call for papers they
mentioned you know a topic for papers
citizen scientists and trying to find
ways to find volunteers for you know for
research because it's all this data and
it needs to be gone through you don't
necessarily need planetary scientists or
other you know phd's to look at some of
this stuff you just need people to
review there are just of images of Mars
we just need to be reviewed to see if
their changes geological changes or
evidence of water that's appeared on the
surface which ordinary people can do
the problem is the scientific community
didn't seem to understand there are
these people just waiting to do it and
the advocacy community elsewhere and we
realized this is a real problem if
people in the different parts of the
Mars community itself didn't even
realize there were all these people
waiting to work on projects that's a
problem and if they don't even know that
they're not going to communicate well
with the broader world most people are
not in the Mars community so and the key
to actually advancing our goals is to
broaden this to a much bigger community
because we can get a little bit
insulated within our own world and think
that everybody else is going to have the
same motivations the same passion that
we do and they don't because we won't
unless we get it out there so this is
one of the key points of exploration
magazine trying to do this mostly in an
online format just car to connect people
and you know we've been looking at
things that Google is done and other
companies you know in other areas hoping
we can work with people like you and
other people to try to find a new
innovative ways to get people together
at work provide volunteers to projects
point people to real things they can be
doing in the space community that they
might not have otherwise known about so
we're hoping this is going to be
launched this summer we'll start off
small but we're hoping to kind of build
on it you know over the next few months
other things we're doing programming
technical programs science and
engineering programs as well as policy
stuff this year and next we're going to
be doing a mars airplane symposium the
concept of sending an airplane DeMar has
been around for a while but it's kind of
gaining steam again that you can
actually fly airplanes on Mars there is
enough atmosphere to do that it's a
little the aerodynamics is a little bit
different than here on earth since the
atmospheric pressure is so much less but
you can do that it can provide some
unique opportunities to study Mars and
not to mention some spectacular views if
you can actually fly an airplane on Mars
we're also doing in Mara
agricultural workshop next spring hoping
to utilize actually partner with people
in the agricultural community to
brainstorm this because once again this
is where the space community tends to
insulate itself from everybody else
they'll start talking about how to grow
food on Mars or elsewhere amongst
themselves but don't actually
communicate often with the people who
have devoted their lives to growing food
here on earth and there are some amazing
scientists working in the agricultural
community they have nothing to do with
space that could have a lot to say they
could benefit the space community on
this if we ever asked them to do it
which that's the problem they often
don't so we're hoping to start
connecting connecting these communities
as well by getting the NASA people
together with the agriculture people and
see if they can brainstorm because
sometimes the best ideas don't
necessarily come from the people you
expect NASA's not necessarily going to
come up with the best ideas
independently they might but they may
not as well you never know and the more
people you can get thinking about
concepts to better that's what we're
hoping to do we're also going to do a
bunch of policy stuff coming up you know
I don't know how many of you know but we
have a new space policy this can propose
the president has proposed getting rid
of the constellation program and
focusing more on private sector
activities but with the goal of getting
the Mars but with kind of a far-off date
so we're going to be doing a lot of
political work and trying to speed that
up and improve the project we like a lot
of thing in it but problem is it's drawn
out over such a long period of time we
feel it doesn't have much chance of
survival in a political world in the
real world be particularly since the
heavy lift vehicle which they want to do
the decision for that's not going to be
made until 2015 right before the end of
the president's second term which makes
it extremely exposed to cancellation so
this is the sort of thing we want to do
kind of get really active in policy as
well but and try to find different ways
of getting out to broader communities
you know most people aren't going to
come to an event like this or
you know to a conference when I make use
of webinars and other mediums get the
word out to other individuals who might
be interested and this is the sort of
thing we want to get your input on right
now since we're a new group we want to
listen to people like you to see if you
have ideas you know what we can do to
get the message out use tech technology
social mediums you know to get to reach
people we might not have ordinarily met
we don't want to be kind of chained in
by the old ways of doing things that a
lot of space community still is kind of
locked into we want to fully embrace the
new technologies to get the word out and
just make our case and get people
excited about space technology oops so
you know I ought to get to this at the
end I'm going to kind of do a few more
slaves but up slides but I actually do
want to hear what you think because this
is one of the primary reasons why we are
here we want to hear your opinions if
you think there are things we should do
be doing prizes we could run that would
stimulate space technology or help
promote the message of getting to Mars I
think that's one of the most important
things we can do right now we don't have
the all the answers at that's why we
want to engage people who aren't
necessarily part of the space community
to get your ideas and see what we can do
what you think might be an interesting
way to engage people because right now
we are at an interesting time period in
history regardless of what NASA does a
lot of interesting things are happening
at the moment the private sector is
starting to explore space in ways that
it had never been able to before I don't
know how many of you saw the launch of
the Falcon 9 the other day from space X
and we just toured there yesterday it
was pretty cool watching you know all
the fabrication of the rockets and it
was great but wonderful launch of Falcon
9 you know and you on mas who runs the
company is going to be if he succeeds
continues to succeed will be servicing
the international space station but he
has his goal is Mars you know you have
virgin galactic who is about to start
starts sending space tourists up to
suborbit but they also have an interest
in Mars and even just kind of by
evidence of virgle you know you know the
April Fool's joke that you guys did with
virgin you know both companies have an
interest and thing is we now actually
have the capability of doing private
mission to Mars if the right people came
together this is entirely possible it no
longer we are no longer in the age with
this is necessarily going to be done by
the government or government exclusively
so you know if you were to team Google
with virgin but if you also added teamed
with SpaceX that would be an incredibly
powerful combination I don't know if
you'd call it whoops I just well I'll
leave it I don't know if you'd call it
verga Lex kind of sounds like a bad
pharmaceutical but you know that sort of
combination could actually get people to
Mars over the next few decades you know
with the resources that virgin galactic
virgin the company and google has teamed
with SpaceX who is already launching you
know is already beginning to launch
vehicles who has an extreme interest in
getting to Mars we could do this with a
pretty in the private sector and we
could probably do this in the next 15 to
20 years if the right people came
together and decided to do this it's not
necessarily going to cost a 50 or 100
billion dollars that or five hundred
billion dollars at NASA has projected
and frankly probably will be done much
more efficiently people like Elon Musk
have said that they could certainly do
it given the time and the resources and
those resources don't necessarily need
to come from NASA or any other yet a
government space agency any rate that's
pretty much all I had for the formal
part of my talk I just wanted to find
out if any of you had any questions or
if you have any suggestions how you
think we could actually better promote
this message or prizes or programs you
think we might be able to do to get the
message out or advanced
technologies yes
some of you so you think we could use
something using example of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth century
of people exploring Africa or other
remote the Arctic you know some of the
great Arctic explorers no we certainly
can it's you know and that has been used
as an example by a lot of people these
days in space exploration that you know
that was a great day of exploration yeah
we'd already discovered America we knew
the Arctic and Antarctic existed like as
opposed to in the past people didn't
necessarily know but there was a great
private exton thusi azum about it and
private sector was funding that largely
another great example which kind of the
same spirit was early aviation which is
being used a lot as an example in space
exploration because particularly the
XPrize that early aviation wasn't driven
by public sector by government by the
military until World War one at least it
was driven or or after World War one
this is really when this took over after
World War one you know it was the
private sector that was promoting
advancement of Technology with all these
private prizes the one they motivated
Charles Lindbergh to fly across the
Atlantic other prizes that were offered
you know for speed or going around Lee
flying around the world and and there
were a whole bunch of other ones that
were Arctic prizes as well so this is
kind of this is you're actually got it
right on the nail on the head here this
is the sort of spirit we want to tap
into that and this is not by far not
original on our part Peter Diamandis
back in the 1990's founded the XPrize
just with the same concept thinking
that's got to be a way to stimulate the
private sector to do some of this
because none of us want to actually wait
around for NASA or others you know in
government agencies to do this if they
can do it great but I think we've all
seen kind of the false starts over the
last well 30 years 40 years really since
the end of you know we haven't been to
the moon since the early 70s and yeah
we've done some great things since but
none of it really rises to the level of
going to the moon
you know back in the 60s and early 70s
people thought we were going to get to
Mars by the early 80s we missed that
goal by quite a bit and it's going to be
a miracle if the government is able to
us to get us back to the moon or anyway
anywhere by the 50th anniversary of us
landing on the moon now that I find to
be pretty pathetic that yet this is
turning into some great historical feat
which I'd line you know coming you can
compare to the pyramids or something I
think this is a really sad if people
start thinking that the moon landing is
kind of similar to the pyramids that
something that some ancient society did
that it despite the fact that there are
still people who walked on the moon
around today I just talked to one of
them yesterday and so we need to make
this real in their lives and that's one
of the big problems as well making it
real because a lot of the young people
growing up have no real personal bond
just real space exploration because all
the good stuff seemed to happen before
they were born and it we'd seem to be
completely incapable of doing it now so
maybe NASA will do it but I think more
ways we can simulate the private sector
to just take it on the better and I
think you know the innovative the
brainpower the innovative spirit just in
this campus you know could do an awful
lot to promote this because just amazing
people here are amazing people in kind
of a 10 square mile radius around here
that you know could really contribute to
this effort
I was curious is Mars the best option to
live off of the land like you're talking
about as far as financing sources right
yeah I love the ones we can get to that
we know about at the moment yes the moon
has no atmosphere it's completely
exposed to you know the Sun and
radiation and plus the atmosphere on
Mars as i mentioned i didn't mention but
that's what we're going to be using with
our in situ resource utilization as a
car co2 atmosphere so we can use that to
create you know if we bring hydrogen
along to create oxygen water and fuel
but we also know there's water on Mars
so if you have easy access to water you
don't even need to bring that you can
just create this stuff using technology
chemical chemistry we've known since the
19th century and interestingly the Mars
the Phoenix lander which landed a couple
of years ago a couple years ago yeah
found water ice at least near the polar
regions 1 inch below the surface it was
kind of these funny things I was talking
to the principal investigator Peter
Smith about this and you know of course
the light Polar Lander landed with retro
rockets and I had this big scooper on it
and you're hoping the school dig down
you know at least half a foot or a foot
and find this wonderful discovery of ice
so they landed they looked around they
didn't see in the ice they looked foot
pointed the camera underneath the lander
and the retrorockets had actually
cleared away soil and exposed water ice
so is one of these things almost like a
coward I have a car too and you look
around you look under you and there's
the ice and as you mentioned this is
disappointing because they were hoping
to at least have some sort of effort and
finding it but the fact the retrorockets
were actually able to clear away enough
soil to expose the ice means it was one
inch below the surface so if you can
gain access in other places we're not
likely to send our first human mission
to the Arctic regions of Mars but
there's plenty of evidence that there is
other access to water and there may even
be liquid water subsurface liquid water
a lot of evidence now that is coming and
other is and you can see with some of
these cliff faces
is that there have been out pores of
water from these liquid water and recent
some recent examination of some images
they took a few years ago of a
particular cliff face compared to just
one very recently showed that this has
happened within the last few years so
this is an act this is actually
happening this isn't something that
happened like three million years ago
you know when they say oh it's in the
recent past three million years ago well
that's great its recent in geological
terms but not in our terms but no this
happened within the last two or three
years so they're very will could be when
we send people to Mars you know with
particularly with the correct drilling
equipment they very well could reach
water right there on the surface and
utilize that so that's another reason
why it's mud you know you can actually
live off the land the atmosphere you
know the resources and this good
evidence we can actually grow food in
the soil there's a few things we have to
work around there but this one of the
reasons why we were also hoping to focus
on this look at what we know about the
soil composition on Mars and start
finding ways to overcome perhaps some of
the challenges yeah I actually heard
somebody say that um Mars soil would be
particularly good for growing asparagus
though but you know once you can grow
things you can also manufacture things
as well you know it's not just about
food you can grow you know it's about
manufacturing bamboo has been a people
think that you can grow bamboo on it and
bamboo can be used for an awful lot of
things so once you start growing plants
you can start producing stuff that you
don't have to pull in from Earth and
that's pivotal without that once again
we're just going to be limited to small
research bases on Mars yes
attention
I can't hear you can you actually come
up to the mic I can't even hear I can't
hear sorry so I don't see how the
existence of an atmosphere in mass would
help because the density of the Mars
atmosphere on the surface of Mars is
actually as low as like five or six
times the altitude above Himalayas and
so you know yes there is air and most of
it is count outside but at that altitude
human cannot survive without like like a
mass and an oxygen tank so it sits in so
in a sense I guess you could perhaps
grow food with that atmosphere but first
of all the rate would be slow and
secondly human cannot I mean it's not
like we can walk around without it well
no the humans can't walk around there
and yeah we're not going to we made
there made some people actually say you
could grow thing some sort of plants
even in the yet without shielded but
that's very speculate at the moment
everything will be within you know
atmospheres that we create and you're
right we can't walk around on the
surface but that doesn't mean we
shouldn't go frankly people always say
we're not designed to go to into space
because our bodies aren't designed to do
that well I suppose you can argue that
but trust me and then I'm borrowing this
from somebody else's analogy but we're
not actually designed on living on the
majority of the earth also try living I
you know friends I live in Boston you
know if I were actually trying to live
there as nature created me I don't think
I'd last too many evenings in the winter
naked in Boston you know we're not
designed to live in most of earth
without but we're we were able to adapt
to environments because we're able to
adapt advance and this is part of it
this is the part part of advancement if
we never left you know the small sliver
of the planet where humanity originated
we stayed there we wouldn't be obviously
we wouldn't be here there
be no Google there would be no internet
we were you know we'd be just living
happily you know in this very small
tropical area because you know what do
you think it was good that we expand it
off or not it drove innovation because
we had the challenge humanity had the
challenge itself to overcome the
obstacles by doing so civilization was
created pyramids are built great
civilizations all over the world were
built and you know it sometimes you look
but why would we want to live there
sometimes you know I can't give you all
the answers I think I know passionately
we should because just for scientific
reasons and for just kind of a vision of
humanity that we're work going out there
and we are kind of committing ourselves
something greater than this planet and
plus kind of preserving our humanity and
our worldwide cultures you know which
are pretty fragile a lot of things could
happen that would uh if we stayed here
you know could pretty much and
everything and nobody would ever
remember what we were about so there's
also that elementary beverage preserving
the species as well but I think it's
also going to be a great thing as I was
saying to kind of find new innovations
so they're going to help us back here on
earth yet that you never know you never
actually know that these things are
possible until you start doing it start
challenging yourself and so that's
another great reason to go you know to
Mars in particular but thing is Mars
isn't the end goal we're saying we want
to go to Mars we want people to go there
but we're not going to be able to look
anywhere else until we start it that's
the problem is Martin explore Mars
really isn't about saying we want to go
to Mars that's it that's the end goal
it's a great place to live and no people
will be vacationing there no well yeah
we hope there are settlements we hope
people you know do live there but we
hope this is the starting point where we
can actually really start exploring and
finding ways to overcome the obstacles
the very big obstacles that are out
there preventing us from doing anything
and doing real exploration and just
because we don't know how to do them now
doesn't mean they don't exist so so I
just want to make sure i'm i'm not
against exploring mass but
it seems to me that the the goal that we
are talking about right now is
eventually hopefully a some kind of
permanent settlement as opposed to
people going there either as an
exploration like what we've done in the
60s with the moon or some kind of
tourism where people just go there for
say one weekend and come back and it
seems to me that because sending a human
being there is so much more expensive
compared to say sending a rover so so
here's a proposition why not do a lot
more explorations with robots before we
actually create a price to send a human
being they're like why why not why not
make a much cheaper price to send to
have private institutions send a robot
there well I think it's great to have
private institutions and a robot there
I'd love I love us to do it but it's
actually not correct to say you people
say that sending robots are more
efficient actually no they're not you
can it is cheaper to send one rover to
mars and send people no question about
it but it would take an extraordinary
day if you wanted to get the same amount
of science down of the human could do
would take an awful lot of Rovers humans
do things much better much more
efficient like actually probably the
best best-known rawat robot guy at least
in the United States Steve Squyres Mars
robots you know right around the spirit
runs Spirit and Opportunity you know
yeah he's a big advocate for robots but
you know he's quoted as saying and he
said it several times to me that one
human crew could do everything that
these Rovers and they've been there for
six years and I can't remember how far
they've gone but you know several miles
one human crew could do the smell level
of science they've done in one day
probably less than one day that these
and go further than those Rovers you
know just walking you know but but
they'll also have their own vehicle so
they'll be able to travel you know
minimum of 50 miles a day humans can
bend over pick up a rock and break it
open
if you've probably noticed it takes an
awful lot of effort for even a rover to
try to even get below like a millimeter
below the surface of a rock yeah that's
not mean they've been wonderful them in
a wonderful resource and we do need to
continue sending Rovers because frankly
would be foolish not to set foolish to
send people there before we had this
data I mean these Rovers and Landers and
orbiters have been vital to sending
people to the planet but if you really
want to explore and you want to do it
efficiently humans are going to do it a
lot better they're going to in the end
they'll do it less for less money
because if you want real science down if
you want to get these questions answered
you know the humans are going to be much
more likely to get it for instance
there's a lot of circumstantial evidence
of life on Mars you know other the
environments possible past or present
you know the environment was obviously
may have been appropriate for life in
the past but all the evidence of
subsurface water okay every place on
earth where there's water there's life
one thing there is methane m in the
atmosphere Mars can't be because of the
thinness of the Mars atmosphere it can't
sustain methane for very long it has to
resupply the methane every few centuries
so they can't quite account for why this
methane is here the only way the two
ways we know would come are from
geological sources volcanoes and other
thing and mostly from volcanoes but and
after effects of volcanic activity and
life there could be some volcanic
activity going on on Mars we don't know
about they even we have you think we
would have noticed hot spots but there
could be going on but even if it is
volcanic activity that means there is a
heat source and water on Mars which once
again points the possibility of life but
getting back to humans and once again
I'm borrowing a line from somebody else
here but people make darn Terry good
fossil hunters it's if you sent a robot
one of these Rovers out into any
particular Hill you know
in the Badlands you know you know what
we know there are a lot of dinosaur
bones highly unlikely the rover would
find anything even though we know it
just filled with dinosaur bones you know
humans would find them because we're
good at that thing and we can we don't
have to wait 20 minutes for a change in
command we can bend over we can analyze
a rock we're intuitive robotic robots
may become like that over time but
humans for at least for the foreseeable
future do things much better and frankly
inspiration people kind of discount
inspiration robots yeah they kind of
inspire people people love looking at
the Rovers but it's not give me nothing
compared to when the first people walk
on Mars and you can't you can't estimate
how much impact that will have back in
the Apollo program in a particularly
with education we doubled the number of
science and education degrees as a
result of Apollo because people were
inspired by the fact that people we were
landing on the moon it looked like we
had this you know endless possibilities
about exploring and I'm a big advocate
for funding spare science education but
I don't think we would have actually
doubled the number of science and
engineering degrees if we had just spent
the money on education you sometimes
need to inspire people and that's one of
the problems we have in this country
right now you know no matter how much
money we pour into science and education
if you don't have something to inspire
them they don't think they're going to
do something cool you know in something
that's relevant are larger than
themselves there are a lot of what are
easier ways to go through college a lot
of easier ways to make money then going
into one of these really complicated
technical degrees or anything else so
since we have been endlessly talking
about oh we're not we're not graduating
enough science and engineering people in
this country well because we're not
inspiring our kids do so and this sort
of thing can also inspire generations
not just here but around the world to
embrace technology and see that there
something beyond you just products you
know well I'm going to go into science
so I can provoke create this new product
there's nothing wrong with products I
know I'm in an environment that's
creating products all the time I love
them I love google but you know there's
something beyond that and I know the
founders of this company know that as
well since they've there because of
their passion for space you know with a
lunar prize and the other things
relating to Mars there you know push
forward so I think it's really important
people underestimate the value the
psychological value as well of sending
people as opposed to robots to Mars any
other questions or any concepts of what
we can do to try to promote this message
or projects you think we could promote
you know the stimulate people like
people from google or silicon valley and
as a whole hey ray well thank you very
much for having me here and it's great
to speak thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
