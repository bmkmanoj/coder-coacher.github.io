honors for his innovative use of
statistics the title of his talk today
is racial profiling analysis in a post
beer summit world please welcome Greg
Ridgeway thank you it's a pleasure to be
here today I'm glad to have a such an
interesting audience to hear probably a
topic that you don't get to talk about
around here so today I'm going to be
talking about racial profiling analysis
and it's something I've worked on on a
lot but it's come up sort of as part of
a line of work we've been doing for
police departments around the country
police departments don't get a lot of
analytical attention and many times it's
not sort of part of their standard
business traditionally but now you come
across this topic of racial profiling
analysis and others are doing their
analysis for them not always doing it
well so we're going to try to dive into
into some of these these issues so
racial profiling has been a concern
going back several years certainly
stronger in the minority communities in
the u.s. it really came to sort of
probably public prominence in the in the
1990s when there's a series of what are
known as the i-95 Turnpike studies the
first one was on the New Jersey Turnpike
there was a lawsuit the federal
department justice brought a lawsuit
against the New Jersey State Police for
racial profiling on the Turnpike and so
researchers did something sort of
interesting
they they collected data on who was
being stopped and the race distribution
of who is being stopped on the New
Jersey Turnpike and then they sent a car
going down the New Jersey Turnpike going
around 60 miles an hour and a passenger
in the car would look at the cars that
were passing them didn't record okay
that look like white black latino black
black Latino white why and and and then
tabulated to see whether the race
distribution of who was passing them in
the car was matched that of the race
distribution of who's being stopped and
they and they didn't match and there
were some some problems with this study
for example I mean if any of you are
from New Jersey who goes on the Turnpike
of 60 miles an hour so no one no one
goes 60 miles an hour in the Turnpike so
everyone was flying flying past them and
later studies looked at who was going 70
miles an hour 80 miles an hour and the
results changed a little bit the second
study was on on the Maryland through
mayor i-95 through Maryland and that had
similar results so as a result of these
court cases public concern the there's
there's been a lot of legislation
happening about 14 states have passed
legislation banning the practice of
racial profiling requiring police
departments to collect data and that's
led to a lot of different practices
going on around the country most
recently not so long ago about two years
ago there was the the high-profile
arrest of Henry Louis Gates and that
resulted in the the infamous beer summit
and that renewed a lot of interest and
of course what was on everybody's mind
was what beers will be consumed at the
beer summit and I know that was going to
be peak and your interest so I've listed
what actually was consumed at that beer
summit now as much as racial profiling
was involved in this discussion it was
also concerned about the status of
American beer brewing because many of
the the selected beers are now foreign
brewed but that was sort of a sideshow
to the main event so racial profiling
there's it's it's a question that that
demands some sort of analysis and there
is in fact lots of analysis going on out
there hundreds of studies perhaps every
year are being
trying to address the question about
whether this department or that
department are targeting minorities in
their community most of these studies
are very weak and they go either way
either in favor of the hypothesis of
racial profiling or against it and
there's several problems here to my
favorite ones in Texas there was a study
that that concluded that 75% of agencies
stop more black and latino drivers than
white drivers now that's the sort of
thing that makes headlines but let's
pause for a minute and think about this
well in in Texas whites are actually the
minority now so I don't know whether it
makes whether a hundred percent of
agencies should stop more black and
Latino just because of the population
now the Black Latino and whites are not
uniformly mixed throughout Texas but if
in fact they were uniformly mixed I
would expect a hundred percent of
departments to pop stop more black and
latino drivers but there isn't it isn't
sort of uniformly mixed so I don't know
in the end whether 75% is reasonable or
not there's not a good benchmark to
compare that to now on the other hand
there are some studies that sort of
hastily defend the police department for
example in Sacramento the percentage of
black drivers stopped match the
percentage of blacks among crime suspect
descriptions and they said okay and
since that's okay the department's okay
now that's not satisfactory either
because we don't stop people for traffic
we stop people for traffic offense for
only two stop signs speeding running is
a red light we don't the cops aren't
stopping cards because that person's
armed robbery suspect or I was wanted in
a mugging now that happens sometimes but
there's no reason that those two should
match so it does go both both ways so
now let's get to some methods that
actually are transparent that are that
that really do address the key questions
of interest and I'm going to focus on
three questions race bias in the
decision to make a stop internal
benchmarking systems that assess whether
individual officers are targeting
minorities in their community and lastly
looking at post-op outcomes search rates
how long the stops take and so on so
let's start off with a decision to make
a stop so what makes this so hard it
seems like a very simple question we
should be able to construct 2 pie charts
who's being stopped who's at risk of
being stopped and compare them
difference equals racial profile so
let's try make an attempt at this this
is a data from the city of oakland 2003
my first study in the area in this area
in oakland they from police statistics
they found that fifty six percent of the
individual stopped were were black
drivers okay doesn't not necessarily we
do we know whether that's too big or too
small we need some subtler benchmark to
compare that to and that's where the big
wrinkle is what do we compare it to so
the easiest thing is what everybody
jumps to is the census and the two don't
match so thirty-five percent of Oakland
residents are black and so fifty-six
percent / thirty-five percent is 1.6 and
that's the number that sort of gets
touted in the press and in discussions
and claims of racial profiling now
there's lots of other reasons why it
could be the same they could be
differences it could in fact be race
bias it could be that there are officers
that are targeting minorities in the
community and that might explain some of
this but there are differences in
driving behavior car ownership how much
how much time they spend on the road and
the care with which they drive for
example Hispanics are often are the ones
most likely to wear their seat belt if
the police are out in force doing
seatbelt violations they should actually
shouldn't stop many Hispanics in their
community there are differences across
race groups and lastly the big one in
Oakland is that there are differences in
exposure to the police that is in some
areas the flatlands in Oakland there can
be ten times as many police officers as
in the Oakland Hills so if you drive one
block through the flatlands going 70
miles an hour you're going to be stopped
right away if you drive 70 miles across
the center miles per hour across the
Oakland Hills you have a good chance of
making that without being caught by a
cop you might run into
something some other obstacle but not a
police officer so all these things mix
together formulate that difference of
1.6 and we can't attribute it that
directly to racial profiling so but all
is not lost we have some other methods
that we can use so this is the approach
that we took we noted the ability to
discriminate requires officers to
identify the race of the drivers in
advance that is think about the racially
biased officer in order to practice
racial profiling they've got to be able
to see the race of the driver advance
and say AHA that's the race group that I
wanted to target I'm going to go pursue
a stop of this vehicle okay second the
ability to identify the race in advance
of a stop decreases as it gets dark and
this is something you can test out on
your way home this evening or depending
on when you get off from work that when
it's light out it's reasonably easy to
see the race of drivers in other cars
not always but it's easier and at wet
and at night it becomes more difficult
now it's not impossible but it's more
difficult that's all we need so more
details of this are in the paper that I
wrote in the journal of american
statistical association but using these
two features are explained simply what
we did let's look in oakland fifty
percent of the drivers stopped in
daylight were we're black okay compare
that to the percentage of black drivers
that were stopped at night fifty-four
percent and so this is actually runs
counter to the racial profiling
hypothesis that is if it's dark outside
the racially biased officer should have
more difficulty identifying the race to
the drivers in advance and we should see
that number go down but instead we see
it go up now this naive analysis is far
from perfect we're looking at people
driving during the day compared to
people driving at night people who drive
during the day are different from those
who drive at night the police do
different things during the day than
they do at night so all of these
confound the analysis so we got we can't
just stop at this simple analysis we got
to take it one step further all right
I'm going to show you a graph on the on
the horizontal axis I've got
time going from 5pm to 9 p.m. at night
on the vertical axis I have hours since
sunset so let me put some dots up there
that represents tops each of these is a
stop involving a driver now you can see
some stuff like let's take a look at
this stop right here this is a stop of a
white driver that occurred at around six
thirty in the evening when 630 was about
two hours before sunset it's light
outside easier to see now sometimes 630
occurs after dark sometimes during the
year it's dark at six thirty and these
stops occur at six thirty when it's an
hour after sunset and Stark so we've got
this great natural experiment going on
that sometimes at six-thirty it's light
outside and some sometimes it's dark
outside it gets even better there's this
gap right here where you see no stops
going on and this is my this often
puzzling why no stops occur in this band
here and it's because twice a year we
suddenly change the clocks from to and
from daylight savings time so on one
Monday it's light out x 6 30 and the
cops can see reasonably well into the
other vehicles and the following Monday
it's dark outside now we don't think the
mix of who's driving on the road
suddenly switch from one Monday to the
next monday we don't think suddenly
there's gonna be a lot more black
drivers more white drivers the police
don't change their patrol patterns just
because it's still at six-thirty not not
they don't change their patrol patrol
patterns because of daylight savings
time so we've got this this great
natural experiment the only thing
difference between that one monday and
the following monday is that it's light
out 1 1 monday and it's dark out the
following Monday okay so what do we do
slice up this plot into little slivers
so we look just stops right around
six-thirty and we see that fifty three
percent of the those stop at six thirty
went slide outside were black and fifty
four percent were stopped when it's dark
outside so that's just for 630 we can do
this compete this analysis across all
the different time slices we could do
some statistical modeling to smooth that
out and what we'll find is across the
this time you'll find equal rates of
black and white bean stopped
so that's what the analysis we did in
Oakland this is analysis that was
actually SAT around a table with lots of
people from the community from the
police for the police union from the
ACLU and the Citizen Police Review Board
and all these communities and presented
this analysis and everyone sees that
there is not a difference that the
ability to see the race the driver in
advance it's not influencing who's
getting stopped we repeated this
analysis in Cincinnati as well and came
up with similar results so that's
looking at bias in the decision to make
a stop but that's not satisfactory
either in fact departments and even the
public don't necessarily think that it's
a department-wide pattern that they
don't think that the entire department
is biased but I think on both sides
there is agreement that there are
probably a few bad apples in just about
every organization of some size okay and
that gets the second part if there if
you're not having problems at a
department wide level how can you come
up with practices an analysis that will
identify those bad apples before they
show up on the six o'clock news okay so
this is some work we did for the New
York City Police Department here's an
officer this officer made 392 stops in
2006 of pedestrians okay eighty-six
percent of those pedestrians that this
officer stopped were black sounds like a
lot or maybe it's not depends on what
part of New York this out what part of
New York this officer works let's get a
little bit more detail on this officer
and what where how this officer works we
know that three percent of this officers
stops occurred in January we know that
thirteen percent occurred on Mondays we
know that 23% occurred between eight and
ten p.m. we know that they were mostly
in Brooklyn north in precincts B and C
that is that most of the stops occurred
outside most the time this officer made
stops in uniform and so on we know a lot
about this officer in fact this is just
a partial partial list so now what we
can do is look for stops made by other
officers that occurred in a similar time
place and context so I went through the
database of other stops that were made
and I found about 3,700 stops made by
other officers that match the officer in
question stops stop occurred in the same
time same place same context ok so these
officers should have been exposed the
same sort of suspicious characters the
same sort of infractions and offenses
the same rates of jaywalking they should
all be seeing the same thing they're
doing the same job in fact it's even
better we have the XY coordinates of
exactly where these stops are taking
place and this here's the officer in
question he looks like he's on a foot
patrol sort of walking up and down these
three blocks and here is a contour plot
of where the benchmark the his peers
that we're using to compare their
walking up and down that same block to
ok so now the big question how what's
the percentage of black pedestrians that
this officers peers are stopping and we
find that fifty five percent of those
stops involve black pedestrians that's a
big difference whether statistical or
otherwise that's that's a big difference
and now we've identified a particular
problem and we repeat this analysis for
the several thousand officers that are
regularly involved in stopping
pedestrians in New York and identified
five officers that are substantially
stopping more black pedestrians than
their peers did the same for for Latino
pedestrians found another about eight or
so officers that were stopping a lot
more Latino pedestrians than their peers
now we've we've developed a system
that's been deployed in Cincinnati and
I'll talk more about Cincinnati in a
second it's sort of a web-based system
that is constantly monitoring officers
activities and they run quarterly
reports and every quarter they flag
about say four five six officers and
this has turned out to be a very useful
program for them now these six officers
they flag the chief has told me well
let's say they end up falling into three
categories maybe one category they knew
about yes there was been a problem with
these two officers that were flagged
they've got complaints we've had some
other administrative problems with them
I've
sign them to senior field training
officer they've got six months to shape
up or ship out that's and that's exactly
the sort of thing that we want to to
highlight another two they'll have a
good explanation that officer was on a
special gang detail we was targeting
specific gang for nine months last year
that's a variable that is not in his
benchmark calculation that we did fine
I'm glad they were able to sort of sort
out that question and get that addressed
and the other two officers they didn't
know about no other signs of problems no
other signs of anything going on lets
you know mark that have the supervisor
discussion with that officer and see how
things go over the over the next quarter
the next six months and this is exactly
the kind of discussion that we want
police executives to have about managing
their police force it's not a ness elia
indictment of the officers that are
flagged here but it's a step for
flagging among the thousands of officers
doing work can you identify some of
those that require more more follow-up
and there's more details about all the
gory statistical methods behind it again
in another journal american statistical
association paper that came out in 2009
and for the statisticians among you the
methodology i think is quite quite
clever you might find it useful in your
own work it blends sort of three siskel
methods that are in being developed
manas disco methods that are the target
of a lot of research that includes a
propensity score estimation doubly
robust estimation and false discovery
rate and it sort of combines these three
methods to to identify potential
problems in the police department the
last thing so we've talked about race
bias in the decision to make a stop the
department wide talked about potential
problems with individual officers now
let's talk about a third step about
looking at activity after the stop takes
place there's a lot of different ways
that this can be done one we can
actually audit police interaction with
the public and we've done this we've
collected several hundred video tapes
from those in car cameras that you see
on the cop show and we watched them and
we had we coded them we looked for you
of terms of respect on the part of the
officer on the part of the driver did
the officer have his hand on his gun did
he walk with his back lots of things you
can code from these and there are some
interesting things that can come out of
that one interesting thing is we found
that black officers and white officers
in the particular community where you
studying are different they ask
different questions in fact the black
officers tended not to ask many
questions they you know Mandy rolled to
a stop sign here's your ticket off you
go very simple interaction the white
officers tended to be much more
proactive they saw the stop that's an
opportunity to do investigation where
are you going you have any contraband in
the car who asked IDs from the others in
other passengers in the car these are
two different but valid approaches to
the two policing now if you're a young
black man in this community and you have
a very different experience with a black
officer and a white officer you're not
going to just attribute that to
different frameworks of policing I think
it's reasonable to expect that that
young black man to attribute that to
race bias so there are some things that
the department could do to reduce the
appearance the and the perception of a
racial but of race bias and their
policing so that's something that we got
out of looking at these police videos
it's also often common practice to look
at hit rates after the stop takes place
do you find do you do a search and are
those searches productive in the sense
that you found drugs weapons or
something like that that's an
interesting Avenue to take so what we're
going to look at is comparing black and
white drivers in similar situations and
look at stop outcomes and more details
around the paper in the journal of
quantitative criminology if you want to
look up the details on this so let's
take a look at what happened in
cincinnati now cincinnati you might
remember was about ten years ago now was
the site of riots following the shooting
of Timothy Thomas and that led to about
a 56 year federal oversight of the
Cincinnati Police Department now that
department is is quite a change
apartment from where it was 10 years ago
it's winning awards it's it's sort of a
model department in many ways at the
time we were doing this analysis they
were in the middle of a court settlement
with a class-action lawsuit on civil
rights violations so let's take a look
at what was happening in Cincinnati at
that time if we look at black drivers in
in one year about 27,000 black drivers
were stopped in Cincinnati fifty-five
percent of them had stops lasting less
than ten minutes this is the bout as
long as the stop should take if
everything sort of simple you ran a stop
live me run your license and you got a
ticket off you go should it stop those
top should last less than 10 minutes so
black driver is about fifty-five percent
of the time they had one of these stops
these short stops on the other hand
non-black drivers and I use the term
non-black drivers in Cincinnati that's
essentially white drivers but sixty-five
percent of them had stops lasting less
than 10 minutes so the the white drivers
in Cincinnati we're experiencing much
shorter stops more frequently than the
black drivers so why why is this the
question and now this difference is the
kind of thing that makes the headlines
big difference big disparity between our
black black black drivers and white
drivers are treated in our community but
there is more to the story let's have a
look at that just like with the officers
we know a lot of detail about these
stops for example take a look at the the
driver's licenses twenty-two percent of
black drivers stopped in Cincinnati did
not have a valid driver's license now I
think everyone can agree that if you
don't have a valid driver's license
regardless we were raised that's going
to take more time on the part of the
police the over-the-rhine neighborhood
this is the site of the of the other
riots several years ago nine percent of
the black drivers were stopped in the
over-the-rhine neighborhood while five
percent of the white drivers were
stopped in over-the-rhine now policing
might just be different over-the-rhine
is a is a high-crime neighborhood or it
certainly was during this period and
policing was very different and you
those police you might have asked a lot
more questions if anyone stopped in that
neighborhood
ninety-three percent of black drivers
were Cincinnati residents whereas 61
percent of the white drivers were
Cincinnati residents now you might
wonder whether the cincinnati police
should be treating the Kentucky drivers
differently from the Cincinnati drivers
but it's possible that there are factors
other than than race at play here all
right so now that we know all these
differences what do we do about it we
see that we don't know now whether that
difference between fifty five percent
and sixty-five percent is due to race or
it's due to one of these other factors
that's listed in this table yes
you got it
no other way around of those of the
black drivers stopped nine percent were
stopped in over-the-rhine okay and you
look at one of the other ones you know
the i-75 you know only of the black
drivers four percent were stopped on
i-75 when the major freeways there while
eleven percent of the white drivers so
the white drivers are just have dipped
there's there's stopped in different
context you know the kinds of stops that
occur on the freeways are different from
those that occur inside the city and
that may or may not impact the the the
length of a stop but it's a factor that
we see that are different between black
and white so let's try to get so this
comparison now is more than just
comparing black and white it's comparing
black and white in different context as
an apples to oranges comparison so let's
try to get at an apples-to-apples
comparison so what I did is identified
non-black drivers that were stopped at
the same time same place same context as
the black drivers in Cincinnati so have
a look now we've got stops involving
white drivers where twenty percent of
them had invalid driver's licenses ten
percent of them were stopped in
over-the-rhine ninety-two percent of
them were Cincinnati residents so in all
respects within one or two percentage
points we've got white drivers that were
stopped at the same time same place same
context as the black drivers okay so any
difference we observed between these
27,000 black drivers and these five
thousand white drivers that's not due to
time place context that's more likely
due to race so now let's see what the
results are there of those of those
white drivers fifty-seven percent of
them had stops lasting less than ten
minutes okay so much of the difference
between the fifty-five percent and the
sixty-five percent has to do with
factors other than race has to a time
place context now there is still a
difference but the difference is
fifty-five percent and fifty-seven
percent that's still a difference and if
you're the the black driver that has a
stop lasting excessively long this is no
this is no consolation but the fact is
this is the number that that the public
needs to worry about and discuss and
debate let's look at search rates
another outcome this is over several
several years we see that searches of
non black drivers vary between about 2.6
and three percent of stops of white
drivers result in searches on the other
end here are look these these white dots
out here the stops involving black
drivers are out here at more like six
seven percent okay so on the face of it
we've got large differences between the
search rates of of black drivers and the
search rates of white drivers a lot more
searching of black drivers is occurring
in Cincinnati now let's do the same
thing again these stops occur at
different time places context let's
match them up let's find there's a black
driver stopped in this neighborhood at
this time let's find a white driver
stopped at the same time place context
and check out the search rates and
that's the comparison between the the
blue dot and the white dot and if you
notice in the most recent year I have
data on 2008 the white drivers stopped
at the same time plays context or
actually searched more than the black
drivers in those neighborhoods in fact
that pattern is consistent for the last
three years 2006 through 2008 yes
I think they were surprised although
there have been some theories that the
of what's known as d policing that the
police will back off when faced with you
know with court challenges and civil
rights accusations which might not be a
bad thing in the end for improving
police community relations and improving
Public Safety and and so on so it could
be that you the counter black driver and
maybe this cop normally would have done
a search or thing and now given you know
the the scrutiny you know backs off some
and we don't we don't have evidence of
this we don't have this documented there
are people that sort of talk about this
sort of thing happening and it's not
necessarily a bad thing yeah
alright so i was i was asked how do i
pick the matches to make sure they sort
of within the same context i used the
finest data that I have available so in
Cincinnati what I had was the
neighborhood level they sliced up
Cincinnati into I think 53 neighborhoods
most of them are fairly small that we
would feel like that's called it really
is a neighborhood and so at the best
level I could match on neighborhood in
the New York example you saw that i
actually had XY coordinates so I matched
the entire distribution of X what the
distribution of the XY coordinates to
make sure that those overlap same with
time I'm AB I'm matching the continuous
distribution of time making sure that
those are as close as I can get so in
closing I've gone through three examples
noting that it's not in the end that
hard to do good analysis of racial
profiling issue now there's a lot of
naive analysis out there I mentioned the
the census comparison I've mentioned
this with a naive comparison of let's
compare the search rate for whites and
the search rates for blacks and any
differences there must be racial
profiling so that sort of dismissed
those as reasonable analyses but I've
also shown that it doesn't take that
much effort to push it just a little bit
farther to do a real transparent
calculation get the apples to apples
comparison match black and white drivers
stopped in the same context match
officers with other officers that are
patrolling the same time place and
context and when I present this to
whether it's a police union or community
group it's it's done and just much as
you've seen it here it's very
transparent and easy to understand
there's nothing that technical under the
hood there's a lot of Statistics work to
try to make sure the matches look good
and things like that but the end the
tables that I've shown you say say at
all and if you want a more detailed on
any of these studies you can visit the
center on quality policing website
that's see QPR an org all of our reports
are are always free downloadable on the
web as our all of other brands other
reporters this is not unique just to
our policing work but you're happy to
sort of dive in and learn more about the
the research there thank you and we're
happy to take questions there's anyone
so I didn't catch in your present first
thanks for coming and for speaking I
didn't quite catch um if you looked at
the data for like what are the results
of one of the traffic stops like this
Asura is there always a citation
sometimes I did sometimes not so what I
talked the two examples I gave were of
outcomes worse weather search occurs
whether and with us the length of the
stop was less than ten minutes but we
also looked at whether whether citation
occurred weather warning occurred
whether an arrest occurred where the
person was asked to step out of the car
there's lots of other things that you
can also track and it just depends on
what the police have good data on and
Cincinnati being under a consent decree
with the with as a result of this class
action lawsuit actually had really good
data that they had a really good
auditing process they had the monitoring
going on and they were actually
collecting very rich data so we did look
at all those questions now I noted in
these examples sort of looking at across
the entire city you know generally
didn't find a large race disparity
issues that turns out it's not always
the case did some work in New York where
we found some neighborhoods where there
was no evidence of race bias but others
where there were large differences even
after this matching by time place
context you would find neighborhoods in
New York where there where black
pedestrians were still frisked more
searched more arrested more had more use
of force used against them and there was
no explanation you know that no excuse
could be made other than you know it
wasn't time place context it had to be
something else and perhaps and race buys
was one of the remaining candidates have
you found that in general as a trend
that police departments are becoming
much more I don't know amenable to or
interested in statistical analysis just
beyond Rachel
profiling but general there's a lot of
variability so there are some there are
certainly some departments that are
doing a lot of data collection it takes
Chicago Police Department for example as
a good model here they have an
award-winning a data warehouse called
the clear system they compile lots of
data both on some operational aspects to
attack the crime problem but also on
public complaints so all of those are
tracked are really well what's not
happening yet is a lot of strategic
analysis based on that they've got a lot
of tactical information if you want to
know about a particular address you can
pull in lot from lots of data sources
lots of information about the problems
at that particular address but now you
want to look at say across all addresses
that are problems and look for patterns
and that's where it's become more
challenging they've developed a
predictive analytics group which is a of
a new thing in policing and they're
being able to forecast tomorrow just
like the weather there's a strong chance
of a gang retaliation shooting in this
one block area let's move some resources
in and I think there that's sort of the
limit and where things are heading so
there are some departments are very
progressive in this way two questions
how is your work funded and second how
what kind of reactions do you get from
people from the community and from
police when you present this information
yeah so the funding issue so r and as a
whole gets funding from a variety of
sources primarily the federal government
but also from foundations from private
donors and philanthropists from and
contracts from from cities this
particular work I've blended together
several projects so the City of Oakland
was a grant from the National Institute
of Justice Cincinnati was a contract
with the city that as part of this court
settlement so in some sense we're
reporting to the to the city but also
reporting to the federal monitor who was
reporting to the federal judge New York
was with the New York City Police
Foundation where they were trying to get
ahead of the problem before it got worse
now the second question was at the
reaction
wide range those who are sort of on the
front lines of this I get it they think
these are the right questions and the
right approaches they appreciate the
transparency of the methodology so I
presented this to police chiefs police
unions community organizations like the
ACLU and they get it and they buy into
it and they want to do more so can we so
we didn't find problems here let's start
looking over in this space and apply
those methods there to see if there's
issues there there are always exceptions
to that there's always I've been at
several community meetings when someone
looks at me says white guy blue eyes
we're tired of white guys with blue eyes
looking at this data we need you know
someone who's the real look now the good
thing about this is they can count the
same numbers that I did and then still
in the end they will count fifty five
percent are serged and fifty-seven
percent of the whites are searched so in
the end it's just counting so there's
not really a lot of statistical tricks
going on here and that's a good thing
about this thanks for the presentation I
don't think I caught the first part of
so this data reflects actual violations
of crime when these individuals are
being pulled over or it's the genesis is
more based solely on race of so the data
that you're getting so the traffic stops
are all traffic stops that now allegedly
they're stopped for a reason for some
traffic citation or you know a suspect
one for a suspect but that's they should
be stopped for some for some reason same
with the the pedestrians the stops
involving pedestrians they in New York
in order to make a stop of a pedestrian
they have to be suspected of a penal
code violation there is sort of a
standard if they just go up and talk to
someone say hey how's it going you know
that's not that's not the level that
would show up in this data and then the
second question is how is the police
department how do they train the
officers are they is this profiling in
the broadest sense part of the training
that they have or
do you find that this issue of racial
profiling is just endemic in on the job
course of action now I mean I think the
if the official training they trained
try to train out racial bias I mean in
fact NYPD has done some innovative
programs bringing people to you know
entire recruit classes to black
neighborhoods and have that community
sort of yell at them about all the
problems that there that they've had to
the police that the new recruits is go
to understand the abuses that have
happened in this in this neighborhood so
that when their policing that
neighborhood this doesn't they don't
please in the same way of the past now
there there are sort of Kate certainly
cases where things go wrong and and
officers you know abused their their
police powers for racial reasons for
non-racial reasons and so I don't think
the training the anti proshel profiling
training is up to the level that that
needs to happen nor is it apply there
are 17,000 law-enforcement agencies
across this country it's a lot of
variability in the quality of training
of any kind much less issues of racial
profiling I think that's still a work in
progress yes I had a comment about your
traffic stop study where you said that
it's much more difficult to tell if
somebody is black or white you know
after dark yeah but I think the car is
probably are similar i mean you can you
can kind of go with this whole like you
know black people in a car potentially
have a different type of car different
much better says that yeah this issue
doesn't bias the test but it undercuts
the statistical power of the test in the
same way if the city was lit up at night
you know it doesn't undercut the it
doesn't buy us the test that there was
difficult test but under powers it
because some fraction of those some at
the night time stops half the stops are
still lit up like they are during the
day
half of them are dark like like we need
them to it's a it's essentially an
instrumental variable analysis and
things like the using caught the car
type as a proxy or street lighting
undercut the quality of the instrument
to two separate to predict visibility so
indeed if car type was completely
correlated with the race of the driver
then then the the instrument is no
longer valid and just it's just you'll
always get a no results out of this but
we've got assumed that they are at least
some drivers in a Honda Accord that are
white and some other drivers in HoN
accord that are black and even though
take that into account no there's no
neat there's no need to because that the
mix of cars on the road won't change
between when it's light out when it's
dark out sorry there isn't a need to do
that for reasons of bias but uh the only
thing that you could do is to to improve
the power is you know then you start
having to eliminate intersections that
are well-lit from the analysis things
like that you know might might improve
the power of the statistical power of
the test
so in your style your control for
context where what time today was right
do you also control for the
possibilities that certain categories
would violate rules more often because
that wouldn't and that would disapprove
this is actually racial bias you just
just police doing its work if the car
speeding Nev say told people speed more
than it's not bias against all people
just tall people do control yeah so not
in the decision to make a stop that that
part's really hard I think to City the
first part in your decision to make a
stop because there's a lot of police
discretion in who to stop and who not to
stop and their studies that say if a cop
follows you for a mile he'll find some
reason to stop anyone so in the other
parts I'm dealing with stops police
activity that happened after the stop
takes place so the decision to search
Susan Susan to write a citation things
let things like that and there we sort
of at least they've stopped has met the
level of the police have its past the
police's discretion that this is someone
I needed to stop for some reason now if
we start finding differences in the
search rates that say the search rates
of blacks are much lower than search
rates of whites then you might wonder
maybe a lot of those stops shouldn't
have happened in the first place because
they're stopping people and going oh
this is the wrong guy I didn't really
need to stop this person so if we found
large differences in search rates or Raj
differences in citation rates that would
lead you to that conclusion now we're
not seeing those large differences
receiving smaller differences difference
is nonetheless so there might be some of
that going on but not at a not at a
large magnitude
you also have another thing going on
with trying to figure out who to stop is
that you have to measure who you didn't
stop and that's pretty hard yeah so the
sum of the original sum of other studies
will actually have like you know
graduate students staying on clipboards
we were staying with clipboards of
intersections watch cars go by much like
the New Jersey study and say okay well
that's a white guy white guy black eye
and trying to record this down that and
but then not everybody that passes by is
that risk for being stopped by a cop and
so then they try to say well let's make
this a little bit more difficult let's
put a radar gun and say alright let's
just get the race distribution of who's
exceeding the speed but the speed limit
by five miles per hour and then well
cops aren't stopping everyone that's in
five miles an hour they're looking for
other things and I brake lights out
seatbelt violations and so the list of
things that you try to get the graduate
student to record gets difficult now the
good thing about the daylight savings
time analysis I described is we don't
have to worry about that we just have to
assume police practice is the same you
know at six-thirty regardless of which
side of daylight savings time you're on
so they can do whatever it is that they
normally do whoever they usually stop
but we skip what we get to skip all that
I actually have two questions I'll just
ask one now but what you say the police
practice is the same where regardless of
whether it's day or night at six-thirty
I was just wondering if that's actually
you stated that kind of as an assumption
but is that is that true well I mean
with exception we do drop like headlight
violations for example because during
probably happen when it's when it's dark
out and there might be differences in
race of whether you know differences in
whether you have headlight violations
between black and white so we drop some
things like that now I've talked to the
police so you know what happens you when
it's dark out like oh no we're on strict
shift basis so we don't reallocate our
force you know our shift ends at
whatever nine o'clock whether it's
before or after daylight savings time so
our allocation is the same and in the
end they look for the same sorts of
things you're running red lights rolling
through stop signs speeding things like
that yeah I mean I actually think it's a
reasonable assumption i'm just pointing
it out because it is an assumption and
yep you know it could be questioned you
know you you know hypothetically maybe
there are people that are only racially
biased during the daytime or nighttime
analysis that would completely mess up
this analysis that's right you know when
it gets dark I turn into a racial
profiling I just make a brief calm than
that because if you remember the
Stanford Prison Experiment that you may
be familiar with where Stanford
psychology professor had I thought yeah
this I think undergrad students doesn't
matter undergrad or grad one group was
prisoners one group was guards and then
inevitably I guess the guards started
torturing the prisoners and actually the
people who wanted to commit these
atrocities in this experiment did prefer
the night shift and they did act at the
during the night shift
number though that it's the same it's
the same people 630 is not necessarily
the night shift but or there it's the
same people that are going to be there
when 630 is light out and when 630 is
dark so it is it be first analysis the
naive analysis that just compared
daylight to darkness we're talking about
different people that the people that
are getting trouble with the police
while you're sent to the midnight shift
you know that those sorts of things are
our problem with the naive just daylight
darkness analysis that's why we got to
really slice it up by clock time how do
you determine like at what locations
you're actually collecting the data from
and does the location either validate or
dis validate the results that you're
getting I mean to me it seems like if
you're in a predominantly Latin
community that you're going to probably
have more Latin population violating a
certain rule or wherever ethnicity that
you find yourself so how do you go about
so i get i get all the data all police
activity throughout cross the city so
for new york city no matter you know if
there's a stop that takes place i want
the data on it so there's no selection
on that now if I'm looking at search if
there's a concern about the high level
of the search rate of black pedestrians
in New York City I want to look at the
distribution across the city of where
stops of black pedestrians occur now and
they're different from where stops of
Latinos and stops of whites occurred
stops of asians occur but if we're
concerned about the search rate of black
pedestrians let's look at the
distribution of where where they occur
and let's find stops of whites that
occur in those same times place context
and match those up to the same
distribution these other methods that
are not such a fan of do have to pick an
intersection to station a graduate
student to write down a clipboard and
selecting those if you do it they're
good ways just go as of doing that just
like you would a standard siskel design
of experiments you know randomly pick
intersections things like that you can
do it well and you can also do it poorly
I came across a nice piece of work where
some police departments are scheduling
shifts based on the weather forecast
because they've got the correlations
between what kinds of things the police
need to do as a function of actual
instantaneous weather so they can
schedule shifts for the next few days
based off the weather forecast I can see
a real financial benefit to them doing
that because the lets them keep their
staffing level lower so the data
collection that track stuff as a
function of weather is completely offset
how much additional collection effort is
there for the police force to get from
that level of collections got a direct
financial benefit through to this one
which has a reducing your risk of
somebody getting really irritated with
you benefit all right so here the risk
is lawsuits yeah bet I mean how to have
it what's the collection effort for the
police force to provide you the data set
that you can then analyze well I'm not
sure I understand the question I mean a
lot of departments aren't collecting
anything on on their interactions with
the public there's about 14 to 15 states
that require all the police departments
to collect data on all stops so they've
got to do it anyway California it's no
requirement for police to document
interactions with the public some cities
the first one was san jose although i
don't know that they're still doing it
that they did it sort of voluntarily cuz
they thought it would be a good thing to
track for just because that was part of
their business you track things that are
at your core business la did it because
of a lawsuit so now i don't know if
these departments would do it because of
for necessarily for business not also a
lot of departments will say that there's
just a waste of money officer time to
collect this data that is never going to
be looked at or if it's looked at it's
going to be looked at poorly so there
that's certainly a complaint that I that
I that I here I guess I follow-up
question or phrasing that in a different
way it might be our their policy
implications for states and the federal
government
for this kind of data collection or
would it really be that to have a
blanket collection of data would be just
way too much overkill and it's better to
target areas where there where people
believe there's a problem where there
are lawsuits and so on yeah so there's a
some federal legislation called the end
of racial profiling Act it's been
introduced into Congress just about
every every term for the last four terms
most recently in 2010 and there's sort
of four pieces to this I'm not sure I
remember all of them but essentially it
bans the practice of racial profiling in
the United States that's actually not
been clearly stated by the federal
government prior to this the and then
the the other part is is to require all
any police department receiving federal
funds to collect data on on traffic
stops and report on it so there is sort
of this movement to make all departments
do it I'm not sure that's nicely cost
beneficial anytime the Justice
Department sort of this the Justice
Department through section 141 for one
of off this is the power that gives the
Justice Department the authority to
investigate bring lawsuits against
police departments that are have
suspected patterns or practice of civil
rights violations so when those come
when those sorts have come up the first
thing they do is you're going to start
doing data collection and it's not just
on traffic stops it's on any sort of
public contact it's about any arrest you
make about any use of force you make any
use of dogs start collecting data that's
so the first line of a bit of business
that they require the first stage and
that seems like a reasonable practice
and but I also don't think it
necessarily has to be the US Department
of Justice that makes that happen any
community that is concerned about the
group has suspicions of the police
department or feels that there's a
deterioration of police community
relations one of the first things at
that police department can do says we're
going to start collecting data and
monitoring this and report to the public
in a transparent way
to make sure we don't get to the point
where the Department of Justice is
knocking on our door doing an
investigation or find a lawsuit yes
yeah that's a good question it's
actually not too hard to validate this
so for example in Cincinnati when they
stopped someone they call in to dispatch
you know take me out of the pool because
I'm for the next 10-15 minutes I'm going
to be dealing with this traffic stop and
so we get a record from the dispatch
this guy was engaged in a traffic stop
and we look for the corresponding form
that just at least gets to the existence
of a traffic stop taking place now
whether it's what's on the form whether
that either search actually took place
or didn't take place that's that's not
necessarily that's harder to to audit
what certainly happens is if the person
comes in with a complaint and says I was
searched and the form says they weren't
searched and then they got the in-car
camera that shows the officer searching
but it's not on the form that's a big
problem and every officer knows that
it's not worth you know fledging the
form because this this sort of thing can
happen one last question I'll stay I'll
stick around if you want to almost more
quick follow-up to that is just that
because you really you talked about when
they stopped pedestrians and they just
talked to them and you say well that's
not a stop so they don't do the data
collection same thing here if they if
they were to stop someone and not call
dispatch then they don't have a record
of it is it possible you know that's an
example of harassment or something
that's not so two minute if it so now
we're talking difference between
pedestrians stopped in a traffic stop
stop traffic stop as well where they
stopped someone but don't call dispatch
they were ever hypothetically could vary
by department but it's in tonight they
would call dispatch because otherwise
they're on call like if a 911 call comes
in and they're out of their car you know
dealing with the traffic stop that's I'm
not alleging that it's happening I'm
saying that hypothetically a policeman
can stop someone get out of their car
and not call dispatch to be example yeah
apple yeah okay and but the other
question I wanted to ask had more to do
with them earlier when you're talking
about in Oakland how then the Oakland
Hills they don't have as many police
presumably because there's not as much
crime into oakland hills but
get not alleging this is happening but
like is there there's also the potential
that when you have more police in an
area you're likely to find more crime so
for the example of speeding tickets if
you had more Pete police in Oakland
Hills more people would be getting
speeding tickets but you don't put
police there because speeding tickets
are not considered to be like as
important as as concentrating look like
looking for other other types of crime
so I guess what I'm getting tonight I
get it again the potential of racial
bias and how you distribute the place
yes so I mean that is a legitimate
concern that that the the reason why
there's such disparities you've got ten
times more police officers in a black
neighborhood than in a white
neighborhood now this is different from
racial profiling that is the individual
officers are targeting black residents
black drivers black pedestrians but it's
a very different problem and the good
thing is it has an easy solution des
involves moving officers somewhere out
and that that's something that can be
negotiated with the community with the
police department and with the political
bodies in that in that community but
it's a very different problem from
racial profiling so New York could solve
many of its racial disparities simply by
reallocating lot more officers to say
Manhattan south but then what you'll
find is you know next year there'll be
complaints about the response times to
calls in in Queens so you'll find bias
is there next year that you didn't find
this year as a result of that so there
is this balance between getting
allocation that's the community wants
and but that doesn't sort of exacerbate
the racial disparities that you're most
concerned about like response time
wrong
well what do you mean control for it I
don't want to control for it I mean I
wanted because this is the way the
police are functioning right now so I
went and I'm trying to detect whether
individual officers or department as a
whole is is targeting minorities in
their community
so right so now you say like is the app
does the allocation of police officers
make sense in some way and there's
there's a lot of different ways that
police are you allocated some have you
know their computer programs there's
companies that's you know develop
allocation models just based on you you
input the points of your stations and
and things like that and where your
calls are coming from and it says and it
does all your staffing and things like
that and it's race blind so because the
computer just knows locations of cars
and resources and to the demand for
service and so that's a safe way of
doing it but then politicians will also
weigh in and usually it's every
community it turns out once more police
service in their area they might not
like there you know the quality they're
getting but most communities the
political leadership will be arguing for
more police in their neighborhood rather
than in that other neighborhood that
doesn't need it so much big battle in
Chicago about this I think we're a lot
of time so okay thank you Greg for
