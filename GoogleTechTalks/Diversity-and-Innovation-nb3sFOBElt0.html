pressure to host an MP le lo he is Kerry
was centered in innovation in which
national companies and at the moment is
basically teaching innovation processes
to both companies and MBA students and
his reverse today to talk about
innovation and diversity hello everybody
it's really a pleasure to be here in the
center of innovation at Google in
Mountain View it's really a real honor
for me to be able to share a little bit
what I I feel about innovation and I
hope to share also what you feel about
innovation especially innovation
diversity well indeed I've started my
career as a physicist in schlumberger
and in that company i had the pleasure
and the honor to really to propose a new
products starting from scratch a product
where shrimper she was not in and it was
a real new product for a new market it
was in the 80s and it was a time when
plane explode when they are flying
because there are some bumps put inside
containers inside the plane and I
proposed to develop a system which
allowed to radius copy the what is
inside containers and the first system
has been set up at was he shall de
Gaulle Airport the Paris Airport the
second one was puta for Euro tunnel the
tunnel which is under the channel and
yes it works it works but it didn't find
bumps it fine a lot of drugs and
smuggling and if I would have had the
opportunity to get only one thousandth
of the value of all the drugs found with
this system I would be very very rich
not like you guys are for Google's
because you are very very well paid and
you you deserve
that and now this company is no more
inside a schlumberger but it's another
it has been sold and it has a so their
love new is between 150 and 250 million
dollar every year I have also been in
touch with innovation as I manage L&amp;amp;D
Center in the ceramic field for Sango
bar it was a nd center with 250
engineers and technicians and we succeed
to increase the number of patents per
engineer payer by a factor of 2.4 it was
mainly based on diversity and it's why
I'd like to share that a little bit with
you today if you don't mind so what is
innovation well I innovation you know
all that what is innovation for me it's
mainly creativity in action giving
actual results but to give actual
results it means that we have to work as
a team it's hard a seldom that now
somebody could be an innovator by itself
and starting from the idea go to the
market being alone so it's really a
teamwork and in teamwork I think that
what is important is first the culture
and our culture and innovation is the
culture to be developed it imply
organizational and managers change but
also it's a process and the process to
be managed it has to be planned it has
to be controlled it it is also some
tools project portfolio concurrent
engineering project management risk
management zone but what is important is
that there is a continuum between really
the culture to be developed and the
process to be managed it's also a
nonlinear process innovation you have
large uncertainties when you innovate I
don't talk about development development
is usually a linear process you change a
little bit the
entry point and you will have a slight
improvement or change in the output but
in an innovative process it's you have
very large uncertainties on a slight
change in the initial condition means a
lot at the end and it has to be managed
as a complex adaptive system we need to
really to be a child we need to be
proactive open to change and you know
that complex adaptive system in the
systemic systemic approach the whole
number one according to Al Devis knee is
to keep to increase variety okay but
which kind of diversity could we have
well definitely we can have diversity of
projects of projects we can have diverse
project with our with project portfolio
and in project for portfolio well well
the value of the project portfolio is
really above the sum of the value of
each individual project because it
should be we should have synergy so we
can have diversity of project we have
also even if we have a diversity of
project we have to break zillow's you
know in some companies I there are still
owes between the different teams and if
we have only similar project in the same
sealers we can have some concern unity
and which means to aberration at the end
and no cause fertilization we can also
have a diversity of organization well
for instance 3m which is also known as a
company an innovative company but in the
field of material science
I am as a motto divided to go when
somebody when somebody as in his team
somebody we want to develop something
new II give the opportunity two of two
this guy to create his own team
independent of the mother company and
it's the code that dividing to go and
it's good because because the padding
that we are using when we are in a large
established company in panic they needed
when to you start to grow a new business
are definitely different you don't have
known same time constraint you don't
have the same needs to very quick
decision you don't have the need to
quickly change your mind when you end
and it's mandatory when you are in the
innovative part well there was also
other gang of organization diversity for
instance strategic lines when I've said
a few minutes ago that we secure your
tunnel the tunnel between UK and France
we did we didn't did that do that alone
we work with a American company called
saic and we put two devices together
what we developed in schlumberger and
what they developed in saic and with
those two devices and all the links we
create between those two we had a far
more effective product and well it could
be also geographical diversity but what
is the most important for me is that the
people it's the people who are
innovative it's the man the woman and
teams and they are as close it cold in a
vector there are actors of the
innovation and their diversity is
important there could be diversity of
culture we will come back to that curl
could be geographical painting jobs
functions which are different but there
are also diversity of hall and a
diversity of gender and there are some
interesting study on this part part
showing the diversity of gender could be
really a plus in innovative company so
concerning diversity of culture well
first of all it's perhaps good to have
to remember what's cultures and shine
sharing is a professor at MIT Sloan
School at Boston and his definition of
culture is the way in which people solve
problems and reconcile diamas and
companies which is really a specialist
of intercultural management and he's
probably one of the most known people in
inter to terminations it defines culture
as how contrasting values and conflicts
are arbitrarily mediated and the culture
culture comes like layers you know like
layers in an onion to understand it you
have to peel it for instance for
instance if well you want to understand
the American culture for European well
you could say okay let's visit a New
York and we will see Scabbers skies
coppers you will see lots of people
running everywhere and it can give you
some idea that well perhaps inside below
that below that what seems to be
important what are the deeper values
announced in this society which are
that's not directly visible is the pipes
the more the better perhaps material
successes well for other is better for
Japanese for instance well if you meet
some Japanese you may ask them well
why and why when you are greeting you
bind yourself the guy who a guy could
see and so well because everybody do
that in Japan okay another one would say
well maybe it's to show respect great
and why do you need to show respect you
will smile because it has no answer on
that that means that respect is really
is in deep culture it's we will see that
later that having a different culture
really help to be innovative we have
seen that culture is important but team
members hall also is important and
melodies Belbin show that in the 60s
that it's important he showed that in
successful innovative team members must
have complimentary all style profiles
and working approaches and how did you
find that it was amazing II organized
business simulation requiring creative
intelligence and before doing those
business simulation and before choosing
the all those teams well he passed some
tests like IQ test and so on to a large
bag a large set of people and it was
really surprised to see that this year
he had six people with IQ above 160 so
it was really surprising say a with
these people there are 20 other team but
with those six people I will call them
the Apollo team because we went the 60s
and the 60s you know sky-rocket moon
Apollo and it took that for all those
a business simulation acquiring ketevan
intelligence they will do excellent job
and it was a disaster they were they
really those Apollo team was really the
worst team of the 20 teams is set up so
it really tight under two to think about
that the sku I needs means nothing why
those so white people could not manage
business simulation when they need some
creative intelligence and well what I
notice that you notice that those people
tie all to have the same hole those six
people died oh to be the manager because
all their life has been considered as
the brightest on the leaders and so each
time somebody present 19 the five others
say find all the think to show that his
idea is not the good one mine is the
best one and well-being maribel being
showed that there is idly nine type of
hole in an innovative team and if you
have only three people in the innovative
team it's not a problem it means that if
you want to succeed from time to time
you have to change your whole or to have
to all at the same time and three of
those all are in the ID field and three
in the action field three in the human
relationship field I want I want spend
too much time to discuss each of those
but just to let you know the importance
not only of the designer the guy who is
creative and get the idea yeah but it's
also the importance of the critic
there's been there's been
a study by Stephenson all in 99 and this
study is quite amazing because he
analyzed 69 managers analyst tetex see
during their career and he analyzed also
the 267 project they flow and you know
if first tie to monitor all those
tactics by their creativity index I
don't talk about the creativity index
but they and II look at the success of
the project followed by the critics
which by the 34 critics which were above
the median compared to the 34 critics
which were below the meeting and could
you believe that that the added value
that the payback of the project followed
by the creative tetex where on average
12 times above the added value the pair
back of the critics which were below the
cattle the medium the medium of the
their creativity so it's not in the
designer is it very important the
critics is very important others are
important you won't have alien invasion
without the others but don't forget this
tough wall of the the critic he kills
idea that at wasting the tire team time
but it continuously improve ideas his
sober strategic and discerning you see
old option and judge accurately that
often lack of drive and ability to
inspire others I won't talk about the
others but have in mind that the
nine holes are important and now how
team diversity helps if we look to
strategic marketing after that we will
look to innovation well a multiple point
of view to listen analyze more signals
that's obvious different sensibilities
of customer needs as norman say the easy
part of prediction is technology the
hard part is social impact so innovators
have to bring about people with a better
understanding of human foibles and have
to build sonali and if you have people
from different culture it really helped
to build difference in IE it's really
hard to understand human foibles and to
have different point of view it's also
how to challenge the idea and that's
really the important point when we are
on the same culture well something we
consider as really affect we don't have
to discuss it's a it's a matter of fact
that we have to do that but people with
different culture but definitely they
want they want to understand why people
why you prefer to use this technology
rather than that to use this methodology
rather than that nothing is keep as
granted because you have people coming
from different Orizon so they challenge
ideas and there is also cost
fertilization between different
particles well look look at those cars
in the 50s all I've been the developed
54 54 54 55 and there was another one
the ds9 teen with a steering
meaty with a genetic experienced member
it doesn't look exactly the same than
all the cars which are on the top of the
slides under it's a success well they
were they didn't had internet at that
time night or television but the first
day they sold 12k to tell 12,000 cars
and 1.5 million cars have been sold but
look also totally new design
aerodynamics use fiberglass and aluminum
in 1955 audio climatic suspension very
nice comfort at that time really
incomparable hood holding large windows
no radiator grille look at the radiator
grille here compared to ddd the casa
upstair a money bomb driving wheel and
so on but what is important is that in
this steering company steering committee
in a car company they put some people
from a lunatic with our genetic
experience with our own attic skills and
well when you analyze strategic bad
strategic marketing decision you can see
a lot of reason but definitely they are
three which often come it's the problem
is not well raised there is a search of
consensus and a collective decision
there is lack of vision and lack of
meaning and if you have a multicultural
staff with members would challenge
hypothesis they ask you why why do you
think that why shall it improve our
customers life why does it make sense we
will use it why why the check meanings
and the kid sense of perspective and I
would like to show you something which
happens in the end of 90s and beginning
of the 20s and I was one of the actor of
that and I suffer a lot of this sir
lucious dis issues it's a time of the
okay it was the time often the ye the
Internet boom and in i think it was in
98 the d you see water pepper emerging
digital technologies and they claim in
this paper that the internet traffic is
doubling every 100 days and it was based
on false information force information
provided by world come whose leaders
have interests to talk up figures in
november november two thousand just just
one month after a HK which is one of the
best-known company for market analysis
in the optical fiber telecom network put
this report and in november or dizzy co
again from AT&amp;amp;T showed her that traffic
of internet is not doubling every 100
days but it's doubling every year you
can say okay it's growing indeed but if
you go if you double every year after
tears you have your traffic is being
multiplied by eight but if you double
every 100 day after tears your traffic
should increase by a factor
of 2000 you see the difference and
really I was manager of a company which
was providing wafers with her slice of a
special crystal that we manufacture and
to provide some some optical component
which are used in in optical network and
well we decide in 99 to to invest four
times or sales four times ourselves for
new for building a new plant because of
that and everybody touched that average
voltage 51 person well if we are looking
only to the optical component sales the
growth was twenty-eight percent per
quarter and we we really see this go or
go was more than thirty percent per
quarter and our HK actual in november
two thousand two so two years after some
guys say a be careful it's not every
year that everyone all day that it's
doubling but every year just after they
say that there is a decrease by forty
percent a quarter you can imagine that's
what's at HK forecast in october two
thousand what they really so you can
imagine capex height of it was a waste
of billion billion dollar on all over
the world because because we don't ask
why why why
so having a multicultural stuff really
help to ask question now coming back to
innovation process by itself well often
we say that we have first to generate
variety interact involve and then select
and develop and learn and it's like a
little bit the process of the life we
this diversity of approach diversity of
strategies multiple projects ID clash
merge and selection development you with
some gates mode and then learning
process and in the life learning
processes don't who the DNA but well we
have that and you know that we have to
sell enough seeds to select the best
plans and innovation is also a game a
number game and we need to have a large
number of five year ten percent may pass
the feasibility gate three person will
pass the technical success and one one
will be probably a real success but and
I think that in google you you are very
proud to say that it's not important to
fill what is important is to tie Andy
and I like also the dis Lin's polling
sentence the best way to get a good
ideas to get a lots of idea and what
really matter is the value of your
success and not how many times you fail
so far
and definitely more innovation the idea
from come from multi cultural stuff
mainly due to cross fertilization
process shock of idea well at sangoma
credit this L&amp;amp;D center on the ceramics
in south of hands well we increase my
2.5 or 2.4 the number of patents per
employee per yeah but we also multiply
we also had a starting point had only
six person of foreigners in our staff
five years later we were 30 person of
stuff which were foreigners I love
French people but when they are working
here in Mountain View are in Berlin on
our in Tokyo because they didn't have
the same culture but they don't have the
same training they don't have the same
experience so there is clash of ideas
and innovation I I was also in this this
team when I arrived there was also lots
of silos because psycho man booked lots
of company in the ceramic field and well
all those manager want to to be sure
that what they developed is for their
company and they start to be a little
bit a conglomerate of ceramics company
and it was not good for single men so
they decide to create a heaven decent
term and one was already existing in
North ball in the states across to
Boston and they create another one in
Europe and even that they even if it was
mandatory to do the end in the same in
the same central center people were
working in silos and I my job was to
break the seals and for instance I I
create a John lab with CNS which is a
National Lab a very large national lab
in france's largest national lab in
France I don't remember many researcher
there but it's probably above 25,000 and
we we create a joint lab and I imposed
that the manager of this joint lab will
be a guy from the cns and not a guy from
sangoma because if I choose somebody
from the Alpha lab this joint lab will
work only for the Alpha lava same for
the dead belabor the gamma dybo and
really indeed the joint lab start to
break the Steelers and myself when I was
in a technical meeting and I see that
the beta team has some difficulties
which has been solved by the gamma team
a few months earlier I gave a call
immediately to the boss of gammon saying
a your colleague from better will come
and meet you to discuss something
similar that you show me three months
ago and I'd like to have to be part of
this meeting if I can't well do the
meeting and I want to see the report and
it start to cut the sealers and with all
that kind of hospitalization having
people from our child also having a
better motivation well we increase we
multiply the patterns by 2.4 and well
indeed a having diverse team favor
divergence process kind shock of idea
dive different thinking creativity it's
also helped to develop your mental
elasticity because when you are talking
with people who are used to talk as you
to think as you you don't develop your
mental elasticity but if you are talking
with people who have never we don't have
the same way of thinking well you are
obliged to to move your neural network
neural cells and to try to be more
increase your mental elasticity you
increase your agility and you also share
belbin holes it helped also to challenge
ideals and kill non invented here
attitude when I develop the secrecy and
the system in schlumberger after six
months I receive only a few a few ten
thousand dollars to study eleanii after
that I receive 10 10 million to develop
the product but at beginning it was only
a feasibility study and my boss say that
a piece after you have done your
feasibility study discuss this with
sharp park and the shop back at that
time didn't had yet his Nobel Prize but
he was very well known in the field I
had to work with and I went to CERN in
Geneva and show the result to shout back
and he say oh it's impossible to have a
cathode which is only three millimeters
from the inert it's impossibly it won't
never work we we know for sure that it
has to be at least nine millimeters on a
sec okay sir okay professor Pat well I
was not aware of about that I'm sorry I
was not aware i did it and it work and I
show you him all the plan the drawing
and direct all results well having
people I was not in this field I was not
in this field it's because I didn't know
that it could not work that I did it so
if you have people from different
horizon you have more opportunity to to
create something new so yes I already
talked about customization between
different technologies bike silos and
now I think that it's probably the most
important part of my talk for complex
decision making problem ETO genus groups
produce higher quality solution than
imaginas groups and it's Othman of man
would show that well II test groups of
people and during a six month each time
each group met once a week during half a
day and they have to deal with different
type of complex situation conflict
interest conflict of a conflict of
interest conflict of value and so on and
each time it was a group of i can
remember four people and he had 16 group
which were homogeneous in terms of past
experience in terms of study people have
done in terms of a social way of life
and it has also 25 very heterogeneous
group and what does he shows is that for
nearly all the problem there was only
one problem when it's nearly the same
for the result for homogeneous and
heterogeneous was nearly the same but
for all the others problems the eto
genius group was far superior far
superior and furthermore he wonder if
having a diverse team would create some
frustration because there was more
arguments between people and she was not
the case people were very motivated he
keep to be Velma David they were
satisfied with the way they solve the
problem even if it was perhaps more more
difficult at the beginning so having a
heterogeneous group has no impact on
motivation because from time to time we
hear that having homogeneous group is
better for motivation well Othman show
that it's not the case so
innovation is really a collective
process as I told you the vision is a
collective process because the team guys
out more than the sum of talent that
each member can contribute and its
importance of teamwork and I'd like to
see how Tim diversity apps also teamwork
and really it favors collective
intelligence and collective intelligence
as showing 2 ponyo just last year that
its weekly call it to the number of
people but it's hungry correlated to
links interaction and data idea exchange
between people and there was also very
nice study done in 2010 by Anita Woolley
and she showed that group buttons our
weekly call it with the average or
maximum interval intelligent of group
members weakly correlated there is some
correlation but its weak so even if you
have the bus with a Nike IQ of 160 and
all the team at 140 okay it's a plus but
it's not the only stuff she also show
that it strongly correlated with the
average social sensibility the equality
of distribution of conversation time
talking and on gender than the diversity
it's correlated to how you interact with
the others so if you have a strong bus
who doesn't let the others to talk
probably even if it's the brightest if
his team is really behind they won't
have in complex decision not as good
results than people who are actively
talking to each other and with people
who are coming from diverse fields and
well you know probably this sentence
from Mencken for every complex problem
there is a solution that is clear simple
plausible and and wrong and yes in terms
of strategy have a diverse team help
because because you ask yourself of the
stuff in the in diverse team ask
yourself why why why we avoid to have to
do to get a consensus on a clear simple
and plausible solution we favored
position to positive question we have to
challenge ideas as Einstein said the
important thing is not to stop
questioning and its favor agility and is
change management if it was development
of mental elasticity yes we already
talked and indeed for complex decision
making problems a terrorist groups
produce higher quality solutions an
emergency open now as a conclusion Tim
diversity matters yes indeed to get a
larger choice when recruiting if you
want to have only people who are coming
from this school you have a lower but
that's a detail for both customer
understanding yes it's important to get
new skill it's important to have
contrasting perspective it's important
to get more point of view to understand
customer needs is also very important
but what is more important idea
generation for cost virtualization
constructive conflict and stimulating
debates which solve problem to a
creative path agility
to be more flexible and open to change
and you will feel that and probably
where you have a very diverse team here
in Google you feel that you benefit from
that and finally for complexity as I
told you for complex problem it doesn't
work really for development it's not too
complex for development yes it's
difficult but for development you don't
need to a diverse team but when you want
to innovate having a Taoist need is
really important and i would like to
thank you and i'm ready to answer all
questions or comments that you you have
and some question from the other plants
maybe some comments so you mentioned
that you talked about these nine
different roles in innovation the
critique the perfectionist and so forth
and you talked about the beneficial
aspects of the critique but you know
like the critique I sometimes found
critics sometimes add a lot of negative
value because you know they are
indiscriminately being critics so
there's there's this good side and
there's you know the negative side to it
where I can definitely see how they can
filter out you know things that really
don't matter or are wasting time but
sometimes they can be like overly
aggressive agree with you but remember i
show you also that they've done some
some review of 69 well known critic in a
large multinational company and they
look at what is the creativity the cat
EVT level of the critics themself and
they look at they put them on all and
they look from the last creative critic
to the most creative critic and they
look at the value of the 34 which were
above the medium and the third compared
to the 34 beloved medium and you are
totally right if you're a critic wishes
only looking at the difficult pounds not
seeing all the opportunity you will be
on the bad side and the value of the
innovation he has to check is really low
the value was 12 times the average value
our of the project now supervised by the
34 critics which has a hike a divot II
level was 12 times above the value of
those who were too negative another
question so usually in companies when
they said I was me they usually are
so I mean I was hoping to see
some examples about how gender diversity
actually
there that
the Anita wooly article I which was
written in 2010 so I shall affect that
indeed having gender diversity helps in
innovation and and one of the
explanation of that is that having
having gender diversity in a team means
that people feel obliged to listen read
bit more than if there are only women
are only men but she shows mainly that
adding a woman in a team have a real
improvement create a real important
surprising but it's it's what she showed
and well the the slides will be on your
network and I've put some reference on
the debt so you can the last three page
as only reference under you you you can
have look on these articles if you want
other question okay thank you very very
much for inviting me here it was a real
pleasure to be here and to share a
