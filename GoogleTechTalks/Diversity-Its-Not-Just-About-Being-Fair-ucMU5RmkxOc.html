engineering manager at Google and Krakov
I am going to talk today about the
research that shows both the benefits
and the challenges of having a diverse
organization this is something that I've
taken quite an interest in and every
time I give a talk about this I learn
more about it so there's quite a wealth
of research and I'm only going to
scratch the surface but I haven't seen
many places where it's pulled together
quite like this so let's get started
the the basic tenor of the benefits is
that if you have an organization in
which people have a diverse set of life
experiences and it can be about gender
age national origin race culture gender
orientation educational experience any
kind of life experience these create a
creative atmosphere which is a pot of
positive indicator for innovative tests
and it's a negative indicator for
routine tests if you have a factory you
want to have a group of people who are
culturally similar so that the
communication will be easy but one of
the first pieces of research that I saw
that showed that it's not just about
being fair to have a diverse
organization but rather a business
imperative had to do with the financial
advantages that a company will have when
they have women running the company or
near the top of the company this has
been repeated in a number of studies
this particular result comes from a
McKinsey report in this report they
created an index of how far women
managers were from the top of the
organization and it had a way of
calculating an index for the the weight
of women near the top of the
organization for
for four companies that had more women
near the top they had on average about
10% greater return on equity about 48%
greater earnings before interest in
taxes and and a larger stock price
growth now a similar study was done by
catalyst and in that case they had a
different measure of the women at the
top of the company they they took
companies that had at least three women
on the board and they again had similar
results these results have been shown
for race
Cedric herring has done such studies
he's at the University of Illinois and
this has been also shown in other
geographies The Economic Times of India
in 2009 published some results that said
that women led companies earn fifty six
percent as opposed to 27 percent on
average from the previous five years
so it's an its repeatable in a number of
geographies and with a number of
methodologies which makes it a really
interesting result now the first time I
heard this I heard some secondary
research and I looked for the the
original research it is true that this
is not showing causation it's only a
correlation but the fact that this has
been repeated with so many different
kinds of methodologies different
geographies for race and for gender it
makes it something that we can't ignore
now in the case of innovation one of the
really interesting results has to do
with patents the u.s. computer tech
patents since 1980 are about 91% male
only authors but gender mixed patents
are cited 26 to 42 percent more than any
single gender patent now even more
interesting there was a result published
by some research
at the Salone school at MIT around 2010
teams were formed of people who were
aged 18 to 62 they were given individual
intelligence tests and then put in
groups of 3 to 5 they had to solve a
variety of problems which required
brainstorming decision-making some
visual puzzles and one complex problem
it was a surprise result to the
researchers that the only predictor of
team success was having women on the
team now you see on this graph the lower
axis represents the percentage of women
on the team so to the right is a hundred
percent left is zero and the success of
the team is on the vertical axis so near
the top means that they did well each of
those red bars represents a group of
teams that had that were in a group that
had similar results so you can see that
the teams that were highest performing
were all near the middle now there were
some teams that performed poorly that
also had 50% women but there was that
that was really the only correlation
with success now I went to MIT and
talked with Tom Malone not so long ago
and he explained that he believes that
there is a kind of social intelligence
that is highly correlated with women but
it's not exclusive to women there are
some men who have it and there's some
women who don't this is a skill that
allows teams to get all ideas out so
that there is enough variety of thought
that allows teams to solve problems I
think that this is a really interesting
result now in some it's what this means
is that it's not just a matter of being
fair to have a diverse organization it's
really important in order to get the
best business results
now there are also significant barriers
it's not sufficient to just hire people
from a lot of different backgrounds and
let them go the your team won't will not
necessarily be effective without some
work and some of the barriers include
unconscious bias stereotype and identity
threat cognitive illusions exclusion
from critical social networks and that
just means that when you know somebody
well enough to be comfortable with them
you learn about opportunities lack of
role models and mentors unaware managers
because people can have differences in
their career goals and in motivating
factors but in summary the benefits of
diversity are contingent on the
organization's culture the culture needs
to be inclusive and adopt practices that
reinforce inclusivity so I'm going to
talk about some of these barriers and
especially the first three now to get
started there are some books that I
highly recommend if you like reading and
if you like the subject now blink is a
very popular book by Malcolm Gladwell
and this is really about the power of
unconscious decision-making one of the
examples that he gives is of car
salesmen now if you ask car salespeople
whether they have a bias towards one
kind of person than another among their
clients they'll say that they have no
bias but if you actually do an
experiment in which people go and make
offers on cars it's found at least in
the u.s. that white men get the lowest
initial offer on a car and both black
men and any women get higher offers so
even though they they say they're not
biased and maybe they believe they're
not biased they actually give a
different number and it's statistically
significant but the people who are
actually the best car salespeople they
it's
that they don't have unconscious bias
but perhaps they know themselves well
enough that they ignore their initial
reaction they treat all their customers
the same so even if a teenager comes in
a sweaty t-shirt they still treat them
the same way and maybe that teenager has
parents who are willing to buy the
teenager a car or if a woman comes then
they treat them the same way and maybe
that woman actually earns a lot of money
by treating their customers with respect
they do better another instance that he
gives is that in among CEOs of Fortune
500 companies in the US he cites that
more than 50 percent are greater than 6
feet tall that's 183 centimeters and in
the general population it's much lower
in around 14% around a third of the CEOs
are greater than 6 foot 2 188
centimeters and that's only 3.9 percent
in the general population now very few
people would say that there's a
correlation between height and
competence but still we're making that
decision and that's a pretty scary to
think that we're making decisions that
were totally unaware of now the hidden
brain by Shankar vedantam is also really
excellent book and he focuses on the the
unintended consequences that we make
that are in reverse relation to what we
actually intent based on bias one
example he gives is of an experiment in
which people pretended they were
applying for a job said they were
observed in a waiting room and either
they'd be sitting alone or they'd be
sitting with someone else
now you may predict that someone who
looks like they're overweight might have
a smaller chance of
hired but you may not have known that if
an average weight person is seen sitting
next to someone who is overweight
there's a sticky effect the person with
the average weight is less likely to be
hired now another example that he and a
number of other authors have cited his
work that was done by Melissa Bateson at
a company in northern England what this
group did is that for ten weeks they
changed the sign that was put up at a at
a coffee station this was a place where
there was an honor system for how much
money you'd pay for the milk that you
put in your coffee or tea so you can see
in week one there was a picture of eyes
and week two a picture of miracles in
week three a picture of eyes and week
four a picture of flowers and so on you
can see that in the weeks in which there
were flowers they received half to a
third of the amount of money that they
received in weeks it had eyes and when
the eyes looked directly out at you
they received a lot of money now at the
end of the experiment they interviewed
the people in that company and not a
single person noticed the the
photographs that they were changing or
posted at all nobody this can be really
scary that we can be so influenced by
the perception of being watched that we
change our behavior and at the end of
the time we don't even realize it I
think that this is a really important
observation now in real life there are
many times when we think there might
have been bias but we're never we're
never really sure because life is
complex there are many factors that
enter into any decision but amazingly a
number of people have found ways to
measure bias and one of these is the
implicit attitude test now project
implicit is a very
accessible internet-based test base at
Harvard University the way it works is
that it measures your response time so
for example I took a test in which I
just had to recognize photographs of
recent US presidents and the example
that I was given was pretty easy there
was Obama and Nixon so at first
there'd be Obama on the right and Nixon
on the left and I'd have to press a key
on the right if I saw Obama a picture a
key on the left if I saw Nixon then they
showed words that were related to good
like glorious and words that were
related to bad like failure and again
I'd have to press her right key or left
key fine but then they put Obama and bad
Nixon and good this was hard I could
feel myself having to think harder and
take more time I mean that was easy
because Nixon was a crook right and but
when Obama was with good and Nixon with
bad my response time was shorter now the
one of the interesting results from
these surveys is that there's a huge
difference between actual bias and what
people report about themselves so for
example seventy percent prefer white
people to African Americans in this
study but only fifteen percent will say
this 80 percent prefer young people and
so on 70 percent have implicit
stereotypes associating associating
science and tech with a male more than
female I also have that bias when I took
this test it showed that I was
moderately biased against women in
science and technology this is really
important I'm biased against myself you
could say you cannot assume that because
someone is the victim of a bias that
they are unbiased we create these
associations by means of what we see
most frequently and it becomes a kind of
a mental shortcut for
now in some situations this is helpful
there's a book called leisure the basis
of culture which I read in high school
and basically what it says is that we
create habits of mind that a free our
brain in order to do more difficult
tasks this resonates for me in the 80s
we were working with people who wanted
to build expert systems and the thought
was you'd interview an expert like an
oil exploration expert and you'd write
this prologue rule chaining system you
just stick in their rules and then you'd
have an oil exploration expert system
the problem was that the experts didn't
know how they know what they know you
can imagine this if if you like me work
in computers like someone who's really
really good at debugging they cannot
give you a rule of thumb for every
situation for how to debug what they do
is that they make associations quickly
when they see a particular problem and
they can associate disparate parts of
knowledge fast because they become an
expert in this area it's really useful
to us to have that that kind of quick
Association and this is how we build
expertise what we have to do is we have
to understand our own biases so that
we're not ruled by them now another
result related to bias which I should
tell you is that there was a researcher
who checked on bias in volunteers it was
a laboratory situation against people
who are gay what and they gave half of
the volunteers lemonade that had sugar
before this test and half the volunteers
had lemonade with a sugar substitute the
people with sugar showed less bias than
the people who had a sugar substitute
now why should this be
Shankar vedantam explains this by saying
that we actually
work hard to overcome bias we do this
all the time and it's hard work for the
brain that sugar is brain food you can
see this in the effect that very very
small children will often express bias
very strongly and people with dementia
will also express it
sometimes a politician will say
something apparently very biased when
they're tired and afterwards say that's
not me why did I say such a thing
basically I it seems that our brain is
working hard against bias that we
believe is wrong all the time
so it's a very important to be
well-rested before a major decision now
stereotype threat is something that has
come in the popular literature quite a
lot this is a very common kind of graph
and you probably know that what it
represents is that when there's high
stereotype threat there's a big
difference between the results of girls
and boys in the results on math tests
but when there's low stereotype threat
there's very little difference now
Claude Steele published a book called
whistling Vivaldi in which he gives an
overview of his research in this area
and the research by some other people
the way that he coins the terms is like
this we all have a number of identities
so for example I'm a woman I'm a mother
I'm an American I'm an MIT graduate I
studied computer science with Joe Joseph
Weizenbaum all of these are identities
associated with me I work in engineering
I haven't I have a degree in biology so
all of these are part of my identity
each of each of my identities can have
contingencies and the contingencies can
be positive
or negative or neutral so for example
when looking for a job having a degree
from MIT can be a positive contingency
because people think it's good when when
I'm when I'm coming into the u.s. being
an American citizen is a positive
contingency but in some situations it
can be a negative contingency for
example when I lived in India there were
people who said why should I hire you
you can leave anytime they seem to have
this idea that people who could leave
India would do that although that was a
little strange because I obviously was
there but what matters in any particular
situation is whether there's a
stereotype that puts you at a
disadvantage if there's a negative
contingency that applies to you and
you're aware of it then that negative
identity becomes really important and
you become susceptible I hope that is a
an understandable explanation it's a
very very difficult area so it's worth
reading about it oh so there there's
some there's a lot of research I didn't
cover yet so when Claude Steele first
started looking into this one of the
indicators that he was trying to
understand was why it was that college
entrance scores were not predictive of
success for black students in the US and
it wasn't just at one college it was
across the board and even at many places
where people were trying to help their
students succeed what would happen is
the the slope of grades would just not
be as strong for the black students as
they were for a white males and they
didn't see quite as strong an effect for
for other groups for example for Asian
students
so over time this they did quite a lot
of experiments and eventually came up
with some strong results that showed
that there is an effective stereotype
threat and it's it's not an innate
ability difference so one of the early
experiments that was done had to do with
athletic ability now you may not know
this but in the u.s. there is a general
perception that black men are better at
sports than white men so initially the
researchers gave some men some mini golf
course to run and they were told it was
a test of their athletic ability now in
this situation the white men did worse
they had to do three strokes more to
complete the course but when they
changed the problem and said it was a
test of their sports strategic
intelligence then the white men did well
and the black men needed five strokes
more so with exactly the same task but
with the contingencies expressed
differently they had different groups
doing well and doing poorly which showed
that it was not a matter of innate
ability it was a matter of response to
the negative stereotypes that applied to
them now in the case of women and
technology or women and math the it's
been shown that women can do well in
math that is not have the stereotype
threat effect if there's a believable
statement that although there is this
gender stereotype in this particular
test it's been shown there's no gender
difference that's one way to counter it
it's also been shown that you don't need
to actually state this anything about
the stereotype in order for the effect
to happen
another interesting effect is that the
you can you can mention inclusion in a
positive group and that can cause your
your score to do better so for example a
woman who's reminded that she's Asian or
that she's a Stanford student will not
have as strong a problem with the
stereotype effect and if you remind a
white man in the US about the Asian
stereotype that Asians do better at math
then white men will do worse so it's
really a matter of the context being
subject to a negative stereotype that
affects you that can cause the
performance to suffer it also starts in
very young girls as young as five in the
group five to seven when they would
color a picture of a doll before a math
test they would do more poorly then
girls who who would color a picture of a
landscape or of a Chinese child eating
with chopsticks now a test or a job
interview is a one-time situation but
imagine this happening over and over
again this is something that could
really affect your performance over a
long period of time and your health now
people who are under stereotype threat
normally they do not report feeling any
stress but there are measurable effects
in their arterial blood pressure that
show up when they are under the effects
of stereotype threat so there's an
physiological basis to this now what can
you do to counter identity threat as I
said before you can have a believable
story that this does not apply in this
situation critical mass is important so
for example when on the US Supreme Court
when Sandra Day O'Connor was appointed
as a first woman the press hounded her
every decision that was made they would
ask what did the woman decide once Ruth
Ginsberg joined the court all that went
away now totally separate from that was
how were decisions made within the court
but all the external pressure went away
she no longer was the token woman she
was a judge when Sandra Day O'Connor
retired then for a short time Ruth Bader
Ginsburg was the only woman on the court
and all that attention went to her which
surprised her until another woman was
appointed in cases of companies putting
out flyers when they're recruiting it's
been shown that there's a a critical
mass of about 40% that's required for
people who are in the minority to feel
comfortable and trust a company so if
they see themselves in about 40% of the
photographs on the flyer they're more
likely to feel comfortable applying it
turns out also that it's important for
companies that want a diverse
organization to say that they've valued
diversity saying that they're color
blind or gender blind does not engender
trust it's almost like saying well we'll
forgive you for not being like the
majority it's important to say that you
value diversity having a credible
narrative is important so for one thing
having a role model if for example if
you have some first-year students who
are having a hard time but you're able
to find some third or fourth-year
students who can talk to them and say I
went through the same as you but I
succeeded and these are the things I did
that helps people to counter identity
threat and be successful part of that is
it's important to have an expandable
view of intelligence not a static one
not saying either you have this skill or
you don't but rather this is something
that you can grow a really interesting
result is about self affirmation at some
junior high schools I think it was shown
that when students start half of them
would give
fifteen minutes to write about their
positive values the control group wrote
about values that someone else might
have but they don't the effect was
positive on their grades for two years
it's just such a small investment of
time this was recently report repeated
about two years ago among physics
students at a university physics woman
students and take taking that time
fifteen to twenty minutes to write about
the positive values increase the scores
it reduced the affective stereotype
threat as I said before a positive
stereotype can counter some of the
identity threat like saying you're Asian
if it's a math situation and a
stereotype doesn't need to be mentioned
to have an effect
now this next result is really hard to
understand if you have critical feedback
that's helpful it can help someone who's
who's under identity threat and what's
been found is that positive feedback
like good job or neutral feedback is is
really not helpful what is really
helpful is to say this is hard but I
believe that you can do it we're going
to work together to make it happen I see
this as a sense of engagement
communities of support have also been
found to be important and that was
something that was different between
Asian students and black students at US
universities oftentimes the Asian
students even if there were only a few
they would form groups in which they
would talk with each other and share
experiences so that if one of them
learned something the others could learn
from them too and a lot of other kinds
of students who are in the minority
would tend to just isolate themselves
and even refused to ask for help
thinking that that would reinforce the
notion that they're dumb the introducing
the idea of
groups in which people can study
together it really made a huge
difference this last point is also
really interesting intergroup
conversations can be really difficult in
some experimental situations they put
together groups in which one person was
from a my majority and everyone else to
be in the conversation was in the
minority when the person who the only
person from the majority was asked to
sit out chairs they subconsciously put
their own chair away from all the others
as if it was a little bit scary those of
us who have been working as women and
technology can relate to this sometimes
there'll be three women sitting together
in the micro kitchen and that's just so
unusual that when the men come in most
of them just like step back they're just
not used to seeing that many women at a
time and very few will feel comfortable
and come and sit down what we think
happens is that the person who normally
is in the majority is afraid of saying
something that shows that they have a
bias and they're afraid of sounding
uninformed and so it becomes a really
scary situation for them so if the
conversation is promoted as being a
learning opportunity between the groups
then people are feel more comfortable
and in that same experimental situation
they do put the chairs closer together
and this can really make a big
difference now there's a website called
reducing stereotype threat org and it
has many of these recommendations I
recommended but this book that I
mentioned whistling Vivaldi it's really
very good if you're interested in this
subject now the title of the book came
from an incident there was a student
that who was I think he was a graduate
student
at the University of Chicago and he
noticed when he was walking around the
neighborhood's
the people would be afraid of him like
couples would reach for each other's
hands or people's eyes would go glassy
they'd get tense and he came to realize
that his very existence was threatening
to them this made him feel bad and so he
started looking for smaller streets and
out of nervousness he would whistle and
he was good at whistling he'd whistle
classical music or songs from the
Beatles and he noticed that when he
whistled all that tension went away by
whistling like that he showed that he
understood the culture of these other
people and even though the stereotype of
a dangerous black male still existed it
didn't apply to him this was really
important as a discovery and it's a very
nice book these results are slightly in
a different domain but I think it's
still relevant Daniel Kahneman won the
Nobel Prize for his research in prospect
theory he's a psychologist but he got
the Nobel Prize in Economics prospects
the theory is the theory of risk-taking
and risk averting strategies that are
taken when the results are known so for
example if you say that 80% of people
who take this inoculation will survive
you get different results than if you
say 20% of the people take this
inoculation will die even though it's
the same result and even experts are
susceptible so he wrote a book that's
very popular it's called Thinking Fast
and Slow and this this work is also
summarized in an article in The New York
Times Magazine from about a year and a
half ago called don't blink the hazards
of confidence so the first situation
that he
describes was when he was in the Israeli
army he's a psychologist so he and
another psychologist were asked to
evaluate the recruits so the the
recruits would in a group have to do a
task like get a log over a wall and
neither the log nor any of the people
could touch the wall they would observe
how decisions were made and how they
would respond to failures and so on
they'd send a recommendation of which of
these recruits would be good leaders and
a few months later the commanding
officers would send back their reports
of which people they thought were good
leaders there was basically no
correlation but it was the army and they
had to keep giving recommendations so
they kept doing their analyses in
exactly the same way with exactly the
same level of confidence even though
they knew that their results were were
not being very good predictive in a
predictive way much later he was asked
to visit an investment firm on Wall
Street and then in this case the
investors were people who would give
advice to wealthy clients he asked if he
could have some data and amazingly he
was able to get some he got eight years
of data for 20 investors now he reasoned
that if skill were involved then there
would be a correlation between the
results that an individual investor
would get in one year and the following
year so he calculated correlation
coefficients between every pair of years
year 1 and year 2 year 1 year 3 and so
on and what he found was that the
average correlation coefficient was 0.01
there was basically no correlation so he
arrives and they go out to dinner and
they and he says well it's not a very
strong correlation and they said yes yes
we know is going to
below but they didn't know it was going
to be zero but somehow they get through
this visit and when he's being driven to
the airport one of the executives says
well you can't take away from me all
that I've achieved and he was thinking
well I just did he calls this effect a
cognitive illusion that is a coherent
story rather than data leads to an
illusion of confidence and this is
particularly prominent when someone's
professional competence is at stake he
he also coined a term what you see is
all there is now now I think that this
is relevant in the discussion that we're
having now for two reasons one is that
many people make conclusions about how
well women can do in technology based on
the experiences that they've had and
frankly most people have not seen enough
situations to have enough data to make a
conclusion it's really important to make
use of the data that's available in some
of these great quantitative experiences
experiments a second reason I think it's
really interesting is that often women
are criticized for not showing enough
confidence to be a leader and it's
important again to realize that
confidence and competence are not the
same thing now this is a very well-known
study there was a venture capitalist who
is very successful and her case study
was given to some MBA students but some
of them received it with her name Heidi
and some received it with Howard
everything else was identical the
students were asked to assess these two
venture capitalists and fortunately the
skill level was assessed similarly but
when asked who would you want to work
with about 70% said Howard they said
Heidi was too aggressive
they wouldn't there was with Joe
not a pleasant person to be with and
remember it was exactly identical text
now women come to realize that there is
a difference between behaviors expected
from men and expected from women and
whether it's conscious or subconscious
women make a choice about whether to
stay in a career where they have to make
some decisions that won't make them
likable or whether they want to live in
in a world in which they can feel liked
like people want to have friends many
times women have to make such a choice
now there was a recent repeat of this
study in a different context this was
published in PNAS last fall in this case
science faculty at US universities rated
a student resume to higher as a
potential lab manager and the only
difference in the text was the name so
both men and women faculty they rated
the men as more competent they were more
willing to hire them they were more
willing to mentor them and if they were
hired the men's salary was about $4,000
a year more it was around $30,000 for
men or 26,000 for women on average so
this is not a very happy result
there are a lot of studies of the way
that men and women communicate and I
don't think that there's really a strong
consensus on exactly what the
differences are or should be but I'll
give you the results from Towson
University which is more or less in the
middle of the results people report in
general people say that men talk more
and they interact more women are more
likely to be interrupted
they're more likely to allow a
successful interruption and if they
interrupt somebody else it's most likely
to be another woman in a formal setting
this is important because men gain the
floor and they keep it women take less
time in asking a question people want
their leaders to be able to hold the
floor and explain but if women take less
time because they know they're going to
be interrupted they won't have the kind
of posture that people expect from their
leaders in informal settings women Excel
they're good at communication that is
collaborative and where people jointly
build an idea
so most of the research I've been
describing to you is research that is
almost too detached from daily life that
their laboratory situations they're hard
to compare to any given person's
experience and you can't normally have
two different qualities in the same life
but what if you could have the same
person experience being a man and then a
woman or being a woman and then a man
well it turns out there are transgenders
and there are studies of them so one of
these studies showed that on average
when men become women they start
experiencing new disadvantages and their
incomes fall by about 12% initially and
30% in the long run their professional
lives get harder when women become men
they get new privileges their
professional lives get easier initially
the incomes rise about 7% on average and
in the long run about 10% but we're very
fortunate because there are two
biologists they're both tenured
professors at Stanford one went from man
to woman and one went from woman to men
and they were willing to talk about it
so Shankar vedantam book includes quite
a lot of interview from them the person
who went from woman to man
Barbara Barnes to Ben Barnes he said he
was oblivious to sexism early in life he
could not understand feminists but after
he changed to being a man people who
didn't know it was the same person would
say his work is much better than his
sisters he had better treatment and
every day he he could complete a whole
sentence without being interrupted as
long as that person didn't know he used
to be a woman and then he went he
thought back to earlier in his education
so for example when he was a pint
Ecology
his guidance counselor or her guidance
counselor told her not to apply to MIT
but she did anyway and the same thing
happened to me I ignored them too and
later in one of the difficult classes
there was a problem said there were five
problems the professor
announced in class that no one had
gotten all five right only four had been
done so she went to the professor after
class and said but I got all five right
and he said oh it must have been your
boyfriend and she was appalled but it
never occurred to her at the time that
it was sexism aware the person who went
from man to woman this person was
working in the area of gender selection
proposals and this is very controversial
so as a man he had made a controversial
proposal and there was a lot of debate
but he had some Authority and there were
some people who engaged as a woman she
made another similarly controversial
proposal the establishment was livid few
people engaged and people engaged in
behaviors that seem physically
intimidating when scientists started
screaming at her and she said you feel
like this guy's going to come over and
hit you another expert jumped onstage
and started shouting at her she lost her
sense of authority at Stanford she used
to be on Sam Stanford's Senate and is no
longer in any committee
she went from above average salary to
the bottom 10% she gets interrupted when
talking she can't frame issues this
could be really discouraging but it is
discouraging but researchers have also
now looked at what is the difference
between women who stay in engineering
and women who don't stay what people
thought what the researchers thought was
that there would be less perception of
bias
in the people who stayed but that's not
what happened the women who left
engineering and the women who stayed
they had the same number of problems the
same kinds of problems there was a
really no major difference the
difference was that the women who stayed
were women who were hopeful they were
engaged and they were proactive I that
your first job makes a big difference
and someone who has good engagement in
the first job really that can help them
to get a sense of excitement all alone
so now I want to talk about some
interventions that people have done this
one is really interesting because it's
just so open the MIT science faculty
initiated a study and this was because
three of the senior women faculty
believed that there was some bias bias
in the way that lab space was awarded or
grants and similar sorts of issues now
you have to reflect people don't really
know how much salary other people are
getting most of the time you're a bit in
the dark but three of them had a feeling
that there was some bias so they went
and talked to all the senior women
faculty in science and it wasn't hard
there were only 15 of them and most of
them believed that there was some gender
bias so they went to the Dean and a
study was undertaken three women were
included that one woman from each
department and three Dean's who went who
had who either were or had been
department chairs so there was found
that some of the departments did indeed
have bias and this shocked everyone the
president was shocked when he realized
that these women did not believe there
was bias when they were a young faculty
that it came about later and he also
thought it was a perceptual thing he was
shocked to find that there was fact
behind it
and the Dean says a critical part of the
reason was collective ignorance it did
not look like what we thought
discrimination looked like so it's very
important to have data now about ten
years later a follow-up study was
published they did quite a lot they
hired a woman as president they're more
women faculty now there had been no
change in the number of women faculty
for 20 years even though there was an
increase in the number of women's
students but now they they have better
results that way they have women on all
the committees it's not simple because
women say well we have a greater
proportion of committee responsibility
which means less time for research so
it's not a simple problem but the first
point is that you can't understand where
you are if you don't have good data this
is also an interesting result this was
published in in Harvard Business Review
and it was a study of managers I think
women and management what this shows is
reasons that people leave a job and it
shows that men are almost 10 percent
more likely than women to leave a job
either for promotion or for a salary
increase almost nobody leaves
purely for child-rearing but women are
almost 10 percent more likely than a man
to leave a job because of a difficult
manager now this makes a lot of sense to
me you don't want to stick with a job
that you think you don't have any chance
with when you also have these important
children at home if if you're going to
try to manage your time when you have
children at home you're only going to
want to do it if your job is rewarding
my colleagues in Japan have shown me
similar results in Japan so this is not
strictly a Western result either it's
really important for managers to realize
that motivating factors are not
one-size-fit-all
people who manage men and women both
should make sure they understand
what exactly people want from their
careers now Harvey Mudd College is very
well known as the case of doing what
seemed like an impossible task they went
from 12% to 42% women in computer
science in five years and basically they
did three things they took about half of
all their first-year students to Grace
Hopper which is a conference for women
in computing regardless of their major
this provides role models there two or
three thousand women technologists there
the second thing they did is they change
the introductory computer science
courses to not require previous
programming experience so they separated
out people with experience from those
that don't and they made it more
holistic and CMU did something like this
earlier as well they also involve
students in research from their second
year and this is something that other
universities have done to like triple IT
and Hyderabad they also involve students
in research from their second year
they're solving a different problem
there the problem there is that bachelor
students can earn so much money in India
that their parents say are you crazy
wanting to go to school more but by
getting students involved in research
earlier they greatly increase the number
of students that wanted to stay on for a
masters or PhD so none of these is
really new ideas but in combination and
with support of the president they had
quite a large effect now I can tell you
about a few success cases at Google also
one of them is closed captioning on
YouTube this was a feature that was
championed by a deaf engineer Ken Haren
Steen he said we have to do this and he
made it happen but nobody predicted the
business impact this feature would have
it went well beyond the deaf community
it's really valuable to companies that
do business in multiple countries where
the sound isn't very good
it turned out to be a killer feature and
nobody knew it but having this person
with a different background helped to
make this happen the response to the
Japan earthquake is also something
really interesting now google has a
group called crisis or and they have
various technology pieces that they
built in response to disasters
now the Japan earthquake happened about
three o'clock on a Friday afternoon and
we have an engineering office in Tokyo
so the people who were there they just
dropped everything else contacted the
crisis team and they started adapting an
application called the person finder
they did a bunch of other things too but
I'll just tell you about the person
finder this is something that where you
can enter the name of someone you're
looking for or put in information about
yourself if if you're or about someone
you've seen so that people can find each
other it was used in Haiti after the
earthquake as well now the problem in
this case after the earthquake and
tsunami was that many people were in
places with no internet and in Japan at
the time most people had two G phones so
they didn't have internet access now the
engineers who came from one of the CJK
languages that's chinese japanese korean
they assumed the opposite of the
engineers who came from one of the roman
languages with a with a phonetic
alphabet in terms of whether people
would be able to write the names when
when you write a name in japanese you
write it using these kanji characters
but they're ambiguous that is there a
lot of homonyms in japanese like the
word comic can mean hair or paper or God
and you distinguish it by which Chinese
character goes with it and moreover if
you see a character there can be
multiple pronunciations of it and there
can be minor differences like we lived
in Japan
I remember one case when one of the
other women was trying to figure out
whether it was an X or like a curve in a
line and those minor differences could
make a difference in what the name was
so given all the difficulties the
solution that was come up with was to
create a Picasso site where pictures
could be uploaded so people could take a
photograph of one of the boards at a
community center that had names of
people that people were looking for send
it to a gmail address a volunteer would
upload this on Picasa and then first
some people at Google and then other
volunteers also started transcribing
these into person finder about 5,000
people volunteered to help transcribe
names and about a hundred fifty thousand
names were put in through this joint
effort and in part this was because of
the diverse background of the team being
able to respond to this so what should
you do to make your organization
effective you need to create an
atmosphere of trust you should create
critical mass as much as you can and
provide a credible narrative it's
important to know yourself understand
your own biases take the test that
project implicit I suggest you take at
least two and especially concentrate on
those where you think you don't have a
bias it takes about 10 minutes for one
dataworks it's really important to get
good data you need to create an
inclusive culture and active lis valued
diversity in thought and team
composition it's important to support
alternative career goals and share
strategies that work and as I said
before the site reducing stereotype
threat org has a lot of good suggestions
so now since it's International Women's
Day let me tell you about some of the
early programmers
many people say that ADA the Countess of
Lovelace was a first programmer she was
a daughter of Lord Byron but her parents
separated when she was only one or two
months old so she never met him but her
mother had her trance trance as a
mathematician perhaps in reaction and
she did a translation for Babbage and in
doing that she wrote out the how to
compute a sequence of Bernoulli numbers
and this was shown that it would have
worked if he had ever built the
analytical engine Grace Hopper is the
person after which the Grace Hopper
conference was named she was a
mathematician at Vassar when the second
world war broke out she decided to
volunteer for the for the the Navy I
believe and she thought that she would
be sent to Princeton where some of her
friends were working on encryption but
instead she was sent to Harvard to work
on the mark one she established herself
early on by helping to calculate some
complex differential equations needed
and that took several months but later
she helped to build the first compilers
for example this became the background
for COBOL and she said it was because
she was lazy she became quite a spoke
person for the computer industry and
I've heard her speak in person so if you
have time you should look up Grace
Hopper and the nanosecond on YouTube
there's a great video in which she
explains the how far an electron can go
in a nanosecond she was a great
spokesperson now the women who were
assigned to the ENIAC are also very
interesting many women were hired to be
computers which meant that they did
complex calculations but six of the
women at the University of Pennsylvania
were selected to
you work on the ENIAC which was the
first all-electric all electronic
digital computer all they had was logic
diagrams but they built the first
programs and they had to do it by
manually moving cables and so on there
are there's is some really good video of
interviews of these women unfortunately
they've all passed away now but they had
very interesting experiences these were
some of the first programmers ever now a
number of women have won the Turing
award but one of them Barbara Liskov I
think is is very interesting because
some of the constructs we use everyday
in our programming like iteration
constructs are things that she designed
and so it's important to realize also
that we had more women in computing in
the 80s that then at any time since then
and nobody really understands why it has
reduced of course I have my own theories
and a lot of people have theories but
it's important to encourage young women
to study this because it's a fun area
and they can contribute quite a lot so
as I said before the the tacit project
implicit are important and really easily
available there's a very nice keynote
speech by Sheryl Sandberg
from the Grace Hopper conference in 2011
and I encourage you to find that video I
think she's having some events soon - I
think her message is really really very
valuable but this talk differs from that
in that I'm focusing on what
organizations have to do and she's
focusing more on what women can do for
themselves I think both are important so
thank you for joining the voices come
through
and I'm happy that we could participate
