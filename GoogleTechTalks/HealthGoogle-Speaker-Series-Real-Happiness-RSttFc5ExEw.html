could use no one left out it was a
completely inclusive vision of life
where anyone was said to have the
capacity to change their own minds not
to change the circumstance they found
themselves in but in terms of the degree
of connection or isolation compassion or
bitterness with which it was held and so
I heard that and there was an
independent study program at the school
where you could go anywhere
theoretically for a year and do any
project that they approved of and then
come back and do a kind of cross
cultural study so i said i want to go to
India and study meditation I wasn't
frankly interested in Buddhism as a
philosophy or an identity I didn't want
to call myself something different i
didn't want to adopt a set of beliefs or
dogma but if there were some tools that
actually could ease the way i saw a life
in the way i lived life I wanted them so
off I went and in fact I did find it
took a little while but i found the kind
of circumstance i was looking for which
wasn't heavily laden with history
culture beliefs cosmology but really
centered on almost like an immersion
into utilizing those skills of the mind
so from that experience and what's
happened from from then on i really do
consider meditation practice as a kind
of skills training that anybody if they
are interested in can pursue it's like
an experiment it's a quality of
exploration so first of all it's a
training in concentration whereas most
of us would probably describe ourselves
perhaps not in every arena of life but
at least in some as somewhat scattered
or distracted where we sit down to think
something through we're trying to work
through a dilemma we're in car
chin with somebody and it's not that
long before our attention goes to the
past and we go over and over and over
some situation which perhaps we now feel
regretful of but cannot change or our
minds go to the future and we create a
scenario that has not happened and may
never happen and perhaps it's laced with
a lot of anxiety I've been using this
example lately I was teaching with a
friend of mine Bob Thurman who's a
professor of Buddhist studies at
Columbia University so it's teaching
with him in New York City and I just
used this as an example kind of
spontaneously I said it's like you're
sitting in an airplane in New York on
the tarmac and you realize that plane is
going to be late and then begins that
anxious cascade toward creating a future
oh no I'll probably miss my connecting
flight surely i'll miss my connecting
flight what am I going to do I'm going
to land in Portland Oregon it's gonna be
after midnight oh no there won't be any
cabs is not New York what's going to
happen as though Portland had a history
of people just perishing after midnight
when they landed at the airport like
just disappeared and I I just used that
as an example and also said as a side
note that when i see my mind beginning
to go in that kind of direction i have
almost a kind of personal mantra which i
say which is something will happen right
like something will happen sorry i said
the thing about Bob in the beginning
because I just had used that example in
front of him maybe six weeks later I got
an email from him which said I just
landed in portland lots of cabs because
clearly it was a creation of my mind you
know so our attention can be kind of
flickering go to the past go to the
Future judgment speculation it may not
have a sense of steadiness steadfastness
centeredness and the larger
manifestation of that in life tends to
be a feeling of fragmentation the way we
can have so much compartmentalization so
much role identify
the way people say I feel like one
person at work and a different person at
home or my favorite example of this
actually was teaching in New York City
and someone raised her hand and she said
I feel filled with loving kindness and
compassion for all beings as long as I'm
alone but once I'm with others is really
rough or maybe we feel quite connected
and okay well with others but very ill
at ease being alone and so our lives
here too can be quite fragmented so in
the process of deepening concentration
we bring that attention together we
bring our energy together so that we do
have a sense of of being more grounded
of having a center it's often a very
simple process and not exactly what we
think sometimes we just choose an object
it could be really any object and and
whole varieties and systems of
meditation practice choose different
objects an image of visualization a
phrase a word a sound in the school in
which I was mostly trained we tend to
choose the feeling of the breath the
actual sensations of the breath as that
object so we have an object we settle
our attention on it attention goes
flying all over the place we bring it
back so it's a process of learning in
that moment to relinquish of whatever
relinquish whatever has distracted us
being gentle not condemning ourselves
and berating ourselves being able to
start over just bringing our attention
back to that object and one reason they
say that the breath is so often chosen
as what we call the primary object of
meditation of concentration meditation
is because first of all you don't have
to believe anything in order to feel
your breath you don't have to declare an
allegiance to any system or reject
anything else if you're breathing you
can be meditating and then is one
my teacher said I've always felt quite
charmingly he said the breath is very
portable if we can practice say 5 10 15
20 minutes a day in a formal dedicated
way we can practice at work no one needs
to know you're doing it it's not like
perhaps a meeting here gets contentious
i don't know but i often use an example
say you're the contentious meeting at
work and tempers are starting to go up
you don't have to say excuse me a minute
and open a closet door and pull out a
lot of equipment and you know sit in a
certain posture and look funny no one
even needs to know you're doing it so
it's like a resource that we can touch
we can return to the breath is very
portable so we can access that sense of
groundedness when centeredness wherever
we are as long as we're breathing so we
settle our attention on that object and
we say interestingly enough this isn't a
process of accumulation I mean it's one
of the things that's hard about
meditation practice is difficult for us
is that the results may not be so easily
measured with the kind of metric that
were accustomed to you know it's nicer
for us to be able to say well yesterday
I could be with three breaths before my
attention started to wander so today I
can be with 15 and tomorrow can be with
35 and then but it's not exactly like
that progress is much more measured in
that moment when we realize we've been
distracted maybe it's still only three
breaths later but we can let go more
easily we can return more readily we
have a greater kindness toward ourselves
these things are harder to measure but
that's the whole transformative nature
is that we bring that into our lives we
have an ability to start over more
easily when we lose sight of our
aspiration when we've made a mistake
when we have strayed from our
in course we have that resource of
coming back to the moment and having
that feeling of renewal so that's the
process of deepening concentration it's
said to be very empowering because it's
a lot of energy that's flying all over
the place that's not available to us
that could be available to us and it's
said to be quite healing because it's a
movement toward integration of our being
it's like weaving all those disparate
aspects together so that we do have that
sense of wholeness so that's
concentration which is the first skill
and the second is mindfulness which is
of course a word that's being used a lot
because there's so much research going
on about mindfulness classically in
meditation schools mindfulness means a
quality of awareness where we can be
with what's happening we can connect to
our experience in a moment without the
intrusion of so much bias old fears
projection into the future what's this
going to feel like tomorrow what's it
going to feel like next year things we
feel we're not allowed to to feel that
we try to cut off or a tendency to be
completely submerged in the Cascade of
changing states not having a sense of
spaciousness or perspective there lots
of ways that we are just habituated to
hold on to push away to go to sleep to
numb out to ignore to distance ourselves
too much to get too lost in and overcome
by the various states that come and go
so mindfulness implies a certain
balanced relationship to what's
happening not cold and icy distant in
that may be mistaken sense that we
sometimes use the word balance but a
real sense of honesty and clarity and
interest in our experience so here's my
favorite definition of mindfulness these
days which comes from a an article in
The New York Times
now almost three years ago I think there
was a pilot project in in the schools in
California somewhere in a fifth grade
classroom bringing the tools of
mindfulness to the kids and it was a
great article altogether but there were
two lines in it I especially liked the
first from one of the researchers said
all day long we tell kids to pay
attention but we never teach them how
and then the second was from one of the
kids so I guess fifth grade is like 10
years old something like that so they
said to him what is mindfulness what is
mindfulness and he said in response
mindfulness means not hitting someone in
the mouth and I thought great definition
of mindfulness mindfulness means not
hitting someone in the mouth because
what does that imply it implies knowing
what we're feeling when it begins when
that feeling begins not 15 consequential
actions later not after we've gone to
our you know computer and typed out the
email and pressed send it implies being
very in touch and aware of what is
happening within and without it also
implies a certain balanced relationship
to that emotion because clearly if we
get consumed by submerged by overcome by
all these changing states will probably
hit a lot of people in the mouth but at
the same time if we hate it we fear it
we cannot bear that we're having this
emotion or eyes we're just going to
clamp down in some way and then we're
going to explode it's not going to work
so to be in touch to note we're feeling
very quickly to have that sense of
balance which can recognize what's
happening also gives us some space it
gives us some options because at that
moment we have time for some wise
reflection maybe we think well you know
last week I hit someone in the mouth
didn't work out that well let me try
this instead it doesn't mean we never
respond we never do anything and that's
one of the great problems I think with
the word mindfulness is that it's
starting to imply a sort of passivity or
complacency like I'll just be with
whatever fine it's all fine which it
doesn't really mean at all it has much
more of a sense of a very dynamic kind
of choice because there's space and we
realize we have options the here's
another way to describe it I went with a
friend of mine to a prison in Wisconsin
because she'd been teaching meditation
there and I was there to teach for the
day so the fact that it was a prison
doesn't really have anything to do with
the story but that's where it took place
so we're in this room and my friend
asked for three people to leave the room
and since that was a prison that meant a
staff person had to go to so that was
four people left the room and then she
asked everyone left all of us left to
just create a structure in the middle of
the room with any material we found so
they're a bunch of chairs and these guys
got up and they piled all these chairs
on top of one another and there were
some flags because it was estate
facilities they put in these flags and
what we takin off our shoes so we had a
bunch of shoes to pile around the chairs
and I think there was one plant so they
stuck that there and I looked at this
mound of stuff there and clearly because
of the flags it began evoking all these
feelings in me I thought oh this is a
monument and it tells the story of valor
and tragedy and challenge and triumph
and glory and then one by one she asked
the people who'd left the room to come
in and she'd say tell me what you see so
the first person who came back in the
room said I see a monument and I thought
right on
what is discerning guy I mean clearly
has it right and every person who came
into the room told a very different
story about what they saw one person who
happened to be the staff person said I
see chaos that just see gasps and that's
not to say that every story we tell
about what we see what we hear what we
feel what we sense is accurate some are
quite distorted some are much more
realistic and it's not to say that we
are trying to abolish that tendency to
tell that story but mindfulness allows
us to see this is what is actually in
front of me this is the narrative that I
am beginning to weave about it some
stories are fantastic they bring us
together they raised our aspiration they
opened doors for us of what might be
possible some are very very damaging
very old and quite damaging so here's a
story like that I went to a house once a
friend of ours had rented a house for a
number of friends to do a retreat in and
when I went into the bedroom that had
been set aside for me I saw that there
was a cartoon that had been left on the
desk from the Peanuts comic strip in the
first frame of the cartoon loose he's
talking to Charlie Brown and she says
you know Charlie Brown what your problem
is the problem with you is that you're
you then in the second frame of the
cartoon poor Charlie Brown looks at her
and says well what in the world can I do
about that then in the third and final
frame Lucy says I don't pretend to be
able to give advice I merely point out
the problem and somehow whenever I was
walking by that desk my I would fall
right on that line the problem with you
is that you're you because that Lucy
dominant voice had been so strong in my
earlier life something really great
happen
well it's never going to happen again or
do you really deserve to be happy or if
you make a mistake that's not the
opportunity to begin again that's the
opportunity for a very big downward
spiral for a very long time that's a
kind of story if you really knew who you
were or you don't have the capacity to
change or whatever it might be so what
mindfulness does going back to the
prison for second mindfulness allows us
just to make that distinction not to
annihilate the capacity for the story
not to cease to respond to anything in
life but it brings a kind of awareness
certainly an intelligence to those
moments because we see look what I am
weaving and what is it we have the
possibility of some great discernment
right there and do we want to continue
in that vein do we want to let it go and
we can let it go because we've trained
in that so that's mindfulness to be able
to be so in touch with our experience
that we can see really into the nature
of it and once we can do that then we
can look much more deeply into whatever
is happening we see layers and layers
and layers that might have been
disguised or hidden when we were just
struggling against what's going on we're
so completely caught up in it if we're
looking at an emotion it may be anger
we're looking at we may see layers of
sadness and fear and a sense of
powerlessness or helplessness if we're
looking at a time of great delight and
enjoy we may see levels of withholding
in ways that we're not experiencing
perhaps as fully as we might what's
going on we may look at our attention
and notice that we have a tendency to
fixate on what we don't have
and on what we do have just so many
things that are very interesting that we
might never notice just in a superficial
movement through a day so mindfulness
really opens us to seeing so much and
understanding so much more including
truths about change renewal possibility
the fragility of life the tentativeness
of all situations including a truth of
interconnection that when we look quite
deeply at any experience we see layers
and layers and layers so for example if
each of you just reflected right now for
a few moments on the different people
encounters conversations that have led
you to be listening to this right now
let's talk right now so I'll assume
nobody was like walking through with
their lunch and just thought they'd sit
down that we're here each of us because
of a confluence of conditions and
connections and relationships and all
kinds of things that's what this moment
in time is that's what every moment in
time is is as confluence so sometimes I
do this reflection and I think back to
being in college I think back to the
Board of Regents of the state of New
York who gave me a scholarship so I
could go to college so I could go to
India that's a part of why I'm here
right now so many things this is what we
see that life is more intricate
connected then might appear on the
surface the Vietnamese n teacher tick
not Han has this
exercise where you like holds up a
string bean or something like that and
he says now see the universe because you
can well we look at a tree and we see
not just the entity of the tree standing
there is a seemingly singular solid
thing we also sense the nature of the
soil which is nurturing it and
everything that affects that soil and
the rainfall and everything that affects
the rainfall and the quality of the air
and the sunlight in the moonlight that's
also the tree it's a network everything
is this is part of the insight that
comes just naturally from paying
attention in a deeper way not in a faint
or forest or contrived way but because
this is what we actually see so then the
third skill of meditation after greater
concentration and greater mindfulness is
greater loving-kindness and compassion
and to go back to prison yet one more
time if mindfulness allows us to see the
distinction between our experience and
the story that is coming about loving
kindness or the deepening of
loving-kindness and compassion changes
our default story that ready immediate
narrative that tends to Russian doesn't
have to be luci in fact it can be
instead of a story of fear a story about
connection a story about inclusion
rather than exclusion and this is based
on that kind of wisdom of seeing
interconnection so loving kindness
literally means friendship it doesn't
mean we like everybody or approve of
everybody but the construct of self and
other with a great big other out there
the construct of being in or being out
of there being a line that divides us
the construct of us and them are seen as
constructs
and we understand that we have an
alternative vision of life which is
actually more true so this is actually a
skill to pay attention in a different
way and all of the heart spaces you
could say that are revoked from a
different quality of attention and I
find this interesting because I've been
present a fair number of times when
different neuro scientists and
researchers have been presenting their
findings state of the dalai lama about
meditation studies and whereas early
studies were pretty exclusively focused
on mindfulness as a skill more and more
people are studying compassion
meditation in these different settings
so very often i've been present as these
findings have been reported and almost
always the researcher will conclude with
a statement like and from this one can
almost begin to think that compassion
can be seen as a skill and it's always a
sort of pronouncement like whew this is
a big deal and i just think all right
yeah because from the point of view of
meditation training obviously it's a
skill i mean there's no there's no
question of that and i look at that too
i'm quite intrigued by that why it can
seem so often that that's worthy of a
pronouncement do we tend to think of
compassion more as a gift and some
people have it and others don't if you
don't you're out of luck or just a kind
of immediate emotional response not
based in anything based in a worldview
based in how we see ourselves or others
but from the point of view of meditation
compassion is absolutely a skill because
it's all generated by how we pay
attention so if concentration training
steadies our attention and mindfulness
training refines our attention so it's
not so clutter
it by all this other stuff compassion
training or loving kindness training
opens our attention it really has a
stretch in different ways so if there
are people for example you tend to
ignore look right through discount
disregard the question becomes what
happens when you actually pay attention
to them it's not the phony forcing of a
certain kind of emotion week I'm going
to like you or something like that but
it is the willingness to shift to move
out of a rut to open and expand who we
pay attention to and then we see what
happens from that or what do we pay
attention to do we pay attention nearly
exclusively and most obsessively to what
we don't like about somebody can we
actually open to have a more inclusive
and total perspective about somebody
this doesn't feel right often it feels
kind of weird but it's an interesting
experiment to make just to move out of
that rut whatever it might be or how
about if in conversation our attention
tends to be quite fragmented we barely
pay attention to people because people
are distracting us from the next 50
emails we need to send and everything
else we need to do and so they're
talking and we're gone so what happens
when we gather our attention and we
actually arrived and we listen so that
the training in deepening
loving-kindness and compassion is really
a tremendous experiment in attention
sometimes people think of it as some
that will force them to try to pretend
to feel something it is seen as very
gooey or sentimental and not that
appealing I teach an intensive
loving-kindness meditation retreat at
the center i co-founded the insight
meditation society every year and at the
beginning of one retreat this guy came
and I'm actually know why he was there
he must have been there to make someone
else happy he said to me the beginning
of the retreat I hate this meditation
because it reminds me of a continually
enforce valentine's day like on the
count of three you will be filled with
love you know something coercive and
very strange but I'm happy to say by the
end of the retreat he was reporting a
very different experience because it's
not that the training in loving kindness
or compassion is absolutely an attention
training and seeing what happens with
the consequences of that so here's
another example I was also teaching with
Bob Thurman somewhere and he used this
example he said imagine you're on a
subway and these Martians come and they
zap the subway car so that those of you
who are in the subway car are going to
be together forever he says what do you
do if someone's hungry you feed them
somebody's freaking out you try to calm
them down not because you necessarily
like them but because your lives have
something to do with one another you're
going to be together forever so I love
that example and I started using it
quite a bit and then one day I was
sitting on an airplane and the tarmac in
New York City and I was flying to tucson
and the plane ended up sitting on the
runway for four and a half hours in what
looking back I sometimes now refer to as
the breakdown of civilization because I
got hotter and hotter and hotter and
people were yelling and screaming and
getting madder and madder at one point
the pilot sort of took command of the
aircraft to get on the PA system and he
said no one is leaving this aircraft and
I wasn't feeling that chipper myself you
know I was thinking I'm paying rent in
New York City you know like they let me
off your plane I could go back to my
apartment and then I could try again
tomorrow no reason not to but I couldn't
get off the plane and then just sitting
there all of a sudden that image that
Bob had used came up in my mind imagine
you're on a subway and these Martians
come and they zapped the subway car so
that those of you who were there are
going to be together forever and I
looked around the airplane and I thought
maybe these are my people and it was
quite interesting cuz things shifted I
realized that some amount of my own i er
was the thought how long am I going to
be stuck with these people and then I
thought forever look like deal it's a
different imperative to deal that's the
kind of movement of the mind to say okay
here's a certain rut here's a certain
familiar realm of attention what happens
when I include rather than exclude what
happens when I think this may not come
to an end these people have something to
do with me in the end so we play with
our attention quite a lot in this
training so these three skills are
really the essence of meditation I think
whatever form it might take and there
are many many many methods it's really
up to us if if we want to experiment and
to continue to deepen these skills the
hardest thing about meditation practice
is that it needs to be done not just
thought about it would be so much easy
here if we could just admired from afar
and get all the benefit but is not like
that it's very empirical it's very real
and so I think it's worth the experiment
if you want to see what kind of
methodology might best suit you and what
conditions might help you actually do
some so do you have any questions or
comments anything you'd like to talk
about we might have a chance to practice
for a few minutes as well yeah I think
do I have to give them microphone how do
you keep from falling asleep while
meditating how do you keep from falling
asleep while meditating you might fall
asleep while meditating they it's not
uncommon sometimes what we discover is
that we're very very very tired and it's
only when we stop that we see that level
of fatigue so it's not always bad thing
to see sometimes it's very instructive
we also set the stage for trying not to
fall into the sleepiness and have it be
so overwhelming sometimes you sit with
your eyes open you might choose to do a
walking meditation say instead of a
sitting meditation one of the big things
in attention training is having a sense
of immediacy so if say you're using a
technique like being with the breath if
you have the thought well I'll just be
aware of this breath in the next 50
you're going to go to sleep but if you
say just one breath just one just now
it'll give you some energy things like
that so we work with the attention to be
somewhat more gathered and more precise
okay the question was about the opposite
situation where is a great image
actually said it's like 50,000 people
trying to get out of a stadium all the
same time well it's like sitting down
and like the doors are opening 50
thousand thoughts or just spilling out
so it feels like a waste of time and
then it's very discouraging so she just
gives up you are not failing at
meditation I promise you really and I
don't say that just to be comforting or
to offer some solace you're not failing
at meditation because meditation
practice is not in the end it's not
about what's happening it's about how
we're relating to what's happening and
that also makes it difficult to measure
you know would be easier to say well I
had a good session because there were no
thoughts but that may not be true you
might have a billion thoughts and all
nasty thoughts to to boot but you might
be relating to them with some awareness
and balance and that would be considered
a very good meditation so really you
cannot fail at it but it's important to
understand what the goal actually is
also those states don't last forever you
know that they're just times of some
greater uproar or agitation maybe and so
this is great outpouring of thoughts so
also if you just SAT there a little
longer who would quiet down so please
don't take it personally and don't feel
that you failed so we do two different
things in the face of that kind of
restless thinking one is to see if you
could have it be
more in the distance and take a little
more interest in the feeling of your
breath if that's the object that you're
centering your attention on the example
is sometimes used of seeing a friend in
a crowd you don't have to shove aside
everyone else and say go away you're
bothering me you're in the way but your
interest Your Enthusiasm is going oh
there's my friend there's the breath
there's the breath everything else can
come and go come and go come those
doesn't matter there's the breath so if
you can find that kind of balance you'll
find some ease even though the thoughts
are still churning and sometimes what we
do is almost the opposite of that which
is you sit down and you make the wild
movement of thoughts the object of your
attention it's like you're in a storm
well like yeah I came in yesterday to
this area and it was raining and raining
and raining and then the person who's
driving he said well you know it's gonna
snow tomorrow I said oh great you know I
was just in Seattle where it snowed for
the first time like a hundred years or
something like that yep but weathers
weather write and so sometimes you just
think this is an inner storm and I'm
just going to open and let it process
through instead of try to control it and
constrain it which isn't going to work
so that's another thing to do yeah yeah
mm-hmm walking meditation is also the
question was how does one do walking
meditation it's also done in a variety
of different ways some schools of
meditation would say first of all eyes
open that's very important some schools
would say as you are walking see if you
can still maintain a light awareness of
the feeling of your breath even as
you're walking along the way I was
trained didn't do that so much the
object of attention shifted more to the
actual sensations of your body and
movement your feet touching the ground
things like that so the first thing I
usually suggest is eyes open
then see if you can bring your energy
down so you feel your feet from your
feet not as though who you were your
consciousness was residing up here in
your head somewhere trying to peer down
and see what's going on but feel your
feet from your feet I wrote when I was
writing a description of walking
meditation in this book I just wrote the
editor put in a line saying something
like it's like your feet are looking
back at you and I thought that's so
weird like I didn't say that you know
and then I tried it and I thought who it
is kind of like that that's what it
feels like and you just feel the simple
sensations it's not an anatomical
exercise where you're trying to think of
this muscle groups doing this and that
muscle groups doing that you just
actually feel heaviness lightness
pressure harden and softness you don't
name them but you feel them so it's a
very light attention because you don't
want to hunker down and cut off
awareness of everything around you but
it's a really fascinating exercise
because it keeps us aware in the time
that obviously for in transition we're
usually thinking about the next place
we're going and everything we need to do
and so on so it actually opens up that
transition time is the time of more
mindfulness yeah uh-huh so the question
was she finds chanting to be easier and
does that count as meditation yes I
think it counts as meditation my
personal bias and it's a beautiful
extraordinary experience to do chanting
my personal bias in meditation is that I
would like everyone to have at least
some baseline technique that they can
use anywhere and then whatever else we
do for the sake of the experience or the
training is is a wonderful addition but
we've got that kind of nitty-gritty
thing that goes with us anywhere because
if you are in some difficult or
challenging or anxiety producing
state and maybe you could chance inside
but it wouldn't necessarily be that easy
but you can breathe yeah is it possible
to combine meditation and prayer I think
so yeah I mean I think if one has that
orientation then then certainly and I
think that would be I think it's always
a good addition to know what we actually
want to know what's happening within to
know what our motivation is to know
what's cookin to know what's taking us
away and had to come back to what we're
doing yeah yeah how does it want to
introduce mindfulness to children
interestingly enough there was an
article in the LA Times just a month or
so ago which someone had done a
meta-analysis of all these different
studies about mindfulness and they came
to the conclusion according to the
article that yes there really is
scientific validation for mindfulness
and the kinds of changes it provides an
attention and so on but then the person
later on in the article said something
like well of course we know it couldn't
work for children we couldn't work for
elderly people who were very set in
their ways and it couldn't work for
people without very sharp intelligence
and and all these people was like this
uproar like wait a minute you know I
know lots of older people and children
and maybe not totally brilliant people
too who are doing mindfulness with great
effect so there are several books now
that a really good books about
mindfulness training for children
according to the developmental stage
Susan Kaiser greenland is one author
this book the mindful child Linda Len
Thierry wrote a book that's used a lot
in New York
city as well basically we just take the
same techniques and make them concrete
I've taught loving-kindness meditation
to children trying to make it very
concrete you know think about someone at
school think about when you feel safe is
that when you're holding someone's hand
is it doing this or whatever and then
mindfulness can be great fun depending
on the age of the child feel lied down
feel your belly moving up and down put a
stuffed animal on your belly watch them
go up and down things like that so Susan
Kaiser Greenland and then Linda Len
Thierry oh uh so what you were saying
about not sort of standing in judgment
over your success in meditation reminds
me of a story of something that happened
here at the local Zen Center in Mountain
View there was a machine or meditation
retreat going on and one of the
participants was having a very hard time
he was uncomfortable and sort of fidgety
and his mind was racing and everything
and after a few hours of this he went to
add okusan interview with the Roshi and
said i think i'm going to just leave
because I'm just having a terrible
sitting here I'm just I can't settle
down and the row she listened to all
this for a while and then he just smiled
kindly and shook his head and he said go
back in there there's no such thing as a
bad sitting and so he did that and sat
down and things seem to get a lot better
at the end of the day he came back to
the Roshi and he said thank you so much
for making me stay he said it was really
great in for the rest of the day I had a
really good sitting in the row she
smiled kindly and shook his head and
said there's no such thing as a good
sitting that's Fabio there's a great
story like it well I went to one of my
teachers are early on when i was living
in india because i wasn't always on
intensive retreat i was trying to have a
life and it was a very simple life in
those days this was the 70s in india no
job no
family no phones no computer and how fax
is no email but still it was quite
difficult to have a regular practice and
as it is and it was difficult in large
part I think because I was judging my
practice all the time when I sat down to
meditate and it felt peaceful and serene
I think I'll good i'm gonna live the
entire rest of my life in India doing
just this and when it was difficult or
challenging or I heard or I was bored or
I was sleepy I'd get up and I think it's
not working and so finally I went to one
of my teachers and described this
pattern and he said to me whew I have
just one piece of advice and that is
just put your body there he said every
day just put your body there it's not
that there's never a time for evaluation
and assessment because there is but not
every moment that you're doing it and
the real fruit or the consequence of the
practice is usually not in your it's not
seen in your formal sitting and it's a
good thing because we don't practice
meditation to become a great meditator
we practice meditation because of the
effect in our lives of these qualities
of mindfulness of concentration and a
greater compassion and so on so it may
not even be while you're sitting that
you notice that it's done anything but
you will notice when you're in
conversation with somebody or when you
do make a mistake or when you kind of
open up your sense of aspiration to be
bigger and not be so limited by forces
of habit and things like that and that's
where it counts so this is a good thing
mm-hmm mmhmm mm-hmm it's an interesting
question the question was is it harder
for someone say a newspaper reporter who
is bearing witness in effect two great
atrocity and trauma to do something like
loving-kindness meditation because of
the disparity between the reality of
what people are going through and this
sort of ideal of of compassion or loving
kindness I think that you know many
people that are experiencing a lot of
trauma and seeing a lot and some of them
were interesting in newer studies are
trying to bring meditation practice to
those situations to see what kind of
effect it might have and and I think
that is it harder i think it is
sometimes it's harder sometimes it's not
in terms of loving-kindness practice
because almost always one sees people
who are responding in the most horrible
of situations from a basis of compassion
and you think how can that be you know
that people find that in in that
terrible desperate awful situation and
yet they do and so I think we bear
witness to that as well which seems to
be a capacity of the human heart and
also for some people there's a certain
sense that the kind of dualism and
exclusion and discounting and creation
of the other is at the root of so much
of the devastation that happens that
we've got to find another way it's just
we're compelled and a lot of that
depends on one's understanding of loving
kindness or compassion if it seems too
sweet nice you know and fluffy is not
going to serve as that alternative but
if we understand
an a certain power in seeing the world
differently then it could serve it's
like um I don't remember accurately the
famous quotation from Albert Einstein we
said something like the significant
problems that we face cannot be solved
by the same level of thinking that
created them something like that and so
that's the kind of experiment we make
it's like whoa we need a very different
way of thinking and so let's look at
what happens with this so okay thank you
all so much may be happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
