method the 12th bad math day hosted by
google also have a hand for google
search through them everybody or we're
working an endorsement deal right now so
just a little reminder that if you if
like everybody else in the world you
have one of these things you should now
turn it down to off or silence please I
I had you know I had I went to a funeral
a couple months ago where one of these
went off was very unpleasant so please
turn off your cell phones and let's see
so our first speaker is date at David
I've never learn how to pronounce your
last name Hey oh fire fire okay Dave
buyer Varner college note a note a
mathematician and also in co-inventor of
Macaulay program with which many new
probably familiar and of course star of
stage and screen so you can ask them
about it later alright so here's here's
Dave I are talking about the coloring
Taurus of a graph hi so for those of you
who like to come to talks looking for
mistakes they're already several in the
first slide I got Richards email on how
to get here too late to change the
directions here ok so I'm interested in
my background the pertains to this is a
toric algebra toric geometry I've
written various papers with a parent's
term fills Soren popescu on applications
of Torak geometry two things that felt
like to me to be close enough to graph
colorings that I wanted to look again at
graph colorings which was a topic that
always interested me say in high school
there's a standard way so there are many
variations on graph colorings I'm
interested in what I'm trying to find a
geometric explanation for the sort of
most fundamental kind of graph colorings
in my opinion is vertex coloring so
graphs
so we have a graph G and I'm going to
consistently through this talk I'm never
used once the fact that is d vertices
because we're going to go away from
vertices quickly but I do use everywhere
that there n edges and rather than using
colors to color a graph the typical
thing you find in a textbook is to take
a finite abelian group whose elements
you consider to be the colors and then
the idea of coloring a graph is to
assign a distinct value to each vertex
distinct in the sense that two
neighboring vertices never have the same
value so too for color a large planar
graph you only use four colors but
you'll never have the same color next to
each other so the first step in to and
the advantage to thinking of this is a
group it turns out the order the group
doesn't matter a standard that I mean
I'm sorry the group itself does not
matter any two groups of the same size
you can either well you can color the
one or color or the other but the shift
want to make is we want to think of this
as a phenomenon edges rather than a
phenomena on vertices so this is so we
want to think of the difference going
along an edge between the vertex and the
next vertex so we're looking for so
coloring induces a function on edges
which is never zero if it's a strict
coloring and if you come around in a
loop you come back to the same color so
these assignments have to sum to zero
around any cycle so this shift is a lot
like studying functions you can take the
gun study gradient vector fields but if
you're looking a gradient vector field
has a property that you integrate around
in a circle you come back to where you
started and it's the same thing as
studying functions up to a choice of a
constant so here if I have an assignment
I on edges which sums 20 I need around
any cycle and is is non zero everywhere
I can always get back to an ordinary
coloring by just picking an arbitrary
value for one vertex and then
propagating using the edge differences
so never again going to think about
vertices now 11 feature of this is it
makes it clear that this is dual to
another interesting concept which is a
flow on a graph and a flow on a graph
instead
of being a nonzero assignment on edges
which sums 20 around any cycle it's a
nonzero assignment on edges which sums
to zero in and out of any vertex so let
me show you example so on the top
example here is that is it is a triangle
and I'm I'm coloring with the integers
mod 3 and so the the color I used is 0 1
2 on edges on vertices and that
corresponds to the difference function
if I orient each edge counterclockwise
as I've shown you it corresponds to a
difference function one everywhere and
that's one sums is three going around
the cycle but that's zero in our group a
the dual flow would be to draw the plane
or dual I haven't drawn it quite the
same because of the outside is now at
the bottom over here by just sort of
turning everything quarter turn and
labeling that edge with the same flow
instead of getting a labeling of edges
which sums 20 on cycles I get a labeling
of edges which whose flow in and out of
each vertex is is is 0 so we have a
total flow of 3 into the bottom vertex
but that's 0 mod 3 and sin the second
example is just a more elaborate version
of the same thing so how do people the
first way I thought about how to count
these which is I mean implicit in most
book descriptions of say calculating the
chromatic polynomial is you can imagine
a hyperplane arrangement but not over
the real numbers instead in the integers
mod MZ and the ideas you put you want
the space to be the set of all possible
edge labelings which some 20 run every
cycle and then you want to put in a
hyperplane in that space for everything
your every rule you're trying to bay
which is don't be 0 on this edge don't
be 0 on this edge don't be 0 on this
edge so for this example and and and
then you can try to do inclusion
exclusion counting or more fancy Mobius
inversion count
to try to figure out if there are any
vertices left uncovered by your
hyperplanes if you can find a vertex you
can find a point in your space which is
not covered by any of these vanishing
hyperplanes you found a coloring of the
graph I uniformly find it easiest even
though for counting purposes you leave
it the way I just set it I find it
easiest to look at these things if you
take the universal cover so always use a
cyclic group since the exact structure
of the group doesn't matter just the
size of the group and embed that cyclic
group in the unit circle and and then we
can take the universal cover of the
space of all group valued functions
which summer zero run any cycle as a
real vector space of all real valued
functions which some zero run any cycle
and in that space that can draw on my
original edge functions so all these
little dots the dots on lines and the
dots with red circles around them are
functions from edges of the graph to Z
mod 3 Z in this case and then saying
that the you can't vanish on a can't
vanish on B you can't vanish on C is
just saying void you have to avoid those
green lines which are hyper planes in
this case and so this is the same
pattern this is a periodic pattern so
there really only six distinct points in
the orbit here as you orbit around but I
just like to prefer to think of it
periodically so the strict colorings are
the ones they're shown not in any
hyperplane okay so how has it been
generalized there are many
generalizations of vertex colorings
there's edge colorings there's list
colorings my favorite is it was first
called the star chromatic number by
Vince in 88 and then was later it's been
called more recently the circular
chromatic number starting with chu in
1992 the idea it actually by accident
fits well you can think of this actually
would make sense coloring a real nap
there is a color wheel and so that
actual pigments actually tend to you can
think of pigments as having the topology
of a circle
actually it's more complicated than that
but you know that you could imagine a
circle of colors and you want to use
lots of colors and you don't really care
that over here it's the different shade
of crimson then over here what you want
is you want the colors to be as far
apart from each other as possible along
common borders so you don't really care
about glue if ink is cheap now because
we don't mix individual pigments we
print a map we use for color presses but
the four color presses are synthesizing
lots of colors if you want colors to be
as far apart as possible in the color
wheel then this model starts to make
sense where we think of our colors is
having a cyclic ordering and instead of
saying they never have the adjacent
vertices the same color say i want
adjacent vertices to be as distinct as
possible so it happens for a pentagon
that i can optimally color a pentagon
using five colors with a separation of
two and five halves is less than three
so that's actually better than three
coloring it and you can't to color it so
you know people think that this more
naturally reflects the character of the
how you code color a pentagon so the
circular chromatic number the idea was
well what's this with you know mixing
there's us there's some hustle there's
also a notion called fractional color
ability which is not the same notion so
the it's sort of like the main names
somebody got the website first I think
that this should be called fractional
color ability but that's a different
concept so circular color ability
whatchu came along and said is well why
not just use the unit circle itself and
measure how good a coloring is by what
the separation is along the unit circle
between any two between any two
neighboring vertices so it's a more
geometric formulation that it turns out
to be exactly the same theory so I want
to go back and look at the first example
I'm using the same ambient space which
is I'm you know for this triangle I can
draw it in the plane it's a set of all
maps on edges real value maps and edges
which are zero around every cycle as in
zero around one cycle here so actually
if you think of this in our three this
is the anti diagonal
and our three that we're looking at and
then if I want to simulate for coloring
using using using the real colored
circular color ability then I would
protect each edge not by a hyperplane
but rather by a slab of thick of radius
1 quarter each way so that any point
that's within a quarter in any
coordinate of one of these hyper planes
is a bad point in the rest of good
points but the reason this gives the
same theory as before is because the
adjacency matrix of a graph or the gray
basically the bond lattice and the cycle
lattice of a graph are examples of
unimodular lattices which basically
means that the matrices insight here
only have unit determinants so that if
we try to calculate what the coordinates
are of one of the vertices of these air
pockets here we're introducing the only
denominators that get interest in the
problem so if we were if we started with
a denominator of a quarter because meter
slabs a quarter each way then those
vertices of those air pockets are all
going to have denominator a quarter also
so in fact you get you get in there
effectively integral with respect to the
grid we're thinking about and so just
starting with a circular definition you
get back to getting rational answers
just like the first definition okay so
what have you done with circular
colorings well there's there's roughly a
hundred papers between maths I and
archive and searching for earlier names
for this and there's a good survey that
came out five years ago by zoo in
discrete math that describes a bunch of
problems and I guess my favorite theorem
I know if it's a representative theorem
or not is using the existing four color
theorem the point of view of all this
work tends to be that the true color
ability of a graph is this rational
number that we're constructing here
which is the best coloring with this
flexibility of you
you know fractional distances and so
forth and that when people discuss the
integer color ability they're the wrong
I mean they're approximating we don't
want to work with the approximation
anymore we want to work with the actual
value so that's if i were to paraphrase
the theme that seems to run through all
the work is is it's really a ting you
know everything that's been said about
color ability of graphs and going back
and saying well if we look at the true
answer what theorems can we now prove
about the color Brody I graphed and so
it's interesting that every possible
rational number of a planar graph
between two and four one also occurs in
a degenerate case but every rational
between two and four occurs as the
circular chromatic number of a planar
graph so they're dense everywhere and
that's kind of nice okay so what am i
interested in doing the view I'm taking
here is I'm looking I mean since I'm
coming from toric algebra and in a
nutshell what is it to work variety i
mean this circle is just the simplest
taurus you can think of remodeling the
real line by a lattice of one
dimensional lattice and in you know
studying other tour I you're just taking
higher dimensional real spaces and
lighting out by other lattices and so
forth so I'm thinking that this theory
of circular credibility is like one
variable calculus and I would rather be
doing multivariable calculus or calculus
on manifolds or whatever so I'm looking
for a way to tie in the Torak geometry
i'm interested in into the study of
graph colorings and you know circular
cul ability to me what's like an in so
there's a design pattern in mathematics
which is you know which an example of
which is the Jacobian of a curve is that
you never study a problem by itself you
try to find a parameter space of
possible problems of which the problem
you're interested in is simply one
instance and then if you can prove any
interesting theorems about the parameter
space maybe what you wanted to know
about that one instance will fall out of
the more general results so with that in
mind what led me to this definition
that so the first shift if we review was
instead of thinking of vertex colorings
has actually values on vertices we
thought of them as values on edges and
then is equivalent as long as we make
sure we sum around some 20 around cycles
well the next shift is instead of saying
we want to avoid zero let's say we want
to be as close as possible to some
different target so this is actually
very easy shift to make for the original
problem which is in a circular coloring
if I said that my target is one half for
every edge and that I may be rarely be
able to achieve a difference of one half
on each edge in fact I'm only able to
achieve a difference of one half on each
edge if the graph is too colorable which
is an extreme case but more generally
I'd let people get close to uniformly
close to one half on every edge and
still have all the cycles sum to zero
and that's my shift instead of wearing
avoiding zero I want to get as close as
possible to half and then the more
general problem on a study is instead of
studying one-half one-half one-half as
the target values on edges I want to
study arbitrary target values and edges
so that gives me the first sort of
working definition surf's more as an
exercise to work out is no detail is the
color I would define the coloring torus
of a graph to be the space of all r to
the e which is the space of all
functions on edges which you nominally
are a raw target function for a process
like this but then I want to mod out
here's my tourists coming on a mod out
why whenever to problem statements are
actually equivalent ok so let's see some
examples see how that might what that
looks like so in this example of a
Pentagon I'm rephrasing the example we
had a few slides back where i showed the
through the the five halves color
ability of the Pentagon only instead of
wording it with integers mod 5 I've now
said that in blue around the around the
upper left
I'm writing down my target values that I
would like to come up with an edge
function which is as close to a half as
possible in every single edge and the
edge function I'm actually able to come
up with which is directly transcribed
from the previous example is to assign a
value of two fifths to every edge and
now two-fifths sums up to two when you
go around the cycle but we're modding
out by integers the two is zero so that
is a valid coloring and the distance
that I get between two fifths and a half
is you know is it is a tenth but you
have to translate that back to the other
notation if you care to describe to
somebody else well I five half colored
this but my point of view now is to
forget that completely all we care about
is distance between target color target
and coloring so if everyone remember if
everyone remember what it means if I was
trying to for color a graph I would want
to find a coloring within a quarter in
this metric of the target coloring
one-half one-half one Apple Apple a half
but I want to study more generally what
is the metric properties of the coloring
Taurus okay so if you look at the middle
example on the top it's actually the
same example and the way you can see
that it's the same example is if you
look at what i did on the upper right
those are the I've added one half going
out of the top vertex both ways and i
subtracted one quarter going out of the
bottom left vertex both ways those are
both examples of bonds so I'm actually
acting on this by the real bond ladder
the real closure the real span of the
bond lattice and what I've done is I've
moved my target value so instead of
being a half a half a half a half at 0 0
half three-quarters one-fourth and
simply by slight and simply by sliding
my coloring with the same moves you'll
notice that these changes have the
property there by some around the cycle
it changes it is 0 so those are legal
changes which don't change a coloring or
a target really you could do it to
either or both you really have
no effect so the middle problem in our
coloring Taurus we should really think
of the middle problem and it's coloring
solution is being entirely equivalent to
the left problem yeah ecology or there
will be a technology in this talk at
some point what oh yeah is this homology
or ecology and yes yeah I will formulate
it as a comb ology group although I find
it easier to understand you know more
viscerally whatever we'll get to it
we'll get to it okay so that's to the
bottom is another example which is you
know the first triangulation of the
sphere which is the tetrahedron I put
the standard coloring problem down which
is a half on all edges and I'm able to
get and there's an optimal coloring it
corresponds to a for coloring but this
is what it looks like in our language
and you'll notice that it's there's a
tight little loop where we're off by
quarter going around an entire loop and
then they're actually two places and you
can find the loop quite easily because
they're two places we're actually using
a value of a half so we're on the nose
reach meaning our target on two edges
but the other four edges forming a cycle
we're off our target by a quarter and if
we were to try to flip to a different if
we're trying to add one various places
and flip to a different lattice point
we'd still be off by a quarter this is
an extremal I mean this graph is just
for colorable even in the real sense and
the fact that that this is as close as
we can get for that target a new hand
and the lower right are a different set
of target values all I've done is one
change I've moved this to a different
point in the coloring Taurus by signing
the top vertical edge target of zero
instead of a target of a quarter and
instead of target of a half and the
effect that that had was I can now come
up with a coloring which is within a
distance of sixth everywhere of the
target which is much closer than a
quarter so it's a better coloring the
closer you can get to the target the
better your coloring is okay
so we can go back and look at this in
terms of ambient spaces and I actually
find this a little bit surprising but
with one way to interpret this target
coloring model if you're used to the
hyperplane model for the original one is
to instead of having remember in our
earlier pictures the slabs all there was
a correspondent to a central arrangement
I mean you used all the slabs pass
through the origin and then you have the
periodic translates of them but they all
pass through all the translates of the
origin whereas when you start moving the
around the targets so that they're not
neatly lined up on a half what it
corresponds to is letting the slab sort
of float freely in space to different
positions and for a different
arrangement of the slabs are there still
air pockets now I mean at the end I'm
going to show you some evidence I found
this surprising because I would think
that to try to cover space with a given
you know so what would i if you view
this as a game we're trying to cover
space and we're given a slab thickness
and we're given the underlying
hyperplanes of our slabs all we're
allowed to do is translate them you'd
think that it'd be having one hand tied
behind your back to have all this to
have to have the arrangement be central
you think that by having all the slabs
overlap at the origin they be leaving
gaping holes elsewhere and you can cover
those holes quite easily by causing by
having thus lads float away from each
other two more two more uniform I mean
is the making sense that's my intuition
would that be your intuition well it
turns out in the police and planar
graphs that it doesn't seem to be the
case I'll make that statement more
precise later that somehow even 11
affords this greater level of
flexibility it proves to be just as hard
to cover space or conversely you leave
gaps just as often and therefore can
color just as often in this more general
model so it's starting to suggest you
know the conjectures i'm heading towards
okay so this particular example even
though i chose the point one half one
half 0 that's
equivalent again by a bond move 2000 so
in fact in metric Lee the target is
itself a coloring so we can get distant
zero from it and in fact the center
vertex of each of these hexagons is a
coloring which is distant zero from the
target which corresponds in our original
language to a to coloring so this shows
the flavor of how you might think of
this geometrically okay so what is how
do i construct the telling the coloring
Taurus how do I sort of make more
precise the implication that there is an
equivalence relation among edge
functions that I want to be using well
this is the same lattice that anyone who
studies this using toric algebra would
use there's a bond lattice in Z to the N
blondes are also thought of his cuts I
mean think about minimum wage that you
can take scissors and cut a graph along
edges into two pieces if you put
functions if you wit functions on those
edges all pointing from a given side to
go side that's an example of a bond the
simplest example of a bond is a vertex
bond which is you charge a toll leaving
a vertex in all possible ways or what
New York City does is charged a toll
entering the city in all possible ways
but those are examples of bond so for
example for g equals k 3 i show the
three vertex bonds they actually are
dependent you only need any two of them
but that defines the bond lattice for
that graph so the full equivalence is we
saw an example of moving by a real
multiple of a bond in the previous
example of an equivalence and built into
this whole picture because we're
coloring with our mod Z is anywhere
there's an integer you can move it to
another integer so if you add those two
statements together you actually get the
full equivalence group for this setting
which is RL plus Z to the N acts on our
to the e.r to the RN and to coloring
problems are equivalent if
they differ by an element of that group
so a coloring is simply and coloring
happens to actually be an element to
that group and then we're basically
comparing that subgroup to various
cosets of that subgroup so the problem
we're interesting and interested in is
we want to be calculating the L infinity
norm which means take the max of all
separations what is the distance from a
problem alpha to coloring beta where the
nfinity norm is induced from our end we
take all possible differences in any
coordinate in RN and take the max but we
want to build into this somehow the
equivalence that's determined by RL plus
Z to the N ok so we go back and say what
is the you know how do I translate this
back to ordinary color ability this is a
bit of algebra that we could say that a
target problem alpha is 2 over 1 minus
2r colorable if if you can get within
distance are uniformly on across all
coordinates for some beta which is a
valid coloring ok so I mean I guess the
the what I want to formalize this by
just defining the subgroup age to be
that group and I can restate everything
in terms of that subgroup that basically
what does it mean to be an age first of
all it's slightly it's closely related
to what the bond lattices in the first
place an element of age is a function as
a function on edges and it's a function
edges that sums not 20 but to an integer
around any cycle and in some sense this
is if it's easiest to think of this in
terms of the universal cover of
everything we've been doing when we fold
it and so we're saying that an element
of the space RN is 2 over 1 minus 2r
colorable if the distance to the nearest
point of H think of H is this you know
periodic set of subspaces the LNP
distanced a 228 nearest point of h is
less than equal to r and you can
rephrase that as the distance between
the coast at h alpha and h itself is
less than
you are and I want to define the
coloring Taurus T sub G to be our n mod
H using this induced metric ok so now I
let me answer your question ok there is
a lot of variation of this I mean I like
I mean remember learning deformation
theory all the cool things they did with
h1 of something or h2 of something so
one tends to look for this but I mean I
I I think this would be most useful for
generalizing this to other settings but
I don't know why one would do that I've
tried that basically um I want to view a
graph is just being a one-dimensional
simplicial complex and the fact that
I've chosen an arbitrary edge
orientation there's nothing special
about the directions of chosen four
edges that just need to make some
choices everywhere in order to do
calculations and we'll discuss that
later but that corresponds to orienting
the one simplest season the simplest of
complex and then the bond lattice that
we're studying before we can recognize
as being the image of the co boundary
map so if we want to calculate instead
of homology then we want to way of
lifting functions on vertices two
functions on edges and the way do that
is is Delta of F is defined on each edge
as being the difference of the values of
F between the two edges between the two
vertices that came from so that's used
to define the ordinary simplicial calm
ology of the simplicial complex so the
familiar cycles come out of that but
what we can do is you can use any group
you want to construct comala g and the
natural group to consider here is to
plug in our color values our color
values are the circle s 1 but thought of
as a group it's our mod Z so we can
write down the chain complex our mods e
to the v is mapped by the co boundary
map to our mudsy to the e and r mod z to
the e is really just our n mod z on
right we're because a Nazari is a number
of vertices we have and we're modding
that out by the image of the the real
image of the bond lattice so it's really
our first definition from before that
the coloring torus is simply h1 is the
first is it is simply h1 the the first
calm ology group of the graph with
coefficients in the color group so and
then of course the way in which we
talked about inducing the metric is you
minimize the distance between two cosets
taking the l infinity norm and there is
a distance measure which you can apply
directly to h1 that all works here so in
terms of original language you know the
distance between alpha 20 determines the
color ability of alpha and the general
the first problem we started with which
is what is the ordinary color ability of
a graph is the distance from the vector
one-half to the vector zero in this
space so now you could apply this to
other coloring groups it might be
interesting to go back to discrete
coloring groups and try this definition
I'm reminded that Rhoda tried hard to
prove the four color theorem not by
using I mean by using pairs of binary
colorings I mean I know if anyone's
remembers reading that stuff I never
really quite understood what he was
trying to do but you know it's it
suggests that possibly it could be of
interest to study different structures
besides a purely cyclical structure any
case you know if one plugs in a torus
and instead of coloring on when you
could iterate this you could actually
plug in the coloring Taurus itself here
and everything works formally and you
could i'm not sure whether there's
anything that would come out of that but
this coloring torus is it is a is a
general construction which we're using
in this one special case for circular
colorings
okay so let's do some examples so the
simplest example is where there's one
cycle so again I'm gonna take a Pentagon
and I want to just for the sake of
definiteness orient everything clockwise
and label the edge values x1 through x5
and what is our bond lattice well
there's we have two equivalent
formulations of the bond lattice we can
think of the bond lattice as you know
generated by the vertex bonds or we
could just take the condition that the
bond lattice is the set of integral
points in functions that sum to zero or
on any cycle well there is only one
cycle so functions that sum to zero
around this cycle is just functions that
you know some of the coordinates are 0
this is in other words L is the anti
diagonal hyperplane I mean it's easier
to picture it for the triangle it's just
the anti diagonal and we're looking at
before for the triangle so the coloring
torus is we take our n in this case it's
five space mod all integer translates of
that anti diagonal hyperplane so what
you get you to get closely spaced
together translates of the anti diagonal
hyperplane and a new mod RN out by that
subgroup you get as a quotient group a
circle which is which is covered by just
a single segment going from one
hyperplane to the next copy so in fact
in the middle of this of this slide here
i drawing you with the actual circle
looks like now I'm insisting that NB I
just to show you that in the odd case
that the ordinary coloring problem one
half is is as far as possible around the
circle from 0 as possible so I give
examples of you know what are various
representatives 40 basically any integer
point in our n mods out 20 in this
quotient and the point of all one have
slides out to the same point as one half
on all zeros because it's you know
like an even number halves adds up to
one I can slide around using bond using
bond moves and I can smooth this out
completely using blind moves and just
spread out that single value of a half
across all entries and make it 1 over 2n
1 over 2n over 1 over 2n so in fact we
know the distance in this it doesn't
feel yet like a l infinity norm because
we're only in one dimension all norms
pretty much look the same in one
dimension at least this kind of norm and
so we're only taking one difference it
looks like a circle where it's 1 over N
to go all the way around and 1 over 2n
to go halfway around so in fact for this
kind of graph the ordinary coloring
problem is the hardest coloring problem
there is and the answer in terms of
circular color ability is that an odd
graph is to n over n minus 1 colorable
notice the limit as n goes to infinity
that value approaches to so since these
are odd you can only three color an odd
graph using the ordinary definition but
if you tried it to color a graph you
almost get away with it imagine a
million vertex graph a million a million
gone you go ok red right red white red
white you get almost all around before
you get in trouble you know and the
discrete definition says you're screwed
I mean you were just what you do is
wrong whereas the continuous definition
says no no just take that little gap and
smooth it out and if you smooth it
router over if you smooth it out over
all n vertices then what you end up with
is what this is saying which is that um
that it's actually very close to two
colorable in the real sense now there's
another phenomena here which I want to
comes up again in the next slide which
is a well-known property of bond
lattices and psycho lattices which is
the cycle which would be the value 1
1111 on these edges is actually not the
next hyperplane it's actually five hyper
planes out ok so in other words a way of
saying this and if anyone could tell me
a reference for this i bred this various
places and i can't find it anywhere but
i mean it's a well-known fact among
people who study lattices
graphs is basically if you take the bond
lattice on a graph and add to it the
cycle lattice on the graph you get a
full dimensional lattice but one that is
finite index in the full lattice and
that index is well known to be the
number of spanning trees of the graph so
here we can get a spanning tree by
deleting any one of the five edges there
five spanning trees and sure enough the
the cycles give us index five in our
family of hyperplanes okay so the next
example is it's not an example we would
study for ordinary coloring so much but
becomes interesting in this case we
notice you generally leave out self
loops and multiple edges when you're
doing coloring problems in the ordinary
case but this definition makes perfect
sense de least ask well what's going on
if we allow multiple edges so this is
sort of this is dual to a triangle you
could also say we're studying flows on
the triangle so that's where this these
intuitions would come in helpful so dual
to the triangle we have three parallel
edges from the bottom vertex to the top
vertex and now the bond lattice now it's
easier to think in terms of vertex bonds
all but one generates so there's two so
all the one is just one of them so we
take one vertex bond which is let's have
the value who be one on each edge going
up from the bottom that generates the
bond ladder so bond lattice is 111 so my
picture is I have our three with this
diagonal line in it but then I have all
ended your translates that of that
diagonal line and if I squash all
integer translates that diagonal line
bought out by this I basically collapse
our three two are too and I get this
triangular pattern or hexagonal pattern
how good I think it looks like a sphere
packing of each of those lines quotients
to a point and again I've drawn in blue
the the lines that correspond to cycles
and I've drawn in red the rest of the
lines and you'll notice that the cycles
our index 3 and all the lines it's
another example that same
phenomena there are now three spanning
trees to this graph knock out any one of
the three edges and but from our point
of view all it's not simply the cycles
that matter it's it's ZN you know modulo
this URL so what I'm looking at since
it's harder to describe I can't simply
draw you a circle again but the easiest
way to picture the two-dimensional
coloring torus is via its Universal
cover so this is what I've drawn here is
as a and the lower left is a big portion
of the universal cover of the coloring
Taurus and in the on the right blow-up
of a couple of vertices or the coloring
Taurus so each dot is the same origin
we're basically taking the we
constructed the tourist by modding out
by a mixed group it had a continuous
component of vector space component and
a discrete component I prefer to think
about all tour I as being our some
vector space modulo just a purely
discrete group so that's the picture we
have here when you think the universal
cover is that we take that plane are 2
modulo that discrete group which is the
dots and that is the coloring torus so
what happens you know how can we think
of this metric this is a polyhedral
metric upstairs we have little cubes
around things and the univ all is
replaced by a unit cube but now that
unit cube is being quotient addai agonal
line and so what happens we take a cube
and you squash it within 2 antipodal
points getting brought to the same point
a unit cube squashes to a hexagon so in
fact what you see in grey here our
hexagons our hexagons which are
expanding unit balls around each of
these origins and what we end up with is
a voronoi diagram so the hexagons going
the other way which are in green are the
region boundaries where there's a
hexagon of points which are closest to a
given origin in the universal
and you can so this midpoint here is the
closest point between these two vertices
but it's still much closer to either
these vertices then going on so we end
up with is interesting idea which is the
antipode which is in you can look in a
coloring Taurus and instead of asking
for a particular known problem you want
to solve ask what are the worst problems
for this graph it may not be a unique
worst problem in general this polyhedral
metrics we very convoluted and
complicated and there'll be many many
pockets which are further like like
there's a place between the Earth Sun
and Moon where gravity stops and dust
actually collects there through many
many pockets in these in these Universal
covers where your equidistant from a
bunch of points and those are going to
be the hardest coloring problems so this
particular case I've drawn an example
where you take the line from here here
you can see that a third of the way up
is the pocket and would that translate
what that translates to is a target
value of zero a third and two thirds and
there's just no way to make that target
particularly happy right I mean whatever
you big is basically because any
coloring of this graph has to some 20
around every cycle which is basically
the same thing as saying it has to be
some multiple of the generator vowel
which means we're going to give the same
value in all three edges so it's
basically the coloring problem
simplifies to pick a number and get as
close as possible to zero a third and
two thirds you know I mean so
okay so as I said I prefer not to think
in the total space where I'm modding out
by both a vector space and a discrete
group I would much rather understand
more generally what this collapsed cube
looks like in each of these in my
coloring tourists Universal cover so it
turns out that the answer is closely
related to Minty's theorem which keeps
coming up partly because what Minty's
theorem really is if you're a fan of
oriented Metroid duality I mean it's
really a it's a simple application of
Metroid duality is why it seems to come
up in lots of cases but minty was
interested specifically in ordinary co
em colorings of vertices of graphs and
he proved in 62 that a one criterion for
a graph being M colorable is that there
be a way of assigning edge orientations
so that as you went around every cycle
and looked you know how many edges are
going the wrong way how many edges going
the right way that the the ratio is
fairly balanced by which he means say
you're trying to for color a graph and
you enter on a cycle with eight edges
then at least two have to point forwards
and at least two have to point backwards
or another that's at least a quarter of
all edges have to point forwards at
least a quarter of all legends at the
point backwards and you need such an
edge orientation for all cycles in your
graph and that's equivalent to there
being a for coloring and M coloring of
the graph so for people to study
hyperplane arrangements this is a
familiar pattern or generalized as a
familiar pattern I want to go back to my
very first slide where I showed ordinary
colorings of K 3 and now I want to pick
an origin and just look around you know
look at the chamber structure around
that origin the plane in which these
triangulation appears is the plane of
functions that sum to zero their other
edge functions they sum to zero on
around cycles but their edge functions
so that each chamber near the origin is
that since it's a chamber is a sign
assign to each edge it's what whether
that function is positive or negative on
that edge and we can compare that sign
to the reference orientation of we
needed a reference orientation to make
calculations and what we effectively can
do is we can look at each corner near
the Oregon and from that just write down
an orientation of the graph which is
like the street address and may Troi
pirie sense of that corner of that
chamber and you'll notice if you do this
for this example that you only get six
edge orientations you don't get all
eight the two that are missing are the
two cyclic orientations okay so so the
well known phenomena for hyperplane
arrangements of this sort is that your
your non empty chamber is if you make a
central arrangement instead of periodic
change arrangement are precisely the a
cyclic orientations in your graph and so
what is an a cyclic orientation well
basically in ninties language is simply
a way of assigning directions to every
edge so that are on any cycle there's at
least some edge going the wrong way on
the right way you can't have all the
edges going the same way so minty serum
is like a quantification of making that
more precise instead of saying there's
got to be at least one edge each way you
say there's going to be at least one
over m edges each way so generalizing
the idea that the non empty chamber is
Miss arrangement or a cyclic
orientations the fat chambers that
actually contain lots of colorings are
the well balanced orientations okay so
again I'm temporarily flicking a switch
and turning off the + Z to the N if you
remember I definition of the coloring
Taurus was demott out by RL plus Z to
the N I'm flicking that off as if I'm
working in the you know just to get the
metric what I want to do is understand
this one effect which is what does the
metric look out look like when I'm not
out by RL so upstairs before i mought
out by RL if i have a point alpha and i
want to know how close is it to the line
RL
well I can probe that question by making
a box of radius R so it goes from alpha
minus R to alpha plus our in each
coordinate and then I want to ask does
that box intersect the subspace RL or
not okay so this is going to turn out to
get Mickey's theorem among other things
so basically you know a knee-jerk
reaction for anyone trained in
polyhedral comet or x would be Farkas
lemma here which is that you know either
the box intersects RL or we can separate
the box from RL using a hyperplane okay
so to formalize that slightly better we
might as well you know choose a linear
functional that vanishes on RL and then
the way we stating that is either the
box intersects RL or I can find a linear
functional vanishing on RL that is
strictly positive on the box that's
really saying the same thing then just
take the linear functional equals
epsilon and there is your original
hyperplane okay what happens that we
know what these linear functionals are
in this case because RL is defined by
the vanishing of the cycle sums so any
linear functional vanishing on RL the
coordinates we want to be using here are
just going to be sums of cycles it's a
linear combination of cycle sums now the
cycle sums have a have a an important
property there the actually the circuits
of a matrix and in other words you can
you can picture them as being all
minimal intersections with the
coordinate planes of some subspace or
more familiar language for toric people
I mean since the matrix in question is
unimodular this is actually the graver
basis of other matrix but in particular
what's a take-home message what you
really need to know about it is not only
can you express any of the linear
functionals we care about as a
combination of cycle sums
we can actually do so conformally in
other words first take your linear
functional and jiggle it so that it's
nonzero on every edge then you can break
it down into a sum of cycles with that
sign pattern for every single cycle okay
now moreover since it's a cube lined up
with the coordinates once we have a sign
pattern in mind you know for our
original linear functional we can
canonically decide for any functional
with that sign pattern what is the
lowest vertex just you know core edge
but you know side coordinate x
coordinate just look at the sign it say
okay let's go low not high that picks
out a corner a corner of the cube so
basically for any linear functional in
that space in that worth it it's going
to have a minimum value on that corner
of that the given chosen corner of the
cube which we decided is the smallest
the minimum corner of the cube so now if
you have a conformal some of things like
this and the sum is positive at least
one of the pieces of the somme has to be
positive so what if it is found you
found a cycle that is positive on that
vertex but it has the same sign pattern
we started with so it's even bigger and
all the other vertices so we have a
cycle which separates the cube from the
from RL so we end up with a very clean
description of how to tell whether a
cube meets RL or not either the are but
our ball around alpha meets RL or some
cycle is strictly positive on the air
ball okay so if you're zoning this is
this is a place you could just start
from scratch I love this problem just as
its own as its own problem but if you
like little linear programming problems
here is a puzzle you have a graph you
have intervals of valid values you're
allowed to sign to each edge can you
come up with a choice of values from
each of these intervals with a property
that it sums 20 or
every cycle now in terms of our previous
language you can imagine making a
rectangular box by taking the product of
these intervals and then I'm asking does
that rectangular box intersect RL that's
really saying the same thing so what we
found from before is that near exists a
solution to any such you know restricted
linear program like this if and only if
the mid kowski some around each cycle
contains the origin though it's yeah so
that's the form in which we want to bill
use this and and here we take the
Minkowski summer on the outer cycle and
we get 3 comma 7 which doesn't contain
the origin the outer cycle another way
of saying that in terms of the previous
proof as the outer cycle separates the
separates the cube from RL so actually
to go back to Minty's theorem how does
this relate the mentees theorem well
I've been saying we tried the coloring
correspondence to the distance to
one-half one-half one-half one-half
one-half and you can apply this
criterion to find the distance of
one-half one-half one-half one-half but
one half is an arbitrary vector because
it depends on our arbitrary choice of
sign of orientation on the graph so we
go back and do what minty wanted us to
do and try all possible orientations on
the edges of the graph and then go back
and again measure distance using this
rule and you'll get a NM coloring if
this rule ever gets us you know close
enough by this definition so let's apply
this to our problem we want to find out
what we're going to when alpha is within
our of RL so I make a unit I make a
radius our ball around alpha by taking
intervals alpha minus our comma alpha
plus R on each edge and the box
intersects RL if the minkowski sum
contains zero around each cycle but I
can do the makowski some out and I get
this this expression here and you know
when it clean up that expression I
basically get scale
old cycle sums so the polyhedral metric
that we saw on examples before is always
has its fast that's given by cycles of
the graph and the scaling is you have to
scale by the length of each cycle and
then just take the sum of the values in
those edges that scaling means we leave
unimodular T which makes the problem
much harder but this is a complete
description of the metra they're
complete self-contained description of
the metric on the coloring Taurus where
we can work directly on the torus or its
Universal cover and forget the
scaffolding we're working in functions
on RN ok so the special case I'm
interested in is planar graphs there's
been some developments recently I mean
the first computer proof drew suspicion
in many ways but just because it's so
complicated people didn't know whether
to wonder about the code or wonder about
everything else but you know people
believe it now and believe it now in
part because it was redone in 96 by
Robertson Sanders Seymour and Thomas and
they came up with far fewer cases to
consider still something like on the
order of 800 cases not something one
could really do by hand even on an hour
commute somewhere but in the subway you
know every day for years it's just that
you know it's if one did you have
checked in under cases you wouldn't
really feel that you understood the
problem what's interesting is that these
cases the approach in both of these is
similar and related to an idea that's
close to hundred years old there's a new
work I'm not sure if everyone's even
heard of it by gunfire and Werner in
2004 there's a theorem prover a proof
assistant called developed inria
Sofia and typically I think they do a
lot of great stuff like the programming
language of camel and the idea is that a
totally new proof they walked through a
mechanical this is like the
formalization of mathematics except that
needs a lot of help from us they
actually were to walk through from first
axioms a proof that the computer could
check its way to long for human being to
read and check but a human being
basically program
this proof which the computer checked
and there was an interactive process for
they tried things and it's just like
analogous to writing more efficient code
one writes more efficient you know
action basis and then it goes further
and the reason that people find this
more satisfactory at least those who do
is because this same system has been
used to check many things it's not like
you have to believe in code that was
written once to prove one theorem didn't
have a bug in it you can believe that if
there was a bug in this code it might
not have come up in this application but
maybe somebody would have found it in a
different application okay well i mean i
would i would like a human
understandable proof for actually let me
be more concrete i would like a proof I
can understand I mean this yes this
distinction came up you know like proof
for the gym a tradition conjecture their
combinatorial apologists who don't
really understand that proof for example
right any case of looking at the
coloring Taurus the first conjecture I
would like to make and I find this as a
prizing one is the point half half half
in the coloring Taurus just one of many
points with denominator a quarter and I
believe that every point with the
nominator quarter is for colorable
bloody definition have made in fact that
relates to a stronger observed empirical
pattern be very precise what I believe
is true I believe that it's certainly
established the coloring the radius the
coloring tourists can be greater than a
quarter I mean it'd be nice to have a
little pigeon hole principle where the
reason the four color theorem is true is
there wasn't enough room you know but
that fails badly i mean the coloring
tourists for planar graphs can be nearly
a third what i believe is the case is
only the third in the limit you could
have an infinite graph if you could
define it right would be a third and for
any finite graph you can have points
which are nearly a third away from the
origin but there's a bizarre numerology
to what's to the denominators of the
points that get closer to a third this
is like an astronomers data I mean they
stare at the dress Tron owners will look
at some output from some computer
analysis and some radio waves and then
say
you know the universe does this and i
wish i had an astronomer to tell me what
this means because it doesn't work for
two and three but starting with for it
kicks in and the pattern is you can
predict exactly the furthest you can get
away by back solving this 56 times
one-thirds gives us 5 18 the distance
that six torsion points are away i mean
one could imagine attempting a proof
along the lines of you know every every
antipode has the following structure and
you know the trip through for torsion
point to the antipode we multiply it by
4 it just looks like the original trip
you know that almost explains these
numbers but it's not quite that simple I
mean for example so I have ideas why
this might be true but I wanted to
present the basic picture and I don't
know why it's true but i believe it is
true so thank you
Oh
alright yeah hope they do if you comment
a bit on what the situation is for
infinite graphs
no um could you repeat the question it
would help if I knew it first because
you had his characterization result and
said that all the
the rationals can hitch
yes OIC ok so you want to know the
question is whether there is work on
infinite graphs and refraction and
circular color ability you call PQ color
ability right right I I heard that I
thought whoa situation where you have
are there situation for you where
think about irrational
ah
okay so the question has to do with
whether one could construct an infinite
graph that whose circular credibility
might be irrational oh yes right and in
fact that's I mean for connected you
mean for strongly connected graphs I
mean what makes it so hard to prove
coloring theorems is that it's not a
particularly local phenomena but at
least you can group clunk chunk it up
like that if you yes you he's giving a
good example if you have disconnected
graph just take a family approaching
some plain but for a say three connected
planar graph which way I think be a
reasonable place to ask for an infinite
version of a three connected planar
graph you know could one isolate the
obstructions and sell them together I
would think that you would be what you
would be able to fix that I mean I think
you would just be able to take you know
take my guess would be yes any other
question
I did not let's take our stage again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
