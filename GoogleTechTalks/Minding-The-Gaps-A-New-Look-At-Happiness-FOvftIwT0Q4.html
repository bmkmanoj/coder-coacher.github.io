okay so I'd like to share a brilliant
idea one that I thought was crazy until
I tried it myself and it took a tragedy
for me to even consider it you see about
six years ago I bought a motorcycle 5.9
something years ago I crashed that
motorcycle and broke my neck now the
idea is not to break your neck that part
kind of sucked but something really
awesome came out of it
see I felt like I had a second shot at
life and I wanted to do something
positive with it something useful and I
wasn't a particularly unhappy person but
I'm I love growing as a person and I've
heard of this thing called meditation
and I didn't really think it was all
that interesting I mean how can just
sitting there do anything for you but
science are starting to show that maybe
there's something to it and besides what
else can you do while you're in a neck
brace so I said what the hell I'll try
it so at some point I gather the result
to do about 15 minutes a day for a few
weeks and I'm going home to visit my
parents now my parents have this
interesting ability to get under my skin
so at some point we're having a heated
argument except somehow I'm not getting
heated so my dad turns flabbergasted to
my mom and he says what happened to our
son that's when I first figured out that
there may be something to this and so I
gathered the courage to do a one-week
retreat and I thought that was
fascinating enough that I took off three
months or I'm sorry actually that's when
I quit my job at amazon.com to go do it
for three months in a monastery in the
Colorado Rockies now I think some people
wondered about me like young guy so much
to live for
and he's going to retreat from the world
and so I called it an expedition
following the advice of my first teacher
Alan Wallace and that expedition changed
my life so I'm doing it again this time
by taking some time off work
and it's not to relax or find myself
it's to deepen my understanding of an
idea that I'm pretty sure is going to
save the world see most of the time you
hear about this idea from people who
sound like this maybe they are bearing
orange robes and looking very spiritual
now I don't mean to be mean people like
that but I feel like a lot of times we
in the West don't really relate to
people like that I am an engineer I want
to know why things work and I also like
to explain why and how they work so
that's what I'm gonna do here and I'll
begin by sharing with you the ancient
secrets of Tibet okay you ready
first one is pay attention second when
you notice that you're not paying
attention pay attention now this doesn't
sound so hard but how are you supposed
to notice that you're not paying
attention if you're not paying attention
and the answer is you have to explicitly
check now you're probably used to doing
this while you are reading for example
you're reading and then at some point
you notice your eyes are still scanning
the page remindes doing something else
and you checking it oh I meant to be
reading but when you're walking down the
street there seems to be no incentive to
check in fact what would you even check
you're not trying to concentrate but
there is something you can focus on you
could focus on the present moment so I
want you to go ahead and try this you
also on on video there focus on the
feeling of being present okay
got it that's awareness now meditation
is like babysitting that awareness you
see you have to keep a close eye on it
because the instant you look away it
wanders off in other words as
you are continuously attending to your
sense of being present
you are aware if you stop for even an
instant you become unaware even though
you don't realize it so between the time
you look away and look back there is
this gap that's almost impossible to
notice and this is the first take away
there are many gaps in your awareness
that you won't detect or even believe
without a great deal of practice in fact
I think you could go an entire lifetime
without ever suspecting these gaps or
that they exist and I think that people
who regularly do so what goes on in
these gaps seems harmless enough
for example have you ever noticed
yourself integrating your life like
you're walking down the street and
commenting those are some pretty shoes
whenever my black shoes went that dog
has a poopy tail or maybe you're
reliving the past or pre living the
future or maybe you're repeating the
same thought churning on it over and
over again you could be at a romantic
dinner worried about work you could be
at work thinking about a romantic dinner
and what I want to get across is that
none of these thoughts are actually bad
it's just that they almost always happen
in these gaps of awareness now why does
this matter
well these gaps are where awareness goes
sorry where happiness goes to die so
I'll say that again because I fumbled it
and in case you were zoned out when you
are babysitting your awareness and you
stop for any amount of time there's a
gap there chasm a dark alley where
happiness goes to die now they've known
about this for a long time in the east
and we're just starting to figure it out
in the West there was a paper published
a couple of years ago at Harvard titled
a wandering mind is an unhappy mind so I
came back from the monastery and it
occurred to me that I had been absent
for most of my life you know sort of
like an absentee father but an absentee
self so I resolved to actually be
present more often and I found in those
gaps revolutionized my perspective on
human nature so let's view this through
the eyes of a man named Johnny you see
poor Johnny is being dragged to the
Opera by his mean wife so he goes to put
on his tuxedo and notices that his diet
hasn't quite been working so he beats
himself up a little
quit hitting yourself Johnny quit
hitting yourself they get in the car and
he starts worrying because they're
running a little bit late then the
stoplight in front of him has the GALT
turn red and he finds himself mentally
cursing it finally they get to the Opera
and it starts and man this is boring I
mean it's not me this board it's the
Opera that is boring so he can't help
but feel a little bit resentful towards
his wife who is the cause of all these
problems now Johnny sounds like a bit of
a head case doesn't he I mean who gets
mad at red lights but the thing is
Johnny doesn't want to be an annoyed
bored fat resentful man I mean can you
imagine so the trouble is nobody's ever
given him clear instructions on fixing
it so he's been bumbling around for his
whole life growing up his mother used to
tell him things like Johnny don't cry
over spilt milk and young Johnny's like
okay how do I do that and his mom's like
mm-hmm implementation details see his
mother's a PM not an engineer and now
that he's grown people tell him to just
chill out or like go take a meditation
class or something as though he has time
for that crap when there is so much
worrying to get done but you see today
is
lucky day because we're gonna strike him
with a lightning bolt of awareness and
rewind his day okay so he starts putting
on his tuxedo and notices that he's
about to beat himself up so he pauses
and he makes a note to change his diet
exercise more great then he finds
himself about to curse a red light he's
like huh I was about to yell at a light
for being red so he gets to the Opera
and and he still can't quite figure out
what his wife loves about the Opera but
he doesn't feel like blaming her for his
emotions you see he remembers the last
time he remembers what happened the last
time he did that and Johnny doesn't like
the doghouse so slowly Johnny discovers
that every single negative emotion that
pops up is whispering to him beckoning
Johnny you need me how are you going to
remember to pay the bills if you're not
anxious so he thinks how am I going to
remember ah thank you come again and so
it slowly dawns on Johnny this is what
mines do this is the source of almost
all of my suffering and that's why I
hurt other people huh I wonder if this
happens to anybody else so he starts
looking around at the rest of the world
my god this explains everything
none of these people want to suffer in
fact deep down none of them want to hurt
each other and yet Wow so he makes a
resolution what if I spend less time on
blame and outrage and more time helping
I don't know exactly how yet but I've
got all the
time and energy and passion now and I
hurt less and I need less so now if this
all sounds like magic well yes it is
because we've struck them with a
lightning bolt of awareness but if you
had a tool that allows you to see inside
of those gaps
who knows what you'd find I'm just
sharing with you what I found because
Johnny isn't a fictional character so
here at last is that implementation
detail awareness is the missing piece
that allows you to apply knowledge when
you need it by the way you may have
heard of a skill called mindfulness it's
a skill that's at the heart of the
leading therapies for a lot of things
pain anxiety depression addiction panic
obsessive compulsive disorder I mean the
list goes on and on and on and if you've
heard of this before you may have
thought what kind of black magic is this
and it's not black magic it's based on a
very simple idea that if you want to fix
a problem don't wait three seconds
don't wait three minutes do it now and
now and now and now and now so before I
conclude I want to address one common
concern and that is that sometimes
people feel I am aware of my anger while
I'm yelling I'm fully aware first I'd
argue that you're not fully aware but
you know close enough so I'm fully aware
while I'm yelling but somehow I can't
seem to stop myself and what I want to
say is that these are deeply ingrained
habits and it takes some time to loosen
them even with the awareness but here's
a hint that may help you may have
noticed at some point in your life that
you are not your body and you you have a
body you could say you experience a body
but you are not your body similarly you
are not sure
thoughts you experience thoughts you are
not your emotions but you experience
them too so if you can't be any of the
things you are experiencing then what
are you it's kind of a mystery I'll let
you think of that one on your own but
notice that even though we are not any
of those things we commonly identify
with them throughout the day and this
makes life much harder if you can
instead identify with the awareness that
is having all of these experiences
things start getting a little easier so
now I'd like to recap the main themes
here one anytime you are not babysitting
your awareness of the present moment
like a hawk it wanders off almost
immediately and leaves a gap and unless
you've trained like a ninja in detecting
those gaps yeah kind of hard to find
second in those gaps our minds like to
fight complain worry and blame
that's where annoyance and boredom come
from and as an aside if you find that
you're easily annoyed or bored today if
you were to win the lottery
you'd be an easily bored and annoyed
lottery winner you just be bored and
annoyed with shinier fancier things you
may have heard of research showing that
lottery winners don't become happier
this gives a hint as to why okay so
number three is if you fill in those
gaps you have a much cleaner shot at
happiness because you can see and fix
the obstacles in real-time and as a side
effect everyone else starts making more
sense for the practice of closing those
gaps is known as meditation this is the
skill that allows you to apply your
knowledge in real time and turn it into
wisdom by the way what does not work is
just deciding I am going to be a more
aware person from here on out yeah it's
a skill you have to practice it you
could take classes for example I teach
classes here or at least I will when I
again when I come back from retreat and
there are some others so go to go slash
meditation if your internal and look for
resources so I also promise that this
idea could save the world and I've
already given some hints as to why
that's true when you see in marvelous
detail all of the suffering that your
mind is been putting you through it
becomes impossible to not care more
about yourself and other people so you
may have heard this quote it's
attributed to Plato at least the
internet seems to think it came from
Plato where he says be kind for everyone
you meet is fighting a great battle and
the more you practice awareness the more
that idea stays with you at all times
the result is more compassion for
yourself and others and that results in
more action and kind of cleaner action
better results and so our usual approach
is to tackle problems independently
energy crisis consumerism obesity but
the better you understand the real
source of all of these problems the more
obvious it becomes that the only way to
win this endless game of whack-a-mole is
by one way give people a tool that makes
them healthier and happier and has the
side effect of helping them care more
all other solutions are band-aids by
comparison so the next time you're
reading a book and you find the your
eyes are scan the page in your mind is
doing something else and you notice this
and you wonder where was I try to
appreciate that mystery where were you
the answer to that question stands to
change everything thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
