us my name is Craig Cornelius I'm a
member of the International engineering
group and I'm pleased to introduce you
to several members of the Cherokee
Nation about almost two years ago I had
a chance meeting with a member of the
Cherokee Nation taking him to a camp and
I mentioned that I was at Google he
mentioned that oh we have people in our
company who'd like to make connections
with Google because we've been doing a
lot with trying to preserve our language
and we'd love to have Google help us
work on Google's tools for the Cherokee
Nation and the Cherokee language that
led to a collaboration over the last
year and a half we have as of March of
this year a version of Google web search
in the Cherokee language and I think
you'll learn an awful lot about the tech
the way the Cherokee Nation has used
technology we have three visitors today
Joseph herb Roy Bonnie and Jeff Edwards
and they will tell you a lot about how
the Cherokee Nation is using technology
to keep their culture alive and vibrant
for centuries to come I don't see oh my
god see oh honey Google people of Google
hello
oh you can't hear me okay I'll squeeze
it closer maybe my volume yeah we're
going is that better
I see Oh Joseph herb Aquadome Joseph is
what they call me I guess you say it
we're from the Cherokee Nation we are a
new department even though we'll talk a
little bit quick brief summary of the
history and then what we've done with
technology in the last few years and I
think it'll be interesting because it'll
show you a different side of a take of
Technology and a culture in communities
that went from having different hype
stages of Technology so you'll you'll
see that Cherokee people have actually
embraced technology for hundreds of
years and so we'll start with that with
some of our slides here and then we'll
get into some of the advancements we've
made with Google and how it's important
for us to actually continue as a people
to address these technology needs
because of what occurs with language
loss and cultural loss if you don't if
you don't localize make your communities
in your language so hello my name is Roy
and the Joseph said we're a new
department that were the language
technology program at Cherokee Nation
and now I know what we do basically is
we find that technology solutions for
our language and you know we have a
unique written language which we'll talk
about here this first slide is an image
of the historical boundaries of the
Cherokee Nation you can see it's got the
outline the blue the red and the green
that show us how it shrunk over the
years as a westward expansion occurred
you know the United States history so
that's something a map showing that so
what happened is a you know the
Cherokees we were in the first groups
that actually made a lot of who made
treaties with England and all this we
were when the earliest documented travel
nations in the United States because we
we had this back and forth for
relationship this image here is an image
if they called her three kings
these were three turkey ambassadors that
were sent to England to negotiate some
terms with the king at the time but we
show this the show they have you know
the Cherokee Nation has been around
quite some time even before the United
States itself and we've always been you
know educated people and we always try
to keep ahead of you know what's going
on and this is Sequoia Sequoia is
significant Cherokee history because
he's the one that created the written
language of the Cherokees we've had the
spoken language but we did not have the
written form so he created a syllabary
in the sample of that is right below
Sequoyah in Cherokee so Sequoia came up
with the handwriting system of the
Cherokee syllabary in 1805 he was
working on it
I give the men 8 18 teens but he had
several problems at the time people
weren't accepting of it they've had you
know as it was a lofty pursuit and maybe
when half owner shouldn't happen for
various reasons but around 1820 he had
finally finalized the idea of what it
would be and he simplified the unit's
simplify it but he he broke down the
entire language into 85 characters so
this image here shows the original
handwritten syllabary by Sequoia and you
can see there's two two versions here if
you think in the first part one looks
like a cursive writing and next to it
you see like this personal thick and a
little R next to it kind of that's
showing how much it's a handmade cursive
to the typeface and we'll talk a bit
more about that in a second but this
chart shows a comparison of the two this
was adopted by the Cherokee Nation
Council in 1821 so what happened is
during this time of history we had the
recall at the removal era in which the
United States adopted the policy of
removing the Indians from the east and
moving to the toward the west so what
was going on is the Cherokee Nation
needed to combat this idea somehow so
the writing system was part of that and
so we adopted you know the handwritten
version that sequoia did as you can see
here this the cursive they simplified to
that to the metal typeface so we
established a printing press in the
1820s there's an image of one of the
presses that's actually in telecoil
Oklahoma now yes for the Cherokee Nation
is based now you can come through a
museum and see the printing press there
there's some images of the the middle
type so if you deal with a lot of type
you know how tiny those things are
below it is an image of the typeface
taken from the original press itself you
can see it was greatly modified from the
handwritten to this as you know the
nature of that adapt ation and so this
is the typeface that we bound up with
we've had the same typeface since the
1820s until recently when we stole this
is the base model but we're just now
getting to the point we can do
sans-serif typefaces and that type of
thing with the Cherokee language this
image here is the actually the first
instance of Cherokee in print you can
see it right there's the first few
verses of the book of Genesis from the
Bible this was printed in 1827 and so a
couple of months later where is it
close-up of it the printing press was
established with the relationship
between the Cherokee Nation in the
American Board of foreign missionaries
and what they were you know the goal was
to you know be missionaries to the
Cherokee Nation but in part of that
process they helped develop the printing
press and the Cherokee Nation contracted
with a foundry in Boston called the
grille foundry that actually made the
typeface letters themselves but this is
the first time that was ever printed it
was in her newsletter to their
supporters in the eighteen hundreds or
1827 and this here is the result of all
that the Cherokee Nation wanted to print
a newspaper so this is the Cherokee
Phoenix and that was the first issue was
printed in 1828 and this isn't the first
issue but they all look like this pretty
much it's a printed in English and in
Cherokee and at the time you know this
was a very it was a first Native
American language newspaper ever printed
and is still printed today but it was
used to as kind of like a like I said a
PR piece they inform everyone including
Cherokees and everyone else in the
United States of what was happening what
their removal policy in Washington she
wanted to remove the Cherokees and other
tribes from their home
so the interesting thing about it is
that uh not only did it circulate here
in the continental US it also made its
way to Europe at the time and that
created a very animus of our language in
Europe so our language itself the
written version has been like studied
ever since people have always had a
fascination with it yeah it's it's a
rare accomplishment for a single person
to come with a writing system so
Sequoias become sort of a like a big
hero you know mythological figure almost
though we'll get back to this point but
later of why that's important to us so
this is um what's exciting is that even
though we weren't successful in keeping
our land and we were shoved out by the
United States but during that we wanted
a Supreme Court people don't realize
that the United States Supreme Court
said we didn't have to move but Andrew
Jackson did so we ended up getting moved
and this is a shot we produced a film a
few years back and this is a little
screen shot of it in front of a map and
it shows you where we ended up today
after the removal was one of the first
things as we did the printing press and
what was neat is that we rebuilt our
society and one of the things we started
with is education
and in education we educated men and
women which was unusual at the time
because if you know we think of equal
rights and can you imagine in the 1800's
Cherokees paid women the same as men we
educated all the women and men from 6
years old to 21
we had 61 schools and two universities
and this is one of the most leading
cutting edges you know you know
education systems in the world because
we educated the entire population for
free so we had printing presses back
then we make books materials some
religious some academic so all this
occurred and technology still advanced
Cherokees were the first to have a
telephone west of the Mississippi so we
were actually taking
logically were more advanced and you
think well what what would make people
that still advance like this even though
we were 80 to 90% literate compared to
the thirteen percent of whites at the
time why would you want to care about
this new technology that came out why
would we were an early adopter so people
came in salesmen like they do with the
Steel's of the day at Cherokee Nation
and they got these two guys that would
test the technology or Iran Accord
and these guys had a conversation and
they tried to discuss who are they going
to get it the reason they did is that
this one statement is if they wanted to
get it would they this is the reason
they got it
Thaksin Cherokee if you can use the
technology in your language it's your
technology it's not a white technology
it's it's not a you know a German
technology or Korean technology it's
your technology when your language is
utilized in it so we had the first
telephones and this guy I don't know if
you guys know who will Rogers is but he
was a mixed-blood Cherokee and his
technology was the radio and he was a
satirist which if you know anything
about Cherokee we we like to laugh a lot
and he made a lot of jokes and teased
about political stuff he was like a lot
of comedians today joking about politics
and all and he brought a lot of
awareness of Cherokee people back then
and so he also used technology for us
and that was really early on he bought
radios for Cherokee schools and stuff so
they'd be aware again adopting the
latest technology before other people
yeah well as you can see here this is a
tap router and it just kind of shows
that you know throughout history the
Cherokees have continued to keep up with
technology I believe this one's around
1970 little earlier than that and so
just throughout history they continued
to keep on top of technology and that's
a really neat piece to see there
and that's just a document that was
tapped up on the top writer I guess in
March of 1917 and then this was just
kind of more of the paper going over to
Europe and it kind of preserved our
language but going over there because it
kept it documented in capital lives like
a Michener majuli we bring this up
because that unique radian the paper
making his way to Europe creating an
awareness of our language you know
internationally and that's held through
ever since and this slide here is taking
the from you of the the topographer
Herman's out if you deal with a lot of
funds lost you know who this guy is he
was working on a Cherokee font back in
the 70s
unfortunately this font never quite made
it out but this is an example of how you
know people have always been interested
in the Cherokee language and it helped
us out a lot what happened is this here
is one of the first Cherokee fonts
designed by actual Cherokee speakers
this is from around 1991 92 again you
can see it's based on that old typeface
that's slightly modified but it's got
the basic elements of it there the and
this particular slide is showing this is
a by June Tuesday or Tuesday I suppose
she was a student at Yale and she got a
grant to make a Cherokee typeface of
fawns and this is why she came up with
and this model was based on that earlier
trot we showed you and the Cherokee
Nation uses as a model for the the font
that we had for around 2000 the Cherokee
Nation came out with this own font and
that's what it looked like and you know
it it was good in the sense that we had
a Cherokee font that at least we could
type up documents in the week it was
like a fancy typewriter at the time we
just get
in print it's all we could do it was not
Unicode compliant because it was map to
English characters I'm like the keyboard
so it looks Cherokee but technically
it's not in that you know if we wanted
to use technology other than just your
printing stuff out we were still just
kind of stuck in the air until we came
up with Unicode but this is an image of
Cherokee Nation headquarters Intelli
claw and this we don't actually work in
that building warehouses elsewhere but
that's where we used to be but uh yeah
well you and switch okay and 2003 the
Cherokee Nation did a language survey of
our language and they found that less
than 10% of people under the age of 40
were fluent so we kind of went back in
history again where we educated everyone
we we started at school Jolla gay Junod
a low-cost ii is the name that's a
turkey school and we currently have
around 90 students three and four year
old all the way up to sixth grade and
our students all have one-to-one Mac
laptops and our languages supported on
Mac and unfortunately with having a
turkey school there you can't just go to
the store and buy a Cherokee material so
everything has to be made in-house so we
really had to get busy pretty quick we
wanted our students at the school to
basically have everything that a you
know an English school would have so we
just started getting with our
translators and creating this stuff and
so we're trying to give them everything
that you would have at an English school
except in Cherokee this is of an older
about a sixth grade document there
that's the digestive system and it's
kind of gross looking but they need to
learn it I guess and so we have a lot of
fun making this stuff because you know
it's never been made before and so and
of course we have the solar system and
you know where the planets are at and of
course there's the United States again
all this stuff we just have to make and
and when we adopted Unicode it made it a
lot easier to make this stuff because
someone could work on it and we could
send it to someone else and they could
work on it and before it didn't really
work that way so and
this is just one of our students before
we had computers at the school you know
they've got the old pencil and paper and
it's taken a really long time and now
that they have their computers it's a
lot you know a lot better process and
what we're going to show you here is a
little animation that we made we're
competing with Spongebob and Dora the
Explorer and all these stuff in English
and so we have to try to figure out ways
to you know keep the kids engaged and
keep them in the language because once
the kids leave our school
not very many of the parents are formant
and so once they leave school they go
back into an English world and so what
we're trying to do is create stuff for
them outside of school to keep them you
know in Turkey thoughts so this is a
little animation we made for them is
that too bad on that and now this is the
turkey nation non unicode font and this
has been around I'm not really for sure
how long I guess
yeah 99 mm and this was our first font
that we actually had where we were able
to type it served a purpose because you
know our language we could use it on a
computer but like Roy said before it was
more or less pop it up and printed out
you can really do anything else with it
and as you can see there I don't know if
you can see it really well there's all
the code points for the Unicode or
English I'm sorry for the English on
there I don't know if you can see that
real well and then that's our layout our
keyboard layout and we'll show you a
little bit later one that we created but
um that's basically how to get Cherokee
if you had the old non unicode font
installed if you do the lower case on
the upper case and hit that key then
you're gonna get that particular
character so learning Cherokee before
unicode was it was pretty difficult
because you had to remember where 85
characters were and which you know you
only had to hit shift and when you had
to
to get that character so it was it was
pretty complicated if you worked with it
a really long time then you know
obviously you would memorize it but
Tappan was pretty painful during this
time yeah we keep talking about you know
just because of the importance of what
they did for our language yeah all the
material that Jeff showed it at first
was created that old font that wasn't
unicode so I said again we were we were
stuck we're just you know making
something printing it out they having a
poster or a paper and we wanted to move
beyond that and the reason that we
introduced the max in the schools was
that uh you know on the OS 10 that 18.3
they started supporting a cherokee
unicode font and keyboard on the system
so that a keyboard layout that was just
up that was put into the apple LS that
the the shift keys but those are there
was also another keyboard layout that
the phonetic typing so you know how does
like basically say it you could type it
out and it would switch the syllable for
you just like kind of how japanese does
and that type of thing we had in
Cherokee and I said the reason that
happened is because of Unicode yeah sure
he was adopted or the glyphs for
assigned code points I guess around 1995
the Cherokee Nation made an application
to the group and that went through the
whole process with us but it eventually
got pulled into the system and and
because of that we can move on to this
so this shot here is our images a
screenshot of the one of the fonts well
this is plantagenet Cherokee but you can
see this is the unicode point range for
Cherokee it starts with the looks like
the B character up in that first row
that's all and sure give it a stir
starts and goes all the way down to the
the B which is the young it looks like a
B but it's not saying Cherokee does have
its own unique code point range and the
Unicode tables so what happened is you
know I said in 2003 Apple you know
started supporting it but I took a loud
to trickle down to the communities
because we had that one font for the
longest time and everyone that used it
you know a lot of our people that use it
older and they don't quite understand it
technical ideas even lots but this mean
so we've said don't use that font
anymore use a unicode font and yeah most
people like it what does that even mean
you know that kind of glaze over but
this group here and then they just like
the language institute there's a man
that named Chris Harvey that works for
them and Chris developed one of the
first keyboard layouts for the Cherokee
language that followed that phonetic
typing system and there's his website is
the language geek.com he's got a lot of
fonts for other native languages as well
they're all Unicode and if you're
interested in that you can get this
website and done a lot of stuff he makes
keyboards as well so we've used his
materials quite a lot ever since he's
been doing this but like I said Apple
supported the language on the desktops
or the the computer OS here so you can
see these are some of our students at
the school using their laptops they can
do everything in the language they do
all their homework in Cherokee now they
have blogs and wiki's and emails and
everything else that you can do in
English they can do in Cherokee now it's
because the school itself is everything
is taught in Cherokee from history like
the map smiles everything is in the
language so they needed a way to use the
language in Cherokee in the modern
context because you know the kids
started off at pre-k and every year we
keep adding a grade to the school we're
currently up to the 6th grade but when
we start doing this they were in the 2nd
or 3rd I think at 3rd grade and they
needed technology in the room you know
they were getting older and to keep up
with what the kids need today they got
to have this so that's why we introduced
this to them at that time
so they're they are doing their more
homework they're in that it's I was like
this picture cuz he can it shows you and
this is a little girl you know so using
the technology and she really likes it
and yeah she enjoys having a good
computer you know it is a problem with
it we're the first ones in there she'll
tell us there's something wrong with
this thing but it gives one of the
teachers from working with the students
some more shots there so they really
like this stuff for so a god it hit them
where they live basically you know
before
for this a computer to them was just
another machine they can do stuff on but
not it wasn't really tricky friendly
because you know using a font that's not
Unicode you know has lots of problems
see we tried to email something you know
it's gonna get all gobbledygook it's not
gonna quite work right you couldn't use
it in a website unless you made an image
out of you know they have all these
problems you know if you try to embed
the font it's just not very optimal
until we start using Unicode but the
great thing about all this is you know
we have the Cherokee immersion school
and telecoil Oklahoma but there's also
you know we talked about how the
Cherokees were moved from the East to
Oklahoma there were some turkeys that
stayed in the East so in Cherokee North
Carolina there's the Eastern Band of
Cherokee so that's a separate tribal
group we're all kind of related but
that's a techno gate different
government system now versus ours but
they have a Cherokee language immersion
school as well so this slide here is a
little video we're gonna play oh we have
video chats between the two schools now
so the kids you know at our school
they're the ones in the little corner
there get really excited because they
could to see there's other children out
there too wearing this language yeah
because that church like many indigenous
languages is in danger of dying out so
this is all in an effort to you know
perpetuate the language it said this
this clip is just between the two
schools they're interacting it will play
a little part of it
you get the idea they enjoy using this
stuff in that we had to move to this
which you know we had to hit them even
harder or they live so last year and
just about a year now we are officially
on the iPhone and so you could imagine
the technology advantage that we had
because these kids were actually getting
the point where they were going to start
texting and doing all the stuff normal
kids do but they would give up Cherokee
to text their friends of course because
you're gonna text your friends your
cousin's all that our kids didn't have
to give up their language skill they
could still text each other in Cherokee
and they were so excited they were
beaming to have this day occur and it
gave us the ability for contacts and
folders and all this stuff and recently
we're able to do some so we got in the
CLD are you know it's really weird it's
great to talk to you guys because a lot
of times we talk about unicode and stuff
back home people just want to see the
surface area and we have to go to these
kind of explains probably like when you
go home and talk to your family at the
holidays and you're like trying to get
the glazed-over unicode or programming
what huh so we were so excited to come
and talk to you guys because these are
texts i we have elders texting us we
didn't realize that actually elders
would pick up devices in a indian
community and start texting us so we'll
have people in their 70s like you're
like God and they're texting you and
you're busy you know you could work
pretty hard and all of a sudden you're
getting a text from a 70 year old person
you have to respond to their an elder
speaker and in our culture you have to
respond so you can see us actually this
is when we were translating the Google
search engine and these guys were
texting other speakers to see if the
translations for these new terminologies
if the other groups liked them so they
were using their their iPhones to
actually trances we were translating the
search engine and we were sitting around
in front of this in my office here
texting other speakers too and they were
the big discussion in Cherokee about
this word and the meaning of this and
concepts
and we made digital books in the
language so we still are printing in a
way for our digital devices and this is
Andy pain he ran from LA to New York it
was a transcontinental race and a knee
pain well he was a Cherokee guy he won
this is 83 years 83 day race it was a
worldwide race at the time in the it was
$25,000 which was a lot of money and he
won the race and you know later he
became a lawyer or something but we were
proud of that runner and a knee pain is
taught about a bunch of these
traditional stories Roy did the
illustration here and you can see these
kids using the technology isn't
something they think about just like
families don't care about code and all
the achievements you do what they really
care about is how it works
and they can get on there and chat with
their friends i chat read books hear
sounds watch animations but we made some
friends contacted Facebook and we
started doing Facebook in Cherokee so if
you could imagine usually when you're
from a dominant language group or even a
larger group localization is something
that you don't really have to be
concerned about to the degree when
you're such a small group because every
day when you're walking out of the
building when you're walking down the
street it reinforces your reading skills
because you're seeing stuff in your
language all the time well finally we
have our written language coming back
our literacy skills coming back because
you can do stuff on Facebook this is a
conversation I posted up here it was a
snow day there and I took off work and
then Durban feelings he's one of our
actually he's a living treasure now he
wrote through the 1975 dictionary asking
me how do I know that and I said well I
got an email from the chief and he's
like oh haha then we ended up having a
conversation but this stuff's possible
because the technology starting to be
there because the localization some
other people in our communities is
wadays a friend of ours wikipedia you
know we're starting to get more and more
articles in Cherokee or
not a lot yet but you know if you think
about a year and having devices most of
our community have to be online with
mobile devices internet is sparse we're
from a very poor rural community and so
a lot of people have to get online with
their cell phones and so we think we're
growing pretty pretty good at this point
if you could imagine this is a huge
achievement for us you think about
wealth a third grader writing a blog it
happens all the way out in the world but
it finally happens in Cherokee and we
were so excited that our language is
being used by our children which hadn't
happened you know we grew up we were the
first generation they stopped eating you
know there was our traumatic events from
boarding schools and horrible things
from statehood that occurred to our our
grandparents and parents that caused
them to think that it's not important
for us and then we came back and grew up
and thought it is important this is
something we need to do and having
little girls and little boys write blogs
online is a giant achievement for us I
guess some of you probably recognize
this page isn't yes the language
settings on Google came out in March I'm
working with Craig and the translates
the Cherokee Nation we found a gag you
know Cherokee it's one of the interface
language is on the Google search engine
so there is there it is in the list
there if you want to go there and switch
your language out there's a shot of the
home page there and you can see we have
the keyboard to you on there so
everything works in Cherokee and this
keyboard layout it follows that one that
we showed earlier you know from the old
Cherokee Nation font so that you can hit
your Shift key and it doesn't follow
that same pattern there but I think is
really great that this this is out there
especially people back home that can do
websites stuff you know they can take
the the code there and put that into
their website I think that's a pretty
cool thing but this is just the other
day you know it shows that we still you
we use Google every day and then you
know we have the art Chloe birthday
celebration the other day and now we
we're not computer people if anyone
knows we we're artists we are our
degrees in art
we just got into the technology because
of the needs that we were working in the
language but so see we used to do
stop-motion animation with kids and they
do the stories in the Cherokee language
so when I seen this I'm like that's
really cool you know that Google decided
to celebrate you know the birthday of
artic Loki they created with Gumby but
you know it's in the Cherokee language
you can see all the buttons in Cherokee
in the interface and that's a it shows
how far we've come along as if people in
a group with our language I here's a
sample of doing an image search you have
a cat you know you have everything works
in in that Cherokee later says there's a
pretty neat we're really fortunate that
this occurred in the video search so
there are several videos popping up on
YouTube now you know in Cherokee in the
other titled ensure he and again because
a Unicode this is happening that for us
you know a lot of people take it for
granted you know it but we're really
happy that we got into the Unicode code
point system this was just the other day
to this is a Google Maps in Cherokee we
can label you create your own maps there
so you know this technology is being
used and it's actively being used and
not only do our kids use it the idea was
to get children to use this technology
what happened was they are using it but
the older generation is using it too
because you know typically you know the
older people are kind of stereotype to
say we're not gonna use this or you know
they're scared of it but they've latched
on to the technology because it happens
in the Cherokee language so if you can
get products and devices and things that
are actually in Cherokee riq many adopts
it really quickly
even like the the iPhone iPad and iPod
Touch everything when people seem that
it was a part of the OS and it was just
on it a lot of people thought it was an
app throw I K where can I get that jerky
yeah and say what no it's it's actually
on the OS if you have four point one
hires when it started so if you have you
know if you go to store now just buy one
of these devices Cherokees on it and
that wrote people yeah at first it took
a while for them to grasp the idea but
when they got it that was really this
huge impact that it had on our language
so this here is a image of that was I
think the Droid 2 there say we're hoping
maybe we can get at some help on this
here from you guys and you know since it
doesn't have a Cherokee font in the
system of choice of a square is there
but as many of you know you can root
your device which is what I did here so
I wrote it a phone here and I didn't put
a tricky phone on to it but it would be
great you know if if we could actually
have Cherokee on the device or the OS
itself without having to do this process
because if I get a lot of people now
around you know back in telecoil asking
me if I can because a lot of people use
droids and there's this very popular and
it's even surpassing yeah the the iPhone
of where we're at because it's you know
people really like it said we'd like to
be on both but I am always doing route
requests now and there is a zoom tablet
I had the the route so people really
want it but at this point yeah that's
most people in our community they don't
have the the savvy to do this it's kind
of you know it's really technical if
searching for someone that just doesn't
know anything about how the stuff is
they're like oh I don't want to go
through this whole process and you wrote
it and do this but in this show it's
possible alright so this is our paper
our paper is still going today there's
an app for that actually you can see
that we're still using our language
online we're still we're still going
we're still around you know people
always want to air Indian still alive
and we do have a live culture the reason
we do all this stuff is so that we can
you know we we started teaching at the
university just so that we could teach
the Cherokee to Greek community because
we're opening up five more immersion
schools soon and we need teachers for
them and we're educating the next
generation of teachers and we wanted
them technologically savvy so that they
can talk about Unicode they can install
keyboards they all know how to root they
can actually get the community by so
there isn't a small group of us there's
teams of us in our community and this is
an article it's in Cherokee and if you
don't read
on the English button and see that on
Cherokee Phoenix and read it in English
as well but we do it you know we do all
this technology stuff because we have a
culture a language we have children that
statistics show that if they know their
culture and language they get out they
stay out of trouble they're healthier
they're less prone to diabetes and all
the horrible stuff that occur you need
this kind of stuff to keep people happy
and healthy people and these are our
children you can see we're teaching them
dances traditional foods but we're able
to do a lot of this stuff if if all you
do is ceremonies in the language you
don't do it all the time and you
eventually won't know what your prayers
say you won't know what your culture is
doing you won't remember you may
remember just a few things but if you're
getting a text every day and Cherokee
constantly from all these people and
emails and blogs and you're reading
stuff on Facebook and Cherokee your
language survives your people survive
and Google's been a part of this process
for us
you can Google search you know last year
you typed in Charlie G in our language
there was a little under fifty thousand
which is gray in our small group now
there's a million and a half in one year
and still limited access and devices
that we're still going so we were
growing despite everything we're like
starting to take off with our language
digitally and so this is a renaissance
for us these children are are all our
younger speakers if you can imagine they
speak very good Cherokee they don't have
an accent like us it's very smooth and
we appreciate you or don't and this is
Waldo in Cherokee thank you we have one
more right there contact information if
you guys ever want to contact us this is
kind of our the technology was changing
so fast we couldn't like eventually what
happened in the last hundred years
someone come along they work on a
typewriter and things wouldn't change
that much and now technology is changing
so fast cherokee nation actually has a
division that addresses that and we are
the small but growing division that
deals with the localization and all the
different needs that our language has in
technology
issues and we're excited that Google
it's one of the first things that Google
it connects us you know Google does on
the internet and now we're able to
connect on the language so if you can
imagine those little kids on their
computers they're not having to see that
in English which is reinforcing
everything we're doing to keep this
culture that's thousands of years old to
this continent alive and Google's been a
part of it so we appreciate your time if
you have any questions we're here ok I I
was wondering the process for coming out
with Cherokee terms for new concepts is
it do you develop sort of your own sort
of names where they sort of partially
phonetic with the English terms or how
does that work you know that's how
indigenous are the names yeah how do you
how do you localize terms that we've
never had yeah like Unicode yeah
actually our code is it's a unicode e
but ok so almost litter ated a little
bit but most stuff we don't do yeah but
code we did because we a lot of times
when we're localizing we look at other
languages I'm see how that did it and a
lot of languages did the idea of a
transliteration of code okay but like
for email for instance so yeah we call
it lightning paper ha cool so it's all
of them have different terms but mainly
they're Cherokee concepts uh-huh with a
handful of transliteration uh-huh and so
unicode is transliterated but most of
things like email server they're all
descriptive terms check out a verb based
language okay so we describe everything
and it's it's really neat because you
can pack a lot of meaning in a very
short word yeah and we're a tonal
language so
it's it's really an interesting thing
yes like download like you you're taking
it down because it's so spacial as well
uh-huh
we were discussing this concept and we
were buncha elders and they were
discussing well you don't you actually
doubt you take it down and put it inside
something huh and that's all just in a
very small word and so this this occurs
with stuff from emails to servers to I
guess I'm standing up and I'm getting
blank so I'm nervous but there's a lot
of terms and most of them deal with that
digital stuff usually deals with some
type of lightening just yeah just like I
guess in English you know you do
electronic for a lot of things or but
for us it's like lightning and so but
lightning papers we always think it
sounds really cool and kids remember it
yeah you got yeah so just a quick
follow-up you mentioned that charity is
a tonal language hmm are there tonal
marks in the character set or is it like
like something like Arabic or Hebrew
where they don't have vowels and you
just know you kind of have to know okay
so it's not indicated in the not in the
right of the writing system at all no
it's not we were actually working on a
grant with a science foundation to for
the dictionary to actually put tonal
marks in for diary purposes uh-huh but
you're right it's um it has to be known
but we always try to describe it as in
you know in in English if you write the
word store like you're going to a store
or something yeah you you actually write
it sto re you don't say story yeah you
know because we know there's a silent
either mm-hmm and we have a similar
thing when you look at search we
actually had a problem with search this
is oddly enough a really complicated
writing problem we had the the word here
is iced tea which in Cherokee phonetics
you drop the second syllabary Val and so
you can actually write it i HD ihd
honesty and they know with the context
you know what it is but
if you write a IOT you have to be
careful because some of the translators
really like that because there was some
grammatical reasons why you could write
it this way but if but it also means to
shoot at somebody ha or to break apart
something and you don't want that when
you're searching you want to break
anything when you're pushing a button so
we ended up actually translating I Asti
we don't have a centralized system of
writing comparative link is just like
you can write cool in English co ll or k
WL RK e we have a slight adjustment to
some things but people can pretty much
read it but we've noticed since we were
working the language is starting to grow
with Facebook and all the stuff it seems
that our community's starting to
centralize spellings in just a few years
I mean it's starting to like you see
people as I get with a living language
yeah we didn't have this kind of growth
and now it's starting to grow together
again but it's a it's a really good
question because these you know trouble
us a lot and sometimes you'll get stuck
a day or two on a word and you're
sitting there trying to end concepts and
you're like what do programmers thinking
sorry thank you I have both a historical
question and a modern question my
historical question do you have any idea
why Sequoia invented a new syllabary
whole cloth rather than using Latin
alphabet or doing an Abu gada like the
Canadian Indian languages used he seemed
to have just taken created what fifty
three symbols eighty eight eighty five
symbols just created eighty five symbols
and the sign sounds to them just do you
know was there a reason for this others
there's no hard documentation in Hawaii
and there's lots of theories why there's
us another theory that there was a
Cherokee writing system before this and
some of what he came up with as model on
that too but essentially you know what
happened is he served in the military
for a while
okay and that he'd seen this idea that
you know people could write back and
forth and he wanted to do the same thing
but it was more to matter of I guess
like cultural pride to have our own yeah
and so he started working on this unique
system of writing is that was
specifically Cherokee and so he called
it talking leaves that was just
terminology for it because he has seen
people sending papers okay they may know
what's happening way over there you know
when they're not together and so when he
started developing the writing system we
actually have another presentation we
did about this I wish we had it with
this but you know how it turned out that
looked like some of the characters do
look like English but they don't sound
like English if there's a conjecture
that he was influenced by other
languages like Cyrillic and Greek in I
forget what else now but there's several
others that we have a comparison slides
you can see but I said there's no real
hard documentation of why he did it you
know it's just kind of that's how it
turned out but the people kind of assume
that you know he wanted to be something
that was specifically Cherokee rather
than China yeah one of the issues
Tuesday's of early on there were certain
missionaries that said that we shouldn't
have our own writing system after it was
already adopted within a few years it
was a pretty decent writing system
because almost 90 percent could read and
write in a few years of the creation
okay but after they started writing the
there was missionaries that came in and
they were like you just need to do it in
English phonetics that way there's a
better bond between whites and Indians
because we'll know what you're will get
closer to knowing what you understand
what you understand if we we can have a
little bit and it would have safety of
the Unicode problems yeah which we never
foresaw a couple hundred years ago but
you know the advantage is them some
tribes haven't adopted the language as
quickly but when we first got our phones
out it was really exciting this last
year and even even once in a while we'll
run into somebody that didn't know it
will run into some really older people
in communities that that are way in the
backwoods and will show them the
language on a phone and almost
inevitably these older people do this
can you believe we're on something
that's on a commercial I mean
imagine your language isn't supported
anywhere and for the entire time of you
growing up they did everything that
you've known subversive to blatant
annihilation of a culture and language
and you're included on something how did
that happen and our our cultural pride
in our writing system has been serviced
within the last few days now or if last
hundred a couple hundred years Cherokees
really want to see their writing system
in fact phonetics has never really
caught on in fact we were talking at a
computer company way up north and one of
the people were like why don't you just
give up your language and write in
phonetics it's a valid thing but we
can't get two communities to support
that
well you never you know we even the some
of our programs our language programs
tried and they could get people like us
to use it because we already understand
English well enough of writing systems
to do that but we can't get the older
generation involved with us and if you
don't get the older generation you don't
get the prayers you don't get the
cultural understanding you don't get the
old documents that we have and so when
Sequoia adopted this and you know
there's there's a loss of speculation a
lot of times people basically try to say
he you know how could he have done this
I mean for one he was actually not
literate in English so you can imagine
and you know we always argue cuz god I'd
be so much nicer to to have an alphabet
you know syllabaries pretty tough
sometimes because we have drops of some
valves and alphabets very powerful but
this is a guy that he adopted it's what
we have and then he actually came up
with the cursive writing and so the
cursive writing is very different in
what you see today but even he adopted
it he worked with the printing press and
the some of the missionaries to actually
change it over to which looks like some
English characters because it was more
affordable cuz you don't have to if
someone's already got a bunch of these
you can use those some of your
characters that will look like the
cursive writing that you already
developed and so yeah my second question
is are you in contact
with people working on other with the
right term I'm looking for his minority
languages you know languages like well
sure Irish or other endangered languages
yeah we do a lot of outreach and so far
we've had a lot of success because one
of the biggest problems with cultures
dying is expansion of it you know people
usually focus in on just the language
and one of the biggest problems is is
that it's not just about the language
it's not that you could just search in
the language you know that oh great we
can search in it it's that you're
actively using your language every day
in a way that you would have naturally
used anyway and so we've had people come
from Ireland the guy how did the
language geek he does Welsh if you say
and he's well yeah he he's the one that
he actually we didn't have any ability
to do Unicode it on PCs until he came
around and Cherokee Nation sponsors PCs
pretty heavily and if you're dealing
with the language that can be difficult
until he came around and it was
wonderful cuz we've been fighting for
Digital Inclusion of our language for a
long time even among our own community
people so I know that we go for our web
search we sometimes have problems with
some languages based on how they're
written if a language doesn't have
spaces we sometimes have a hard time
figuring out where when we're looking at
a page trying to figure out if it
matches your keywords where to split all
the characters up into words and do that
correctly it looks like Cherokees
written as a syllabary with spaces in
between words I don't know what kind of
grammar rules the language has I don't
know if they're love alternate
Spelling's that we should be able to
detect or you know if you type in
something we'll say oh well here's how
you would write the plural form and
we'll look for both words for you is
this is this tough or easy have you
worked on that with us it's a pretty
complex language but we we do have a
grammar book in a dictionary that
details a lot of the rules that are
involved in that
Indians we have a searchable little
document that we have we could actually
send to you if you need something like
that and I said the good thing about you
know we that the as far as like marking
if I like grammar if you like we follow
the same pattern of English and commas
and periods and all that there's no
special punctuation and there's the
language is not capitalized or lowercase
either and yeah but like I said after
you we have a document that it kind of
details a lot of this these rules of
grammar and on all that and the likes of
the pluralization is a little bit
different for depending on what you're
talking about but yeah it's it's it's it
is an issue translations you know the
biggest thing is people ask is you know
search well who's searching you mean
like it adjusts and then it can you Jeff
kind of heavily depending on if it's
talking about you but in English
sometimes it's actually the same written
word even though it might have a same
meaning this way but you can say the
same search for I search you search all
that stuff but it not for us it's a it's
like Turkish I guess it's a synthetic
language where you add things on the
fronts and the backs of words and those
can be well for example there's a lot
you can put in word one of our our
translators his name's Dodie you'll and
that's a short it's just like four
characters and you drop the value easily
but it means the guy over there eating
someone else's food and so there's a lot
in each word that you can do and so we
love Cherokee because it can be a lot
more advanced in English and then there
are certain things like prepositional
stuff that we don't do as well in the
sense that oh it's in already built in
the word so like when we translate
there's a lot of these those and ends
and ons that are very complicated
because we don't put those articles in
and so a lot of times when you're doing
localization you have to move things
around a little bit I'm sure a lot of
languages do that but for us it's new
you know and making sure that you know I
know I'm really bad about putting making
sure that I have my little my little
commas and all that stuff proper
they're also check this code so I'm like
I messed up the code in the translation
but it's a it's an exciting thing that
you know Google I mean you're basically
connecting the world together and you're
building a Cherokee world together as
well and having this kind of thing we
can send you the documents and it can be
put in a database where we actually have
it's the dictionary part was done in 75
and it has sentence samples all the way
through for every word and at
conjugation so we have a bunch of
samples and since we didn't we don't
have OCR or Jeff had the type this huge
document uh and so luckily he's we call
him Cherokee fingers because he's so
fast at typing and so when we can't we
have to get something digitized so that
we can be searchable we always bugged
Jeff because he's really fast and if you
find any documents I don't want to say
that you'll do it but it always helps
anyway oh wait that didn't know overdo
it well we appreciate it
I have one comment I passed around a
magazine which has Roy Bonnie's artwork
in it and I encourage you to take a look
at it unfortunately I can't give you
because we have only a few copies but
this is an example of the or this is the
story of Sequoia drawn by these folks if
yours if you're on Google look at Roy
boney and Native American or Indian
country today and this thing it has
actually got the whole it's a it's like
a digital version of our history that we
talked today but it's in a graphic novel
form and you may see the posters that I
that I made from the first page of page
of that I had one question since you
have almost 200 years of written
parallel text English and Cherokee what
would you like to do with that with the
Cherokee Phoenix to further I what you
have a tremendous resource there what do
you want to do with it well for one I
mean we have a lot of documents that we
don't have digitized and typing them up
takes long
and unfortunately we're a small group
like digital group you know so we're
dealing with a lot of other issues so
but what we'd like to do is be able to
take that documents and put these
translations that you know a lot of
times what we did is we did the English
version and Cherokee versions you know
on all these documents all these
newspapers so that people could read it
because I don't know if we mention it
but the Cherokee Phoenix was the most
popular American newspaper of its time
in Europe we were had more subscriptions
than any other newspaper in Europe of
that came from the Americas so our
newspaper was known in fact they would
do a lot of correspondents so Cherokees
actually knew about Turkish cannons in
the 1800s that would take down a British
ship with one shot they knew about the
British mining rubber and so it was the
CNN of the day of what was going on and
we have all this materials that have
really old words you know just like if
you read 1800s English writing there are
some fantastic things you can learn
about grammar but unfortunately we have
lots of museums and archives of stuff
that we hadn't had time to type up
everything and so we have to hurry
because you know our papers are getting
old and not everything is digitized yeah
the the tricky Phoenix itself I think
the University of Georgia has a virtual
archive of just just images and so
there's the University of Arkansas I'm a
little rock they have a website that has
images of it too but there's no like
true text version of it anywhere and if
we could get that that would be like a
really excellent resource and beyond
that we do have a lot of like some of
the books that we showed the
presentation we have these old song
books and eBooks story books we have old
primers all this stuff with you have it
digitized like with actual text instead
of just scanned images that we like
really excellent so we can have it
searchable and all this that would be
like a Google Translate or something
yeah all this stuff would be really
great to have all this but when the
issue is you know there's not a lot of
people that we have you three of us were
the with an entire tricky language
technology team at Cherokee Nation and
so we do a lot of other things
but if we had some way to actually like
someone which an OCR that would be like
a really great tool that we could use to
the digitize all this you know we're
we're from it's not a tech community
we're a low Internet area with speakers
that want to be more involved but we you
know time to get very good speakers
online just type tapping up the stuff's
pretty tough yeah and imagine doing it
on a phone because that's your major
device with like Internet and stuff and
PCs we're still hoping to get some
better support but it's kind of tricky
if an update wipes out you know we'll go
install Cherokee on it on update wipes
it out I gotta go back they're like well
it's broke and what it is is the
computer is updated and we have to put
Cherokee back on it and all that stuff
and so we're always very excited that
keyboard alone has been really handy on
this front we know people that actually
when things happen like that they type a
lot of stuff up in that browser there
and and they can copy and paste it and
do something else if so yeah people
really work hard at trying to use the
language and even something as simple as
a little keyboard on a search engine
side has become useful just just a quick
question about the keyboard so you said
someone had developed a sort of phonetic
composing keyboard and said right but
the one we have is your traditional
keyboard with the shifts and stuff is
that right so is there a spec for the
composing keyboard would you rather see
that keyboard is an option instead of
the one that's there now that would be
great if we had that we have that chart
to see earlier in a presentation how you
find it here it's this as follows the
phonetic conventions that we use I was
seeing it's just scroll through it real
quick I know we had it
there it is this chart here you can see
has the turkey on the left and then the
right is the English phonetic equivalent
so you know it would you would type that
that letter combination out to get that
syllable and then I say yeah so that map
is directly onto an English keyboard
yeah serve lowercase yeah
and for people under 40 we like the
phonetics as we already know the keys
yeah right but some of the elders really
like the holy thing yeah and so we
always defer to them sometimes gray so
they're the source of your culture right
so but you know when it comes to us
typing we type the phonetics because
it's so fast
uh-huh and you know there are certain
characters there's like 10 of them that
you barely use of course like any word
if you need that that letter you need
that letter
uh-huh and so sometimes when you're
typing that way those those 10 that you
barely use are really hard to find all
the keyboard yeah when you haven't typed
it in like a day and a half right you
forget to switch which are there okay
thanks well we need to respect the time
but thank you all for joining us today
if any of you would like to ask for
their questions we're gonna be having
lunch in Charlie's and we'd be happy to
have you join us thank you so much to
our speakers and just to let you know
they're speaking at the Unicode
conference in the next couple of days
here in Santa Clara and we are happy
that they could join us at Google as
well yeah Wednesday at 3:00 we're
talking over there a little bit
different more Unicode base to try to we
also get to meet the guy that helped us
get into the Unicode chart which we were
very excited about because we use it you
know when your language is actually
adopted into Unicode I know that's we're
geeks too like that's a really good
we're gonna meet that guy I know you
guys are busy and we appreciate you
taking the time out of you know you guys
are changing the world one code string
at a time and people notice out there we
do so thanks for letting us search and
