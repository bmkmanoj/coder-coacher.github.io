science is that there's too much
information out there the amount of
information grows exponentially at least
but our ability to handle information
doesn't and the specific problem i
looked at is how do we help users of a
social website find information that
interests them specifically how can
users of orkut find communities that's
the term that's used for discussion
groups like Usenet groups or yahoo
groups or how can people find other
users they might want to meet so i was
able to start working with orchids
shortly after its launch and this shows
in the first 10 months there was
exponential growth of members and a
lower exponential would still
exponential growth of these communities
anybody to create them and we're very
organized so the question is how you
help people find you his interest to
them I want to be able to have curved
community ranked recommendations where
if you were viewing a certain community
you would be told what other communities
you might be interested in here's an
example of some recommendations and
guess it's what community this is for
piece of knots anyone want to guess okay
not ad units programmers this is for the
geeks community and the way these
similarities were figured was with
implicit collaborative filtering for
collaborative filtering means is it was
this distributed her approach where we
look lots of people's behavior and it
was implicit because we weren't asking
people to write anything explicitly we
were just observing their behavior
specifically which communities in joined
and we work from the premise that two
communities would be similar if they had
lots of members comment so here's some
terminology out reducing you consider
consider each community to be a set of
members we might talk about a base
community be wine for wine lovers and a
related community our liveliness you'll
see later why I use that and what we
want is a measure of similarity how
similar how good a recommendation is our
for me and one thing you want to look at
is how does the membership between the
two buttes overlap there are a lot of
people in the wine community or also in
the Linux community so here's an example
we have the pizza community and to
communities I'm matched only the names
with these different overlaps which
one's better recommendation
I would reckon it's a beauty right ah
okay so someone in the audience and she
recommends he'd said the people in the
upper left or right upper upper right
excuse me I was actually asking the
reverse question so if the base
communities pizza should we recommend
the one on the right or the one on the
left yeah I'd say the one the right
because even though it's a smaller movie
of a larger proportion okay so I'm
sitting it's a circular yeah someone
very clever and the audience said he'd
recommend the group on the right because
even though it was a smaller overlap
it's a bigger percentage so the obvious
answer which not at this part audience
did within the one with bigger overlap
which we've been linux at the time i did
this research limitless was the most
popular community so it had the biggest
overlaps with just about everywhere and
told this to a friend of mine who worked
at amazon and he said oh yes the harry
potter problem so whatever book someone
looks at the one most frequently
purchased with it is harry potter and
it's not very useful to always be
recommending that so from of size is
also a factor I've shown that here is
the size of the base and related humans
also these relationships are asymmetric
for some similar their polarity measures
in computer science works both ways aids
as similar to be is via stay but that's
not the case here so if you look at the
Stanford community the stanford class of
two thousand six community isn't a very
good recommendation let me show you my
terminology the numbers in parentheses
are the size of groups and what you see
here is that there's an overlap of 47
members who belong to open the
communities so for the stanford class of
two thousand six if someone belongs to
that group without the Stanford one that
might given recommendation or you could
argue that you could say no that's just
too obvious so that starts the question
of how do we tell which recommendations
are best so the relationship is possibly
a symmetric I I didn't have a very
theoretical computer science education
so I walked over to who hold my abs and
Serge ass ashley said you'd of grams
what formula do i use i overlay on the
size of two groups to figure out
similarity and everybody gave me a
different function performs i'll go
through these and what i decided to do
and we had some arguments about which
ones would be best but then decided
let's implement them all and see so the
simplest one is pal one normalization
you can think of this
terms of vectors or each number is a
dimension and there's a one in that
dimension if that user belongs to that
community or I find it easier to think
of it as set notation just take the
overlap between the two communities and
divided by the product of their sizes
and something to notice about this is
this heavily penalized as large
communities if can you use twice as big
you'd better have twice sitting and
overlap another measure is l2
normalization in the vector space it
would this would be the same as the
cosine distance and this is the same as
l1 except for the square root sign in
the denominator so you take the overlap
and divided by the square root of the
product so this pen Eliza's large
communities less heavily another measure
that's used in mutual information
specifically i'm looking here at
positive correlation which is the upper
left corner in this matrix what this
formula shows is how well membership in
the base community predicts membership
in the related community and then
there's another version where we have
negative correlation in the blue which
is how well does that membership into
these community predicting our
membership in the related community some
of you will be familiar with Alton's
term frequency inverse document
frequency measure and that's used to say
the two documents are similar if they
have the same words in common and we can
use that
but instead seemed to say to communities
are similar if they have the same users
in common another men another one this
kind of made the most sense to me
intuitively with all gods which looks at
how much lipo you're a member of the
base community is to belong to our at a
non-member of today's community so
switching back to the harry potter how
much life leader is a purchaser for
lying the winter wardrobe to buy harry
potter then people who haven't bought
allowing the witch in the wardrobe that
tells you whether to recommend it it's
actually yielded the same ranking this
is l1 so just for fun we decided to
invert it and see what we got so we use
this version so going into this we
didn't know with their be significant
differences among the measures or would
they all give similar rankings which
ones with users prefer which measure
would be best and would there be a
partial or total ordering of the
measures so here are some
recommendations for the isle of wine
community you can see the Isle of wine
community is 2400 members and in the
upper left corner we see any overlaps 33
members with ice wine out of 51 members
of the ice wine community and something
to notice remember I said that l1
heavily penalized as large communities
you see that here because l1 is
recommending small communities l2 is
recommending larger ones that's the one
with the square root
later and then the other algorithms have
figure yet communities so what's the
best recommendation hi I've seen saw
some people taking wine before so I know
some of you are wine lovers okay so
someone said Japanese food they don't
let you know about it okay someone else
had red wine if they don't already know
about it must be Linux oh you wouldn't
mention I professor Alaska Kansas Linux
ok and I think there's a lot of
different things you could say you could
say the small groups are good because it
might not have heard about them and of
course the only way to find out is to do
an empirical test see which users prefer
so for an experiment we pre computed the
top 12 recommendations for each of the
six similarity measures and then we set
up an experiment the exact details are
in the paper so that when a user reviews
a community page we do a hash and the
community ID and user ID and select a
pair of measures may be l1 and epilogue
odds to compare and we interleave those
and then we track what does the person
click on and we only look at new users
because we can have other
recommendations in the pants and we
didn't want
to influence it okay so the next
question is how to interpret the results
there were six possible cases on the
left I'm some of these status in the
base community you can be viewing the
geeks community even if you're not a
member of it so i divided the member in
non-member cases that's the left column
across the top I have their relation to
the community they click on so the Big M
is for if they were already a member of
that community and it is for if they
didn't belong to that community and they
don't join it after clicking yet and j
is if they didn't belong to it but they
play enjoying it so we have six possible
cases at the big games and little ends
to make them easier to tell apart so
which of these measures which of these
squares do we care most about okay and
here in j remember to j and that's what
we thought to that if something is the
member of a base community they play on
community they didn't belong to enjoying
it and society good recommendation and
it's really unclear how to mature for
the other ones if some of these men a
member of a community and they click on
something and don't join it doesn't mean
it was a useful link because they
clicked on it or was it just a
distraction and clicked on it and it
wasn't what they hoped it would be and
you can ask similar questions about each
of these squares so we measure all of
those but we've cited the primary
feature would be member to join
conversion so we ran this experiment and
we generated four million of these
recommendation
pages and we got nine hundred thousand
clicks on those legs and here I'm
featuring the conversion rate you see if
somebody belongs to a community and
clicks out of recommendation there's a
fifty-four percent chance that they join
the community they click on if they
there any community they don't belong to
when they click on a link there's only a
seventeen percent chance that they join
it overall it's a thirty-four percent
chance so for the analysis we want to
take each clinic and remember each click
was choosing among two different
algorithms and if l1 rated that item
more highly that the user clicked on we
give a point to l1 if long odds ready to
get more highly to give the point too
long odds and doing that we actually got
a total order on our results so a quick
leading to joins L to get the best
results hell one was next to worst and
all of these were statistically
significant except for the single arrow
supposed to the double arrows so these
are member or overall these are just
looking at number of base community
joins a conveyed in the top row excuse
me click sounding to join that's
ambiguous I'd have to check our numbers
if you look at all clicks l2 wins the
order is the same except that l1 jumps
forward
so after this we were wondering about
positional effects we show things in
this sword grid other positions that you
are more likely to click on our first
experiment couldn't tell us anything
about that we were putting the best
recommendations first so what we did is
we generated new recommendations just
using l2 and we showed them to different
users in different orders and then we
trapped a million and a third cliffs to
see where people were more likely to
click so we show 12 with 3 rows of
recommendations when we showed a single
row anyone want to guess where people
were most likely to click I don't pay
too much attention to these pictures as
someone else would see a different order
so any guesses in center first first I
first even left or right we have a lot
of Iranian users blame you let's see
okay yeah the center got the most and
the leftmost had next although this was
not statistically significant did you
ever test for a size of image yeah I did
not test for signs of image nor did I
separate out the different language
speakers there's there's all sorts of
interesting things that can be done but
since we were doing random orders the
images would cancel out okay what about
for two rooms and here's another
question why are these the
recommendations for
sorry oh you dub students now actually
Washington stick into the Washington
safe recommendations and what position
do you think people are most likely to
click on again don't pay too much
attention to these pictures now you
guess a bottom center / room upper rides
upper left top Center take the top row
got more on the top right actually have
the lowest and the town center and this
was highly significant statistically
going to three rows this is for fantasy
and science fiction book club any
guesses what people did here where they
clicked whilst a someone said middle
upper middle right okay give here's
where we found it upper left Angela got
the most you go back now again it
doesn't matter what those those bunkers
are ya so someone theorized when there's
so much information people just stop at
the first one although I can't tell you
why I can just
what happened we got a lot of reactions
from users about these related community
recommendations we got hundreds of
emails a day we had something they click
on requesting that we have certain
recommendations and we now a lot of
angry emails from the people who created
community so some are angry because here
we were adding something to their
community page that they have no control
over and then people were angry about
some specific recommendations the
recommendations communities that they
did not think we're similar or tasteful
or appropriate and I sympathize with
them oh we heard from them value using
recommendations so for the C++ community
we recommend the community for people
who don't understand women and for
chocolate we recommended pms and now all
the recommendations were amusing I
create the she nerds group and see if
you can guess which which late I didn't
like clinics tricks so he was this one
so I actually implemented the feature to
allow community or to delete a
recommendation at Google we do not do
things by hand who will commune the
owners unhappy she needs to fix it for
everybody of course you can fix it for
her community so we had a feature where
someone who can
the owner had removed recommendations at
their own and evidently I wasn't the
only person this was the first one that
was removed I wasn't the only person to
want this and just over week after it
was released 60,000 recommendations were
deleted in 260,000 were added so this
was a very popular feature and an open
question is how do these compare with
automatic recommendations is this more
useful to the users and it makes the
community owners much happier but is
this benefiting users in some cases
people deleted communities that they saw
is competing with them are very similar
to them so that would be interesting to
find out there's many possible future
research areas one idea would be just
looking things around and instead of
determining similar communities am
counted users speaking out similar users
based on common communities and one
question would be is a useful so for
example there were a total of nine users
who belong to these three communities
that I belong to so how could that be
used it can tell me you might want to
meet these people they share some of
your interests or someone looking at my
page orchid is mostly used for dating
interested in Helen sorry she's married
try Jessica and even this was based in
social network I didn't really make use
of that information you can imagine I
look taking into account distances in
the social network the demographic
information should we count people from
the same country should we use that more
and recommendation
and she is at last what about different
ages in Brazil was and continues to be
most popular country so you often get
recommendations for communities and
languages you might not speak so I'd
like to acknowledge my co-authors around
sat on the end or Gibby and the orchid
team I pictured there it's grown a
little bit larger mental thing kept the
site writing I got to do this unexpect
and for more information I have to pay
for up here and i'll be making it
available you can also get it and other
papers from lab staff google.com /
papers i wrote a kind of silly article
about this for orchid media it's
referenced in the paper and the URL is
there I ruin a number of Stella Collins
I work at data mining because we have
the data I wanted to test our more on
which we kind of work if you can rate
how sexy trust a cool people are so we
had the data on find out scientists we
are blonde sexy you're there are 18
people more cool so you can find out my
results about that and also control is
hiring including a dis Kirkland office
they want to sand it a whole lot so you
can find out more about that by talking
to any cooler here in google.com slash
jobs and I just want to let you know
about next week's talk the Chalmer
winton will be giving and that's a week
for today and now I'd be happy to answer
any questions yes so yes we were
considering the problem of common
membership in two different sets or two
different groups rather on basically two
users that had common membership and two
groups would contribute the same no
matter what did you consider by a fine
chance like giving more points to one
that was more active in both groups for
example no that's a very good question
the question was you treated to users
belonging to the same to lose the same
and do you think about weighting it by
which users were more active that that
would count as a stronger link toward a
stronger recommendation something else
you could consider is if someone belong
to fewer communities there's someone who
belongs to a thousand communities they
should weigh each of those connections
less and someone who just belongs to
four can you use and participates in all
of them we did not do that our
hypothesis was he'd be able to get good
enough recommendations doing things this
way and I think that was the case but I
think that would be valuable
yeah as a user one of the difficulties
of getting recommendations is it takes
up a fair amount of real estate time to
review them and it's potentially useful
but perhaps if there was a filtering I
had another thing so that the user can
say you know these the areas i'd like to
see recommendations in instead of just
arbitrarily selecting two or nine out of
ten thousand okay so the question was
about giving the user more building
specified what they'd like
recommendations about and that would
certainly be a good thing to do one
since this was expensive to compute they
needed to pre-compute everything and the
total number communities by the total
number of communities is already a
pretty big number so we left it at that
something that would be very very
interesting to do with me they have per
user recommendations and that that's
something amazon has at least per item
recommendations when you're looking at
one book page you might like this other
book but they also recommendations
personalized for users and if one of my
counterparts amazon
to give a talk about that i can compute
efficiently I find that very interesting
I'm not sure I fully addressed your
question you are thinking about sort of
having 10,000 10,000 you divide those
maybe 30 40 general areas i'm not using
against by 20th okay so the question
what is a band of technical you could
have on consumer like popular media you
have political news discussion okay and
then and then the user can say well i
really don't care about rimini
of it or music but i would like to see
what other technically okay so the
question is to be able to prove the
recommendations by category the user can
select which headaches so the user can
select what category you're interested
in so am I not the interested in
politics but may be very interested in
food as you can see some of those
relations were across lines you know
someone like speaks and you recommend
linux that could be a bad recommendation
well one thing we considered was
clustering where we divide things up
into groups and that would be a
perfectly good thing to do value what we
just didn't do it yes I worry little bit
i would you recommend here you're going
to be merging the membership of the
roofs and say what have the distinct
difference of why you want two different
groups when they that have all the same
set of members and the conversation
save you plus event do you think about
possibly is advantage to community this
recommendations okay the question was
with these recommendations this will
make communities have more similar
memberships as each other so it might
reduce diversity that different
communities will become more similar
well it'll also 10 there will be a
feedback effect with the recommendations
because if you start by saying these two
communities are kind of similar because
they have some members in common then
they're both featured on each other's
page they're going to get more and more
alike so that is something that could
happen and it's not something that we
measured I in the back then one of the
groups with a controversy
ok so the comment was if you don't want
to recommend something too similar
because people should be recommending
something different from what they
already have access to and I'd say and
we were measuring the empirically so it
could be that similar is the wrong word
that when we made a recommendation that
someone click through and join maybe
it's not because it's similar maybe do
this because it's something different
one example would be people who go to
the wine community thinking it's about
wine is not an emulator the Linux
program and if they go there for the
wrong reason then they might be happy to
see a link to linux or to linux wine
which is a subject that is in similar
but it's what they wanted so and that
that's hard to measure that's an
interesting question another question
from a very potter problem like might
sell a lot of harry potter books but
everybody already knows water
a smaller group
ok so the comment is that even though
you might spell books by recommending
Harry Potter for everything and
something people know about it might be
more valuable to recommend things they
didn't know about so on you go back to
the recommendations so with this I love
wine community I read the small porky
communities that you might not know
exists ice wine pinot noir those are the
smaller communities and what we found
empirically was that he'll one produced
some of the least popular results but
you could imagine wine to be able to
crank it to be able to ask for small
communities or big communities there's a
sort of trade off between the likelihood
that somebody will like something and
novelty you can present something
they'll really excite them it's
different the things that they knew
about oh yeah so also is so this is a
somewhat of a tangent but different
communities behave differently at
different sizes so I just wondering if
you encourage people to go to these
smaller communities
change them and I don't I was wondering
if you saw any of that or had any way of
measuring that at all okay so the point
was that a community behavior depends on
their size if you start with a small
community and you a lot of people joined
yet then that might change the community
and we did it friends with that we had
user who is very unhappy because her
feminist sexuality group liturgy was
Liz's recommendation for a bunch of
groups that she didn't think were
appropriate it that she thought were
merely in scene and I don't know who
almost I'll put this online so having
her feminist membership she was having
these people from the stator group with
different values from Earth join the
community and she shut down the
community because of that and when I
found out about that may have been too
late she may have believed it but I
talked with her and that's one
underneath there
until we can fix it because it was
changing it was changing the community
was renamed communic from her point of
view of course do we count the Creator
community is being more important than
the users over their place yes so you
said you've added the control for
community under to control what was
recommended to the people viewing their
page do you have the odd this would be
an example where the opposite permission
basically to control where your pages
record book where your group is
recommended to useful ok so the comet
was we allowed community owners to
control the recommendations appearing on
their page what about letting them
control which ages their communities
recommended on and we did not do that
although it's something that the bitter
edition would have liked but that you
just have to rely on people emailing
community owners that there would be
links pops so my guess would be that if
someone doesn't want to be listed
there's plenty of people who want to be
in that position will be asking for it
something else who could have done we'd
be like community members made
suggestions about what should be related
but we decided to centralize in the
community donor in users
email them yes so the fundamental
motivator to include this feature in the
site was that too what was the hole
behind that but why include the future
at all okay the question was why I
included this feature at all what was
our goal and I'd say the goal was to
help the users find information of
interest to them why why because because
we want them to use the site and to
enjoy using it so right now people might
create a community that's identical to
warm that already exists at first we
made it so you can multiple communities
with the same name I was done to prevent
my own gram but i think we decided it
wasn't a good decision but we thought
our users would be happier get more
benefit out of the site they were able
to find communities of interest to them
and at that time there wasn't a good
search mechanism when someone created a
community they put it into one of 29
different categories but when you have
hundreds of thousands
communities at that's not good enough
hierarchy I wonder how long this whole
process took from acumen factor multiple
answers with an algorithm to use and
once he made a decision to cut the go on
to the sky processed okay the question
was how long did this process Eddie it
was pretty fast it was over a period of
months now that the dates are listed in
the paper this was done during orchids
first year two thousand four and that I
was working on other projects and we had
to wait for the people to click so you
know swapping in different processes but
orchid the team was kinda start off okay
so you're able to push things quite
quickly so on that chart where would you
see the effect of this project official
that would complain
with this have an effect it's what about
everybody right right then the
recommendations went down to everyone
the question is where does it show up in
the charge we did the first experiment
in July and it's not clear to me that
that had a significant effect so I guess
I mentioned the possibility that if
people could find related communities
they might not create new ones and the
data that's out there that out a size of
community though right okay condom was
its size of community might be affected
yep
well for the experiment we did at once
if it'd been too difficult to measure if
things were changing and the apps and
are responsible for that part of the
system anymore so I can't tell you how
often it's done now but since community
owners have been able to do the
recommendations there's that sort of in
filling that bitch what we implemented
was something where we actually
generated more recommendations that
could fit and we showed them to the
community owner and they can get rid of
some and get more suggestions making the
changes add
acts now very
they become like
okay the point was that you didn't
didn't that community creation then it
was a very different site and it is
yours later and it couldn't be giving
you different effect now that's true and
it's just one of all the different
things that could be measured it is rate
for me to be able to you know all these
different researchers were reclining the
business the similarity measure you
should use or that one is so there were
a whole bunch of questions I word fun
able to answer but but I was able to do
some comparisons but you're right
there's all sorts more it can be done
here and I'm leaving you with more
questions than answering but as I say
most hiring yes so to family these
similarity measure its you exposed your
customers who never leave set up the
different results if you have any
thought as to whether or not there to be
a way to evaluate these offline without
actually doing our lengthy user basic
experience ok the question was we used
our users to do this evaluation is there
a way we could have done it offline do
you mean like with higher the value
waiters right is there a way to evaluate
the goodness of recommendation okay it
is there a way to evaluate the goodness
of a recommendation without subjecting
users to this I think no I'm not
answered in an evaluation but I think
the best measure of what
for users is what seeing what users do
what they click on and maybe we could
have done it for a shorter period of
time I don't know if we needed to do it
as long in order to get statistically
significant results but I think doing it
as an actual user test with many clinics
was available here and I I think there
was enough benefit to our users to
justify it all of that we're getting
recommendations and we're figuring out
which measure we give the best
recommendations or our users and they
implement that and publishing it's fine
interesting because you know this a lot
of research on recommender systems at
various you know metrics of how good
their results where they don't involve
talking actual users
I was curious if you know what's your
opinion as to the actual value of end
user interaction person some of these
more academic approaches
um question was for some evaluations of
recommender systems they don't look at
what the users the actual users do they
have some independent evaluation and I
just reviewed a paper and I criticized
it for having separate evaluators the
evaluators can't know the intent of the
person initiating the query so I think
excuse your results to hire people to do
the evaluation and I've done bad and I
had someone giving evaluations or pages
that are the language she didn't speak
but even when two people are confident
and trying their hardest they just can't
know what's most relevant you know we
looked at those which which was that or
ice wine or red wine the only person who
can decide that is the actual user
that's my opinion approach like sampling
it's the recommendations and asking the
more sort of qualitative questions about
you know are you it's this community
that you thought was good or are you
actually participating in this community
to join and just to kind of get more of
that kind of agree when you I mean
you're privileged in just the joining as
the measure that says that this is
successful the recommendation is
accessible and that's true in a certain
sense but I mean in the long term is
that really that person just joining
lots and lots of groups okay that was a
very good question it was should we just
be looking at what communities people
join wouldn't it be better if week
against a qualitative information from
them about why they Jory did or see what
your they keep using it and I agreed
those things would be valuable we didn't
want to impose under users requiring
more work for them and while we've been
interesting to see who whether people
kept using the communities the team was
busy enough keeping up with the
exponential growth crying too we didn't
measure it I would definitely be
interesting when we look closer the data
you didn't see some interesting facts
mentioned paper there were some types of
communities that people click through to
a lot it didn't join okay I'll give you
a hint if you join a community its
picture gets listed on your page or okay
so all of the communities with the
lowest conversion rate were what's
called adult and none of the communities
where the highest conversion rate were
so this was a case where people were
clicking through maybe they were
clicking through this
community every day they were enjoying
it so it was a good recommendation about
your financial Jory's off me wearing a
shirt and then see how are we doing on
time okay yes could see as she was
asking about the motivation behind this
and you stated it was to get people to
use the Site more did you find that that
was accomplished he did by this like in
terms of usage per user that increase
after this was done ok the question what
is our goal was to help the users get
more benefit from the site or use the
Site warm and devein fact use it for and
we couldn't really measure it because
well I've taught about exponential
growth but I didn't understand it until
I worked on orkut and it really grow
exponentially the site would work great
with a thousand users and then we get
10,000 we have to fix some bottle that
and then we were great until we had
50,000 users so there was enough
problems accessing the site that how
many page views users had was no juror
control okay yes have you considered any
factors out of the position of the page
that affects a quick
and other than just the the matching the
union of the two memberships but as far
as just about what affects behavior like
as far as the size of the icon or the
colors used or anything like that did
you test anything other than position
okay the question was if we look at any
factors other than position and click
through like the size of a kind of learn
colors that were used we did not do that
we could have done that some communities
have no picture and it just says no
picture and I didn't include any of the
slides because they're not very
interesting to look at but we didn't
break those out separately and see how
much likely or someone needs to quit if
there's a picture there's a good picture
if there's a big picture if there's a
many colored but that's a good question
not only are there openings at Google I
think there's actually no things on the
orca team all right duh well let's thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
