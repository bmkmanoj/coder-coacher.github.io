too much and not missing some patients
many other great work that you know
didn't bother giving penance it was just
a just uh they're too much too many arts
and the slice I'm not I'm on that person
okay so uh last thing I wasn't sorry for
I started please ask lots not question
even though I started playing at time
and the first question which come to you
or hopefully ask is what the title means
- okay ah here's one huh okay whatever
okay uh yeah so yeah so let me let me
slowly explain the paddle first let's
our speed as before you'll note the
greatest form of the algorithms that
song - have fun with that Thunder
clapping that's great as we're all happy
MC - its mm - uh you know the problems
that we can solve efficiently in trouble
they say okay maybe console it exactly
but we have a basket by major numbers
for pretty good and then np-hardness
proximation
bummer you don't even have a beautiful
summation algorithm here's where it gets
really interesting
this must be with the energy so we don't
have a good element but also we don't
know how to prove that the are no
algorithm so we're really that's we're
really stuck so in some sense this is a
frontier place we will descend and be
harnessed important that whatever we
have so far is ugf that we don't
understand and this is a frontier of
theory
but I came to birthday so let me make it
a little bit more concrete so we have
painful time algorithms like main span
chains in your programming and any hard
preset and telling the sales persons not
really hard but it turns out they're a
function from in between we and those
have been the focus of my speech in
pieces and what I going to do it with a
different instances shows there and
harder so ah not what not quite any hard
but definitely not for all up to
complexity connections are definitely
not empty and my palms are focused on
three stories and I just do when I give
you a heads up this is the main
punchline upsetting for me to play
action but uh let me start with the
course location problem sort of course
location as you know you're retiring and
everyone stay to get that classical
tiring so comedians you want to take our
algorithms classes birthday and we have
to be tight looking to take the classes
so there different ways to decide who
can take the algorithms but one way is
to is raising your knee just order those
students and even if you instead of
using seniority use a random order uh
it's what we call expose hunger so in
other words if you if you pay out
$40,000 deviation or fifty thousand
whatever and you didn't get a class that
you want that's really unfair so there's
a bidding system you get 100 points and
you get a 40 points we all use that
sixty points for your yoga class
and then something a funny happens so
when you go outside in your bid for a
painting you bid one dollar for anything
oh and someone else being two really
daughters so they get to get the
painting and Eve your home with your
$1,000,000 so I'm pretty good how you
have any noggin so good yes
here you go home if you're someone
business more than you for that one's
got to go home with your 40 points what
do you do with it right so there are
many such a process is different
and there are many other systems and
they all have those weirded economic
issues and then now there is negligent
proposed by a British few years ago and
it's very possibly optimal fair and
truthful and infused in brackets Wharton
Business School and offensive al and let
me tell you a little bit more about this
mechanism the base concept in the Megan
is based on the concept of competitive
Olivia so the big ah the last people to
on your wife okay so that it the don't
mind you problem later okay ah okay yeah
it's something but here in this slide
doesn't matter it might be really hard
to extend - like we can even go to
imagination
okay - yeah yeah okay okay going so this
is our P today anyway was a big deal to
help important thing is there's the
system finds prices where Adam an
exactly why so that's a point and
everyone's happy
the I should say what my spirit is what
the customer is a competitive
equilibrium lighter equal income so
everything is missing budget and demand
is acting like it's a very conservative
with symmetric signatures for the grains
the bomb is that is competitive
doesn't this you're talking about I
classes so he doesn't make you take
magellanic sent to take 0.8 value but we
need the atomic allocations and then we
will them then but I finished economists
proof is in a box limit equilibrium
always so this is where we descend this
come in so I would you find this this
particle in this if you define it or you
can find free well in Bacchus heuristic
algorithm like I said it's used in
practice work done I think it took about
two days to converge now it's much
faster to know but even if in two days
is not terrible if you double your
awning only want to hear it or one
submitted more concerning is that you
know if you're going to take this
algorithm you're going to go try on and
you can university going to be different
data set it's not to here I was it runs
it will be really nice to have a real
algebra not realistic learning with
Google get D so this is where we give
the complexity Ritz I come in and say
well I know maybe we can be hardened
you're stuck but it's actually not going
to be any hard because they're always
visit about the recording when a street
is np-hard decide whether it was really
good to satisfying assignment huh no
ways the way we deal with response where
I think one mole is this called a PPD
it's classifying for the de metrio back
1990-91
and here's the way to class we find this
is a kind of problem you have them you
have a exponential diagram and every
vertex and it moves one ongoing edges
one in W
this verdict says they want incoming
edges on highway edge and you're given a
special vertex that has only one of the
image your goal is to find another
vertically disease is also one inch
insulted always this another vertex of
the knot which one is you can just fold
line in certain years or the next one is
next next early that's next
because we're going to find out
eventually headaches stopped some work
okay but this exponential size are just
following the line takes exponential
time and this is the best algorithm let
me go through this problem so we think
this one is really hard even though
they're always a good solution
this is one of them like a pretest so if
evening is this class defined by this
line problem and when we can prove it
doesn't matter how deeply I person so is
the descender definition is you have a
circuit that you give it to vertically
30 milliseconds of procedure okay and
what we define is course the location
film is finding the parts of the closure
is PPD complete so as hard as it's been
a blind pop much more person for
typically
so there is a course mention polymers
ones are a bunch of other ethically
rebound mark legally questionable
unfortunate PKD um you could have a
graph just with two notes right where
like the first one points to the second
and the second just points to itself
right yeah so then you don't have a
second node with already this your
verdict has nothing pointing to it right
but your what is it you're guaranteed to
be able to find everything okay
oh there's a condition that you can't
have - yeah you have a mullet one
incoming edge bottommost one only okay
in other words do I mean that another
way if you can present if you're looking
for something else
Kannada me then you get a degree people
so uh how is the graph presented as
you're given a circuit that you give it
a red X 10 piece of the successor and
predecessor incoming on the energy okay
so their money response where even a a
proclamation is hard and presented black
ball and I said that many other works
just funny I'll show you let me tell you
absolutely different story
but a community addiction so okay before
I tell you know maybe maybe so um what
was the right before he started looking
for audience diem to define a
mathematically what to communicate and
there are many definitions this is
probably the most popular definition of
catwalk model then you have many of your
very thin or you can read in papers on
it okay okay system at work so uh an
idea what are we kind of incident from
your okay
it's gonna face this we have another
opportunity at for questions
twenty-two you've got all
okay so uh so got the Glock model um Wow
because ah you have a embedded community
expect to have more so it's going to be
random graph it's John random and into
the community we have strong ties or
you're more like if you have an inch and
alpha the community help we study so
you're less likely to edge where alphas
graded so here's the feature which looks
like so here there are two our community
or losses one from the other community
and the render engines with Lorne on
edges and he's even within the same
community or more likely to have a mesh
and queen is from different communities
the problem is this is what a connection
looks like and we're looking for an
algorithm that will turn it into this
next picture so like I said this is a
this is a standard model there's been a
decrease ISM about the small recently um
that you know because you're really
tailoring to specific random
distribution it's not clear that your
elders or just a well unreal Maya
whatever it means so for example in the
context of social networks you pick your
friends random sometimes to be okay not
terrible but there's a bomb okay so I'll
fill you in the next slide I'll tell you
about this alphabetically ETF model
which is not so many in our distribution
but I just before I go on I want to make
sure that no one on say that I trashed
got one very important them ultimately
you know the reason it's universal
education for everything really
advantage here if you care about protein
protein interactions or social nor
markets will be different okay so so
here's a alphabet immunity model again
there's there is no distribution just
here given a graph now we can say that
something in the community if it has
long died in the community so everybody
the committee expected without practice
pinkie and absolutely haven't realized -
if you're not a community only friends
it's been attraction here's some
examples you see the red click the
community a yellow click is obviously
also their community the slightly more
interesting example the white reduce
reason intersection so there is
overlapping more communities and most of
his friends the red but it still part of
the white community no point in an ounce
now we have a decision let's take a
noodle bus network graph and in fine
communities a big infection is your
super so so if your anonymity you're
only allowed to be friends with a better
faction of thing if you're not part of
the community you don't have any really
an indirect and if you are going to get
many friends okay so uh there's been a
serious support some of the special
cases but in the general case the best
thing that we go is the quasi polynomial
time algorithm so looking around an
engine login so it's not a quite you can
actually run it you know it's like too
slow to actually on Bacchus
but it means it would wonderful online
algorithms like this is probably not
going to be hard so we have this
exponential time hypothesis where we
believe the three set actually takes
approximately two the enzyme so much
more than to login yes this is slower is
important so what we can prove is that
if you want to follow that this is
action divider I'm done so it's looking
at exponential planter boxes we engage
you can actually need to enter the login
time
and here also there are a bunch of
advanced to alter their there exist one
deposit at the elements and we can prove
that you need a quadruple quadruple
normal times and to log in the right
thing that's all the problems here have
it is all only ones have Angel
organization ambulance and they we also
have like a I'm floggin on a Parent
Support Technician like you me I think
yeah all we get it so let me tell you a
little bit about the kicks and then we
go back to more story okay so are you
know with some reductions so this is you
know any harnesses does dance doesn't
really know we want to show that three
goings and behind so we have a function
f early that's a reduction he takes a
free that formula and treat their gas
and it sends yes instances be inserted
in knowing two distances answer before
in the real formula I was satisfiable
because this graph is 3 colorable if the
original form is not that if I hold this
yeah I did not be colorable but notice
the function f double notes which one
escape it is but it has a very light
transformation and now we had an
algorithm for three coloring together
with this function and this implies an
algorithm three done so Young's other
ways we believe the three tests take
exponential time when 3-coloring also
avoid this was standard illness okay
slightly more interesting and be
hundreds upon summation we still yes ten
years into the it into sin but now we're
going to send no instance something is
far from yet and now even if we had an
approximate and approximation algorithm
for say coloring we can use this salt
Rita
exactly
you just saw increases hard slope
exactly Authority in finding this
function so impossible into the an
amazing a theory called PCP theorem I'll
tell you a little bit more about it
later
here here's something that I discovered
as a linking one slide
it's not by I realize it's even olive
working okay putting amazing looking
like this are really close to the border
green with an L so the functions are a
reduction since if you're just better
than those and their inability to get
and if you just works and if you just
causes another dozen since you can
parking it just thank you very fine
and the reduction never know which one
you're in so this means the reductions
sent any two instances funding as far
from together any pair assistant send me
really fun so this means that reduction
has these very good oh oh and others are
waiting for one but this is a intuition
why you have to use vertical this year
okay so the key let me give you a simple
example if you you can map from the
existence of a meeting in psychology to
saying you can earn approximately a
fraternity so you have you have to
remove like what you mean by a pattern
and if this part enhance actually means
fine and everybody can get their cutting
error-correcting sense then then it's
true but something to take it up okay
okay this is abilities I cannot for the
full of point this is something cold I
go to another site it will let me let me
share something else II know you wanted
to prove the corrugations are you know
hard but now you only have yes things it
sensor again it says all you have a
readout your hundred actually takes a
speeder thrown up in grades and existing
sensors for our classes in sin but now
you only have yes instances you're going
to spend all the years yes but what are
you gonna do with the no insistence
it doesn't work right mr. mr. Weiser's
pped problems are not any hard when you
always have a solution so here is what
you can do is start from an NFL line
which always has a solution and then you
take that out the function or never
takes exponential Telegraph engagement
classes let me give you such a reduction
so take any graph create the instance
has one class one students you don't
want the glasses we don't like to see it
instantly go
you can do anything not not interested
so to make sure you actually do
something that are useful we also have a
function D that goes out a way it takes
allocation of classes soon and get this
on to be very expert or looking for
another if we had an algorithm for a
course problem together with the
functions F and G it would fly over the
finish line because we will be Venice
aligned requires positive exponential
time which means of course match all
selected terms ok ok one one more
reductions of mental note back destroyed
so how do we get that equality 100 so
again we will submit immediate actions
it's possible there is no community so
we can again have a function yes the
enemy will no no existence but now I
want to say that a 331 financial minds
and then he creates detection to
requires the parts of the engine long
and time and I'll come back later and
tell you more about hungry conscious so
our audience is that oriented I'll get
all give access I can't
uh so so we only have like circle
BBD pond and stereos buzzing only bronze
and it would be really hard to write a
thesis as to like so that everything is
doing PNP but otherwise it's very
related
fortunately we find something in the
intersection listen listen my third
story to play on a Nash equilibrium so
we have Alex involvement there's going
to be a genetic on top and then Alex was
going to say paper balls drawn so Bob
lost and he had to pay Alex one dollar
and the way we for like this
rock-paper-scissors means is we have to
pay losses so for example if this is a
bunch of the log and Alex chose papers
and Bobby is minus 1 and allocates plus
one so the rocket reason is you'll
notice well but if Bosnian Alex would
say paper involvement say interest in
analogy say rock and then Bob would say
paper in and so on it and but there is
sweet sponsor a collision or if they
both threw exactly one thing one day
went down third then neither of them has
any reason to debate they're both happy
with this so this is called a national
committee because Nashville's that any
two-player game always has an
equilibrium and you know rocket engines
to my example it's super useful for like
nuclear on negotiation and Roger you
just when it works equal to Spencer with
not there's a nice list of this motors
register Nobel Prize ceremony by report
by almond who later opened up an
overbite you know Prasad
now the most frequently apply and
economics it very very
one solution constant okay so uh you
know once the players are in equilibrium
there'll be no reason to be baby so what
what's missing here so the goal is not a
question how do they get it safely in
the first place and there's been over a
hundred years of work in economics on
this question and let me tell the
computer scientists outfit there is a
love under the patient life so there's
like regular clear make many fun room I
like try another completion collective
sort of competing inclusion and the main
function of this story is you know these
it's particularly the business of the
competing in a Chicago PPG hearts it can
be expected and if you that's all
canceled can't find it equipment and why
do we expect this players are
decentralized and they're selfish how
are they magically going to converge to
equally like these two papers show that
uh you know finding an exotic podium is
P P D I so intractable but maybe
approximate equilibrium is better maybe
you can you can convert your muscle
recruitment issues so the the gold is
beginning of the bond here is they know
you have your given to N by n utility
nation and they go to find epsilon
equilibrium for it our charity small
constant F so on and you want to is
important with that Bernie employ
question would you define what is in
each numbness okay yeah so I know I know
if I'm unfortunate life so the payoff
possible but the payoffs are over
we wanted an absurd approximation and
abstinence means that if you change if
you're deviating from the quranic'
cotton equilibrium
you can only improve your bails by a
have fun I notice that even for pretty
small epsilon it's like you if you have
a deviation you're going to take it like
so only only make sense for really you
want that's want to be reasonable
so let me talk about some of some of the
work of nuns response over the other you
used an algorithm I finds an exact
equivalent but it takes a financial time
in the working what is it in slices even
the reasoning I'm taking away the store
you know the social things but it means
that since fun is not it's not any
harder than this n applying problem so
it belongs to the Class B beanie and
accept attending daily InDesign colorful
features actually prove that it's PPD
hard so as hard and even for as in the
one over an approximation so this will
be behind but or PPD complete but then
for confidence on a bustah nation so it
open okay so here's the reason it's been
open for a little antigenic fault but
you know there is this algorithms that
runs in a quadrupole enough time again
into login and you know so this one is
blowing out PPP hard light because
except we have this exponential fan of
constants for PPD the balloon is in a
flying bomb just like for 3/3 we can get
reset sick initial times we believe an
alkaline also requires possibly a bunch
of them okay so it's not longer being a
ppuing just mentioned in a bunch of
special cases are known to be solely
more vulnerable time and you know
especially happens a lot last paper from
2015 and it may seem like you know the
general cases just around the corner
there's also been a sequence of
vaccinations audience so Delta if you
have like a one approximation screwed up
is any any any one but you can you can
every provide more than one if the Bears
are in general there's been a sequence
aside from improving results and some of
them again on again regardless so a
little green Solomon is the state of the
eyes like 0.33 something I don't think
anyone thinks this is the optimal but
you know this is only very complicated
paper so the question is are you going
to work really hard and improve into
0.32 or you actually learn to approach
getting their first year so it is going
to be the green line over the red line
and the punchline is soil is talking for
lots of years I'm something is midnight
red line so there is some constant
epsilon where I need to be actually at
the wrong end time so matches our own
algorithm algorithm this is the full
picture of what I got really big
opportunity I can actually die extra
Nate active deep ah yeah so the natural
barrier sort of like you know these ones
are only read right we will improve
assuming ETH with Freesat we have a
reduction in the funky reduction it's
push the quasi for another load on but
ultimately since yes in this instance is
no instances and I don't know you PP the
CPP class prom only have yet businesses
so right and there is also the you know
it's a PPD suppose any horses I mean by
then people going T in America
can you yes not anything like a circuit
rely on
ETA turf
so it was a kid candy so uh you know and
being Conan to music Don essential crime
right so then at the formal a but the
simplest boys you know what what are you
do what kind of production the
duplications in the intersections
exactly
DPD our cosmic lunch yeah
what is the trigger in the code was it
circle mean but I like the way I'm
sitting with a little bit circles there
you know this probably in the Kospi BD
so there exists a DVD algorithm and is
anybody politics it wasn't for Iago and
all these pawns are hard like on number
on bottom again access the identity
problems and G so the lead early
services for the arrows LVPD are even
coming that approach yes except one
person if you know as well vision study
okay now I'm unlike the proof of the
okay let me know Joanna Krupa sick first
okay so own a reduction testing system
yes instances so we take the Seneca my
graph to create Alice and Bob and we
want a function that goes back it takes
four parts of the gluten returns the odd
degree verdicts and we want to find
property that if anything line requires
exponential time to play - will require
a fun important one as we go okay so I
like I said I like I'm not until you
know my uh yes so the main amazingphil
challenge here is understanding this PCB
thing I told her about earlier like a
hardest approximation and how that
relates to PPD
because peeps Kakeru something we go for
like empty heart bombs or look so so let
me let me solve it - you know every
could we go you know keep going I'm
using an example okay talk to you have
your using a graphic on Phonics with the
red purple great and you haven't
constraint for every vertex data
contains is vertically different walls
and papers and we know it can be hard
the right equivalent for a magical room
is actually an employee gaming let me
have that I actually shouldn't write a
better game and every player we have it
from chain that explains playing Absalom
family given what everyone else we see
that's a woman of color is different and
this is already a 15-yard even for
constant x1 and you connect what happens
is I'm okay with an approximation so now
only one and most races are different
from the neighbors
so I'd okay maybe these two neighbors or
maybe do some neighbors or a color but
the air and what the PCP theorem
Delta's is there even for a young Tom
sank on the Delta like you want your
point on factions or vertices are
different from the neighbors that's
already any hard even if there exists an
assignment where everyone is different
so this is PCP different people so I
equivalent for a vpat so you're
ascending what is right government only
we tried for very long time even before
in annuity videos in the terms of
Verizon right I comment can almost
everyone be almost happy so we call F so
Delta PCP national ones Delta so like
all over the intersections
there's don't have that funny cripple
deviation so maybe their deafness is a
small data structure in place that can
improve but more by more than that song
but everyone else's feed is almost at be
pretty sad but occur okay this we
actually don't know how to prove yet but
it's a very useful connection and you
know the prediction is just like a big
video and we have is Delta is so in the
IV projection for a PP so I like I said
I'm not gonna tell you this I can tell
you I like it easier to cheat each
appears the next nz7 when I'm pretending
to be interested was playing time at
least about the question though okay we
have I create a funny vacation still
competing to give me back the prediction
okay yeah so uh okay the certification
is is in this line so uh when you wrote
this Victor we didn't have this result
so it was like okay this is like an
avenue for a pretty insulting you know I
still drawn who is open so useful like
is a thought experiment otherwise there
there are other people hard bombs that
have become even harder assuming this
condition for example the course
location bomber told in the very
beginning is even harder it's even hard
to get like a sub concept Gini index as
far as how so well but you know there's
a dollar replicate implications with
this is sort the main motivation you
know it's something it's a great open
question hey this will be coding people
getting that the nature is the other
total unknown symbolism detrimental
erectus decrease yes as well as people
also on the continent and especially
energy yeah yeah I actually for general
games I can I feel I can boots that's a
little annoyed but this is important
additions is rigorous does is mean
okay so now we're going to change a
little coolant intellectual I the
problem started with Ed from Delta PCBs
from any plan if we have a graph again
you will get contacts in Alice and Bob
and it will have a function in going
back it takes is a epsilon fine national
new perspective sometimes they'll
absolutely calm about that experience
and again if this is Big Finish
fundamental time we'll get Quadrifoglio
Bourbon dynasty hey let's start by
constructing it the reduction from many
players to two players okay so this is
Alice you will pick a random cater for
sale for excise and she'll pick the
strategies for those excite and bothers
other things going to pick a like agent
even a big the strategies for those
objects and then the kayuu versus
outfits and gamers the Bostick's they're
going to play whatever in games but
between them and here you know what we
can take out of the utilities the else
you typically just some affair vertical
and volatility with some little piece of
 versus and I don't like that is
um system now we need a function vehicle
downline so we'll take an apostille
equilibrium for Alice and Bob and
contracting the epsilon Delta P P P -
women or the main player okay so
supposedly I was like so suppose we have
a fast algorithm to find epsilon times
Delta - proud about so what does it mean
to have a like a time travel right Alan
takes a laminated on vertices and in
Chipping strategies for groceries
so this particular al-jamal
in business strategies for all our
participant for both versions you look
at the marginal studies h4x paper you
know what we want to claim is the basis
than epsilon delta r TP k - so we'll
assume by conviction it's not anything
that will populate so the terminal
religion is not met from the fiction of
course the definition not not and to
another means at least it was a fraction
of vertices and release and epsilon
creation and so the average Riddick's
has an epsilon x noclip future so
average breaks you know Alex involving
the initial start line is like an
average over there versus so either Alex
or Valmont to also have an epsilon x
over H which violates essentially this
is an excellent excellent match for as
well okay so why do needs to think in
terms and regions are automatic and
excellent are also personal collective
so so this is a national note that be
scalars just like one is so we have okay
so today okay so we have s coverage it
covers and now we want to get this weird
conclusion that
to buy a charge for
or depending on time okay so I like you
know I didn't tell you what kid now
actually I need to be P logic is
important if a big K even small
encasement square them
Alex and Kate of about cake ceramic a
temple which is no University in
intersection so there is no being a
believer in there so but if they can K
square then then you have like a content
of a page but there is a paradoxical
accompaniment edges now here's the
punchline of the reduction it's called a
very repetition it's a network they
answering productive Muscovy so Allison
Bob each have possibly to the route and
strategy because how to specify or you
know one of the judges 4k version so the
type of the game is possible in capital
and to use to them and by our
exponential time hypothesis for PPD with
whom beam and requires trivia time and
if you lament the entire things that
solving the two-player game quiet cabin
and Gilad Gilad to men's weight your
Monica Velez you then think about them
yeah this is how to get all of them
quality possible-- oh yeah question
so this was all assuming you have this
constant yeah this is a little bit so
assuming a statistic finishes party oh
wait so yeah I make a flight in a sort
of
you know wishful thinking maybe consider
a little bit proof like I said we can
always move this but only for like a
more general game I'm gonna tell you how
to do that I want but I'll show you
there is bigger pictures oh so I feel
like I feel like a big making this
picture no know the difference but it's
a typing right so it will have to
believe me
I mean it's always we anyway we don't
actually don't prove this well we can
know how to prove that it goes around it
okay so I guess this is our main theory
even without HTTP cookie that we can
prove it is called a poem that somehow
put it okay okay so this is the main
term a mean you know it should be
remember there's always a person a
sponsor they win PNP we can flip how
like to argue about this why they're not
be some over Bronson is integrated
images alt code pls it also always has a
solution but for different reasons in
PPD and a bunch of problems like ppppp
these both engines in control
application is no harder than telling a
the intersection of feel like you know
much good stuff like application
tracking way to keep in being PMS
and there's been this amazing
breakthrough of graph isomorphism in
quasi for a long time but it'll be
amazing
and even more amazing show you actually
community and use this is some some
people is actually a theory but I know
it's nobody's faster by which I can
explain
but maybe not quite for a polynomial you
can prove it's anyone's equality maybe I
could be recorded by a robot okay that
one would buy that okay
so I sort of other very kind of thinks
of an excitable you know we have this
like which I lose PCP theorem for people
even though we don't have a theorem been
pretty successful and you can look for
PCP theorems and many other domains in
particular so I'm here we're supposed to
present this last week you sprained
ankle so you can ask about offline me I
was like a PCP here for a funny question
and I think that's it so the fun in
proof without directly your step just
fun to the line yeah I'm good encouraged
yeah I mean there's an intermediate
socialism you know the PTP is like
jumbled with a better person
but you you're limited to spaces like
this I gave to the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
