professor
economics at the New School for Social
Research well thank you very much if you
don't know what the title is about it
refers to John Maynard Keynes who was
born in 1883 died in 1946 and was the
dominant figure in economics in the 20th
century I think is a fair summary the
unfortunately beginning around 1970 his
ideas more or less passed into oblivion
and maybe I'll talk a little bit about
that but they certainly come come riding
back and forth with the crisis which
began in two or seven 2007 so what I'd
like to do is talk about Keynes's ideas
and also try to relate them to the
crisis which is a fair bid for what for
a lecture of one hour but I will try to
be relatively coherent so just to begin
Maynard's macroeconomics I'll say more
about each of these topics as I go along
but there are sort of a few key ideas
that one has to bear in mind one is a
notion of fundamental uncertainty and
I'll say something about that in a
minute
the second is that Keynes drew a
distinction between prices of assets on
the one hand and prices of goods and
services on the other and that turned
out to play a pretty fundamental role in
making the crisis occur
he also postulated basically that
national output is equal to national
income and the national income and
product accounts of the GDP accounts
that you read about in the newspapers
are constructed to fit that identity if
you like
so the basic data that people work with
was in fact shaped in a form that was
invented by Keynes there's an
implication that investment and by
investment economists mean physical
capital formation is automatically equal
to saving and that is also built into
the data and I'll have something more to
say about that what that implies in fact
is that output is determined by
something called effective demand and
not aggregate supply now the kind of
economics
supplanted Keynes beginning around 1970
essentially postulates that GDP is
determined from the supply side that is
in effect the zooms that there's full
employment of labor and capital and this
full employment of labour and capital
generates the level of output that is
known as sales law or if your partner my
friend says law after a French econ
French Italian economist to sort of
flourished around 1820 and certainly the
recent events have demonstrated that
sales law is not valid and that's
another point that I want to that I want
to emphasize as I say I'll come back to
all these ideas as we go along and they
all have a role to play in determining
or setting up the situate the conditions
for the crisis there are also a couple
of disciples that are interesting too
that are interesting to bring into the
discussion one is an American named
Richard Goodwin who ended up teaching in
Cambridge because he ran into problems
with McCarthy around 19:00 around 1940
late 1940s early 50s and he said that
there is this distribution versus demand
cycle in the US economy that is over the
business cycle you see clear a clear
pattern of changes in income
distribution and output and I'll have
more to say about that
and then there's an Englishman named
Wynn Godley who sort of took off from
the idea that it's true that income is
equal to expenditure output across the
economy but for any actor in the economy
whether a person or a sector however you
choose to classify things this actor can
have income not equal to spending so
that in effect if it's spending more
than if the actor is spending more than
its income then it's going to have to
run up liabilities or borrow if it's
spending less than its income then it's
going to have to be lending and there
are quite interesting trends and cycles
in patterns of net borrowing across the
economy and big shifts as we
see around 1980 now I used this fancy
philosophical word ontology it is to
describe Keynes is view of how the
financial word world in particular
operates and there's a distinction that
one can draw between fundamental
uncertainty on the one hand and what is
some what economists call risk on the
other and what I mean by risk is that if
risk applies you can compute it you can
put a complete probability distribution
on all future events and most micro
economic modeling is based on the
assumption of risk now Keynes and other
people argued that you really can't put
a complete probability distribution on
future events in part because you can't
even think of it you can't even conceive
of them and there are plenty of
ecological examples of that
Easter Island the CFCs in the ozone hole
and people on Easter Island when they
put up their statues just really didn't
realize that they would be diluting the
forest and after a while that would
become ecologically impossible nobody
foresaw that CFCs would create those on
whole back and around up until around
1946 or 2006 rather Ben Bernanke
governor of the central bank was talking
about a Great Moderation and he
certainly did not
and possibly could not have even
considered the crisis that was about to
break and that that's the kind of thing
I have in mind by fundamental
uncertainty you really cannot know the
future now if that's true and in
particular if you look at financial
actors and this is a key theme in Keynes
that financial actors essentially base
their decisions on conventions which may
be stable for a time but then can change
quite rapidly
he had a metaphor about that which he
called a beauty contest
now that's not the attempt that's not
choosing miss merry old England of 1936
or something like that but rather
English newspapers in the thirties had
contests in which they put up printed
pictures of a dozen or 15 or whatever
young women and ask people to vote on
not who was the prettiest but rather who
the people who the voting population
would say it was the produced
so essentially you were trying to figure
out what people the person that people
would think was the prettiest girl as
opposed to just the prettiest girl who
was being shown and then Keynes argued
that in financial markets then you can
take this up into a number of degrees
what will the main people think is who
will the majority of people think is the
prettiest of the prettiest and then you
can get to the prettiest of the
prettiest of the prettiest which is
anticipating which way if you like the
second derivative of opinion and Keynes
went on to say that there are some
people in financial markets who really
who really proceed to the fourth or
fifth degree of perception and in this
beauty contest now if you think about it
if there's a little disturbance in the
financial market then you have people
figuring that out and then people
figuring out what they are figuring out
and so on so really the beauty contest
is kind of a magnification device for
telling the group the group of financial
actress as a whole which way the market
is going to break Keynes was actually
fairly friendly with Vidkun Stein and in
sort of it contains later
anthropological philosophy he said that
knowledge is based on social conventions
cane the the Keynes view of the
financial market is it also relies on
social conventions with the difference
from Pitkin stein that they can change
rapidly and unexpectedly and we've
recently seen an example of that
now if you look at the housing price
bubble for example and I'll show you a
picture of the bubble in a couple of
minutes expectations and the valuation
models got built around a convention of
steadily rising prices and in fact
housing prices had been rising fairly
steadily since since the late 1930s was
with greater or lesser greater or lesser
speed but then they stopped rising in
the mid 2000s and the calculations fell
apart
simply the valuation models for both
housing mortgages and the derivative
securities based on housing mortgages
simply collapsed because they'd been
built around an assumption of
exponential growth with which is sort of
fluctuating up and down
now there were diverse causes for the
equity and housing bubbles but certainly
the financial deregulation and the
emergence is something called finance
theory were tremendously important
finance theory by the way is discipline
that emerged around 1950 essentially
saying you could put risk you could it
operated under conditions of risk
in fact operated under conditions under
assumptions of a Gaussian distribution
of risk and the fact that in fact price
fluctuations are not Gaussian is a major
criticism of finance theory but even
worse you can't put a probability
distribution on the future nobody
foresaw the break in the mortgage price
growth for example and in that sense the
theory was was very misleading now so
that's sort of one observation that will
come back and and and bring into the
discussion later the second observation
is that the capitalist economy has two
sets of prices that is you've got a
center prices for assets on the one hand
that is houses and shares and bonds and
things like that and then you have
another set of prices for goods and
services and when people talk about
inflation
they're always talking about the growth
rate of an index of prices of goods and
services and asset prices are left out
asset price inflation is left out or has
been left out until very recently most
discussions now there's a notion called
inflation targeting which is sort of a
grandson of monetarism which says that
what central bankers should do is raise
the interest rate when the price
inflation rate speeds up and reduce the
interest rate when price inflation slows
down price inflation for a variety of
reasons actually slowed down beginning
in the mid 1990s and that was one
rationale for low interest rates or one
justification for the low interest rates
that were that were applied at that time
even while you had asset price bubbles
building up for equity and for an for
for housing asset price movements can be
highly irregular and let me I'll show
I'll show you in a couple of else show
you some slides in a minute where I can
show them right now
this picture is shows indexes of the
nominal and real S&amp;amp;P 500 stock market
index by real I mean the nominal stock
market index deflated by deflated by the
consumer by in this case the GDP
deflator which is the most broad price
and price index for goods and services
notice that you get an asset price boom
getting underway where does it start it
really takes off sometime in the late
1970s early 1980s you see that the
equity price boom Peaks around 2000 then
there's a break down word which was
associated with various things for
example line 11 and then some recovery
but even so the real S&amp;amp;P that is the
solid line
lies considerably considerably below the
peak that have reached and in the year
2000 but in any case there was this
asset price excursion that lasts or this
equity price excursion that lasted for
about 20 years here you see the GDP
deflator versus housing prices note that
housing prices more or less tracked the
GDP deflator up again through the early
1980s a lot of things happened in the US
economy in the early 1980s as I'll come
back and discuss and then you start the
housing price boom it Peaks in the mid
2000s and then then you get the crash
and again this was unprecedented but had
been built into all the models so
housing price bubble breaks in late
1990s housing price bubble in in the mid
2000s now the next theme that's
important to bring in which was in fact
not emphasized by Keynes but fits
naturally into a Keynesian framework is
it basically if you start playing start
participating in the bubble the standard
pattern or the universal pattern is
economic as economic actors increase
that to buy assets in anticipation of
capital gains now the way that people
normally think about this is in terms of
leverage and I'll give you a formal
definition of leverage in a minute but
but basically running up liabilities to
buy assets in anticipation of capital
gains goes back very far into financial
history the most widely the first widely
publicized example was the Dutch
so-called tulip mania which occurred in
the late in the early 16 in the early to
mid 1600s around 1620 or so now the
records are not all that complete but
basically people were borrowing on the
margin to buy up to the bulbs whose
prices were rising and after a while
that crashed there were major crashes
France and England in the early 1700s
and in fact Isaac Newton got in to the
South Sea Bubble in in England got out
got back in again got lost a
considerable amount of money and said
after that I can predict the motion of
the planets but I cannot predict the
badness of crowds and that that thought
has continued until the present day now
there's also a concept liquidity that
turns out to be pretty important in this
context Keynes thought of liquidity as
money
now basically liquidity is or money
rather it is a liability of the banking
system and an asset of the people who
happen to hold money and really by
social convention money as quote/unquote
always accepted as a store of value and
a medium for transactions that ceases to
be true in hyperinflations and but
that's something that they don't want to
talk about much today
now what happens after a crash after a
financial crash of course is that
economic actors fall back on the
quiddity in the form of safe assets
because they're really scared and what
happens after every financial breakdown
and they happen fairly frequently is a
flight to liquidity in the form of
assets and that has various consequences
which which I'll take up in a minute now
for traders however on Wall Street and
others in such places the quiddity took
the form of debt which was a liability
and in effect traders ran up that to buy
assets with rising prices and as I say
this is a very old story it was not very
much discussed by Keynes
but certainly by Keynes and subsequent
Keynesian economists for example people
named Hyman Minsky and Charlie
Kindleberger
who died let's see they hidin both died
in the late 90s early 2000s they don't
have the exact dates in my hand now so
the simplest possible balance sheet
let's say looks like that the on your
assets or basically you have some kind
of asset with some kind of prize piece
of a and that is the positive side of
the balance sheet the other side of the
balance sheet is either debt or equity
where equity could be interpreted also
be interpreted as net worth now leverage
are the leverage ratio if you like is
the value of assets over equity now it's
easy to see that suppose you get a say 2
percent increase in the price of the
asset or say you're at a hundred and the
price of the asset goes up by two so
there's a 2 percent increase there but
if you hold that constant for the moment
then equity has to rise by the same
amount but the percentage change in
assets therefore is a lot lower than the
percentage change in equity which means
that when the asset price goes up
leverage goes down or when the asset
price goes down leverage goes up now the
return to an asset is if you think of
shares for example and for the minute
for the moment ignore dividends although
they're still somewhat important in the
US economy but if you think of shares
the return to an asset is a growth rate
of its price I guess Google hasn't got
around to paying dividends yet so the
return to Google share is its capital
gain
and and that's why people buy shares and
anticipation of future capital gains now
fluctuating growth prices was built into
nearly all evaluation models from
finance theory that were used by traders
with which I mentioned before but that
turns out to be a pretty important
aspect of the of the crisis now as I
mentioned with stable that growth in the
asset growth in the asset price means
that leverage goes down which is a clear
incentive to run up more debt to buy
more assets if you can get get a hold of
the borrowing power and that was also
built into the financial system on the
other hand a decrease in the asset price
means that leverage goes up and pretty
soon creditors close in that happened
quite clearly after the 2007 happened
quite clearly after the stock market
crash in 1929 and it happens with some
frequency and other events so then to
try to restore their positions traders
start selling assets into a falling
market and so drive prices down further
so you get a so you get deleveraging
and a lot of people go underwater now
notice that this ties back to changes
view of financial market financial
markets markets as being driven by
conventions because if you have a
convention that asset prices are going
to rise that's fine and but on the other
hand when that convention breaks you can
have extreme disorder and the highly
highly highly again disorderly process
of deleveraging moreover I've I didn't
haven't put it into the slide but I
should the 2007-2008 crisis was really
characterized by the fact that people
were using
the same financial models applied the
same data to price out the same
derivatives so there was an enormous
amount of homogeneity in the market
probably more than it had occurred in
previous situations and with all that
homogeneity the situation got got
noticeably worse so the convention that
asset prices keep rising falls apart
flights and liquidity and then the
crisis was exacerbated because mortgages
had been securitized into things called
derivatives which is essentially a bond
based on its component mortgages and
then sold on to asset holders and these
derivatives credit cdo's not River had
been sold you know the mortgages had
been packaged together sold onto asset
holders in very complicated patterns
people were trying to evaluate the CDOs
collateralized debt obligations using
these models since they were not heavily
traded and the fact that they were all
using the same models applied the same
data and the data changed was a major
contributing factor to the crisis but
there are financial crises all the time
I mean just look back at that recent
history you have the events of 2007 2008
before that I can't remember all the
events but you had Enron you had the
Asian crisis you had the Mexican crisis
crises happen every 5 or 10 years it was
some regularity
Charlie Kindleberger whom I mentioned
before wrote a fascinating book although
a bit a bit trying to read called manias
panics and crashes and he has this big
table showing major crashes in
capitalism since around 1800 and there's
an entry in that table about every 10
years for the major credit for the major
crisis and there are a lot of other
minor ones as well so they happen all
the time now why did this latest one
propagate to the real side of the
economy that's the key question
and again one can fall back on Keynes
and his followers to try to construct
some kind of a model now as I mentioned
Keynes postulated that output which I
will call X is equal to income which I
will call Y automatically and he was
willing to be flexible about how this
happened and it sort of drove a lot of
people crazy by so doing but the output
equals income identity is built-in as I
mentioned the GDP accounts and so it was
in and these accounts were invented by
Keynes around 1940 and they're basically
the the input into almost all
macroeconomic discussion these days so
he's still hovering over us in that
sense by setting up the accounts and in
which by which we all think the simplest
example if output is equal to investment
plus consumption and if income is equal
to saving plus consumption then
investment has to be equal saving
automatically and that's that's those
are the basic basic identities so to
speak now if consumption depends on
income which also means that saving has
to depend on income then you just do the
algebra and you'll see that investment
is going to determine the level of
output and this is the principle of
effective demand that is demand is
driven by certain injections the other
and other major injections would be
exports and government purchases and
there are also leakages to savings and
imports and taxes and the calculus of
injections and leakages is what
underlies the principle of effective
demand which is all quite simple and
straightforward there is something
called the paradox of thrift if you
think about it it arises in in this
particular context that is if if people
try to save more than in effect they'll
be consuming less and reducing excess
demand so that everybody trying to save
more isn't
self-defeating this paradox of thrift is
an example of something that's called
the fallacy of composition which also
enters rather strongly into Keynesian
economics so that's effective demand now
let me say something about distribution
in demand
which begins to cut into the into the
nub of the transmission of the financial
crisis to the real side of the economy
in macroeconomics
the easiest metrics for an income
distribution are the shares of wages and
profits and income and that's a terrible
metric in many ways but it's about the
best that we can get our hands on for
doing macro you'd be much better if you
could map the whole size distribution of
income into some two or three simple
categories and some people have tried to
do that but let me stick with wages and
profits for the moment our wage in
profit shares and those shares have to
add up to one subject to a number of
assumptions which which I could go into
if you want to hear about it now suppose
you start with labour productivity and
productivity is measured very crudely in
all economics or in all macroeconomics
is output over employment or output per
person our or some such measure and
economists like to babble about
technological change and how much going
on in this sector that sector and when
they do that they're basically just
talking about output over employment
which is a pretty stupid measure but but
it's what it's the one that we deal with
now as it turns out productivity tends
to rise when output swings up at the end
of a recession so this diagram the
recessions in the US economy as
monitored by something called the
National Bureau of Economic Research are
shaded in
and as you can see recessions don't last
very long the the present one which I
suppose entered in in the last quarter
of 2009 was actually a fairly lengthy
recession in terms of output employment
is a lot worse it's a lagging indicator
and that's one reason why employment as
to unemployment is still so high but if
you look at output is the measure this
is the kind of picture you get
as you can see productivity is tradition
as this is log deviation of productivity
from trend and as you can see
productivity tends to swing up rather
sharply after after as the economy
emerges from a recession the general
idea is that firms are unwilling to hire
on more people until they're pretty sure
that the output is seriously going to go
up so that they keep their same labor
force in the beginning of the upswing
while output is rising and therefore
productivity is conventionally measured
tends to tends to go up fairly rapidly
and then as you can see it tends to drop
off now if you work through the algebra
which is not terribly difficult you can
see that the wage share is equal to the
real wage divided by productivity and
there are productivity and wage share
versus output cycles the wage share
tends to fall coming out of recession
because labor doesn't have much
bargaining power the real wage doesn't
go up our productivity is rising and
therefore the wage share tends to fall
after a while labor gets itself into a
better bargaining position and the real
wage tends to rise so that the falling
wage share basically leads rising
capacity utilization and again
economists are always borrowing models
from everybody else in the world this
can be rationalized in terms of a simple
predator or prey model from from
mathematical ecology the wage shares the
predator and capacity utilization is the
prey this idea as I mentioned is was
sort of formalized by Richard Goodwin if
you go read volume 1 as capital you can
see a pretty clear statement in marks
now the interesting thing if you look at
the data is that so in this particular
diagram you see that the wage the wage
share is the solid line capacity
utilization is the dotted line the wage
if you look across cycles the wage share
tends to fall is capacity utilization
tends to rise then the wage share builds
up as the predator and capacity
utilization Peaks and then you go into
another cycle yeah the question is how
do you define capacity utilization and
this is another economist sleight of
hand you essentially fit a trend to
output see what's going up and down we
pretend to be serious but we really
aren't now the other thing you see here
is that wage share fluctuations across
the cycle take a big change after around
1980 that is the reductions are much
deeper and the recoveries are weaker
than they were prior to about 1980 so
that there was a fairly significant
change in in behavior of the
distribution versus demand cycle again
beginning 30 years ago and we'll see
other examples of that sort of pattern
in a minute the other side of the
following the other side of the of the
falling wage share was a rising profit
rate the dark line is the is the profit
rate which is not that easy to estimate
either but notice that it begins to
again rise sometime in the 1980s and
then let's see there's the solid line is
a real short term interest rate the
solid the dashed line is a real short
term interest rate and
solid line is a real as a real five-year
interest rate and basically the story
there is that in response to the decade
of stagflation between 1970 and 1980 the
Federal Reserve had a shock increase in
the interest rates they all jumped up
then and then gradually gradually tended
downward with with some fluctuations
part of the reduction beginning in the
late 1990s was due to inflation
targeting that I mentioned that is the
rate of inflation dropped off and given
their particular peculiar mindset the
Central Bank Alan Greenspan had no
particular reason to try to increase
interest rates now the low interest
rates yes
Wichita we shifted to the right yeah
they are okay just shift them back sorry
I'll have to take that up with my IRA
who does this much kind of stuff much
better than I do
okay now now the interest rate
reductions there was a guy named
Austrian economist named named named
Hayek Friedrich von Hayek was actually
pretty close social friend of Keynes
although they disagreed about many
things and Hayek emphasized that low
interest rates could feed into asset
price bubbles that was one of one of his
one of his major ideas which as I say
was not something that Cannes Cannes
thought about very much but I think it's
fair to say that low interest rates
certainly were a contributing factor to
the bubbles but I think financial
deregulation was was probably more
important and here you have an
experiment if you like in the sense that
Canada had the same low interest rates
as the US but did not relaxed regulation
and they avoided the worst aspects of
the prices and that's about this close
so an experiment is we're actually gonna
get in in macroeconomics now as I
mentioned for any individual or
collective economic actor that borrowing
is equal to expenditure minus income
which in most cases is equal to
investment - saving which is in most
cases equal to a demand injection - a
demand leakage at the same time the sum
of net borrowing flows across all actors
must be zero so that the accounting
built into the national income and
product product accounts can be
satisfied now if you take a look at the
data so what we did was was was put
together data on net borrowing for US
households business government and net
borrowing from the rest of the world
which of course is the same as net
lending to the United States and first
if you look at the first graph first
graph on the upper left you see that
household net borrowing was in fact
negative until around 1980 which means
that households were basically lending
to government and to business which is a
fairly traditional pattern then if again
around 1980 it started to trend very
rapidly upward with some fluctuations
and then of course with the onset of the
crisis broke downward as households got
wiped out basically and had to try to
reconstruct their balance sheets in the
upper trend beginning around 1980
underlying the upward trend was a share
the share of consumption and income rose
by about 10 percentage points which is a
lot and that is when the share of total
consumption income is if I remember the
numbers correctly went from something
like 80 to 90% and most of that if you
decomposed it was due to rise
health care costs which in that sense
had it had a major impact on on the
system the counterpart then that shows
up in the lower right and that's not
very clear I hope you can see it was
falling net borrowing by the rest of the
world or rising net lending to the US
economy now now people talk about talk
about twin deficits and during the
Reagan period there was a lot of
discussion about how the about how the
federal deficit was driving the external
deficit and all you had to do to get rid
of the external deficit was to reduce
the was to reduce the government deficit
the president of my University happened
to be a senator at that time and he sort
of talks about how they told us all all
we had to do to reduce the external
deficit was cut the budget deficit and
we did that nothing happened since that
was that shows you what economists
advise is worth the real twins in this
data at least were the were the private
household consumption deficit and the
foreign deficit to a degree that pattern
reversed after the crisis as I mentioned
that household borrowing dropped off and
also net lending to the US declined if
you turn the diagram and the lower-right
upside down another observation that
comes out in in the data is that
government net borrowing tends to be
counter cyclical that is during the
recession tax collections go down
unemployment insurance goes up etc etc
so that makes forces government to
borrow more so the government in fact
stabilizes the economy which is which is
an old idea which is about been around
for a long time this diagram shows if
you want to spend a few hours looking at
it shows all the patterns superimposed
and I think I'll just skip over it now
so what you see then so far is a change
in distributive patterns beginning in
1980 and a change in net borrowing
patterns at about that same time now the
next thing is a lead-in to trying to
make a bridge between the financial and
real side the next thing is to bring in
a little bit of historical background
going back really to the to the end of
the First World War
by the way Keynes first made his
reputation by right he was a delegate to
the Versailles Conference for a while
and then went home and wrote a book
called the economic consequences of the
peace which was a devastating critique
of the reparations that had been imposed
on Germany and that became an
international bestseller and made him
famous and he didn't look back after
that it still was reading these days
particularly for the nasty comments
about the leaders of the discussion at
the person ago stations in any case
beginning around 1928 you had rising in
an income inequality in the US and
throughout the world in the European
sense of the word
there was a liberal period and that was
that ended up in the Great Crash which
was based on a run up of leverage
particularly after around 1927 in the
stock market in New York in 1929 250 you
get a whole series of events the Great
Depression the New Deal which imposed
very heavy financial regulation World
War two and recovery 1950 to 1970 in
retrospect - sometimes called the Golden
Age because it was really the best 20 25
years of economic performance worldwide
both both in the advanced economies and
in the in the rich countries and in the
poor it was characterized by the
creation of the welfare state the
Keynesian consensus and as I say fairly
good economic performance 1970 in 1980
you get stagflation oil shocks loss of
post-world War two us hegemony 1980 2007
you get another liberal resurgence heavy
financial deregulation emergence of
finance theory and big changes in
inequality over the over this over these
periods that is the numbers here come
from income tax data which has been
compiled by a couple guys put together
by a couple guys up at Berkeley in 1929
you if income includes realized capital
gains then in nineteen twenty nine
twenty two point twenty two and a half
percent of income was in the hands of
one percent of households that fell to
nine percent in 1979 and was back up to
twenty two and a half and in 2006 which
which is a you know very major shift and
in terms of distribution and is
reflected in the wage share and profit
rate data that I presented earlier now
you then get various various trends
going together we noted the trend
decrease in the wage share that's the
solid black line across cycles and it
pretty clearly goes down there was a big
increase in the consumption share of
income which is the dotted line and that
that's what underlies the patterns of
net borrowing that I was discussing
above and then you get a big increase in
household real debt which sort of goes
begins to go down with the with the
beginning of the with the beginning of
the recession again the
our major breaks that occurred mostly
after 1980 at the same time as the
liberal political economy resurgence got
underway and you've got some pretty
strong trans here and and only one of
the one of the few things that you know
in economics is that trans can't go on
forever
something has to something has to break
it's fairly clear that they broke around
2007-2008 now the collateral for the
debt of course was rising equity and
housing prices and household borrowing
was eased by falling real interest rates
so you see the real real medium-term
let's see what we have we have real debt
which is the which is the dotted line
that the one that's rising rising the
one that rises the highest which was
accompanied by real housing prices by a
rise in real housing prices note that
there was overshooting which often
happens in financial crises that that is
the real housing crisis broke downward
before real debt began to break down
word so somehow people hang in there for
a little while after after the after the
asset price booms after asset price boom
stops and of course this was accompanied
by steady decreases in the real rate of
interest again trends which could not
persist interesting enough households
were rational in the sense that their
debt to net worth ratio which is the
dotted line stayed fairly stable until
of course the denominator net worth went
down me because asset prices went down
and household expenditures and net
worths actually declined so if you like
households were being somewhat rational
behaving rationally ninja mortgages and
all perhaps thinking that household
crises would tend to trend up forever
but in fact the in fact they did not so
those are factors that helped contribute
to the crisis
finally after World War two the US had a
very strong external surplus on trade in
a rising surplus on interest in
dividends from abroad or factor income
the trade surplus disappeared around
1980 and Japan Germany China and OPEC
essentially picked up the surplus
position so global economic flows became
highly unbalanced and I have some tables
here which illustrate that but I think
I'll skip over them since you probably
can't read them anyway if someone's
curious we can talk about them later on
so just to try to sum up you get nine
interacting sets of events one being the
major shift and political economy after
1980 the second is that the real
interest rate and wage share trended
downward after 1980 across business
cycles the profit rate and household
borrowing trended up these trends cannot
continue forever the ratio of household
debt to income doubled which again is a
really major change
there was an equity price boom from the
early 80s to the late 90s
thereafter returns to equity were flat
or negative the housing price boom
peaked around 2006 asset price bubbles
allowed households to maintain
consumption even with rising inequality
that is the way that most people
essentially paid to keep their level of
spending up was to borrow and again the
borrowing was made possible by the asset
price increases the twin to the rising
household borrowing was foreign phrase
surpluses and you can see that clearly
in the data although I tiptoed over it
falling real interest rates probably
supported the bubbles but light-touch
regulation was probably more important
and then again the US versus Canada
comparison is quite interesting and the
light tech like touch regulation was
again rationalized by the emergence of
high-tech finance theory Keynesian
macroeconomics as part of the liberal
resurgence had been supplanted by sales
law in the eyes of the profession and so
people just didn't really think anymore
about professional economists
particularly so to speak up the road
little bass if that's up the road and
the other major universities simply
forgot everything the Keynes had to say
and that was more or less the conscious
process I could go into the history but
that there would be another whole
lecture and saw spare you now the
factors that I mentioned seven through
nine essentially the ones on the finance
side supported the mania panic and crash
and again this is nothing new in
historical terms we got a crash every
few years
quiet propagated to the to the real side
of the economy had to do I think mainly
it was shifts in household behavior
aided by the asset price bubbles when
the crisis hits aggregate demand
collapsed household that borrowing
collapsed
since output is determined by demand you
got a major recession and evidently say
as law was not enforced global trade and
financial financial flows have adjusted
to an extent to be consistent with the
crisis in the u.s. they basically had to
because accounting across the world has
to add up and the changing political
economy environment made the whole thing
possible now I don't think Keynes or
anyone else could have foreseen all the
complexities of the crisis that would
emerge but I would argue that the only
way you can really think about the
crisis historically
in economics really is an historical
science we can try to unravel things
after they occur and maybe say a little
bit about what's gonna happen in the
future but not very much and the
framework intellectual framework
provided by Keynes I think it's the only
one that that allows us to try to figure
it out in a consistent body of theory
and that of course is the source of his
revenge after being forgotten for lo
these many years he turns out to have
been correct in much of what he said not
all and other people said things as I
emphasized which what goes into the
story but they were all Keynesian and I
think in that sense Keynesianism
hurricane's has been vindicated well
that's what I have to say questions
are you convinced yeah
you wanna use the knife or oh it's too
much work okay the question is what is
the next good thing and in the next bad
thing that might happen let me I'll try
I can try and answer but but let me just
preface the preface the answer by saying
that Donald Rumsfeld was a Keynesian in
the sense that you know we talked about
known knowns and and the unknown knowns
or the known unknowns and the unknown
and no one switches which is very close
to fundamental uncertainty and there's
really a lot we don't know particularly
right now because the unknown unknowns
the things we can't conceive of are
likely to determine the outcome now that
being said the positive development so
to speak would be if I can get back to
the net borrowing picture which is a
ways back notice that how household net
borrowing breaks downward with the onset
of the crisis and in fact it's getting
down toward the levels of not it's not
there yet but as toward the levels that
that rule prior to 1980
so if households manage to swing
themselves back and they may or may not
but if they manage to swing themselves
into a position of actually being
negative net borrowers or net lenders
the rest of the economy that could
provide a mechanism to bring the
external account back into balance if
the government which the government
eventually will have to do also manages
to get its fiscal situation back in
balance so the positive
outcome could arise from essentially
rebalancing the US economy internally
now that would have to be accompanied by
a rebalancing of the global economy
externally and if you like a major
negative a major bad possibility is that
it's not going to happen that that is
that Germany and China in particular as
the major exporters will not find it
feasible or convenient to swing their
economies in the direction of generating
more internal demand and in that sense
bringing the world back into balance
so I mean most of the discussion these
days centers around the international
situation that you you pick up any
newspaper in the US any day and somebody
is going to be berating China first
exchange rate policy but I think if the
u.s. u.s. still has enough hegemonic
power to affect the world if in fact it
gets its internal situation in order
that I guess that would be the answer
yeah
hi there I guess my question was related
to the borrowing of households which
started to answer I was wondering if if
there's a way you know like sort of soft
land that Trent and I am wondering
what's the relation of a household's
debt so to speak to the assets they hold
in you know I for one case and you know
like other types of investments which
are not counted I guess today as savings
I mean it's typical savings like like a
money market account in a bank well I
mean your contribution to 401ks
certainly is saving that that in
national accounts turned the u.s. the
ratio of US debt the net worth I could
probably no I can't pull it out here
maybe I can is that diagram here US debt
to net worth is the is the dashed line
on the left scale
and as you can see as a number it's not
all that high because the us pride the
u.s. household sector actually has a lot
of net worth in the form roughly off the
top of my head roughly 30 40 percent in
terms of housing and the rest in terms
of financial assets so in that sense
households are not highly leveraged but
on the other hand leverage went up quite
strongly with the fall in asset prices
beginning in beginning in beginning with
the stock market and then with the
housing bubble now
the decline in net borrowing or negative
net borrowing means that households
would gradually be building up their net
worth but the real cause of the swings
in network with the asset price bubble
and it takes a lot of net borrowing to
offset the fall of an asset price I
guess so I expect that households will
be and in bad in a bad budgetary
situation for quite a while which in a
way is not a bad thing I mean I mean the
u.s. really should be saving a lot more
than it is so a few slides ago you
asserted the sales law had been
determined to hold as well determined or
not determined
well you said that it had been not
determined in your post-mortem analysis
yeah and your causal factors you listed
that as one of them yeah I was kind of I
don't understand where you say that
sales law was determined to hold or to
be thought to have held well I mean
well the short answer I guess comes from
Candide that is economists like to
believe that we're living in the best of
all possible worlds and then Ana most of
the thrust of conventional
macroeconomics the centrist essentially
says that that the economy is going to
tend toward a quote unquote efficient
position where all resources are
utilized definitely and that kind of
thing and evidently you can't have to
have a lot of unemployment of all
resources are being used optimally so it
kind of is really brainwashed into
thinking this kind of thing and there
graduate education you should ask your
chief economist to give you a lecture
about why that's not true yeah I so it
seems to me that one of the major
confusions about Keynesian economics is
that once one accepts on that premise
that one is to intervene in the economy
then the net natural next question is
just how much intervention is the right
amount so without getting too much into
policy prescriptions it seems depending
on how you measure it that the balance
sheet of the Fed has been increased by
some thirty three percent or so more
than that let's try to be conservative
so let's say we buy into the notion that
all the right things are being done then
what can we expect China may be growing
at like nine percent or so annually so
let's say something on that order of
magnitude you still results in excess in
excess in the monetary base of on the
order of 25 percent year-over-year what
is your comment on that is that too much
is that healthy what to make of that
number
well let me answer it in the following
way I think basically if you want to
avoid a major recession or avoid a
depression given the reduction in
investment and the increase in saving
that followed the financial crisis
basically the only way you can maintain
aggregate demand at some level is
between is by using some combination of
the fiscal expansion which the Obama
package did I would argue it was too
small but anyway they did what they did
and monetary expansion that's rageth
demand at the same time if you like Wall
Street managed to shoot itself in the
foot so dramatically that the basically
the financial system was in grave peril
of collapsing and the only way that you
can avoid that is by throwing a lot of
money at Wall Street which they did with
very enthusiastically the expansion of
the Fed balance sheet which was running
what on the order of six hundred billion
something like that and it's now
something like two trillion that was a
consequence of expansive expansionary
monetary policy to try to bail out Wall
Street sooner or later they're going to
have to mop that up and there are
various ways that one can various
technical ways that one can think about
doing that which they're beginning to
dabble with at the moment but I mean for
the I mean the Fed ultimately is gonna
have to shrink its balance sheet and and
that's also going to but that will
create problems with availability of
credit to the real economy so it is a
whole can of work and I think
if those interventions had not happened
we would now be in a depression there's
no question in my mind about that
and then the real issue was out
gradually unwind the interventions get
the fiscal deficit down to say I could
go back I can't remember the exact
number we go back to look at it you know
shrink the fiscal deficit by something
like six percent of GDP and hope
household borrowing stays negative so
lending is positive and there is some
possibility of a soft landing that I
wouldn't count on is that so it seems
that you're saying what has been done
was the least of all evils but my
question still is so let's take this
pair of numbers you go from six hundred
billion to two trillion over more than a
year but whatever how do you know where
to stop I mean if that's been such a
good thing in the sense that it's been
the least of all evils why not continue
doing it well it hasn't erased all evils
I mean I I'm not going to defend Goldman
Sachs for example and the Goldman Sachs
and Citibank
for God's sake were and the other banks
were major beneficiaries of this
intervention
they're so interconnected with the rest
of the economy that had the monetary
intervention not happened and we would
be in a real mess if you look by the way
when look at experience in developing
economies who specialize in this kind of
event
when their banking system falls apart
you find that rebuild the banking system
takes a pretty significant chunk of GDP
like 20% and the u.s. is getting up in
that range we're in the same ballpark
as I say I don't think ideally I don't
think you have any choice but to do it
but that doesn't mean it's a happy
process and stopping where we have
stopped if we are indeed stopping I
think is probably a good thing so I
pulled all my investments into cash back
in 2004 I don't give financial advice
although I did more or less the same
thing yeah well that was back in 2004
but it took four years for the crash to
occur and I was this close to doing
something very bad investing into the
stock market so for the current sucker
rally any idea how long it will take
before it crashes I think I'll pass well
