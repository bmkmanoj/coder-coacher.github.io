for exciting trip my name's Larry
brilliant and this is billed as a dot
org event it isn't our conventional do
good org event so I have to just tell
you why we got involved in this is that
David and I are friends who have a
vigorous ongoing email correspondence
about politics and the state of the
world that's usually pretty depressing
you wouldn't want to get on it but I
know David from writing the most
intelligent coherent and long emails in
all of human history and I'm just so
thrilled that he's going to be here and
expose his other side of his life so
with no further ado I'm going to
introduce a longtime fan of his Tom
Galloway who's going to introduce David
and Sheldon Thank You Larry this is also
an author's at Google event and it is
being videotaped for ventral side
distribution so we do ask that you keep
your questions general and not very
specific to Google in other words it's
going public guys I'm actually also
known David for a while do the full
introduction unfortunately showings
going to be somewhat on the short side
here because I don't know him after the
Tokyo fair enough money now Sheldon
Brown is the director of the center of
research computing in the arts at the
university of california san diego and
he has head of new media arts for the
california to telecommunications
information technologies and his widely
splayed artworks on cutting-edge
technological innovation with non
artistry released that's what David has
to say about them thank you
of course is renowned as a science
fiction author having won multiple
Hugo's and nebulas he's also going to be
the guest of honor the writer guest of
honor at next year's world science
fiction convention in Japan which is a
very great honor in the science fiction
world he's also known for writing about
many other subjects such as his book the
transparent society about privacy it's
also active in education this talk is
going to be on visualization tools for
creativity and the third millennium and
is very sort of indicated one thing
about David is this enthusiasm when I
first met David I just moved to
California and David upon learning this
may be squares tell no one outside of
California anything good about the state
to keep anyone else moving in and made
me sealed it by seeing three courses of
California uber always by the Dead
Kennedys I'm sure this will be an
equally interesting talk ladies and
gentlemen David Brent and Shelton Brown
okay well you know I won my wife with
one of my castor length speeches and
that was very nice but we were a bit of
a gun here and we're going to try to
cover a very wide range of topics that
all deal with the basic notion of can
visualization and collaboration tools
make a difference in problem-solving
because problem-solving is really what
it's all about how do we solve the
problems of the next 50 years or we're
toast either the planet will be fried or
we will sink back into the standard
human culture which was shaped like a
pyramid with a few lording it over
masses and peasants below where the
world's first human civilization shaped
like a diamond in which the well-off and
educated outnumber the poor and the
implicit notion of the time it is that
it keeps rising as well and that it's
churning and the children of the poor
don't automatically inherit their
parents position it's constant dynamism
dynamism is what Google is all about
this is the goal of the Enlightenment
and can we solve the problems that are
always looming to you know try to
prevent the Enlightenment from
continuing now if I find that we're
running out of time I will simply reset
the clock okay
so let's get started and then operate my
own slides okay great all right so
Sheldon was the lead man yesterday when
we visited will write because they had
more in common I'm going to be doing the
majority of the glower here although art
is certainly an important part of this
you'll see that we quote Eric Schmidt at
the bottom that they're organizing
access to human knowledge has made it's
more powerful as individuals that is the
intention now here's a brief view of me
transparent society is my nonfiction
book it's the only addison-wesley public
policy book from the 90s it's still in
print because it's all about little
technology forces to choose between
freedom and privacy and it is it just
won't go away my novel earth they now
have a wiki online that keeping track of
predictions from 1990 that have come
true these are some of Sheldon's
installations you'll see this one at the
Seattle Center for the Arts he's just
installed one in yeah and this is our X
or area in which if there's time will
tell you all about it it's an attempt to
take computer games and make it into an
extremely educational tart well targeted
educational museum upsetting that takes
visitors or online visitors through
every step of be creating humanity and
thereby covering physics astronomy
biology everything in nice little
capsules okay now what we're talking
about is progress in visualization and I
want you to pay your attention right
down here at the bottom two lenses which
led to telescopes and microscopes the
discovery perspective and the printing
press these were three things that of
course real life is more complicated
than this so I'm not going to claim that
this is an absolute everything we do is
goes back to the metaphor of the blind
men and the elephant the book of the
blind man is grabbing the tail over the
elephant is like a rope grab and grabs
the task oh it's like a spear and very
often people try to grab the wrong parts
of the elephant and they get kicked into
the next week my job is not to be right
will rights job is to be right my job
some of you your job is to be right my
job is and Sheldon's job is to step back
the interesting and shake up your view
of the elephant so I'm offering you
metaphors that aren't necessarily
completely perfect telling us what
happened but they help you to get an
idea of the war that we're fighting
every phase in the Enlightenment seeks
off three things and advanced in the
Augmented a prosthetic device that would
augment human memory one that were
augmented human vision and one that
augmented or shift in human attention
printing Augmented human memory
fantastically it x many times we've got
a lot of knowledge that people had a
veil
to them glass lenses augmented vision
obviously even to the extent of just
being able to see a perspective shook
people up and said we never thought of
this before and all the other things
that they have that the Romans do not
have like gunpowder and sailing ships
none of them made them think that they
were finally had caught up with the
rodents but perspective did perspective
the arrival of perspectives made it
nathan sink the Romans never thought of
this in their art we must be better in
some way so it shook them up but it also
created a crisis of confidence and so
every time you have this triple of
augmented memory vision inattention it
resulted in a crisis of confidence in
which in which civilization the
conservative members of civilization
tried to say reject this for justice we
must be people kept deal with this and
always to two things happen we did not
refuse the new tools and we solved the
problem by empowering using them to
empower everybody now one of the things
that's going on at Sheldon is going to
talk to you about is how modeling
techniques fit into all this both
scientific visualization and games
require modeling techniques that are
better at creating worlds modeling
objective reality or creating new
subjective realities and so the focus
that you might think that we would focus
on vision memory and attention because I
emphasize those but we're instead going
to step back look at a gym pl4 the
slightly different way and talk about
how aren't anticipation resilience and
discourse are four ways in which these
new visualization techniques can help us
to become better problem solvers so now
to dash through art is a Shelley yeah
that's where we're at so
we're actually going to use art as a
training mechanism for this conversation
kind of initiating these four areas with
the with a bit of a dive into discussing
what the role of art might be at this
moment and then come back to it after we
look go through these other areas of
anticipation to resiliency in this
course if we have time so so first in
order to do that we need to at least
have some some things that we kind of
put out there as a cert Asians about
what art is and what its function and
role is now one of the main things that
artists do is kind of endlessly pose
that question to themselves so r is
often about trying to understand what
art is so you try to come up kind of
boil it down into a few kind of bullet
points is it's quite difficult but I
think I can stand behind these that that
what we're trying to do with art is
highlighting the human condition of the
moment addressing the universal through
the particular and expressing our
assumptions but then shaking those
assumptions of that spur cultural and
social growth the first out of old
paradigms so I'm not necessarily talking
about culture in general I'm talking
about a particular area of culture which
is art so can what is so as we move
forward how are we going to understand
what is its role going to be in
articulating the culture of the 21st
century art is something that persuades
without argument expresses this tension
between the individual and society so we
both have to look at the ways in which
are functions in terms of making meaning
and then how it functions socially and
culturally so if I recognize that the so
I'm going to you know when I look at the
21st century one thing that I know is
that it's not just an extension of
20th century there are some things that
are really radically different and the
11 primary conditional difference that
I'm an estate is a culture now a Moore's
Law condition backwards those lines so
now the forms of culture are all under
the influence of Moore's Law their basic
underlying modality and facilities
radically transform every 18 months as
you know it's computing power grows and
so what good we it's very easy to
recognize how that changes the facility
for art and cultural production but what
it actually does it's more profound as
it changes the way in which these forms
create meaning the way they interact
with culture and society so can we start
to reframe how we actually think art and
culture make meaning and so i would i
look at this i give visualization that
comes out of the field of scientific
visualization as a rubric for how future
media cultural and artistic forms
operate and again this i would say this
is a very different way in which culture
cultural forms operated up to this point
and so some of the key things about it
is that these experiences are driven by
the user so they are just simply
received but the user is a key element
in creating the cultural forms the data
is heterogeneous it's coming from all
sorts of sources simultaneously whether
it's algorithms archives optical sources
other things and it's mixed in real time
you get events and cultural forms they
are not they're not arbitrary but
they're not singular privileged in
points for that for that cultural
experience so to make these cultural
form its data plus algorithms because
the user so the digital space now is
this meta medium for all of our cultural
forms but the key the other key
difference to all of this is that
cultural forms are now a social space
and this is a radical departure from
previous cultural forms so now are we
gained cultural and social literacy
through these visualization mediums and
the first one that we're really kind of
fully articulating is the one of
computer gaming so another key
difference of this is that our cultural
forms or multimodal so the same types of
technologies of saying types of ways in
which meaning created erupts fairly
readily into multiple types of
modalities whether their architectural
whether their online experiences whether
there's sculptural whether their
imagistic the same sets of data and
algorithm are output into these multiple
forms all time so previously we gained
coherency by eviscerating a kind of
particular modality of experience
whether its spatial experience textual
experience image experience we developed
the vocabularies out of that kind of
visceral engagement that the body would
have a particular medium now we start to
engage these syntactical structures
across these modes by looking at the
kind of commonalities of expression that
easily kind of move across them so a
project that I've been doing that
highlights this is this product scalable
city and at the end of the talk will
hopefully see a little bit more of this
and if not I can share it with you
another way but it's a way of looking at
how can we express how this changes our
relationship to how we see and
understand the world around us so this
is an artistic engagement of data that
comes in from various real-world sources
and then it's reframed through different
types of algorithmic structures results
in different
installations videos 4k digital cinema
and a video game experience and the
underlying interest in it is to look at
the urban condition as sets of inputs
and outputs so the urban condition is I
oh so it's not just media that is kind
of undergoing this transformation but
it's the way we live its way we interact
and engage with the world itself we are
constantly providing data into our
rhythmic structures and receiving the
output of those output algorithmic
engagements as our experience of the
world so in this pocket I create these
take these data these data streams and
create these kind of fantastic rear tick
ulations of them where the algorithmic
artifacts are highly highly articulated
I'm really looking at you know exposing
the algorithm in the final form and and
it works with with you you know readily
saw things like you know satellite
imagery when we often also do this with
automatic computer vision techniques for
photogrammetry so all the kind of
cultural forms in there are
automatically extracted from these photo
somatic techniques that are then tagged
with metadata the proof that is kind of
automatically derived as the asset is
taken out of the out of the image source
and then that form that's behavior
within the system itself so you get
these some exaggerating this
relationship between data algorithm and
user and as I said that the at the end
of this we'll see some more fully
fledged examples of this they'll take us
to resiliency yeah I hope we'll have a
half time
and people will stay to watch the video
of the scalable city it's this wonderful
thing that tornado of automobiles going
through a landscape leaving behind house
shapes that fall into shape yesterday
wheelwrights fiancee said it was like
the proteins in a Cell bouncing against
each other and then pseudo randomly
forming successful houses rent or
blowing up because they failed it is a
lovely thing that's not and I hope we
hope we won't run out of time I guess
that the illness is on me all right now
I want to think about the latest Oregon
that we developed during our evolution
and that's the prefrontal lobes the
prefrontal lobes are right here above
the eye as a matter of fact I believe
that the Bible referred to them when
they spoke of Moses having lamps on his
brow now nobody knew what to make of
this well and sun mon was his brow so
they mistranslated it a very similar
words the lamp was horn and all through
the middle ages Moses was depicted with
horns on his head the greatest sculpture
ever made Michelangelo's Moses in a
small Church in in Rome if you ever
visit bro we must see it looks like it's
about to stand up his horns on his head
ok but these were actually the lamps on
the brow why are they the lamps on the
brow there what enable us to actually
think about the future there are the
biggest difference between us and other
grammar using animals like chimps and
parents and dolphins there what enable
us to do what Einstein called the
Gedanken experiment our thought
experiment he said half of relativity
was the math at the other half was just
imagining himself on a tram going to
speed of light away from the burden
clock tower and the proof of this is
that people who have had prefrontal
lobotomies lose their ability to
actually protect themselves in the
future say what would happen if I spread
this rumor by the water cooler tomorrow
what would happen if I
if I told my boss he had bad breath only
people over over 50 have a clue what I'm
referring to what what would happen if I
try to get through this yellow line and
losing this ability to ponder mental
experiments of the future is why I would
much rather have a free bottle in front
of me than a prefrontal lobotomy but the
point is that game mechanic and the
point is that this is what we use in
anticipation anticipation takes up at
least by my estimate ten percent of our
economy today we think that the days of
auguries and disemboweling the Sheep to
look at their entrails and tea leaves
and all that stuff is over it ain't true
over ten percent of our economy is given
to writing business cases and prediction
and then stock market and all the other
things that are involved in betting on
the future and we need to get better on
that I have a lot of opinions about that
a lot of proposals about that but I'm
going to actually skip right through
anticipation because anticipation is
actually getting a lot of attention so
is art art to shake us up these two
areas are getting a lot of attention
this is a slide from one of the defense
briefings I've been in once a month I go
to Washington most recently the defense
Threat Reduction agency I was supposed
to sit on the people and do evil genius
what could go wrong next scenarios and
we we decided that even though was on
unclassified to classify ourselves
because we were coming up with too many
nasty things I one guy said the worst
thing the terrorists could do is get one
of us to blackmail the rest of us to go
do our thing in any event the point is
in business government life we seek to
anticipate and this is one of the slides
that give it these
saying you know what is is that we're
trying to defend the only thing on this
list and shared by other cultures is not
styled your patriotism for the tribe
that where I've brought up and all these
other traits are exceptional traits
unusual traits google-like traits
enlightenment traits and if we fail to
defend this civilization that has these
weird enlightenment traits I assure you
the new powers in a pyramidal social
structure will make sure that it's not
tried again for another 2,000 years just
like they managed to prevent it after
Pericles experiment all right so I
talked about the for accountability
arena a markets justice science and the
details of what they have in common how
they have managed to harnessing
creativity using anticipatory tools and
that's just not important to us today we
have three levels of civilization the
traditional hierarchical levels that are
supposed to use anticipation to protect
us and utterly failed to do so 911 and
that doesn't mean they're bad the lesson
is anticipation inevitably does fail you
have the accountability of Eva's which
are more agile or inefficient but they
probe in all directions for things that
might be profitable or might be
scientific and then you have the people
slightly chaotic undependable but the
ultimate source of resiliency
accountability and sovereignty now this
defense slide spoke about how there are
four types of information flows going to
these three levels and it creates a
matrix in which we have to look you can
use matrices like this to see if there
is a part of this set that is being
underutilized certainly the princess
these guys are trying their best to seek
information about them there are already
skilled professionals doing them but are
there ways in which this through this
using a matrix like this you can try to
find underutilized opportunities but I'm
going to just wait right through it
patient because anticipation is not the
topic today in anticipation inevitably
fails as we saw in 911 and we saw again
on Katrina and what we absolutely rely
upon when anticipation inevitably fails
is the partner of anticipation
resiliency having a robust civilization
that's capable of rolling with the
punches in many of these defense
gatherings and the the premise is how
can we deal with public panic and
several of us almost always say what
panic show me the panic on 911 you saw
people running away you saw some people
crying but there's not one known case of
a New Yorker running away from something
that needed to be done the moment they
saw something that needed to be done
they turned away from their panic and
they're crying and they did it it was a
case of the citizens of a great American
city basically standing on the rubble
and saying what else you got and this
power is something that is not being
paid attention to buy big meetings at
the top of the hierarchy because they
psychologically do not want to notice it
the point is that the great trend across
the 20th century the monotonic trend
across the 20th century with the ups and
downs of fascism the ups and downs of
the moon race the ops and downs of
everything the great trend across the
20th century was the professionalization
of everything at the beginning of the
20th century you did almost everything
for yourself and your family by the end
of the 20th century I have strawberries
flown to me in wintertime from New
Zealand by professional pilots I do so
the Saturday I don't know my pilots
perhaps he knows his the point is all I
have to do is pay twice summer rates and
I get stronger the specialization
thing has been great the
professionalization thing has been great
it's wonderful we owe almost everything
to edit cannot continue simple
demographics we're going to run out of
people who are qualified to become
professionals da the point is there's a
counter trend that is ready it's the
counter trend that you are feeding your
business is to feed this counter trend
although personally professionals use
google but the rising levels of citizen
education and access to knowledge there
you go overlapping and intermeshing
specialized fields an airline pilot can
be a very very good local paramedic hey
you see he's been a Scoutmaster for
three years okay he could be insert he
could be something else as well the
explosion of hobbies and skilled
applications and again augmentations of
vision memory attention we're entering
into an era of Romney valence omni
knowledge through the knowledge mesh
that you are creating and attention
attention you immersion intention these
things have to result in an age of
amateurs or we're screwed it doesn't
have to denigrate the professionals or
the specialists each professional
specialist can be an amateur at a dozen
other things and what does that lead to
that leads to robustness that leads to
resiliency but it is resistant it is
resisted tooth and nail the one thing we
saw at Katrina everybody's talking about
FEMA and all that I agree I agree I hope
for a change fine fine but the politics
is aside for all of this Republican
Democrat state local federal officials
the one absolute common trait exhibited
by the professional protected cast on
Katrina absolutely what
they saw citizens trying to do something
the way New Yorkers did on 911 it was to
say stop they had reasons they have
liability concerns they have more
concerns there are always concerns and
rationalizations some of them racist the
point is that when you see something
that's universal you have to take a look
and see if something deepers happening
and it was absolutely universal
protection of guild privileges in
response to what they had seen happen in
911 and it's very very dangerous very
dangerous because the robustness and the
resiliency is exactly what we rely upon
the most I mean I find it staggering
that people who claim that we should be
acting in our own defense who complained
that under Bill Clinton the military was
only ready to react quickly to one major
and one medium sized surprise attack we
are now capable of reacting to one small
surprise attack if Mexico invaded right
now we would be in hard dire straits our
ability to respond resiliently to shock
should have been up what would think now
here are some things that that we've
talked about there they're great they're
they're important issues how the cell
system could be revised so it would work
better in a emergency how the internet
there was internet in Katrina and no
cell there should have been peer-to-peer
cell capabilities these people all had
we're sophisticated radios in their
pocket did not work that's ridiculous
but the internet there was abysmal
self-organizing software the abysmal
ability to simply organize themselves
here's another example of
self-organization how many of you saw my
hand grenade
through in salon magazine a few weeks
ago about why Jan and cat code I have
never received such as bilious rage from
political arguments things that I
deliberately tweaked out there in order
to any other human civilization would
have burn me at the stake long ago so I
keep trying but this I swear the
programmers out there wow man the anger
I got from people who obviously didn't
read the article because what I'm
talking about is the fact that my son
brings home from class these text books
that have chapter review they have the
problem set and then they have try it
and basic a little bit a little thing
that illustrates the statistics or
whatever the chapter was about type it
into your computer and see watch the
algorithm actually cause the coins to
flip or cause the doc to move across the
page powered only by Galileo's lost oh I
don't know if you're doing that do you
not if you're under not if you're under
25 because it doesn't exist the
computers on our children's desktops
cannot compute oh sure you can did you
can download you can do 19 are naming
all the letter said oh you can do this
none of the people who have this in
their textbooks none of the kids who
have this in the textbooks I can I can't
and they jump and you know what three
different microsoft executives have told
me when i complained about this three it
is almost exactly the same words there
are still there still basic programs and
textbooks don't worry they'll go away
alright I'm going to erase past this
that I recommend you go to eat a sheet
calm / spiders and it will instantly
show you the point that I'm trying to
make about empowering people if you have
a robust civilization a resilient and
confident amateurs they will be able to
augment our civilizations resiliency but
in order to do that they desperately
need rules of discourse so this is the
main thing I wanted to talk about today
enough with anticipation enough with
resiliency discourse the real digital
divide here is between the asynchronous
realm and the synchronous room the
asynchronous room the content provider
and recipient are not there at the same
time this is the realm that adults use
web browsing email file sharing
downloads search did I say that right
research project collaboration web logs
it's very useful to grownups though this
the interface here still needs vast
improvement I'm not being nice to you
people on this side there oh the
synchronous realm chat instant messaging
interactive gaming virtual worlds avatar
aang telepresence content provider and
recipient are present at the same time
primitive interfaces that dumb down the
exchanges to the level of flirting
grunts and shooting except for meeting
where and groove made a good effort
groove missed a lot of what was
necessary but made a good effort except
for meeting where and this is this realm
is almost useless to serious people
almost useless to adults nope you know
this is the synchronous room today chap
in 1969 i sat at a teletype at
altec and did this my initials and a
colon followed by part of what i typed
followed by somebody else's initials a
colon and part of what they type
interrupting me in an upward scrolling
the launch all right great you can add
stuff like that millions of student of
kids have myspace this generation is
writing more words reading more words
they have higher IQs than we ever had if
they are not engaging in discourse it is
because they are held in contempt by the
creators of this site who believe
contemptuously that they don't want to
engage in discourse that they want buxom
avatars head balloons that can fit at
most a kook sentence and ROFL well that
is all they can do and what we have is
what are called honeypot ideas the honey
pot of Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash look
still buildings and have avatars and you
know what that's building the furniture
first it's not building the
functionality that enables them to
actually convey ideas to each other test
ideas against each other produce
evidence analyzed act like sapiens
descendants of people who built this
civilization and yes ninety-eight
percent of them aren't interested in
that but two percent is an awful lot of
creative people you could hire a new
you'll excuse me freaked out I should
try to get more passionate
no up our abilities at this course go
back a long way you wouldn't be as good
at what you do at a cocktail party you
wouldn't be that good at talking to
people if this didn't go back a long way
our ancestors I believe we're the
migratory paths of the animals were they
would send boys ahead to the traditional
places where they always caught knew
they would catch a beast and traps and
all that and they would gather wood in
ahead of time and crushed grapes into
boards and they leave them hanging from
the treatise permit in a few weeks
naturally they got another animal they
invited the tribe over for a barbecue
and they took the gourds off the trees
and they so how's it been Yeah right hey
I am sure they held business meetings
caroused and berated each other the
point is we wouldn't be as good at these
things if it were evolved into us our
brains are capable our attention economy
is not new our ancestors provided
selected practice selected focus by
adjusting their distance from somebody
turning to and away from others heating
their reputations favoring things that
are interesting remembering what's
important to them rules of courtesy
keeping a train of thought staying alert
for surprise this course depends on
attention selective focus prioritization
and countless mental skills that we've
take for granted and we still do all
these things we keep track of the gist
of a conversation time has effects since
the person mentioned something and yet
it doesn't lobotomize us we adjust
attention with time orientation
reputation and yet if you're at a
cocktail party if you're at a restaurant
and somebody three conversations away
from you mentions your name or any of a
dozen other hot-button words what
happens out of the buzz that you've been
ignoring what
named suddenly leaves up or the name of
somebody you care about somebody you
once dated 20 years ago and what's more
that previous sentence that led up to
the mentioning it leaps out now what
does that mean that means your brain is
constantly hearing more than your
hearing it's constantly providing
services that enable in a deep way that
wasn't supposed to happen yes first the
special effects special effects you're
fired I think we're probably okay but
why don't you serve why don't you simply
move some places I'm gonna be good now
if your body's asked questions oh one
more just to make just to make me happy
yeah staying ready and attuned to
surprise
are your cues being able to respond well
to surprise as if you're back in that
jungle these are things that are
bringing empowers us with all the time
and the thing is the internet should be
providing analogues to these services so
that we can engage in discourse and it s
includes jesting and semantic services
government and academia have lots that
you guys have lots of technology text
analytical services but the problem is
that it's very hard to get them into the
online world in a way that mimics the
smooth way that we use them in real life
now let's step back for a second and
talk about this what would be our wish
list for services that would boost
online discourse in life we assign scant
attention by priority you've heard of
the attention economy some of the traits
that affect priority our orientation
facing toward or away from people
proximity you're approaching avoiding
them time since they last spoke
reputation and topic syntax things that
are contained within what they're saying
ideally these should online affect
things like the size of his oh or of the
speech text display rendering of avatars
video justing of the contents fonts some
sifting high-impact words a semantic
services like alerts smart transcript
ting Omni search and the availability of
information and actions that you could
do on the spot based upon the priority
that you've given to what's going on now
i'm going to show you examples from this
wish list things that i really wish were
out there one thing is almost none of
these places actually separate text
ability simply into Windows where you
can track them this does have some
precedent it does exist in a few places
and certainly the epic reclaim that the
separate avatars with separate speech
balloons might qualify for that but
here's the an example of the effect of
orientation what oh I don't know why
that happened but you see by shifting
the attention from joke to marry the
emphasis on size of available discourse
space changes now my new all of this
could happen in 3d it can happen in
video I'm talking about the
prioritization effects I'm not talking
about some simplistic online demo that
that shows a window of text although
having this would be a vast improvement
in discourse over anything that's out
there here's the effect of distance oh
shoot I'm going backwards there's some
sort of Bounce going on I don't all
right here's distance
alright so gets larger as it approaches
there's also time stamp if this person
hasn't spoken in a while or a long time
then window get smaller this person
spoke recently that has an effect upon
the window and of course there may be a
complex algorithm italy-based
interaction of these prioritization
factors so if this person hasn't spoken
a long time but it has a very high
reputation and you're facing them they
stay large larger than say Francis this
person was away in behind even though
they spoke just recently and I spoke of
reputation there are two kinds of
reputation the one without a slider the
blue thing represents global reputation
the hosted system by his own standards
and its own modalities the hosted system
has given this person a very high
reputation however it's only medium high
in this slider affect reputation that is
applied by the individual user this
person here has a high slider for a
personal score of Miss user but a low
global rep therefore because of that
even though this person is slightly
closer to this person this person has a
larger effect a larger window in this
case but there are many ways of
representing a larger effect of the
person now here's an interesting thing
you have the scrolling effect you sing
the most recent words and then it's
cools off the top what would could be
more useful than a simple slider along
the side so you could slide back up and
see what the person said before what
would better replicate your own mind and
say what was that you were saying
earlier and we can't do that find me a
place online where you can there are
dozens of problems going on on this
me let's see if this there are some very
very simple ways to try to solve them
this person people are all worried about
the weather and this person was saying
something about his aunt money so the
system reduced it to blah blah omelette
here this person is facing this way so
all the government is a few articles
priority 10 words but even so the type
font gets smaller toward the top so you
can fit more justing into and so near
the top you would have more Justine
going on until at the top there's just a
high-impact high semantic value words
look what happened over here here's the
guy's name he was been worried about his
sister these are highlighted often and
they could even highlight on a global
bird's-eye view acres away there could
be an alert this topic is being
discussed over here would you like to
send a calm would you like to send an
eavesdropper would you like to teleport
over there or walk over there to see
what's going on because we're alerting
you that information that some value to
you a top offensive interest to you is
going on over there also suggesting
services that try to make some sense out
of chaos and there are lots of other
services that this sort of thing could
provide project whiteboarding where you
could asynchronously be able gather
around a project and engage in action
items a groove approached this and seems
to miss the point smart transcription
we're in a community and you can choose
draw a line around people to get level
one transcription some or other
hangers-on the new level two
transcription just to keep track of the
gist of what they're talking about
courtesy cues kiosks do exist kiosks
exist on there and second life they are
mostly places where you go to buy things
which is of course a good thing and they
should be part of
they're not making anywhere near enough
kiosks basically and go into them in
order to get your body your avatar body
augmented now some of you may be saying
of course some of this has been done
before it's obvious I heard that from
the computer human interface conference
I heard that at the MIT Media Lab people
said of course of course and I kept
saying where's the prior art show me
where it's been done it's needed we need
stuff like this in order to replicate
some of the services that our own brains
provide so that people can engage in
useful discourse there are lots of
others video analytic tools self-loading
teleportation new style game methods
environments rocker rapidly augmented
reality overlays augmented reality
that's supposed to be going on our
goggles and eyeglasses in 10 years
showing you the sir ray burner Benji
science fiction and my sci-fi and and
I've supplied it applied one Zatara
that's supposed to be downloadable for
you guys in Google it's a work in
progress and it shows augmented reality
being used to organize smart mobs in the
next 10 20 years I gave a copy here to
Google and burner Benji's new book
rainbows end both attempts to convey the
way the world will be in 20 years with
instant access to augmented reality
overlays of all kinds just at the taffy
and some hogle command and suddenly
they're dinosaurs everywhere sure you
don't need anything you want what a map
to the here or there all these are men
in reality overlays you don't need to
wait for the goggles there are ways to
do it now now how do I know that these
things have never made it online except
for a few things like the kiosks and
they sigh and the size of avatars with
distance what never no never
here's your proof that these traits
properties services and methods have
never made it online no significant
prior art these gaps and unlike this
course are real and the patent will
issue now what a coincidence I arranged
it my patent issues today which means
that if you're online right now it may
or may not depending on Monday eastern
standard time this number may or may not
be up you may have to use the
application number but proximity
orientation memory aging importance
reputation filtering spatial content am
I really ought to make a lot of money on
this or to use this thing to draw
attention because I haven't in recent
years been able to get people to admit
that this hasn't been done Media Lab
computer you interface they all listen
what are you talking about rid of course
all those things have been done they
have not been done well there's a crude
demo crew demo that I could show you in
which screw you can do the reputation
slider you can do a crude form of
exchanging files and getting people's in
personal information you can see a
certain small amount of jesting going on
text services with having to do with
it's just a little cheap garage style
but there are some implementations that
show the variety because what would be
ideal is to offer this as a set of host
capabilities and let then that hosts be
creative and compete with each other to
create worlds here the angle orient
is a face here it is a video image face
aiming one way these get larger Amy
another way big and smaller control
panels for controlling the various
services of living in this world where
the services are more important than the
buxom avatar and more important than
ROFL although you can physically type
ROFL various specialty worlds horoscope
world this is a group in las vegas was
working on a 3d avatar rich prototype
DARPA was going to give us a contract to
develop Citizen Action network's none of
the Tia total information we've had
great luck total information thing hit
and their entire information budget cuts
zeroed out and if this we had this
contract it would have been ready in
time for Katrina so to summarize our
meandering path tech advances in vision
memory and attention disrupt
civilization provoking crisis of
confidence this has been going on since
the 15th century civilization passed
every test by refusing the retro
nostalgic efforts to quash these new
powers saying that they would make us
sinful saying that they would make us
crazy and instead apply use them to
apply reciprocal accountability which is
the theme of my nonfiction book the
transference society and of my novel
earth the notion that we grow up and can
apply accountability reciprocity across
all civilization in an order to do that
we need a minimum of secrecy but above
all developing all of these prosthetics
for vision memory and attention into new
tools for problem solving and in this
talk Sheldon and I talked about art
which shakes up the assumptions in
status quo and the 21st century tools
for that include visualization
simulation games generalized openness
where people can define art however they
wish anticipation leaders for seed ages
and opportunities 20th century tools
would be analytics modeling and
correlation data gathering
accountability these are all happening
we need them to happen more we need
Sheldon up there you know with more
students doing more great art but at
least there's substantial attention
being paid to this especially art as
applies to gaining yes there's great
stuff we only see what world rights
gonna surround you but the other two
resiliency in this course they
desperately need augmentation of the
tools for visualization that can lead to
problem solving in resiliency the
citizens are robust is respond well to
surprised 21st century tools that are
needed or agile communication self
organizational skills dispersed
expertise transparency and above all
confidence in discourse this operates
inner interoperates well with resiliency
we argue we discuss we persuade we react
quickly be improved and we need better
interface with which to do these things
with each to argue with which to come to
conclusions and that brings us to the
end of the formal part of this talk but
I do urge you to during the question a I
don't believe it
just a bit under an hour tank your ears
must hurt yeah alright we can show we
can show that wonderful video of
Sheldon's and you'll find it way cool
and what's more as it'll give you a
chance to do your bathroom break and
then we'll be open for questions is that
what you'd like yeah ok cool hey they're
interested you caught me so there's a
couple of things that I would show from
this but when I would start with this
project in people and someone's going
away is data type of discourse you know
we we as we start to create these tools
of these digital tools no we we start
with some kind of representation of the
world around us some way in which it
simply translates to to the to the
medium to this to the screen but then we
have to actually step back and reflect
upon what it is we're actually doing you
know how can we actually really kind of
capture what the essence of this thing
is I think it's David showing the policy
you know really to try to you know
investigate what is actually happening
in conversation and have you how do you
turn it up something more meaningful and
so part of what I'm doing in the scale
of the city is you know trying to look
at ways in which we what the effect is
upon when we have this kind of
ubiquitous Google Earth view of
ourselves when we have this way in which
we kind of our off creating these these
worlds that we're simultaneously
occupying between the virtual and the
digital and then trying to come up with
a kind of provocative enterprise those
two so the first thing I'll show you a
community audio a video that takes you
through some of the process of creating
the scale
and it starts by taking data such as
this which could come from google earth
but then taking that and that just
becomes a seat to create a new kind of
way of replaying that environment so I
take it I take a height map of it that I
apply an algorithmic transformation to
it that's that's fairly fairly large and
it's gestures it's meant to kind of
leave behind the traces that yes this is
a kind of algorithm adjuster you've done
here you cut copy paste it and rotate
rotated a piece of the world something
we're really familiar with in the
plasticity of digital media now we start
to apply that same algorithm to
something that's a little more analogous
to the real world and it becomes a
little more of a provocation of what the
meaning of that transformation is so
then that the little colored lines are
actually analyzing that looking at
spaces where you could possibly start to
grow a city in this case then I use an L
system algorithm to actually which is
developed for plant growth simulation
and grow a network of roads into into
this landscape and these roads are built
from these are convening spirals so
these highly decorative patterns that
have been used throughout the culture
drought cultures for thousands of years
almost globally to to decorate surfaces
and so in some way attention re playing
that image for the view of the satellite
so the satellite view becomes the kind
of privileged desirous view of this
environment so these so these brothers
go into this landscape in a kind of
automatic way I have no real control
over and besides the adjusting the
parameters of the landscape they're
having up the algorithm and and then
these become the underlying settings for
which the city is actually going to
start to arise based on the user
interactions and and for that i have to
boot out of here and
the computer game part of this so this
provides a kind of cinematic overview of
one of these underlying data processes
for this and when I think I've will do
is a move out of here to make a couple
of say I'll show you this will in part
here so in that interactive environment
what you're actually operating you exist
in this space but not in that kind of
singular normal avatar mode you actually
control something that's a little more
akin to of whether it's the weather
system you control a particle system and
consists of all these automobiles so
you're you're having a effect upon the
environment without kind of like a
singular one-to-one interaction that's
it so you control of these particle
systems as it stirs up the environment
and the environment grows around you so
the end result is your your engagement
within that world shows how it kind of
give you both kind of processes that's
constructive and destructive with the
world around you and then some form of
maybe some underlying mathematics of
what culture actually is and we we hope
to have a little bit of a little bit of
the constructive left over and after the
destructive guess let's open this up for
questions yes in the back yeah
a lot of what you spoken about here and
then also written about on your blog
taught me about against some of the
failures of anticipation as well as
action by our government and elites in
general what is your thought or hope on
the possibility variance of an
accountability soon well accountability
is the fundamentals that everybody human
we have to understand human nation human
nature is informed by the fact that we
had gone a lot of bad habits for a
million years other bad habits for
20,000 years and some very bad habits
for 4,000 years during these care middle
of cultures every time human beings got
metallurgy and agriculture large guys
picked up metal implements and took
other men's women and wheat and then
they hired a bunch of guys and spangled
close to leap around and get the dregs
from their table by saying it's good
that he has your daughters it's good
it's good here's the reasons it is the
most natural thing in the world that's
why feudalism has such a good grip on
our imagination that's why fantasy is
more popular than science fiction
including fantasies like Star Wars as he
plugs his latest book Star Wars on trial
the point is that the point is that the
Enlightenment is one major attempt to
redo the effort that Pericles made at
five-thirty bc and that is in plato in
his ill make sure that it wasn't trying
to get another 2,000 years for two to
three hundred years we've been trying
something completely different and that
is to use a rule-based systems of
markets science and courts and
and democracy to harness human
competitiveness and the only way these
four accountabilities arenas work is if
they'll open if their reciprocal the
economy if there's darkness if there's
shadows inside markets cheating will
happen duh and the markets are no longer
efficient if there's darkness in
democracy cheating happens and it's not
efficient at correcting policy same
thing in science and ignorance so it is
absolutely essential and I tell the
these defense guys I have nothing
against tactical secrecy our side does
have to win but anybody who acts as if
what they are keeping a secret is going
to stay secret in five years with the
way technology changes is a fool or they
want a closed society that it will be
able to keep secrets in five years and
if we are on a openness and
accountability trend within five years
then we are strong I can't make it any
plan I mean this is not political one
where the other this is just a pretty
bloody obvious and you folks are part of
the openness trend that doesn't mean I'm
opposed to all the intellectual property
right that doesn't mean that i'm going
to wag my finger at you about China the
Enlightenment has to win its victories
as it can pragmatically but the overall
secular trend has got to be towards more
hope and accountable resilient and
citizen and powered civilization even if
you have momentary deviances from the
path does that answer your question very
much well that's me ran in ratlam
anybody else yeah
once you're out exactly asked if they'd
good to just which is um do you really
expect that show of people I've got a
patent now is going to make them say oh
yeah that shows that hasn't been done
before I mean if anything depends some
short socks if I entire life to software
fine fine how about 10 years in tearing
people I turn you it's as simple as that
I dared that I dared a smart ass like
you at good commuter given up about
several dozens and Emma stuffy but I had
800 smartasses insomnia the computer
human interface conference at the MIT
Media Lab by all means the same thing is
you see your response is very
interesting it's very much like the
three executives at a different
executives at Microsoft saying oh there
are still there's still basic programs
in the textbooks don't don't worry
they'll go away I mean I this is the
amazing thing it's kind of like only
Steve Jobs understood what the GUI meant
when he toured Xerox PARC and nobody
else saw what they were seeing I
remember in the mid-1980s hypercard
hypercard comes out and the universal
response was oh that's cute but why
would anybody want to click on a hot
spot on that screen and cause another
screen with here I don't get it we have
these honeypot jar drawing attractive
states and we have things that just
repel vision people don't look until you
have a mark andreasen you know you have
a ten berners-lee who says hello I saw
hypercard and I refused it's noticing
all been it's been done before who cares
all that's going to affect is how much
money I make
off of this the fact is it is not being
implemented it's not happening and
that's what I care about and if getting
a patent is going to help me
show show some people it is not
happening the entire general suite of
ways of doing things online is not
happening I'm not talking about the
implementation of this or this I tried
that for years I say here's our holy
seen implementation and I say well it's
not as sexy a second what you can get
staba cars off the shelf you can't get
this off the shelf because it's never
been I don't know what to do quite
frankly if the papist doesn't get people
to say I guess it's never been done cool
I guess it's been under john s your
problem is a chi MIT Media Lab I mean
I've seen papers that do things like
this but somebody wrote a paper
something the implementation after that
in academia well if there's is that
again if there's a paper on this or a
paper on that then it cuts down in the
range of my path it is an insanely
aggressive patent absolutely insane
because I saw I thought WTF you know hey
I'll draw attention to the whole field
by now as it turns out in the process of
drawing the patent patent office did
find two little things it is I don't
hope I don't own all proximity and
orientation in all implementations and
all results due diligence I will
perfectly be happy to point you in there
with those directions and if you find
some more we will add that to due
diligence and if as a result of you guys
going out there and finding all sorts of
previous examples and deciding to
implement them you leave me with nothing
then Google will start providing all
this wonderful things
and at least you'll give me a pat on the
head for how to smart will you do that
because that's all mark andreasen has
that's all timbers we have cattle the
head and I hope you give that I hope
you'll give that to us you know for
having come here and start you don't get
darling do this tom find somebody down
the road who will do miss stuff you know
have a satisfaction comes from that the
other well has stated to separate a
little bit in my case I hope that did I
showed my projects devastating different
people on this show in Warsaw last year
with it was attended the presentation
was attended by all these government
ministers and urban planners who were
thrilled with it I was very fearful the
next time I flown to Warsaw I'm going to
be surrounded by these horrible suburbs
of the curly room he did not mention
this time that he stopped it you did
last time you need to make it part of
your regular that half of what
you're doing is isn't this cool and a
half of what you're doing is as a
cautionary tale yeah because I need to
QC out watching this thing so it's a you
know the both the the compelling vision
that good stuff hoppers doesn't know
that the foreboding as well and that's
what art is supposed to do is we said
any other questions before we do a quick
dip back into our then let's do it but
yeah remember i wonder if the reason why
that one who does that is because
oh I could be however one would think
that it would have been tried oh I
believe that there are more than enough
examples in this world ring where there
are honeypot attractor states and blind
spot distractions states that the
hypothesis that it's is one now are you
telling me that a working hypothesis is
that people do not want methods to just
to orient their attention better online
according to prioritization factors that
mimic the prioritization factors of your
life I'm saying that you gave them to me
look I want to use that to place now
that me and then did anybody else hear
me say that this was a schematic to
demonstrate the effects of orientation
not a way not a not a service that I was
offering as a finished product did
anybody hear me say that once hope I
don't think the ideas in there Toby
useful they may turn out to be but if
you want he was implement that by taking
happen you just killed most of them I
mean people will shy away from it
because it happened that I can say as I
tried the other approach that maybe your
reaction I'll bet you there are other
people in the work in the room who is
Lucy that the patent existence of the
patent is evidence that this is another
investigative area what I said well
people could try to buy an important
meeting
as a silly kill revealed I mean is it
possible that maybe the patent means
that I can be a guy who says I want this
to be a generalized thing that goes out
to a myriad hosts there are people in
this world I would not sell the patents
to because they would then either use it
to kill these things or to create a
single shrink wrapped box and what I
would like to see happen out of this is
a generalized suite of hosts empowered
methodologies to allow a million
different people to compete with each
other on hosting services by provide
providing different mixes and matches of
the effects of reputation effects of
proximity orientation effects of texting
services I have to tell you that if you
consider text jesting services to be
something that unimpressive you then I
actually have to tell you I die I don't
think you understand I just don't think
you have a grasp of what you just saw
because how could you in this room in
this company not believe that offering
Ted offering text analysis services that
then alter the effective delivery of
text and text and speech and other
information I mean at a different level
looked at from a different side it's
what you do so I don't mean to be you
know when you came out after me
synchronous and asynchronous kia
yes the synchronous stuff and then you
your demos based on that and I think any
of the question is yeah why should we be
interested in that why why not apply
some of these techniques to the
asynchronous self I I never said that
they don't apply to the asynchronous
side I think that as I said in the state
a synchronous slight it needs
improvement many of these jesting
services could easily apply to
asynchronous many of the tools that
enable us to work offline mentally what
I'm asking for is a step back and saying
what is it that we do we're very smart
are there some things that we do that
did not make it online during the
hypertext thing we look we point we tap
and we want loop pages duh this an
analogy firmly life was suggested for
the online world and it took five years
for somebody to say here's the death
more than five years all I'm saying is
let's take a look at what our brains do
and I'm sure I missed several and if you
come away from here with nothing else
then let's step back what am i doing
right now when I'm at a cocktail party
what am i doing right now when I'm being
at my most creative what am i doing
right now when some piece of art is
shaking nail you guys are the ones who
are supposed to be doing that stepping
back now and then and groping of the
elephant okay
yeah take the optimistic approach since
a lot of character that earlier part of
your presentation was sort of showing
about how these changes in human
approach to information interaction
continually iterated over the centuries
are deep do you see your what you're
proposing here today has inevitable and
yet as a pivotable as the GUI as
inevitable as as as a hyper card what
absolutely I mean what is that what with
at me is that I mean I those were those
necessarily inevitable with the land and
evitable and why at that particular
moment the lens is a great example shown
because lenses did exist in Roman times
and they did not caused the disruption
it did not cause the shake-up envisioned
printing was crudely available they
could have carved a page of a book and
procreated many many copies the
pyramidal social structure and the
assumptions that were embedded therein
the hero of Alexandria had steam
mechanisms not just the spinning thing
with steam driven Pistons that would
move stage productions it's the deeper
set of assumptions that are part of the
Enlightenment that enable you to take
these augmentations and
make them shaking of disruption
terrifying things that are given to
everybody so what I usually say when I
talk about these ethical shifts is it's
this this confluence of technological
cultural and social transformations you
know these these techniques is
augmentations that are available that
may have been sitting out there for
centuries for decades for weeks but they
coincide they provoke these other ways
of these other kind of idea appeals and
so you both kinda lau a way of
articulating of seeing this world around
you and this new kind of powerful
mechanism for interacting with it so
that for instance in the 15th century is
the key to the Renaissance that how it
spurs the transformation of the
ecclesiastical by sin site being able to
show the world as opposed to just some
sort of hierarchical representation so
we now became a part of that which was
worthy to be represented and in fact the
same mechanisms also allowed us to
quickly engage and train you know in
commerce across seas and new forms of
building archetype of new forms of
architecture so they have these
cumulative effects and I think that's
the key thing that we're trying to look
at it this particular moments what are
these kind of cumulative cross-cultural
cross social effects what and where
might there be scenes in them where
might there be gasps gasps and are there
ways and we can we recognize these gap
areas are there then approaches that we
can take to kind of bridge them and what
end those bridges become the nesa
sary means by actually you know getting
us out of this whatever predicament were
in and getting us into the next cultural
and social phase yeah I was I was
stunned when I realized that the people
of those days they didn't consider their
sailing ships or their cannon to make
them better than the Romans they had
been living in an injury already complex
with Rome for so long that they were
simply assuming they had some additional
toys and Sedition this it was wasn't
even printing it was perspective that's
so rocked the intelligence II of Europe
and said Romans never had this they
never had it at all we have moved ahead
and from that moment on bang they
stopped referring to Roman law they
stopped referring to Jerome as what the
classicists did but it wasn't a bang but
you see what I'm getting at it the task
before us every now and then is to step
back and say what tools are we missing
what things are we missing what ideas
are we missing because we don't have
time the enemies of this enlightenment
realize and in the next 20 to 30 years
we are either going to make it or blow
up the world or fall back into old time
human patterns and they believe that the
way to avoid calamity is to go back to
pyramidal control and they may be right
they may be right but I'm not gambling
on that neither is anybody else in this
room I'm getting on the notion that we
can take the enlightenment to its point
where we have sustainable
sustainable technologies where we have
problem-solving tools that are so agile
so resilient so good in anticipation so
good at rethinking and rapid real-time
now we can deal with the problems
quicker than they come up because that's
what the original slide was its
problem-solving tools and looking for
gaps in those problem-solving tools and
i'll tell you where the biggest gap is
in my opinion right now it's in helping
the people to be self-organizing robust
smart ma be resilient citizens we talked
about it you guys have been providing
them with the one portion of the toolset
that actually works they can get online
and they can get into the op knowledge
mesh and they can find stuff I'm yelling
at the one room full of people who are
actually doing something about this
sorry you're the only ones in yellow
except for the defense guys and all they
want is anticipation anticipation
anticipation I point out to them that
the all-volunteer army ironically is the
first Army in all of American history
that doesn't know what to do with
volunteers all the ways in the past
there was a professional army and their
job was to be a tripwire knowing that as
soon as war started millions of young
men and women would stand in line to
avenge them and that was our pattern I
ask the general the other day and I
what would you do with a million
volunteers he blinked at me said I
wouldn't know what to do with 10,000 and
he was rocked back because he hadn't
realized that the ship and gone so far
away from our American traditions then
that he was conceptually incapable of
even noticing that it happened and
that's what we're here for you want to
see the want to go yet or it didn't
sorry that I'm gonna start adult this
model there was no plan it just is
something they they love to do it you
know it's not really a person what you
think what you're talking about as many
different levels with Google's business
model we can open that result from
anticipation in anybody expect I
honestly don't know i can tell you
though that what google provides google
provides the preconscious for a simple
session and the preconscious sifts a
minimal myriad things and tosses up a
selection of them for our consciousness
to them push aside another ninety nine
percent until we say i'm going to ponder
this the exact and analogy because i've
been making a lot of them the analogy
for the human
is what's called the preconscious Google
does that Google's job is not to and be
engaged in the process of anticipation
to provide anticipatory analytical tools
now you may go into that as a side
business you may go into that fine fine
but right now the service you're
providing the world is the preconscious
what we don't have is a civilization
filled with citizens who have analytical
tools of the ability to discourse with
each other winnowing and find in
fine-tuning and creating coalescing
smart mobs on the on the spot we do not
happen would you guys like to see the
see the video yeah this will just start
and then sir and we think a little bit
so this as i said this project results
in multiple forms this is part of a
installation of this museum in austria
called ARS electronica coolest museums
in the world and i thought that before
they had one of my pieces are there but
this it's a for screen installation and
this is one of the screens the people
interact with its load
right now so and the other screens are
machinima so take the same database and
kind of machine
automatically generates cinema so this
environment so I'm controlling this
tornado of cars and as I move into the
environment it's scattered with all this
these photograph photo dramatically
arrive architectural fragments that have
these we do have some behavior embedded
in them I have these physical forces I'm
a tornado after all and and I'm doing
multiple things so as I moved to the
environment the road system grows around
my page
kind of gets in places that I can
I exert forces of the masses of these
jokes
the ride
size and shape but also as I'm doing it
I'm sorting the environment so behind me
you can see these houses as a if they
land in particular Vlad areas they start
to self assemble themselves into houses
and try and go back to their kind of
original state grab much like proteins
randomly jogging against each other
inside a cell yeah so it's a form of a
there's a form of a genetic algorithm
that operates as you move deeper and
deeper down the roads and it's a little
bit hard to navigate a single podium
spot and this is a multi-user
environment so there are other so there
are other users that you would see is
their kind of vortices moving through
this space now the next iteration of
this is to is to engage users in the
actual speeding of the databases of this
so right now all the data this I'd gone
out and grabbed myself but what I want
to be able to do is have a you know it's
like do these things in museums I want
to have a station where people actually
select in part of the earth they want to
put through this pipeline that they
actually can you can actually get people
to take is the process of extracting
these objects and these objects are
really funky you know they're not
perfect you know photo chromatic
extractions of the 3d geometry
they're filled with Jarvis and one of
these I have often say about art is what
your we do as an artist this is a
choreographed and artifacts that's
certainly much mission project is doing
I want people to be able to actually
take their own photos and uploading
Methodist system so their own data
becomes a part of this requirement and
then the last step is that this becomes
a right now a multi-user environment for
museums but I want to be able to have it
as a online module but of course it you
have a lot more complexity around the
graphic
trees right
there are parallels between that's in RX
Mary which is attempted to what how many
of you have heard of Spore that's why i
will write had us up yesterday for hours
with the news trying to find out how far
we've gotten them for I've been on extra
artisan I guess he was probably pretty
really quite up in reflection anyway
school you know academics and haven't
really taken it very far at all so even
in South lunch but the XO area takes a
different approach than coach
but this is this is also
people generated by choices user choice
loser designer
shall we are interested in
and that all are so like this is a
choreography of system so you have ik
genetic algorithms physics l systems so
I have data that is in this rich
algorithmic system based environment the
end result is the articulation of how
other systems interact and long side and
so that's you know another kind of what
my talk to people like oh right what
what we're really looking at is how the
you know these future cultural forms now
increasingly depend upon smarter and
smarter
computational environments that way that
just kind of like blindly assemble data
which is how you're in town may or other
text database
that that accomplished a lot but as we
move forward we end up getting these
orders of magnitude data environments we
have
have higher and higher level
expiration and
better and better computation
now fortunately this thing how moore's
law keeps kids going along and they keep
soaking up every kind of last bit of it
as we go as we soak up every last
Atlantis cape so this is a chilling
aspect which is also intentional because
as you can tell by looking each other is
not exactly perfect developer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
