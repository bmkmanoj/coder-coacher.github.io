to introduce ominous I'm a Thomas on a
recent attempted trip to Antarctica and
even though the the boat didn't actually
make it out of port it wasn't his fault
and he did a terrific job of trying to
rescue the expedition almost has started
out in the spent of time in the Israel
Israeli Special Forces learning to dive
and doing secret secret super secret
stuff graduated to doing war photography
for a while and then decided that he
would like to do something more
constructive and meaningful with his
life and is now has for the past 40
years been doing underwater photography
of large animals and photography of
large animals in the land and leading
expeditions to show people the fantastic
wilderness wildlife that's out there and
convinced them that we should preserve
it so like to welcome him to Google
thank you
isn't it open okay good afternoon
everybody and thank you said for the
opportunity IMed settings he mentioned
just about two months ago on a street of
not on the street really but on the way
to the boat to a trip and the friendship
develop since then of food the whole
time so thank you for the opportunity
and bring me into this particular group
of amazing what you build here and I I
heard about it but you never been here i
matter of fact I used to know very well
as you know Polly gene Clark the
previous owner and the president of
Silicon Graphics which you maintain in
part of the building now this is my
connection only so to be here again it's
really a fascinating cycle of history as
said mention I I wasn't well I born in
Israel and I mean Israeli I all those
American citizenship and thank you
thanks God and thank you America for the
opportunity because I left the country
because I did not want to get involved
anymore after almost 20 years in special
services and in special forces in all
kind of counterterrorism
I did my own and I wanted to express my
own fine way to express myself I came to
America to learn film and television I
got the University of New York and I did
a test but I could not continue because
the cost of the credit was about two
hundred seventy two hundred dollar
credit so I started robbing the taxi for
six months I was driving the taxi in New
York but only in America you can do it
believe me but there's no other country
in the world and I travel involved 120
countries around the world you cannot do
what I've done here and what what we
what we able to achieve in this country
with the people like you have here and
while driving a taxi
I was actually also at night during the
day I was teaching driving and one of
the dive shop in New York and I then I
took a group small group of four people
to the Red Sea to the place which I knew
very well and from there everything just
went crazy and I start taking pictures
on the water and that's how my love and
my photo because I was a photographer
beforehand I did as you say well
photography indeed fashion I did racing
car racing like I raised my by my
surface race until today motorcycles but
the love of photography and the ocean
took all over took all my life away two
completely different
and I continue is that for about 10
years running trips around the world to
most exotic places and start from
America to places that hardly people
travel before today is very popular
places like the special Island Papua New
Guinea Nui Island of the South Pacific
and Madagascar and so on but as it
become popular and my desire was not to
be in a business to our diving trip my
design was photography and then I
realized the lack of connection between
the big animal and the perception of the
big animal in the public compared to
what is really in the ocean and how to
connect between the two how to bring
them one way to go out to do magazine
story to bring the pictures and so on so
forth but that is very remote you still
not connected and then I took my
knowledge that I had before for the
first 10 years in the United States
running the expedition and put them
together but when you work with big
animals you cannot work with big group
of people cannot take 10 or 20 or 30
people and go around and just here is a
whale and here is a dolphin and here is
a blue great white it is become an issue
of very small group four to six people
the most just like when the BBC going to
do their own expedition filming or like
the National Geographic do I do only
with a very small group of people and
that's how it all started and since 1990
I focus all my effort of going after big
animals either by myself searching the
place and after these bring people with
me but only and we can do it only once
or twice a year because each animal have
a pattern of behavior and the pattern of
behavior in certain parts of the world
which we can spot otherwise it will be
difficult it's like finding a SRM a
needle in a haystack but if you if I do
my study well and follow the course
there will be always each animal will
have about two to four weeks period of
time that they are located some parts of
the world that I can bring myself my
camera the team of photographer all
people like yourself like certainly are
into a place and to enjoy the encounter
and that's what I'm going to share with
you and if you have any question I'll
answer up to this
in addition to that I also brought some
of my equipment so you'll be able to see
the difference and the housing change
between film analog into digital and
light underwater because otherwise
without light we don't see any of the
color all right as you see here those
are years of having fun pushing the
envelope like you guys doing all the
time
you're sitting behind the computer and
these wonderful places I have to go no
complaints I love it to go out in the
ocean go out in a high wind in a desert
in the ice but explore and explore the
wilderness being on when I come back
here I know how wonderful is discomfort
when you go out there you realize the
difference in life and what life is all
about not just sitting at home this was
the day that our still was shooting with
a film camera and just to let you know
I'm in a way proud of it today but up
until then up until six months ago I was
shooting only film I still have about
100 to 200 rolls of film in my
frigerator and my girlfriend did not
want to touch it because it smelled from
film I enjoy it for me is like for me is
like aroma for me it's like who knows
what but she does not want to touch the
refrigerator but the past six months has
not worked digital and some of the
images you see here will be also digital
images and I'll point them down to you
and those are the places around the
world that all travel in in other words
if you look at the map there's almost no
place in the world there is water that
I've not been in except if Mars is part
of the of the our planet or our system
I've not been there yet and there are
little water there apparently
but when you come to the to our planet
elder way from Antarctica to the North
Pole in 1999 I put the first expedition
ever and David Barr was with me on a
trip through the to the North Pole and
on the
nuclear hides breaker we got all the way
to the North Pole and dove under the
depth is four miles or four kilometer
about - almost - enough miles there is
nothing there really but just we broke
the ice we look at GPS zero degree and
we went underwater for about hundred
feet and we said goodbye we done it
anyway we start with probably one of the
most photographed animal polling there
are more pictures of polar bear there
are polar bear in wild there's also a
subject that become really one of the
topics of conservation not just
conversation but conservation today in
the world and there is a great pressure
on the American government especially
the American government to declare them
as endangered species and to protect
them because of the diminishing ground
and ice and therefore also food for the
polar bear and we estimate we meaning
the world of research estimate that by
year 2040 to 2050 we will be without
polar bear on our planet
the images here that you see of polar
bear I'm coming from the Canadian Arctic
and just for size for relationship that
you know that you are part of it we are
part of it and you see the size
difference between the poles of the
polar bear to the palm of this young man
this is where we'll find them mostly in
this time of the year and this time of
the year we're talking about the months
of between May and June when the ice
start breaking and what we see here is a
pack ice and because of wind it pushed
the pack ice close to the mainland and
therefore you see all this rock it's not
rocks of course but pushed ice the polar
bear will find refuge there the polar
ball will go around and look for break
in the ice and where he think and they
know where there are scenes because the
scenes will come in for fresh air and
then eventually they ponder try to hunt
them as you see in some of the other
pictures it is not very easy to get it's
very it's quite complicated to be able
to get that close to a polar bear but it
can be done part of what I'm my effort
is to dispel the myth of the danger and
dispel the myth of how we use animal to
other portray hatred to prey danger
portray whatever that we portrayed but
is hardly ever we portray the truth and
we use our intelligent which we have
above all those animals we are able to
get close to them and to be with them in
peace and but that is also the attribute
when working with a small group of
between 4 to 6 people if we had to work
with bigger group is very difficult to
hold or to keep people quiet and
peaceful and passionate you took three
or four days to be able to get to this
particular moment and eventually crawl
that close to the bearer
and here you see the bear with it
without trying to look for food and
bears are extremely extremely naturally
the little almost over 3,000 years and
naturally they are they have a very
extreme sense of ability to figure out
where the food is and best based on
their eyesight they know where the ice
is very thin that mean that recently one
of the seal make a hole there to breathe
and they will come in and they'll put
all the body weight on over the whole
you know to break the ice to be able to
get closer and catch the seal just under
just like here
we missed the moment and it take about
five to seven try till eventually a
polar bear will really hit the
motherlode that will get will get
himself a seal so they work really hard
to get the food it's not very easy and
like life for them is not easy now with
the diminishing ice is even harder for
them to find food and that's why we
found we are finding more and more the
quality bodies of polar bear completely
is out of starvation on the ice oh there
is report something that we've never
done before never helped before as
recently as last year that polar bear
Mel come to the den chased the female
and feed on the young one interesting
images of eventually was able to catch
the seal while we were not closed close
to it but we came just too late just to
see the last pieces of the food and
that's what's left over from the same
one day we got too close to them to the
polar bear or at least the photographer
myself and one of the ways it's a female
will do
she will slide in or to a position when
from them she can jump almost 7 meter 20
feet knowing that and like we all have
what they call comfort zone and knowing
that that the comfort zone that we we
cause the call I cause the comfort zone
we just stepped back and she just
allowed us to stay there and practically
play with the Cubs after this so all of
this is being being very attuned to the
environment and very sensible to what
what signals the environment give us
other will be changes of light other big
change of wind or wind direction or the
animal animal behavior or change in the
behavior of the animal it is signal
first one for us to understand if we pay
attention and that's how we bring
wildlife photography into the screen
into a book or into a this kind of
opportunity like sitting together with
you
and all those images some of your
photography I believe and all those
images are not taken with very extensive
or expensive camera Gil is only about
the 300 millimeter lens and sometime
with 1.4 teleconverter which make it
about 400 millimeter lens but you don't
need any more than this the idea is
working with very small group being
quiet being patient or passionate with
the environment things eventually
allowed himself and a lot of stuff to
happen in the 44 of our eyes
it is a desert out there but is white
desert it's cold and it's beautiful and
the light is just spectacular from day
from day at night it is actually it is
not night time because we are there
during the month of May or June is
almost 24-hour daylight and it's just
amazing the color and the variation of
color that you see because of the light
changes we move fast and run away from
the polar bear into the other side of
the world exactly opposite into South
Africa and to another great predator
that suffered tremendously out of bad
reputation and undeserved lease oh yes I
know it just last week there was a
swimmer that was got caught out in name
in San Diego by a great white but listen
guys I don't think any of you will cross
the street when it's a red light and
especially not during rush hour right
well if we know that we know that you
can rush hour many more cars on the
street and red light that means that the
driver can go why would we go
deliberately early morning and late
afternoon when it's the best time for
great try to feel what we've got while
we go swimming we just because we
disregard nature and disregard and we
think we are the best thing and the only
thing in the planet but there is other
inhabited on the planet early morning
late afternoon is the best time for
great white to feed no matter what area
or any shark and I will show you some
very good in very very good behavior as
a result of that those images of the
great white you see here all of them
taken in South Africa and the place that
we are growing is about tune of ours
anybody been in South Africa and kept on
all right but tune of our east of Cape
Town there is a small little town called
a fishing town called hands by or
hermanos very close to hermanos the
small town they called a husband a
fishing town and from there into the
Indian Ocean and about ethanol by boat
into the larger island called geyser
Island and sorry the larger Island
called iron Island and the smaller on
coal geyser and between them where the
finger point is what they call the shark
alley is about 500 to 700 meter about
2,100 feet long alley with depth of no
more than about 18 feet or 20 feet of
water but that's what you see here
that's why great white come down now a
great white there is not all year round
there is a time of the year that would
be more than than the other time of the
year and during the time of May June
July and why because the seal give birth
in January in about June July the sea
the young one are about six months old
and then that will go to the water
that's when the shark will come in the
population on the island rise from about
30,000 sales during the months of let's
say October till about May and from the
morning increase to about almost 45,000
15,000 young one of almost every year
the island nobody allowed to go on the
island nobody there are just a range of
once in a what once in the blue goes on
an island but otherwise no human
interaction whatsoever but in the water
there are the white and that's what
happened the scenes are playing in the
wave and the short just blue just below
just below the surface and as the scene
notice the shark around they start to
run away and job as fast as they can and
the chunk get closer and closer and the
seal jump even higher and faster till
eventually the shot get totally out of
the water try to catch the seals and it
not again at this time will take about
ten try and we do it or we know it only
because of so much research be taking
place on the taking place out there so
many student from so many university
places them out there for many years
that we know that on average a shark a
great white who make ten try before
eventually he will be able to succeed
and have a catch so the seal are having
a good time and they succeed this time
because they have a short time memory
showed but in short-term memory so they
don't know what will happen next like
they forgot what ever before and the
continued to play in the self and then
all of the sudden the shark jump out and
that's a total sequent sequence of a
shark jumping out by the way this
picture I think I have it here yes last
year anybody knows about the competition
of the BBC of rock wildlife photographer
of the Year last year this picture one
as you see behind them the first prize
in animal behavior but I'm the reason
and eventually that is a mission to set
is that just as of this morning or
yesterday I got another email message
the two of my pictures you see him later
on they're here on a presentation two of
the twelve my picture that I said this
year also been considered for the first
place for the first place that I was
shared with you later so and that is the
full sequence of a great white bridge
what's happen is you all know physics
the angle of the angle of rise of the
Sun over the horizon is the same angle
of the hardware the Sun will penetrate
the water so late morning between 6 or 7
o'clock in the morning until about 9 o
clock in the morning the Sun rises only
about 20 or 30 degree of the horizon
this only is much like in drawing the
water if you have only so much light the
seal that goes under at 40 50 or 60 feet
there's I'm sorry the shock that goes
out at 40 50 or 60 feet the seal cannot
see it the shark rock up in case any
silhouette and that's what the heat
around 10 o'clock this behavior stop
totally you not see it happening anymore
started back in afternoon at but 4
o'clock exactly the same thing the shot
the Sun Goes Down 20 or 30 degree over
the horizon seen swimming on the surface
cannot see underwater because the Sun
body if you see any surface or the upper
side is dark the scene cannot see the
the shark warming on the water but the
shark can see the scene on the surface
boom
don't swim early morning or late
afternoon on a surface if you do your
you're on a subject otherwise all their
log is open for us
naturally we feed them or we are taught
them by a charm we feed them as pieces
of fish basically and bycatch from the
fishermen and as a result of working
with them for a long time since 19 since
1990 practically speaking in South
Africa
Andre the local Ranger and myself found
way that we actually can interact with
the great white and not just be afraid
of them around or be on the contrary and
what's happen is as we put bait in the
water and we attract the stuff to come
in but we put just the charm ooze out
abate the shock will come in and we
start to bite on the engine on the motor
we do not want to have the motor not
that we want to break the enamel of the
shark teeth so we try to push but
anytime we push they put the hand on top
of the short Mouse on its note if you
want to call it all of the sudden the
shark will get into a catatonic state of
mind but they will be almost paralysed
will go vertically in the water and just
stay there and open its mouth and jaws
like you see here now if you see here
and nobody got hurt
that's how when I take the people that's
how people are protected we put the
people in the cages one or two person
the cage and bring the shell key in and
the photographer sometime will go out
and bring the picture back home so you
have you can put it on your on your wall
on your table somewhere
being an open-water was a great right
yes it is possible it's not something
that will blame practice it's not
something we give to allow everybody to
do it of course but if you if we do it
mindfully when conditions are right we
can condition right that we know the
professional that we work with that
means disability that means no other
coming in a name in an air in a radius
of about two or three mile around us we
can go out of the water we swim with
three or four or five great white at the
same time it's not a trouble the trouble
is because of too many mix information
too much data in the water that creates
confusing confusion also for the shark
and make them behave in a way which are
unpredictable but when there are no
confusion in water when the things are
normal as could be normal in this
environment of today is not as no issue
swimming with them as you see in the
next few picture not just swimming with
them but practically even coming close
and touching them because they are not
feeding under water the feeding only on
the surface or on the bottom they are
scavengers they will clean up the ocean
they are Muslim and we need them badly
to maintain them and not to continue
poach them and stop this sad feeling and
so on and so forth and killing great
white because of the jaws for souvenirs
because we are big enough we are too big
we as we have bubbles and we are noisy
in water they come in just like a
fireman like a policeman they come they
look around they see what is there and
they go away but they never made any
threat toward us when we are in the
water and try to film them just like
this one
anybody knows what is that was that okay
what are the thought what okay one other
thought the largest fish ever live in
the ocean or animal ever live on a
planet metal effect and it just sounds
from here on the cost on a border
between San Diego and Mexico
the blue whale the largest animal ever
live on our planet the rich to a size of
almost over a hundred feet in length
over 30 meters all wells all citations
have several very distinct behavior and
one of which that the animal that
elicitation live in northern hemisphere
don't close to the south and those that
live in the south
don't cross to the north we don't know
why there are so many things still we
don't know like you discover here every
day and try to solve so many issues with
out in the wild also there are many more
things we don't know and one of this is
a phenomena y and u and they travel for
some of them like the grey well travel
over eleven thousand mile but they will
not leave the northern hemisphere or the
southern hemisphere will cause all of
the all of dissertations family except
perhaps dolphin all of the cetacean
family will not cross from the South
Pole from the South amis field to the
north and vice versa
dolphin Kafka's which is our dolphin and
we talk about very shortly
I'll will do it but when it come to the
wells where as will not do it here we
see the blue well of behad not too nice
you see it gets its name because of
because of the color the tint of bluish
pollution water and here you can see
clearly the relationship and its size
compared to a vessel this vessel that we
were on is about 30 feet in length or 31
or 32 she was from from the stern to the
bow and that's just from the air about I
was about 200 feet above above the
subject about the two subjects and be
able to bring this alive and we have a
sense of really relationship between the
two
and a picture with underwater
this tell is almost 21 feet in with this
picture taken from the surface I'm here
only about 6 inches away
if anybody knows photography this was a
fisheye lens that will give you a give
you this dysfunction of the horizon but
we'll come in with the lens about almost
16 inches away from it and be able to
catch the well and all the way down to
the island in the background of Baja
only 15% of the blue whale will flock
most of them do not look not just like
not just like the sperm whale or the
humpback whale many other whales don't
look at all and again we don't know why
but that's one way which had identified
the whale by the shape and by the cuts
and crevices that are on each there and
that's how we identify them and there
are places or there are group scientists
which do continual research and try to
under defy how many wells we have in the
world today what's happen is we used to
have about close to a million blue whale
on the planet at the beginning of the
19th century around 1900 to 1910 1910
today these less than 11,000 blue left
on the planet now the slowest growing
animal in addition to the to the
northern right whale of the cost of New
York and Massachusetts and Connecticut
which are only about 3 to 400 of them
left there are on the verge of the being
extinct no question about it
there are bigger there are also issues
along together with the polar bear as I
mentioned there was a bigger there was
big issue passed through through the
Congress and to the Senate and they did
not decide on it yet unfortunately it
pressed the deadline and there was a
request to slow the ship that coming in
the shipping shipping line along the
northeast of the United States to avoid
further collision with the northern
right whale which attended the this
issue of collision identified one of the
biggest threat and be the number one
accident and of course to death among
the northern right whale in the past 30
or 40 years
but the government still decided to put
your head on a pocket and do other
things
this bidded the beautiful Bay of San
Francisquito on one of the island in
Baja California from which we operate
and we actually play camp above the
night and morning we take the boat out
and looking for blue well for other day
and that's the boat that usually most of
the trip we usually do on an other on a
motorboat of sailboat which give us the
flexibility and the ability to go many
different places to go to a many
beautiful as you see here a many
beautiful bays of Refuge place so we can
enjoy yourself not just in the water but
also see the vistas and what's happened
on the land and we go to the animal that
anybody probably know from so many
movies and so many advertisement and
then of course the game part of Disney
we're going to see the killer whale and
anybody knows why this animal got its
name killer whale another misnomer of
our Western civilization
excuse me now when when the ugly sixes
try to find the treasure that the
Spaniard and the Portuguese left
underwater with the Spanish galleon
coming out from Central America during
the the the new world all the way
crossing back to Europe they went to
look at the manifest of those vessel
that are in Toledo and Seville and
everything of course nothing is Spanish
and Portuguese anybody speak Spanish of
course there's some men speak Spanish so
how do you say killer whale is punished
I said banana and that's what they
describe does those expert of those
manifest was the skipper's or the
Navigator of the boat which was the more
intelligent or the more able person then
the skipper most of the time the
navigator
it wasn't writing and they described the
animal they described him that like
feeding on other well and they call it
killer whale and the names stark in
English but actually there occurs and
actually there are only dolphin and they
are truth dolphin there are today about
three different species we know the
categorize three species and maybe four
or five of killer whales or authors if
you want to call them in the right way
we have resident we have transient and
we have nomad and the difference between
all of them it is about social behavior
the free and feeding and the area which
they are roaming the Walker that you
know most are the one from Canada from
British Columbia or from the Orca that
you see here from Norway are all
resident they are usually a group of
eight to fifteen animal mother only
mostly female and her sisters and the
claw under curves and some male that
keep the race going but there is no
ancestry these noble not inner inner
breeding the transient are smaller group
usually about six to eight animal I'm
only one family and only unique family
and then there is the nomads which
usually to two individual or solitaire
male that get together and operate in
open water
the transient and normal are open
working in all water of the world they
will go to cold water they go to warm
water there is no limitation the
transient the resident will stay in one
particular place like the water British
Columbia like the one in name you know
me and here you are in Norway when when
the weather is pretty cold because the
time of the you to come to see them is
around November December and now push
more into January February as a result
of the herring coming in into the field
the herring is a small fish that we eat
and we love so much come to the field in
order to hold the metabolism during the
winter time usually the old time of the
year now in open sea of the sea the
Arctic sea and during the wintertime
they all congregate together they get
into the fuel system which is very deep
and very cold and that's how the whole
the metabolism till the springtime when
they go south and then go to to mate and
to where and to resident or later ends
but in the winter time when they come
into the field they all cough all of
them from the open sea and because it is
very small tight environment is easy for
us to see them and what we see outside
we see them when they are actually
excelling they are warm-blooded like us
and when they excel the warm air ups are
spent in a cold air that on the surface
and we be able to identify them and get
close and to be able to swim with them
the spy hub out of curiosity the tail
slapping from other happiness or
communication between each other and we
discover and does the series of images
that you see next are images the shot in
1993-94
the first time ever those images were
actually been caught and understand the
phenomena which how the killer well
really all those trans resident how the
feed anybody have an idea how killer
well feed what the process and how they
utilize their ability to to feed on a
hearing cow selling yeah and then what
right and then what about how they catch
the fish itself okay that's correct what
they will do as the herring coming into
the field their big shoulder bigger than
all this building and they come in a
group of about ten or fifteen of them
and start to circle around them and they
cut a small part like this like this
auditorium and they put them together
what's happen is they're having like
people when they're in danger they all
get hugging each other they think that
if they get close to each other they do
not see the danger they come behind them
and they will be protected
so the Herrick do the same thing and the
Orca goes around them and this is a
phenomenal event only because the sound
underwater and the business is stunning
it is like a dance and a lot of sound a
lot of whistling and clicking and that
goes on and then as you say they're
having to get together very tightly and
then the Orca start feeding on them but
they cannot they will not come with the
mouth and take because the herring will
be faster
well the ANCA will do and look the shape
of the fish the fish run away because
they know the tail will come in and the
power of the tail because what they will
do if you see the tail as actually is
all the dolphin or they said they're
almost like an article it like an
a-frame right and they will around it a
bit and we that was so powerful that
will move the tail as powerfully as they
can and they create like echo in the
water and
of water pressure and this water
pressure researcher when they put a
microphone in the water we held slums in
water slums that nobody understood what
in this sound and the sound is the the
slope of the the tail in the water and
this so powerful that actually will
knock out 30 or 40 hearing actually
knock them out unconscious and then the
alcohol come in and take them one by one
these seven tone animal 21 feet that
when it's at five feet long
we'll take herring which is not more
than a feet long or less one by one and
everything you see here you see the tail
got caught in a cookie jar because this
is the movement and you see how it
filled its body all the way and wanted
to make the move and push so much water
with a powerful term this water pressure
create this water is so much so
pressurized and so powerful that the
herring just get because of the the the
best their article at the the swim
bladder and you see the swim bladder
just really tangling like that in the
surface and what they're there in just
hovering before they'll come and take it
sometimes they'll be curious also about
my fame and that's how close they come
to us and playful whistles we can go on
the water and we've been in the water
just like here everywhere in the world I
swim with them
the orcas are dolphins and dolphin have
Cynara the and you can feel if you are
so peaceful with yourself and so okay
just being there you can feel the
pinging through your suit in this case
we only dive of course with dry suit
because the water cold in about 40
degree water but you can feel the ping
and they know that we are there they
know it is amazing in 1982 and 83 I did
the project for National Geographic in
Patagonia with the ochre that actually
feeding on the seal they come on a beach
practicing off everybody heard about the
stranding orcas and what's happened is
was the first first year that this
behavior was reported and we could go
down there and I did it for Geographic
and was the first time we we got to the
water the photographer and myself we got
to the water and as we've been in the
water the Orca stop their behavior they
will not come close to the beach when we
left the water two hours later the Orca
continued their behavior every day we
try to catch the pictures that come in
along the beach or along the water by
the beach and go out take the take the
seal off from the water point of view
since then when we reported this
behavior since then nobody allowed
anymore to go with the Oakland water in
Patagonia because it's only the is also
the only place in the world which orcas
team doing making this behavior what is
trending behavior taking scenes out of
the beach and they are doing it till
today so we learn from our mistake we
adopt immediately and make it clear to
everybody why and what the purpose of
that mother and comfort that's very good
to know and for all of us to know that
still they are breathing in this part of
the world and there are some some future
but all of cetacean suffering immensely
today because it is not about what the
young one it the problem is what the
female
feed himself throughout until she give
birth because as female feed and provide
the young one saturated milk which
heavily contaminated the young one are
not able to make a living and sustain
life and then we don't have future
generation
here's another mother and calf but this
one it is what I just in LA but I just
been highlighting this is a dead calf
and 1997-98 I did another special for
Geographic and this was the all kind no
way and the this was the picture that
actually saved the all production
because the photo booth the videographer
that were was beside so two of them
their camera jammed by the time we got
out of the water and we had only still
picture and I do mostly steel but
clearly you see how the mother had the
female killer young calf and you see
here the biblical code and okay
suffering today over 40 percent
mortality in the world and the main
reason is because of the young one are
not able to sustain does not have the
energy as the food that they are freedom
from the mother is so heavily
contaminated and this is from last year
this is another unfortunate case and we
don't know what happened to the Orca she
got caught in the fisherman net that
catch the herring and she carried that
with her and eventually she disappeared
we try to go diving we serve and try to
be able to release and cut the net the
net was over a hundred feet longer what
happen is the Orca all its power come
from the table this the only way we
shall she move and she'll need air
eventually after 20 minutes 30 minutes
no matter what she eventually she need
air to breathe and after a day carrying
a hundred foot a net behind her she'll
not be able to do it anymore and she'll
just collapse and die and actually drown
but there's some happy moment is some
happy time also in the wild and they do
it also without training they would jump
and they were like cause we saw so long
at the boat all of them give us this
kind of opportunity and the moment of
total peacefulness inside the field when
the moon just rise it was a moonrise
sunset the opposite side and then the
Orca was just calmly swimming in front
of us and we'll go for another one of
the great cetacean that you heard
probably the most is about the humpback
whales and here in the short story that
will take you from two corners of the
world one that we able to swim with in
the island of Nu and Tonga in the nui
anybody knows where Tonga and Ewing any
idea where they're not that good and
right now look at the map that's not
fair anybody know was Fiji's South
Pacific about 600 to 800 miles southeast
of Fiji will be Tonga and another three
or four hundred mile from there will be
the island of Nui clearly in the middle
of nowhere in the Pacific very small
group of people live there but it is
beautifully clear water and peaceful for
the ogre for the oil for the humpback
whale to find a refuge when the humpback
whale live in Tonga on this autonomous
field that means that there are place
the main place to feed on will be around
Antarctica because the cold water are
rich in plantain so the feed during
summer time between March till about
August September or August and then
September till November they will come
up north
throughout the protected island of Nui
French Polynesia and that's where they
will give birth we go there during the
month of September
to meet them and as you see the mother
and calf is a calf about two weeks old
and even the photographer in the water
just like in the picture I was waiting
for a little bit more minutes and so he
as long as I could hold my breath of
course it looked to me like minute but
Pauline was only few second he left the
water and as soon as he left the water I
was the only
person in the water the madam can feel
very very comfortable and they got back
together like like they do normally and
then I got this picture and what's also
in 97 it was the best picture of the BBC
competition and you have a single just
like we boys try to sync to our female
and try to attract them no we don't do
it very well but more in the nature and
the male are the singer and that's how
they attract the female to them they'll
go upside down tell up about 30 40 feet
just below the surface head down because
this is the best volume I get the volume
of the whole ocean and they start
singing and it is better than being in a
Carnegie Hall or any concert hall that
you find anywhere in the world
when we find a single nobody want to
leave everybody want to be in a water
and just listen and listen and listen it
will take about 20-25 minutes for the
sing it to do one song we'll come back
to the surface for a few minutes talk
enough enough enough
breath-of-fresh-air go back down to the
same place and continue singing it is
incredible just the encounter just to be
on the surface in the water in one more
than 80 to 90 degree on the surface
water are blue as you see it here I'm
just listening to the sound every year
the sound change but just by one
syllable it is amazing when you are
researching and able to look at record
that we have from the from the operator
that record them from year to year in
the past 10 years you can see that today
still the song that the sound 10 years
ago
part of it still remain but if you look
at the Sun from last year is almost the
same except he added one more version to
it it's just amazing mother nature and
what the phenomenon what we learned from
it this is how long the tell is the
diver was able to go down together with
me and if a type of average man about 5
8 or 5 5 can reach the field with other
6 feet long so this is double the size
you have a 12 feet long just the tail on
mother sick because he has also his hand
stretch so this is about almost 15 to 16
foot and the width of the tail of the
Hamburg Hamburg will be about 40 to 45
feet in length and weigh over 40 tonne
and there are very killings that will
come very close to us as long as we are
peaceful in the water and not pushing
against them they'll come as close as I
am to set right now just here just
curiosity
and there will be animated also move
along with our if we move to the left
they'll move to the left if you move to
the right then move to the right
and sometimes we'll jump totally out of
the water
you never know one and always be ready
but they will do it why we don't know
why they do it there is no one
explanation why a 40-ton animal will
lift itself totally out of the water and
we'll do it two or three or four five
times sometimes 70 times where did you
see that in Oh in Hawaii yes yeah and we
move further military far north all the
way to Alaska because it's the place
where we can photograph them when they
are feeding because the god are usually
during the months of June July August in
the northern hemisphere and where the
plankton is a plenty plentiful and then
they start feeling and the feeling what
they call in in corporate behavior and
we are on the boat we shut down the
whole system of the boat and you can
hear them and you can hear the bubbles
as they blowing them from the bottom
from a hundred feet and as the bloody
bubble is calling all the planten
together and as the plantain rise toward
the surface together with the bubbles
then the humpback whale come along with
it open the mouth all the way and only
one down on the surface as you see here
they close the mouth and close the jaws
they push the water out and they keep
all the kale inside food for the baleen
and I'll show you the baleen all this
hair if you see here this is the baleen
is almost like hair and the baleen is
the same material that our fingernail
made off and we see that even closer at
the moment and in the baleen again all
this and the closet the closet the jaws
push the water out and all the plankton
and it's something left inside and as
you see it here as the bar as the jaws
closed those are the baleen that helps
to keep the plankton incident another
technique that I deploy is having kayaks
those rubber kayaks and missiles so able
to get very very close to the animal
sometimes the animal get concerned or
afraid or the notice our behavior on a
surface kicking and people don't kick
very well so with the kayak we just
float on top of the surface very gently
and able to get very close to them
without concern and animal continue to
do what they want to do without being
afraid of us or we start being under
pressure
we move from there for another big
animal very little understood is the
walruses out in the Canadian hierarchy
the only animal ever attacked me or ever
been in encounter with all the animals
was the walrus and it's only because of
chain of coincidence that never happened
and lack of attention by the rest of the
code it usually we work with all the
crew was busy doing something else and
I'll be able to show you some one or two
images from this particular case this is
a in particular this is a loan and one
was and just like Aboriginal people that
knows when they're going to die they
will leave the village from far away
they're going to walk and eventually
they die by themselves the same thing
will also do and that's you see the size
you see the size of the animal but also
the size of those ivory it's very
unusual mother and calf like also
tension now very protective of the young
one
and we are able to get close to them
despite the fact that I feel some and
their big teeth if you want to call it
which they don't use to teach for
anything else but resting their head
they have no use because they feed only
on shells underwater
the blow and the feed on the shells on
the water we can get close to them but
again if we go to the level and take our
time we able to go to create a poll and
then close to it to a level which we
have what they call comfort zone for the
animal and for the personal to your ways
and those those of the animal the two
animal that actually was able eventually
to catch me was a mother and calf that
was back into the ice and we I supposed
to have the boat with them with my
assistant with me in the water but the
assistant when I got to the water he
lost his tank so the boat was busy
taking care of him try to get him out of
the water but I was already in water
with the camera moving toward the ice
floe where the mother silver where the
wall was and I did not know there is one
coming back behind me I turned around
just because of sense feeling a cyclic
o-6 feeling or sixth sense I turn around
just to look where is my assistant but
rather than assistant I see the mother
and the confidence on my side and she
came at me and it was just a distance
closer and we were that close and I
realized that she's coming at me I'm the
only target but I'm near the front of
her very vulnerable was the my tummy and
every parts of my body and my camera so
I turn around and I gave her my back
and she took it she put she put him
there and tooth into it and I got got
hold in my dry suit and cold waters not
to get in but that's not that bad
because she still there and then she
come again but this time she came the
distance was bigger different between us
bigger I was able to raise my my fame
and just touch her gently and then she
turn around and left
that's all not need to be part again
that's the best picture when they're
coming at me second time
the well shark now is the well shark the
largest fish in the ocean and can get to
a size of almost 40 feet in length and
this shark like many other do you know
by the way how many species of shark we
have in the ocean that we know and we
have any idea numbers more than 100 more
than 200 less than a thousand we have
about three hundred seventy eight
different species of shark in the ocean
but shark are suffering and we suffer
consequently every day because of the
the catch and then the shark finning it
is we losing close to fifty million
sharks a year for shark finning and that
mean our ocean become more and more
polluted because the shark most their
responsibility in nature is to clean the
water do you know how much of the oxygen
we breathe come from the ocean is a
tribute to the clean water of the ocean
fifty percent of our air of the air we
breathe come from the ocean the clear
day the oxygen the rest of that come
from the from the trees and changing of
the chlorophyll during the night and
that's we suffering too because of the
removing of the forest
well shall feed only on plantain look
very unusual why does that's why those
grooves in a body nobody knows but they
are beautiful to see and they are large
in size look at this relationship
between the diagram and the animal
that's a view for the dorsal fin and
that's a view from the tail
how small we are compared to this animal
out of this creation
and it did not swallow the diagram this
is not your line this is not a Bible and
we swim very close in this case is is a
female swimming very close is Tonya
doing very another Tonya Anya and Tonya
and one time we get osv swimming and
working photographer from the left
photographer from the right he turned to
close toward me I could not treat him
anymore on the camera side to put my
hand through just to haul him off and to
be able to continue without banging into
each other and I guess last but not
least of our presentation and I guess
what time is almost running in four
minutes right and we take you down to
Isla Mujeres very close to home to see
something extremely exciting and as you
see in the moment in picture is the
images on the counter with The Selfish
the fastest fish in the ocean they
clocked at over 65 mile per hour and
that's how many again everything is
based on window of opportunity
everything has its own cycle and as its
own pattern it is about four to five
weeks ago that we be able to go to Isla
Mujeres in Mexico and able to swim and
see this kind of behavior on this kind
of phenomena so many selfish feeding is
not one by one catching on a hook and
all those things we in person in the
water with this magnificent animal and
they will never touch us then they're
fast there every shot bill they could
easily spin us and every time passed by
and I'll show you some images that you
go banana that I were banana anyway it
just by my side and it took the took the
bait and never touch me
diving with them in water diver on a
fish
as they come into the and very
interesting behavior as they come into
the beta to the school of bait ball and
what they do practically speaking and
you'll see it in one of the two other
pictures after this that's the size of
the fish we're looking at the Sabine
this how the gathering together they cut
a ball out of the hole shoal and it
started to go for the attack and the
goal is the bail and you see how close
they come to us and to the fish but what
they will do they will actually heat the
said the sardine first when they so did
will be unconscious then they'll come in
and they'll take it in mouth like that
lift it up when it turn up vertically
they'll come with their bill and let's
swallow it immediately and you'll see it
in the moment and here the change is the
change direction and you see the water
bubbling everything is so fast they are
so lightning fast and as you see the
heating the fish with the bill first
the fish is unconscious second and third
is in its mouth that's one of the
picture that's selected for this year
for the final at the BBC I don't know if
I yet in a that wonder price but I was
noticed that those are the final
selection and that's the one that was
but only less than a foot away from me
and happens so fast I just took the
camera and take the picture and just
keep taking the pictures on my side
thanks for digital bite
yeah be able to swim with them and not
care less about our present but they
know that we are too big and they are
not part of their environment or not
part of their future they're only
looking for the safe for the sardine and
they leave us alone actually
entertainers sometime I'll present
they'll actually disturb the feeding
behavior then we get the people out of
the water let them finish their feeding
before we be able to continue swimming
as them allows them the guy on the right
you probably many of you any one of you
been in Florida or I've been involved
with sport fishing know the name Guy
Harvey no okay sorry anyway Garvey is
one of the world leading artists that
illustrate selfish all all around the
world and billboard and major on
building either call it mural and has a
t-shirt and if you are in Florida and
you want to buy a t-shirt or show to
somebody you always find his
illustration on it the guy in the middle
is Antony's the skipper and the governor
left is your friend that's standing here
right now this got hobby that we
finished one part of shooting he we did
a television piece together for him and
it was very happy the next few pictures
just show you a picture of people that
have been with me in different trips
different parts of the world the picture
before was at a dolphin trip this is
from the island of the Azores when we
are looking for sperm whale and blue L
this is from the great white shark in
South Africa and by the way the person
in the back who is the with the black
hat with the beer is the hungry hot man
if any of you seen the National
Geographic and BBC pieces Polly seen the
pieces about him and he's the one that
he and I have started the diving the
great great white shark diving and
encounter in South Africa in the early
nineties this is from Norway diving with
the orcas and this is of course with the
High Arctic in Canada is the polar bear
the novel the belugas and the walruses
and in one in one of my future the
successful trip to Antarctica I had
a violinist from the Los Angeles
Symphony join us on the trip so I asked
her to bring her violin with her and to
have a concert for the king we went to
the South Georgia island the only place
we can see the king penguin and we
really provide a concert for them and
they concern her too
so they were singing to each other and
if you happen to have a time and the
money to do something very extraordinary
and one of the few that know many things
left in the world to do extraordinary
just like having an Apple computer and
like everybody have here like I have one
too so I'm not not against that but is
to go to South Georgia and be among
these 250 thousand pairs of king penguin
and heal them it is like another
phenomenal in sound compared to the one
of the humpback whale the singing of the
Homburg well this is part of the
equipment that are used to use not
anymore
the camera on the left this is the
Imperius camera that we used by jacques
cousteau not this camera particular but
the Jacque Cousteau started then a
connoisseur the Calypso bought by Nikon
in the early fifties and called an eye
colors they made up to version number 5
I never graduate from number 3 till
eventually I went to the SL are
underwater film this is the camera that
you see here on the edge and if you like
to after we finish in 1 or 2 minutes
you'll be able to hold it and to see to
fill it in how it loops and today most
of the time I shoot right now is digital
and this is the housing this house
camera inside I have a can on in this
case mark 3 1 TS and what you have here
on the table the rest of the equipment
is lighting underwater and all of the
big animal images that we seen here is
all ambient light not you strobe because
Rob does not go up more than 6 feet and
cannot lit up 30 or 40 feet of animal
but for reef and for fish we use usually
we instruct and I want to thank you and
all the people that participate join me
on trips before in the past and will
join me in the future like onion and
said hopefully we'll be going to
Antarctica again but this time we will
go and because without as I mentioned
before thanks to America and the people
of America
that our free spirit not only connected
to governments or to institution those
individual the did well for themself
educate himself the good learning
together were able to join me on some of
the trip that I lead around the world
and provide me the opportunity to bring
this picture and to send them other to
do magazine stories to do lectures
around the world and to continue the
education of the public and the few
thing that you've learned today how many
shark in the ocean and how the killer
whale feed or caffeine and so on and so
forth but that's the purpose its
multifaceted environment we go together
to the field we learn from the field I
come home I do it publicly what each one
of you does environmentally in your own
neighborhood education preservation and
along also having a good time and
enjoying ourselves and the purpose of
all these eventually going to climax and
I'm working on a major project that all
that will be AB which are called the
Legacy Project I'll not get to the
detail of that right now is late I don't
want to stop people want to do the world
but we are we are the community that
suffering because we are the generation
that can make a difference in the next
10 years going to be the most important
in for the next 100 years how we deal
with the threat that we impose on the
environment that we living in
and for that I want to create the Legacy
Project which is other create more
people who cares because the more we
kill the mob will be able we are not
able to change the race or to change the
sequel or the sequence of way of the
environment but we're able to reduce the
speed but which it occur and we'll be
able to protect what we have left we
cannot resurrect what we already lost so
this will be fruit footless but will be
fruitful is to be able to protect what
we have left and that is the task order
and we can but it can be done
the animal that helped me to get there
they are the center of my life or the
focus of my life and I thank to them and
to the well you did not hear the music
that was part of it but you heard my
voice who Pauline was better and if you
and if you want to know ball but what I
do in the future and the website is big
animals calm it's simple and to the
point
thank you very much guys and if you want
to look in the equipment you're welcome
to take a look at it any question yes
and it is not it was does any
presentation you know thank you yes
should be ura but because we put the
microphone in the water and you have a
headset that you can hear it but
otherwise you cannot hear it the Sun
will not go through there whatever into
there I will sound like
well underwater bring your underwater
you don't need any any equipment you
don't need a headset you will hear it
very clearly and it is like symphony
because it goes through a range that we
cannot human cannot even create the
range the animal can create out of the
water you need the cable from the map
from the microphone that they offered
the hydrophone is in water to be able to
hear it
yes so there was this picture that we
try to do in the
the orchestrating occurred does
threatening to occur in Argentina yes in
principle this yes the seeds yes the oka
stop the behavior did not run away they
just stop the behavior we did we detect
picture of them when they took the when
they taking the scenes from the surface
but not from the water point of view we
try to take the picture from the water
point of view no we did not rub it it
was in the early 80s and because Google
was not there in the making and Sergey
and all the rest did not even think
about all those wonderful tools that we
creating here and it was not the budget
for those things at the time since then
there are other companies there I just
an IMAX team about the months ago to
work there but nobody the Argentinian
government will not allow and we and the
researcher totally against put
everything in the water them simply
because anything that will do during
this time of the year any presence of
people in the water will stop will
create for the Orca to be concerned
perhaps and to be afraid and feel
uncomfortable and unsafe to bear to
practice their behavior what's happenin
in Argentina inferential of all days
there is a particular area that called
what they called the the alley of the
attack when the water inside the the
change of tide is between almost 30 to
50 feet the oak attack usually during
the three hours before that we are after
high tide when a lot of water covering
when the water will recede during the
low tide you can see very clearly the
reef that the aqua cop was in this reef
and when they are talking for throughout
this particular Beach I did not show the
images today but I want
website if you take a look at it and
when and they know it
everything would be there we concerned
that we'll be as such the determine from
