Steve Souders I work here at Google on
latency web performance and I've started
bringing in a series of speakers so far
we've had John Resig from Mozilla Doug
Crockford from yahoo who's here today
myself next week we're going to have rob
campbell from who works on fire bug at
Mozilla and today we have PPK so all of
these talks the videos are available on
YouTube and you can read blog posts on
the Google Code blog about them so PPK
is in from Amsterdam he's here for the
voices that matter conference up in the
city next week and he's most well known
for his quirks mode org work on browser
compatibility and today he's going to
talk about w3c widgets and how they can
use be used for mobile devices I want to
first though Thank PPK for coming to
Google and present him with the google
Tech Talk speaker goody bag there you go
all right please help me welcome PPK
thank you um today I'm going to talk a
bit about the mobile web um I say I
myself started in web development 10
years ago and 10 years ago what was the
big thing in a mobile web I am not sure
if you remember one but it was well not
very good really um and everybody was
excited it's especially the marketing
guys they said like okay what was going
to be in the next week a big thing and
get ready because we'll get lots of lots
of clients who wants websites that will
work on mobile phones it's not out that
we did not get any clients who are
interested in mobile phones back then
the same was repeated in 2002 back in
Hollands one of the telecom companies
try to promote the Japanese I modes
system and that basically failed to
since then I've hardly worked on the
mobile web at all until
about two and a half months ago Vodafone
contact with me with a question hey are
we running into a bit of her trouble
with a mobile browsers could you please
help us out and study the mobile
browsers and said yes of course how I
want to and I was really glad about that
because I was already thinking about the
mobile web it might start to be become
important in the next year next two
years and I would absolutely want to do
some browser tests on the mobile side of
things but the problem was and that I'd
have to buy a lot of mobile phones to do
in order to do some really serious
testing no problem the founder photo
film guy said and we've got two closets
full of mobile phones that you can test
as far as we're concerned so come over
to Dusseldorf in Germany and we'll get
started and I did and I did some testing
and today I'd like to talk about a few
aspects of that testing and also about
w3c widgets which photo phone is
currently supporting and so what exactly
it's the mobile web basically it's
simple you get a website on your mobile
phone the problem is mobile phones are
just not the same as desktop computers
and as far as I can see now and we've
got four major problem areas when you
try to port a normal web sites to mobile
phone the first one is that mobile
phones generally have far less memory
than a desktop computer which means that
performance may be impacted the second
one is that they have a far smaller
display and then a normal computer
screen the third one it's flaky browsers
and that's a problem is not really
restricted to the mobile space but it's
worse there than on the desktop space
and forth and they have flaky
connections you cannot never be
absolutely sure that your connection
will stay on for the time you take to
download a certain website okay I'm
briefly going to discuss the first two
problems and I'll go into more depth in
the second second two properties first
of all small memory I can't really say
much about apps because I haven't really
tested it yet and the only thing I know
for sure is that performance tests are
necessary
one of the guys at vodafone is currently
doing some performance tests our mobile
phones especially in relation to the
major libraries I hope that research
will be published within a few months
I'll leave it at that I just don't know
enough about memory problems or mobile
phones second problem is the small
display of mobile phones we all know
that basically any website you create
today's optimized for say 1024 x 768
that will no way fit into a mobile
display the good part about this problem
is that people have been aware of it for
years already and I've started to think
about it and of course the main
solutions will I in the realms of
graphic design and interaction design
I'm not a graphic designer or an
interaction designer so I'm not going to
talk about those sir parts of the
solution I just briefly like to touch on
the way to technically solve this
problem basically if you want to if you
need to optimize your CSS for a mobile
display you should use media queries as
far as I'm concerned now you use the
syntax you see over there at media oh
and Max we with three other pixels which
means these styles the special styles
for the small display will be used when
the display is 300 pixels wide or
smaller that I think will solve most of
the CSS problems we can encounter a
mobile phones again I'm talking only
about the technical problems we may
encounter interaction design graphic
design is totally differently but I
think you need CSS media queries to
solve these problems take that he in CSS
they are supported by opera iphone both
and iris bolt and iris our webpage
webkit-based browsers i'll get back to
them later and they are not supported by
the android at least not the current
android maybe android 1.5 will change
that but we'll see if you want to solve
this problem with a javascript and you
have to use the good old offset with
document that body does offset
smaller and 300 generally works on all
phones have tested so far except that a
blackberry may have some problems with
it so upset with is basically safe after
tight is slightly less safe because
that's where the blackberry may have
some problems I'm going to leave it at
that for the small display I hope that
pretty soon someone is really really
good and interaction design or graphic
design will take it up from here and
explain us what we need to do in order
to make our websites really mobile phone
compatible with regards to the small
display now flaky browsers and the
problem is nothing new of course anyone
who's been working on websites for
longer than a few months will well have
recognized that some browsers do stuff
differently than other browsers
basically the same is Sir going on
mobile phones except that unfortunately
there are far more browsers involved um
well thanks to the support from the
Vodafone guys I was able to test to run
a few simple tests on 19 different
browsers and 13 different phones I chose
the number 19 myself I mean I can test
it on many more browsers if i want to
but right now I think 19 is enough I
need to reserve some of my sanity and
let's first take a quick look at 0 which
mobile browsers there are and the
android webkit obviously are from mobile
the net front browser so it's a pretty
obscure browser from I think it's from
Japan and not much is known about it
except that it's the default browser on
some samsung and sony ericsson phones
then forgot safari for the iphone
obviously we've got up from mini which
is a thin client i'll get back to earth
at and then we've got the blackberry
browser which is still an independent
browser I we've got the s60 WebKit s60
is the operative system that most nokia
phone throwing arm we've got IE mobile
that is very much of a problem right now
and of course we've got some minor
browsers such as iris bolt skyfire Abby
go open web nokia s40 palm blaze or
fennec
t shark etc etc etc teeth shark yes
teach art I have no idea why anyone
would want to call this browser t shark
but these guys have done it anyway ok so
this is a mess you have absolutely no
idea what's going on and you will
probably quickly get lost in this whole
list of browsers it's probably not
complete either but these are the
browser's have been able to discover so
far and if you wish you may grow now
this is going to be a major problem on
the mobile web of course all these
browsers have their own problems with
advanced JavaScript and CSS I'm
currently investigating them I'm
currently creating mobile compatibility
table for them but it turns out that you
have to test really basic stuff to such
as font style italic I was doing an
advanced CSS selector test in an upright
eight and it turned out that they did
not support some advanced attribute
selectors a CSS which I thought weird
because I know for sure that opera has
been supporting these selectors for ages
and then I took another good look at my
tests and I figure out what the problem
was if these advanced selectors are
supported then a certain bit of text is
being is given a font style italic and
it turned out that this specific opera
did not support forum style italic so it
took me quite a while to figure that out
I had to switch my tests to working with
Colorado color blue will come remember
well that's not so much so much of a
problem the basic problem here is that
you can't even assume basic CSS support
and I've got some screenshots here to
prove it and this one's pretty good
actually this is an opera mobile 9.5 on
an HTC phone touch phone and this is my
complete basic phone CSS test and as you
see it's thought everything the problem
is let's catch it support in desktop
mode because it turns out that opera
mobile has two modes esta mode and
mobile mode in this stop mode it tries
to show your pages basically as they are
shown on a computer screen which may
mean
initially you only see the top left
corner of your website and you have to
scroll down and to the right in order to
see the complete website mobile modes
kind of squeezes the entire site into
the mobile this plane which is good I
suppose and the only problem is that I
have to overrule from CSS obviously with
statements some floats probably they
have to mess with them in order to force
the entire site into the small display
but they also stop supporting some basic
font CSS and frankly I do not understand
why I hope I find out later in any case
I know that it is the case so you'd
better be ready for that worse even you
cannot really detect whether an opera
mobile is in desktop or in mobile mode I
found a quick CSS workaround but it's
not really useful in real sides so this
is going to be a problem we go the
underline a little bit this is a 60
WebKit a nokia e71 and the support is
pretty fine except that font for ryans
small caps it's it looks the same
texture and form uppercase this is not
so much of a problem we can probably
work around that as the opera mini
browser on the same phone as supposed
everything except letter spacing which
is also not so bad the only thing is
we've been assuming for ages that all
modern browsers support these basic CSS
declarations and turns out that mobile
browsers support everything okay you can
get much worse this is an effing browser
on a sony ericsson phone and as you see
it only supports the basics it sports a
font weight font style text decoration
color but not much else this is the
first point or I received that netfront
it's not a really bad browser but it's
not really good either we'll get back to
that later and absolutely the worst
browser i found was an opera mobile 8.00
on a motorola which supports only color
and text france form is a CSS wise and
now i think
this opera mobile is actually locked in
mobile mode as opposed to do to the
previous opera we saw which was in
desktop mode the problem is that on this
specific motorola i cannot switch from
the mobile mode to desktop modes maybe
they introduce it later on oprah eight
point oh oh I don't know anyway I was
unable to get more support than just for
text on form and color which is pretty
basic I suppose okay I could show you
many more screenshots but they only
confuse you more I think it's time to
take a look at the browser market at the
bird's eye view I am warning you these
are preliminary conclusions I'm not sure
of my data yet I have to run many many
more tests but i think the browser
landscapes looks roughly like this at
the moment and the top left for browsers
are the android webkit safari for the
iphone and opera mobile these browsers
are basically able to support CSS and
JavaScript normally and won't go to the
mid level we've got the s60 WebKit and i
probably should say something more about
web kids on mobile phones many browsers
have worked it as a core rendering
engine but that does not necessarily
mean that I do exactly the same in
general it's best to see the Android web
kids and the Safari web kids as brothers
they are pretty much alike but not
totally alike and the s60 web kids and
other web kids would see as more distant
cousins the s60 web kids post a few
problems for me because when i started
my research I try to write read out its
graphic identification string obviously
and it gave back the WebKit version
number 4 22 which is pretty old and
while I then I compared it with a safari
3.0 which supports I think web get 5 25
or something so in theory the WebKit
engine the s60 WebKit engine is really
old the funny thing was that Safari
three point oh does not support the only
child selector in CSS while the SXT
WebKit does
so what I think happened is that the
sexy guys first branched off their own
web kids and subsequently imported more
modules from the main WebKit branch but
forgot to update their user agent string
I'm not sure that this is what happens
but I think this is what happens s60
WebKit has a few problems in CSS I found
so far it does not support border
spacing and it does not support a
padding set in EMS and that's all I know
about a 60 WebKit badge right now but
I'll probably find many more meanwhile
I've learned that the Nokia a 60-year
system is not very important in the US
it is extremely important however in
Europe and especially in the developing
world where I just saw some statistics
yesterday and basically in india and
indonesia nokia phones take about sixty
percent of market share and i'm not sure
how many of those sixty percent are
actually s60 phones which are the most
modern nokia phones currently available
but i wouldn't be surprised if that if
their share is starting to grow so even
though in the US nokia s60 phones are
not very important in the rest of the
world they are and your website should
run on them right blackberry and the
blackberry phone still has its own
browsers browser excuse me I heard a
rumor that they were going to switch to
a WebKit branch but as of today that
rumor is that not yet to I tested the
blackberry storm 9500 and that run a
browser that was definitely different
from web page it was definitely not a
web browser so it's still an independent
browser it supports CSS to pretty well
actually css3 supports is a bit more
flaky and JavaScript sport is ok I guess
although it refuses to run one of my
tests test scripts but all in all I
think it's a surprisingly decent browser
at expected far worse then we've got up
from mini up from many is the thin
clients browser of opera basically it
works as follows you only download a
small
all thin clients and your computer when
you request page through it that request
goes to a special opera server which in
turns to internal requests the page
renders the CSS interprets the
JavaScript and since you result back to
the thin client on your phone and this
is an excellent solution for all the
phones who have don't have enough memory
a two-sport real JavaScript real client
side JavaScript and the only problem is
that as soon as an a JavaScript event
state book takes place the browser has
to go back to the server in order to ask
the server what to do next so any
JavaScript event will cause a page
refresh and this is mainly the reason
and I'm counting it as a mid-level
browser right now there is no real
client site interactivity nonetheless
and the solution that opera has chosen
is probably pretty ok for all the mobile
phones and that's really their target
audience they want to spread opera mini
on many older modern phones especially
in the former East Bloc and in the
developing countries so those are the
mid-level browsers and let's go to the
very bottom level there's netfront a
net-front is as far as i know a japanese
browser created by the company called
access unfortunately there's very little
information available right now I've
tested it and it supports CSS ok ish I
guess JavaScript little worse it can do
some JavaScript I mean it's not that
javascript is completely switched off
and really funny thing about net from
the very very first time I tested it I
started up a mobile phone samsung i
started at the browser and automatically
the browser loaded a certain vodafone on
page with nice advertisements and stuff
and and then i typed in UL URL to my
test page and nothing happens and that
kind of surprised because there was a
progress bar that definitely shows for
progress and then the progress bar
disappeared so i guessed ok my page will
be finished loading but I still saw the
photo phone home page it turned out that
I had to scroll before my own page
showed on this net phone
and that was very weird to me and it
only happened on one of the three nett
France my tests I test it so it's not
definitely not a general failure of all
net fronts still it's odd and that's why
I place it at the bottom level of the
mobile mobile browser sphere right now
but that may change in the future and
then we've got the alt ie mobile the
ovine mobile supports only in line
events which means that document dot
unclick just doesn't work create text
node does not work CSS support is
horrible it's based on the old I for
rendering engine meanwhile Microsoft is
working on an upgrade of the I mobile
browser it's going to be called a mobile
6 I think and it's based on the ie6
rendering engine not on the i-81
unfortunately although they are supposed
to be importing part of the i8
JavaScript engine but I don't really
have the details on that yet so what all
these browsers have in common with the
exception of opera mini is that they are
default browsers on certain phones so if
phone user does not know much about
browsers and just starts using his phone
to access to web he will use whatever
default browser happens to be installed
on his phone so that's why all these
browsers are important for websites
there are few other default browsers but
these were only on really old phones
open web nokia s40 a palm blazer haven't
tested him that them yet so i can't tell
you anything about it and finally we've
got some non-default browsers iris iris
its windows mobile wicked based bolts is
jme based and also webkit-based skyfire
is gecko based OB go I don't know yet
fennec is the new mozilla browser which
only runs in an early alpha on certain
linux operating system on nokia tablets
t shark I don't know anything about what
these browsers have in common is that
users may download them if they feel
like it so these are not default
browsers and therefore
think there are less important than the
other browsers a show on top okay that's
pretty much concludes my overview of the
mobile browser market right now and it's
not easy and I I talked about this a bit
earlier and I got a question okay how
should you test these browsers basically
you have to test them on mobile phones
yes there are emulators available some
of them may may even be good but I
advise you not to count on it and just
try to test your websites as much as
possible on the actual mobile phones who
want to support from flaky browsers we
move too flaky connections and the basic
problem with a mobile phone network is
that if the guy next to you is
downloading a few movies your network
connection will slow down regardless of
how good it's supposed to be originally
and frankly I do not think that this
problem is going to disappear anytime
soon and networks will be cut a bit
upgraded of course they will be able to
handle meant much more traffic than
today but that means that many more
people I ago that starts downloading
movies which still slows down there now
much faster network so flaky connections
are I think the most persistent problem
on mobile we go to face and it's a of
course a serious problem for the mobile
web and especially when you've got let's
say as a web application for
spreadsheets totally optimized for the
mobile phone and it's a keeps track of
the display and make sure you can
actually work on it on the mobile phone
but it needs 200k of JavaScript plus a
few libraries and if this is a normal
web application every time a user
accesses this web application he has to
download the 200k of JavaScript plus a
few libraries plus some CSS obviously
caching isn't always reliable on mobile
phones I've seen wild extremes by now
basically the iphone doesn't do any
caching at all as far as i'm concerned
and the exact opposite is the
60 nakia 60 phones which have very very
aggressive caching so aggressive that it
actually hurts you when you're trying to
develop a mobile website or widget but I
kind of advise you not to rely too much
on cashing on mobile phones nowadays so
I'm a solution to the flaky connections
problem is to put all the cool files on
your mobile phone so that you only need
to download the data of course you have
to download core files if you install
the let's call it an application or
widget or whatever and but once you've
done that the core files are on your
mobile phone you do not have to download
them and the the mobile connection can
concentrate on the data traffic um one
of the solution one of the system set
off of the solutions our w3c widgets and
I've studied them a bit in the past few
months because Vodafone is working on
them and I'd like to take a closer look
at them and basically these w3c widgets
are local applications written in HTML
CSS and JavaScript plus a little bit
more not much but a little bit and
they've run in a browser obviously and
as far as I'm concerned they can run in
any browser although on the Vodafone
system currently to run in opera mobile
and obviously they can handle 80s
requests for the data traffic because
they support javascript and they run in
a browser that was fun of course and
this approach is not only taken by the
w3c widgets but basically by any modern
application system on a mobile phone for
the iphone windows mobile the blackberry
the android etc etc etc the problem I
have with these app systems is that
their proprietary I'm not sure exactly
how much their various app system
systems resemble each other but I am
pretty sure that you have to test a
separate app on each mobile system that
you want to support and this is going to
be a problem for companies I think
back home in Amsterdam two friends of
mine have a website where you can view
nice photos of interior design and stuff
like that the idea is that their clients
will come to their site look at it Dario
design photos and kind of fight favorite
those photos that they like and then
they wanted to go to the shop to
actually buy these products now these
friends of mine and would be served by a
mobile app that allows their clients to
download these photos from the website
and so they then go to chop and sho
shoulder salesman ok I want this thing I
want this lamp of this bed of this chair
or whatever that would be very useful to
them the problem is and that right now
this excusing this idea is going to be
difficult basically what i can do is
then they can create a website actually
they already have a website so they can
say to their clients ok open the website
on your mobile phone go to your
favorites page and you can show the
photos to the salesman the problem is
and that website may be slow to load
except especially when you want to
download say five to ten large photos it
may go quick in may go slow you don't
know beforehand flaky connection problem
and the other solution they may take is
create four or more separate
applications one for iphone one for the
android one for blackberry one for
windows mobile etc etc etc and that is
certainly going to be pretty expensive
so the solution I'd like them to be able
to use is use w3c which is so it's time
to talk a bit more about w3c widgets I
think they are better than websites for
the mobile phone because they avoid the
flaky connection problem they are they
download only data and not the core
files the core files are already
installed on your phone and I think they
may be better than the proprietary app
systems we haven't right now because you
don't have to write four or five 10 12
whatever number of them just one
um and I'm looking into the future now
but what I really really really really
love to do is have a cool widget on my
phone say I've got an android phone I
meet friends who also once at widget and
I'm able to share it via bluetooth even
if I use an android and if in friend of
mine users are not yet 60 on HTC windows
mobile phone or a blackberry of or
whatever i just opened a bluetooth
connection he receives my widget and it
just works that it's the future i
envision that something I'd really like
to work on because I think this will
give will open web faster than any other
possibility of mobile phones right now I
may be wrong but we'll see in any case I
feel that this way of sharing widgets
would be absolutely astounded Lee
totally inconceivably in our
interoperable I mean I think you can't
get much more interoperable than this I
hope you agree with me and besides the
advantage of widgets is at hundreds of
thousands of web developers already know
how to create them because they just run
in HTML CSS and JavaScript they have to
take care of the small display they have
to know like say a one-page of extra
features that are supported in w3c
widgets but that doesn't take more than
a half an hour of study it's really
pretty simple and then it would just
work basically what you do want to when
you want to create a w3c widget you
create one HTML page and you attach as
many CSS files JavaScript files and
image files as you need and which user
has to click in order to start up the
widget you add a conflict of XML file
which contains some kind configuration
information it's really simple you can
really learn that in 15 minutes you sip
will not change the extension to wgt and
it just works um
so that's why I think that which it's
may be able to open web faster and for
more people than any other system
basically people can easily create them
if they're already web developers and
they don't have to be wonderful great
web developers to make widgets which is
can also be something simple so they
have to be web developers in the sense
that they know some HTML CSS and
JavaScript they can easily create them
ideally they'll be able to easily share
them with your friends via bluetooth or
whatever and they just work so in that
situation why would we need anything
else but w3c widgets actually there are
a few reasons why we might need other
systems I think that a proprietary
application system such as the ones we
haven't right now may remain more suited
for certain forms of applications
especially animation having a V games
it's a scientist sorry to that
javascript is not the best language to
use when you want really smooth really
good animations area where up systems
Maya may be better our secure
applications I'm not sure about this I
mean I'm not a security guy so I am just
assuming that a w3c widgets mayor may be
less secure than a proprietary
applications I think actually then we
will find some more areas in which app
systems are better than w3c widgets and
besides native app systems proprietary
absolutions to may foster innovation and
I've everything goes right w3c widgets
will also profit that and so my
conclusion is that proprietary systems
are fine as long as you also support
standards and w3c widgets are not yet
standards they're in draft stadium right
now well you know all about that but
still they may become a standard and
that's what I'm here to talk about
because which it's just work and that
right now unfortunately
um let's see where they do work because
I do actually work I created a few w3c
widget myself and they absolutely work
in the Vodafone widget manager for nokia
s60 phones and that's the main reason
vodafone invited me to come to them help
us create these widgets on the photo
from richard manager platform which were
run sir opera browser of romo below so
s60 market is covered and then last week
opera announced and that i had created
the similar widget manager for t-mobile
unfortunately i don't don't know many of
the details yet but we think that this
which Atlanta will run on windows mobile
phones because all of the screenshots we
saw do some windows mobile phones so
we're guessing but I think that Windows
Mobile may be covered too I think that a
w3c widget and may easily be ported to
the Nokia which at runtime system on
their 60 because it basically works the
same except that it uses an info dot
plist file just as the Apple dashboard
which is due so I'm kind of guessing I
haven't tested it myself yet but I'm
kind of guessing that if you create a
w3c widget with a conflict that XML and
you add an info.plist fire which is
syntactically correct the widget will
also run on the Nokia which at runtime
but i still have to test it so i may be
a slightly wrong but still the concept
is absolutely the same so we've got a 60
cover twice and windows mobile covered
once and that's it for now unfortunately
um and now we come to the main reason
I'm here today and I would love to ask
the people from google androids whether
it would be possible that Google Android
also starts to support w3c widgets
I have no idea out there any people from
the Google Android team here yeah okay I
would kindly ask you to think about this
think about my presentation I have
course absolutely no idea if this is
going is something that can be
implemented easily or whether it will be
very hard but I wanted to make the
attempt anyway by the way I do not ask
for widget instead of but in addition to
your own widget system I mean as I said
before and native proprietary
application or widget systems may have
their advantages and we should certainly
should continue to work with them what
you need for a w3c widget environment is
a browser and of course android webkit
is fine the second point I'm a bit vague
about because I don't know exactly how
that works either on an Android or on
any other phone type but we may need a
way of associating widgets with the
browser and or a kind of an installation
mechanism in any case the phone has to
be able to understand okay i get a dutch
wgg file I have to open that in a widget
environment which uses the native
browser of the system finally what we
need is JavaScript device ap ice which
brings me to the last subject I'd like
to treat today basically JavaScript
device ap is our api's have grant access
to phone functionality such as the
camera the contact list text messages
etc etc etc and I think for real w3c
widgets we need this kind of access
because it will suck tide which more
closely into the mobile phone
environment and I think the users will
also expect this right now there are
several JavaScript device ap is and the
Bondi one is supposed to become the
standard but it's not yet finished
besides I try to read it and it's a
fortunately pretty much unreadable right
now and so I'm afraid we'll have to wait
a bond is an initiative of many mobile
phone
vendors and mobile operators so it's a
bit akin to G w3c in that respect and
they are supposed to formulate one
common JavaScript device API that will
work with all mobile phones and we've
got a phonegap library I don't know too
much about it but I would like to
mention it as far as I'm understand the
phonegap library will bring a JavaScript
device api's to the android blackberry
and iphone platforms then we've got the
opera t mobile widget manager I
mentioned earlier according to the
rumors there is a JavaScript device API
involved but we kind of guess right now
that its proprietary and it's restricted
to windows mobile nonetheless is out
there however JavaScript device ap is
also have a security problem and suppose
my vision comes becomes true and I can
receive a widget from a friend of mine
via bluetooth and at which it uses
device AP is how am I going to know that
that device that which is not going to
steal my contact list and upload it to a
militia server I'm not a security guy I
cannot give you the details of this the
only thing I know right now what I've
heard is that a problem will probably be
solved by signed regions that are
assigned security levels basically if
you widget is not science you are
relegated to the lowest possible
security level and on the lowest
security level any device API call will
alert the user hey can their canvas
which should please use to contact
contact list via text message or
whatever and of course higher level
higher levels of security have more
privileges again I do not know too much
about security and this problem is
obviously pretty year serious and we
obviously need to study a pretty well I
hope Google can help us figure out a
good answer um and the brings me to my
very last subject and also about
security basically JavaScript same
source policy is not implemented in
which is normally a javascript is only
allowed to mess with a page or data that
come from the same server however that
doesn't make sense for widgets because
which is a local application its URL
starts with something like widgets colon
slash localhost / whatever there's
definitely a local application but it
has to be able to download data from
other sources so this as a 2 is
something that we need to think about
really well because it might become a
serious security problem in the future
and I'd like to handle these problems
right now before they can become really
reads so to wrap it all up the pros of
w3c widgets are that they work with open
standards that countless people around
the world can already create em today
and that they promised to deliver
interoperability on a massive scale and
that I feel they will open the web more
quickly and more certainly than at any
other system on mobile phones the cons
are that other application systems may
remain better suited for certain types
of applications animation heavy games
possibly secure applications this is not
really a calm it's just something we
should keep in mind another con is that
as yet there moderate supporters but I
hope sport will become much better in
the coming years and the final final a
very serious come is that we have some
serious security issues that need to be
solved because before we can start using
using with so much kill as I can see now
the pros heavily outweigh the cons the
only really really serious come is the
security thing and if we solve that or
if we at least kind of kind of get to a
situation where people can use w3c
widgets in a moderately secure way we
will we can be certain that the pros of
w3c widgets heavily outweigh the cons
and I guess it's time to get Delta
on the widget thank you for your
attention I hope you learned something
today and if you have questions i'll of
course taken thanks yeah question yeah
and the question was if i had compared
the w3c widgets with google google
widgets and apple dashboards and as far
as i know apple dashboard oh it does
work with some HTML CSS and JavaScript
but I have not really compared them yet
so I am not quite sure I think there
will be certain certain overlaps
absolutely but I'm not sure how big
these overlaps are ya ok you have solved
the problems I have with google gadgets
that sounds good Steve the question is
if you develop a widget is a kind of an
app store the answer is yes Vodafone is
setting one up and the only thing I
would like to reiterate is that the
power of witches is partly that you do
not have to go through an app store you
can just share them with your friends
eventually at the later stage but yes
for the moment there are app stores I
also think we are going to need a source
in the future because of the security
problems somebody has to sign those
widgets say ok this widget may remain
secure you say no Douglas
okay according to Douglas Crockford it's
not going to work here signing will see
Alice okay okay that Alex Russell also
say it says that signing is not going to
work okay so but what you do agree that
we have security issue here that should
solve right how do you see html5 in this
respect um I see it primarily as a good
way of storing data locally of obviously
html5 storage it's going to become
massively important to mobile phones as
to storing the actual core files in
contrast to the data I'm not quite sure
yet this is something we'll have to
investigate but basically for really
really good which its html5 is
absolutely required especially because
for the storage more questions
okay okay yeah okay um I just heard
about new where mobile phone brand so he
had a sidekick it seems to be pretty
popular in the US the problem with me of
course is that I'm doing research in
Europe and one of the things I've
noticed with the mobile market it is
that the u.s. is separate from Europe is
separate from Asia so the data I showed
you mainly goes for Europe partly also
for Asia especially in the nokia case
samsung is also very big in asia of
course but the u.s. I don't know too
much of about US market but thanks for
the tip i'll look into it and just
hoping that vodafone has a natural
sidekick phone so that i can test it
that's all we're always the problem many
people tell me about many mobile phones
t-mobile okay okay thanks any other
Steve I yeah and the spec it's a bit of
a mess right now and that there's no
official homepage you can find it
through my site I wrote an article
introduction to w3c widgets earlier this
week and contains a link to the
specification or rather there what was
it called ap ice and something
specification because there's also a
specification for distributing them and
zipping them and there is a guy from a
prior involved in the w3c widget
specification Marco's calculus I think
he's named and he thought up part of the
system any more questions
no I do not have that dr. test mm-hmm
okay there's an HTML test here that I
might look into the problem as far as I
can see now is not HTML as such I have
not yet found a single instance in which
an actual HTML tag was misinterpreted
but that could come of course later on
okay CSS as well okay yeah CSS is going
to be a major problem any more questions
remarks no but thank you for your
attention thanks for coming here
