honored today by the presence of our
friend the venerable bhikkhu bodhi
Verner Bodi is one of the most important
scholars of Buddhism alive in the world
today variable Bodhi obtained his PhD in
philosophy in 1972 and being a
philosophy major he could have gotten a
job at I don't know like darkness or
something but he didn't instead he
became a monk and he received full
ordination in 1973 he was appointed
editor of the Buddhist publication
Society in 1984 and is president in 1988
and venerable body has many important
scholarly publications to his credit
including at least four volumes of
Buddhist scriptures and the volume is
like this I used to read those stuff in
in addition to coding which is why I
think I did fall from the senior prom
just kidding
in May 2000 he gave the keynote address
at the United Nations on his first
official celebration of visa he
currently teaches at chong-in monastery
and a Bodhi monastery and in person I
found the number body to be not the
stereotypical and lighted being you know
wise intelligent compassionate funny
humble you know the user and also he
speaks Chinese and my friends please
welcome the venerable bhikkhu bodhi
okay first I want to thank my old friend
mang old friend from a year and a half
ago for inviting me to come and speak to
you today and to thank all of you for
attending this talk here at Google I
feel like I'm at the brain center of the
universe not flattering you in the sense
that all of you have master brains but
this is the nerve center of the entire
world's communications and information I
know mr. monk is a great humorous so I
thought that if I gave a talk without
giving it something of a humorous title
that would go down flat so I call the
talk it takes two to tango but the
subtitle gives it a serious tone the
human future and the future of Buddhism
it's been said by some commentators that
the meeting of Buddhism with Western
civilization has been one of the most
significant cultural encounters of the
past few centuries Buddhism first in the
West first encountered Buddhism perhaps
in the 18th century in the nineteenth
century the tempo of studies of Buddhism
started to increase by the 20th century
Buddhists were coming to the west in
order to propagate the Buddha's
teachings scholars and students of
Buddhism were going to Asia to learn
Buddhism and now in the 21st century we
have in the u.s. we have many buddhist
centers buddhist monasteries buddhist
temples Buddhist teachers and yet even
now the full potential of this encounter
of the West with Buddhism has not yet
been realized
usually when we speak about the meeting
of the West with Buddhism we pose the
question what is the significance of
this encounter from our own Western
point of view you know Buddhism teaches
the doctrine of non-self so we should
put the self aside but we're always
phrasing the question what does Buddhism
hold out for us
what is the implication of Buddhism for
the future of Western civilization in
this talk I want to play both sides of
the fence that is I want to view the
encounter of Buddhism in the West from
both points of view I want to raise the
question what does Buddhism offer
Western civilization at this particular
juncture and also I want to raise the
question what does Buddhism have to
learn from the West or what does the
West have to contribute to the unfolding
and development and future evolution of
Buddhism as I luck out upon contemporary
human situation both in the United
States and abroad I see that our future
is in serious jeopardy our future as a
civilization and perhaps even our future
as a species I don't think I'm
exaggerating and I don't think that
despite my title that this is anything
of a joking matter at the same time I
don't want to fall into a grim type of
pessimism despite the seriousness of the
problems that we face I still have the
faith and the hope that we human beings
will come out we'll come to our senses
before it's too late
I want to raise this paper
I also hope that Buddhism might be able
to transform some of the trends that
appear so threatening to our human
future at the same time I also hope that
the meeting of the West with Buddhism
will cause a fermentation in Buddhism
that will serve as a catalyst to awaken
certain potentials lying dormant in the
Buddhist teaching that could not appear
before it made this encounter with the
West I first want to try to support my
statement that we live in dangerous
times by mentioning some of the major
crises that confront us in our present
situation throughout history we have
always assumed that we had a future the
future has been seen as a given
dimension of time and we always felt
that we could count on having a future a
future that would recede ever further
into the horizons of our imagination
today however it is precisely the
reality of the future that has become a
question for us there are certain
present-day trends which suggest that
our future might be endangered an end to
the future at least to the human future
is now easily imaginable even if the
endpoint of the future doesn't occur in
our own lifetime there's a very real
danger that it might occur at some point
in the present century even during the
lifetimes of your children or
grandchildren during our daily lives
when our attention is involved in our
day-to-day tasks and projects
these kinds of thoughts normally don't
trouble us but if we step back for a few
moments and reflect we could easily see
that these claims are not exaggeration
the dangers are very real and when we
take them seriously as they should be
taken they can send a chill down our
spines as human beings we feel that we
have an overriding responsibility to
preserve a future for Humanity we feel
obliged to create for generations to
come a peaceful and affluent world we
feel that we are obliged to leave our
descendants a world that will be
conducive to happiness and well-being a
world that will give meaning and purpose
to their lives and yet if we look around
us we can see that we might be doing
exactly the opposite we're acting in
such a way that we may leave future
generations a battered world a world
darkened by poverty conflict pollution
we may even be leaving them an unlivable
world in effect we might be leaving them
no world at all okay I want to mention
four current trends that throw our
future into doubt I won't dwell on these
in any detail there are analysts far
better than myself that could explain
them at length but I just want to touch
on several of these in order to support
my claim that our future is in danger
okay the first of these is the
persistence of warfare
especially the danger of nuclear warfare
for the u.s. right now we've been caught
in the quad
meir of two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
was that were started as a result of
disinformation and over hasty decisions
these wars have claimed the lives of
thousands of Americans they've damaged
very many more thousands of American
lives and they've left they've destroyed
the lives of hundreds of thousands maybe
even more than a million innocent Iraqis
and Afghans we pour vast amounts of
money into these wars even more than a
trillion dollars in amount of money
that's a bit hard to imagine you know
it's a billion with three zeros after it
and this is money that was better
foresight and more compassion could have
been spent much more fruitfully on
programs of Social Development education
health care poverty alleviation both
nationally and globally in his brilliant
speech beyond Vietnam Martin Luther King
said a nation that continues year after
year to spend more money on military
defense than it does on social uplift is
approaching spiritual death I hope we
are at yet reaching that point but the
way our national leaders have locked us
into the task of continually sponsoring
military programs doesn't warm my heart
and I assume it's not warming to your
hearts and not only are these wars
pointless and expensive but the most
remarkable phenomenon of present day
warfare is it's cold impersonality
nowadays the wars are fought largely by
unmanned drones which are operated by
youngsters who might be sitting in their
cubicles in Nevada Utah Colorado
examining screens and pressing buttons
often we read that these drone attacks
wind up killing not militants not
terrorists
but groups of civilians who might be
celebrating a wedding or gathering for
some other communal function a second
dark blot on our future is the
persistence of poverty and hunger
instead of endeavoring to distribute
wealth more equitably in order to lift
people out of poverty those in positions
of power impose policies that channel
the wealth upwards from the lower and
middle classes to the corporate elite so
that at present I believe 1% of the US
population owns about 25% of the wealth
in the US okay so billions of people in
South Asia and Africa are swap
or swallow okay okay so billions of
people in South Asia and Africa are
swallowed up by poverty but poverty also
ravages many communities in the US and
Eastern Europe so this leaves us with
the sense that our economic and
financial systems are not working in an
equitable manner they benefit those who
know how to manipulate the system while
they exclude those who lack the power
ambition and skills to push their way to
the top a third factor closely related
to increasing poverty is the sense that
our democratic system is no longer
working to the benefit of the government
I think this factor is partly what
explains the rise of these Tea Party
movements so that ever more people are
convinced that the government no longer
truly represents them that it's no
longer serving our benefit no longer
fulfilling our own hopes and dreams
every few years we have an election
which is usually conducted with
something of the spectacular grammar
glamour of an Academy Awards ceremony
and then once the elections are over and
the politicians go to their offices they
usually fulfill the expectations of the
corporations that sponsor their
campaigns rather than the wishes of the
people who elect them to power the
fourth threat
at Google the nerve center of the use of
the world power failures I could expect
that in Sri Lanka but not that Google
maybe I'll send some technicians from
Sri Lanka to California okay the fourth
threat to our future might be the most
serious of all and this is the
accelerating crisis of climate change
particularly global warming I think most
of you are probably familiar with the
consequences of this yet what's most
remarkable is this is that this problem
receives very little attention in the
mainstream media so last year I was to
go to the I in fact I went to the
climate conference in Copenhagen and
before the conference took place the
poll was conducted of the US public to
determine what percentage of people knew
the subject of the conference in
Copenhagen you know I think roughly 28%
of the public knew that it was about
climate change a large percent thought
it was about international drug
trafficking another percent thought that
it was about trade regulations another
large percent thought it was about
negotiations over the war in Afghanistan
and something like that but so few
people are aware of the reality and the
gravity of the problem of climate change
and the attention of the America the
span of Americans attention is very
short and easily clouded by
disinformation so now such a large
percentage of people think that all of
these reports about global warming and
climate change are just disinformation
which is sent out by professors at
departments of climatology in the
universe
in order to secure their jobs and to
push a liberal socialist agenda in
American politics okay so we have these
four factors at least taken together
persistent Wars economic inequality
ineffective political institutions and
accelerating climate change and take
when we look at them together we can see
that the prospects for the human future
are not very bright okay now I come to
the second my second theme which is the
relevance of Buddhism to the human
predicament
okay to my in my way of thinking any
solution to the global problems that we
face must involve three interrelated
processes the first is that there must
be the nurturing of the moral and
spiritual development of the person that
is any solution requires an inward
transformation second we must be able to
bring to fulfillment the best potentials
of our communal life so that we can
create a peaceful and harmonious world
that will further the moral and
spiritual development of the individual
person and third we must preserve human
civilization by enabling those forces by
controlling those forces that threaten
to overwhelm it these three in my view
are intricately interrelated and we
could discern a certain causal
progression among them first the most
basic task is to promote the spiritual
development of the person and this is
generally the way religion works rather
than trying directly to remodel forms of
social organization religion addresses
people in their inward depths and its
primary call is for an inner
transformation but this is also a
transformation that we cannot separate
from the ways we engage with the world
around us when people act in accordance
with the positive values of religion the
prospects for a harmonious communal life
will improve
and when society becomes peaceful and
harmonious then civilization will be
preserved and protected from the
negative forces that threaten to invent
to overwhelm it so I intend to treat
Buddhism from these three angles but
first just a little background
information that some of you might be
already aware of this but I'll just give
a little background information on
Buddhism Buddhism originated from the
life and teaching of the historical
Buddha Gautama who probably lived in the
5th century BC even though his life has
been embroidered with many myths and
legends behind them we could still
detect the life story of a real
historical person he was born into a
small Republic in the Himalayan
foothills in a region that now lies in
southern Nepal at the age of 16 he
married he lived in royal luxury and at
a certain point his wife gave birth to a
son when he reached full maturity at the
age of 29 he started to reflect on the
problems of human existence particularly
the problem of suffering and as part of
an attempt to find a solution to this
problem he renounced the life of the
palace and went forth as a wandering
ascetic seeking the way to enlightenment
or awakening the way to utterly resolve
the problem of human suffering he
practiced the various types of
meditation that were available in his
time but wasn't satisfied with them then
he practiced extreme asceticism and
self-mortification for six years until
he carried these ascetic practices
almost to the point of death
he concluded that the practice of
asceticism would not lead to
enlightenment so then he began to take
normal food again regained his health
sat down at the bank of a river beneath
a widespread tree and resolved not to
rise up until he had reached his goal so
that night he entered into deeper and
deeper stages of meditation until by the
time morning came he was the enlightened
one Buddha the one who is woken up from
the delusion of ignorance after spending
several weeks and deep meditation
beneath the Bodhi tree he decided to go
forth and to teach the truths that he
had discovered he called his teaching
the Dharma and he went from village to
village town to town teaching and
guiding others along the path to
liberation he attracted a large number
of men and women who wanted to follow
him into the homeless life so in this
way he established the monastic Sangha
the order of monks and nuns
he continued to teach for forty five
years from the age of 35 to the age of
80 until he passed away in the small
Indian town of kusinara okay now we
raise the question why the Buddha's
teaching has been spreading so rapidly
and attracting so much interest in the
United States today I mean this is a
teaching 2,500 years old
it might seem that we could assign it to
the museums of the ancient the textbooks
of ancient history and yet we have
scientists economists a few politicians
educated people attracted to Buddha
practicing Buddhism even becoming
Buddhist monks and nuns so how do we
understand this to explain this I would
resort to two factors one is the aim of
the Buddha's teaching the other is its
methodology as to the aim the Buddha
formulated his teaching in a way that
directly addresses the critical problem
at the heart of human existence this is
the problem of suffering in all of its
range from bodily suffering to the
inevitability of death to the problems
of grief worry anxiety anguish and
despair and what the Buddha teaches is
not only suffering but also how to reach
the end of suffering how to find right
in this present life the highest
happiness and the most exalted peace in
order to clarify this the Buddha
compressed his full realization into a
very convenient framework which he calls
the Four Noble Truths so the first is
the truth that life involves suffering
the second is the truth that the cause
of suffering is craving self-centered
desire rooted in blind ignorance the
third truth declares that suffering can
be ended with the attainment of wisdom
and mental purification and the fourth
truth states that there is a practical
way to reach the end of suffering and
that is the Noble Eightfold Path as we
can see from the Four Noble Truths the
Buddha's methodology shows extraordinary
psychological insight the Buddha
explains suffering not by
friends to some outside factor but he
traces it to its roots within our own
mind to our ignorance and craving to
greed hatred and delusion and since
suffering arises from our own minds the
end of suffering the cure
also lies within our own mind by
dispelling our mental defilements are
mental obsessions and gaining clear
insight into the nature of reality to
bridge these two points the beginning
point of suffering the end point of
liberation the buddha offers a very
clear path of practice the Noble
Eightfold Path which begins with right
view of the basic truths about our
existence proceeds to the right
intention to undertake the training then
leads into the three ethical factors of
right speech right action and right
mindfulness I'm sorry right speech right
action Right Livelihood then proceeds to
the three factors of mental training
right effort right mindfulness and right
concentration when all these eight
factors of the path are brought to
maturity then one gains insight into the
true nature of existence and attains the
goal of wisdom and liberation of the
mind
hmm when we consider the special
relevance of the Buddha's teaching to
our own time what I find especially
important to note is that Buddhism can
provide helpful insights and practices
across a wide spectrum of disciplines
from philosophy and psychology to
medical care or ecology even the running
of a corporation as our men care will be
showing in his own book when it gets
completed and published so those who
feel attracted to a particular aspect of
Buddhist teaching don't have to buy the
whole Buddhist show so to speak but they
could take up whatever aspect attracts
them and use it for their own purposes
the Buddha says I don't have the closed
fists of a teacher so whatever is of
benefit to somebody they can take and
use in their own lifetime as in applying
it to their own life okay one of the
main ways in which Buddhism has been
getting a foothold in the West and one
of its greatest promises for the
unfolding of Western civilization has
been through its systems of meditation I
also believe that this is one of the
most important ways that Buddhism can
help us to emerge from our own confusion
and spiritual emptiness as I said
earlier the dangers that we face if we
really investigate where they originate
from they don't originate from weapons
from industry from corporate activities
themselves but they originate from our
ways of engaging with the world that is
they arise from greed hatred fear and
ignorance
and meditation is precisely the means
that the buddha has prescribed to help
us face and overcome these mental
afflictions so in order to help the
world to avert a destructive crisis what
we have to do is to strike a balance
between external change and internal
change but without internal change mere
outer change changes in government's
changes in politicians changes in
institutions changes in economic
policies will be only superficial for
any outer change to be truly enduring to
truly strike at the root it has to be
accompanied by and driven by an inner
change in people's hearts and minds and
the most effective way to bring about
that change is through the practice of
meditation sometimes people think that
meditation is just a way of escaping
from the problems of the world or just a
way of relaxing the mind but actually
meditation is the most immediate most
challenging and most deeply personal way
of contacting the real world the heart
and core of Buddhist meditation consists
in what is called Samadhi which is right
mindfulness the practice of mindfulness
involves the methodical development of a
simple mental faculty that is always
available to us but is seldom employed
to its full advantage usually we use
this faculty just in a superficial
manner
the faculty is the Faculty of awareness
or attention in our usual dealings with
the world the first moment of attention
with which any experience begins is
almost immediately overrun by
associative thoughts and mental
constructions conceptual constructions
and so these conceptual constructions
subordinate subordinate our direct
experience to our practical aims and
usually to our ego centered motivations
the methodical practice of mindfulness
aims at sustaining making continuous
this initial moment of attention so
through repeated practice the
development of mindfulness transforms
attention into a steady and continuous
powerful beam of awareness that can be
used to investigate the deep habits and
patterns of thought and emotion and can
even penetrate into the deep underlying
currents of conscious experience itself
my own teacher the German monk Venable
Jana Pony Katara wrote that the practice
of right mindfulness is quote the master
key for knowing the mind the perfect
tool for shaping the mind and the
manifestation of the mind that has been
liberated okay so so far I've been
dealing with the way Buddhism can help
us at the level of individual or
personal transformation but now I also
want to speak about the way in which
Buddhist principles can help us
in our communal life particularly with
respect to the formulation of public
policy some of the public problems or
communal problems we face today as I've
already mentioned include costly and
debilitating wars violations of human
rights the expanding gap between the
poor and the wealthy international
trafficking in drugs women and children
the exploitation over exploitation of
the earth's resources and global warming
and what is most striking when we
consider these problems as a whole is
what I call they're essentially
symptomatic character that is beneath
their apparent diversity they can be
seen to be just many manifestations of a
deep and hidden spiritual malignancy
that's infecting human society and the
common root of all of these problems
might be briefly described as a stubborn
insistence on placing narrow short-term
self-centered interests above the long
range good of the broader human
community and by self-interest I also
include the narrow interests of the
social or ethnic groups to which we
might happen to belong ok the Buddha's
teaching offers us two valuable tools to
help us extricate ourselves from this
tangle one is it's probing analysis of
the psychological springs of human
suffering and the other is its precise
path of moral and mental development the
Buddha explains that the Hidden Springs
of Kali
they're suffering are the same as those
of our personal suffering that is the
unwholesome roots of greed hatred and
delusion traditional Buddhism explains
these as the causes of personal
suffering but by taking a wider view we
can also see them as the sources of
social economic and political suffering
through the domination of greed the
world becomes transformed into a global
marketplace in which people are reduced
to the status of producers and consumers
through the prevalence of hatred
national religious and ethnic
differences become the breeding ground
of suspicion and enmity even erupting in
violence and brutal strike the cycles of
revenge and delusion bolsters the other
to unwholesome roots with false beliefs
and political ideologies usually
promoted to justify the policies of
those in positions of power so while
changes in social structures and
policies are surely necessary to
counteract our social economic and
political problems what I would say is
that from the Buddhist point of view
they aren't enough I would say that what
is needed above all else is a new
orientation what I would call a kind of
universal consciousness that will enable
us to regard others as being essentially
the same as oneself we have to learn to
reject the demands of self-interest and
acquire this universal perspective
from which the welfare of all appears to
be just as important as our own good
that is we have to outgrow the narrow
egocentric and ethnocentric attitudes to
which we are normally committed and
instead embrace a world centric ethic
that gives priority to the well-being of
all such a world centric ethic should be
molded upon three guidelines first we
have to overcome exploitative greed with
global generosity helpfulness and
cooperation second to replace hatred
suspicion and vengeance with a policy of
kindness tolerance and forgiveness and
third we have to recognize that the
world is an interconnected whole such
that irresponsible behavior anywhere has
potentially harmful consequences
everywhere these guidelines can
constitute the nucleus of a global ethic
to which all of the world's great
spiritual traditions could easily
subscribe without requiring any kind of
exclusive adherence to Buddhism the
chief values that underlie this ethic
are what in Buddhism we call loving
kindness and compassion values affirmed
by all the great spiritual traditions
through loving kindness we recognize
that all other people in this world want
to live happily and peacefully just like
ourselves and through compassion we feel
the suffering of others as our own and
work to alleviate their suffering
okay this call for a world centric ethic
doesn't spring from mere capricious
moral idealism or from wishful thinking
but it rests upon a solid pragmatic
foundation in the long run to blindly
pursue our narrow self-interest is to
undermine to harm our real long-term
interest and so by acting out of blind
deluded self-interest we contribute to
social disintegration social chaos to
ecological devastation it's just as if
we are sitting on the branch of a tree
on the side close to the trunk sawing
away the branch that lies I'm sorry
sitting out on the branch away from the
tree but away from the trunk sawing away
at the branch as we get further and
further down the branch eventually we
reach the point where yes we do get the
wood that we need to build our table a
chair but we come crashing down along
with it maybe to our death or to deadly
pain and suffering
okay so far I've been speaking about the
contribution that Buddhism can make to
the west and to the human future of
Western civilization but now I want to
say some words about the contribution
that the West can make to Buddhism
in my view what Buddhism can learn from
the West is the dynamism of the West the
readiness of the Western mind to engage
actively with the task of social
transformation and most importantly the
consciousness propounded by the best
Western thinkers of the need for social
justice and human rights thus in my view
the challenge facing Buddhism today is
to show greater concern for social and
economic justice if Buddhism is truly
about overcoming suffering it cannot
neglect the social and economic
dimensions of contemporary human
suffering
Buddhism originally arose as a path to
liberation among renunciants who had
left the household life and stepped out
of the rigid class structure of Indian
society but even from his position
outside the social order the Buddha
continued to be a keen observer of the
society around him in his discourses in
his disk okay it's working
in his discourses the Buddha laid down
clear guidelines that define the
distinctive marks of a just society in
the present day in the present day okay
okay in the present day world the
Buddha's teaching acquires a new and
compelling urgency specifically with
regard to this problem of social justice
the need to establish dumber in the
sense of righteousness or virtue is the
need not only to promote Buddhism as a
system of religious spiritual doctrines
and practices but to promote justice at
all levels social economic and political
and to promote justice means that it's
also our responsibility to criticize and
challenge injustice wherever we find it
to detect it to protest against it and
to pull away the curtains that protect
it the curtains of deception and
falsehood injustice can thrive only
behind the veil of deception and
falsehood when the veil is pulled away
and when the truth is made known then
injustice has to wither and fall away so
the great challenge facing Buddhism and
Buddhist today is to come forward as a
voice for justice in the world to become
a voice of conscience for all those
victims of social economic and political
injustice who cannot stand up who cannot
stand up and speak for themselves I want
to meet the CEO of will after this talk
okay the Buddha says that ignorance and
craving are the root causes of suffering
when we hear this we usually think of
ignorance and craving as the forces
driving us through sansara the round of
repeated rebirths or of ignorance and
craving as the causes of our personal
suffering but when we hear this we might
also think of other things we might
think of the global corporations
extending their reach over the world
without regard for the indigenous
economies that they dominate and
undermine we might think of the
merchants of arms who make millions of
dollars by selling weapons to those
intent on waging war we might think of
aggressive nations that seek to use
their military might to dominate the
globe killing thousands of helpless
women and children we might think of the
millions of women we might think of the
millions of women in the brothels of
South and Southeast Asia forced into a
life of misery and shame and we might
think of prisoners of conscience
forgotten by the world yearning for
democracy imprisoned by harsh autocratic
regimes it said that the Buddha's
mission the reason for his appearing in
the world is to free beings from
suffering by uprooting greed hatred and
delusion in our present-day greed hatred
and delusion are not simply matters of
our individual minds but they've
acquired a global reach extending even
to the villages
and towns in the remote corners of the
world producing misery and suffering as
their consequence and so at the present
time the challenge facing Buddhism is to
raise the Buddha's mission to a global
scale not merely by promoting the Dhamma
among those who are privileged enough to
be able to practice it in full leisure
but by helping those subject to the most
bitter forms of suffering receive the
justice for which they long in my view
this is a very deeply ethical challenge
facing contemporary Buddhism and it's a
challenge that Buddhism must meet if it
is to share in the Buddha's ongoing
mission ok this brings to the close the
main part of my talk but I just want to
mention some project that we group of
Buddhist and the East Coast started as a
way of fulfilling at least in part this
challenge that faces contemporary
Buddhism some years ago myself and some
of my Dharma friends and students felt
the need to find a way to put the
compassion of Buddhism into practice in
a way that addresses people who suffer
from economic and social injustice and
deprivation and so we established an
organization that we call Buddhist
global relief which has as its primary
mission to address the problems of
alleviating poverty and particularly
global hunger and chronic malnutrition
we've been in existence now for two
two-and-a-half years and two of our
board members are here with us today one
is Kim bahen she is the executive
director of BGR and the other is still
the Sun she is a board member and the
chair of the fundraising committee in
the two and a half years that we've been
in existence we've launched projects in
South Asia Southeast Asia Central Asia
including Afghanistan and Pakistan
Africa Mali in each year South Africa in
Haiti and also in the United States
where there's a lot of hunger and
malnutrition we've put out here some
brochures about our organization so we
invite those of you who are interested
to please feel welcome and come and take
a brochure and then to check out our
website to learn more there's also these
annual reports which I was using to hold
my paper so I'll put all of these out
and please all of you who are interested
please feel welcome to pick one up okay
so I want to thank you first I think
Hmong for inviting me to give this talk
and I thank you all for your attention
excuse me okay
Hmong says I could take one a couple of
questions so please if anybody has any
questions please feel welcome to ask but
don't ask difficult ones okay so please
hi I'm afraid this might be a difficult
question okay but can you cite any
examples in the past of where Buddhist
teachings have have been beneficial on a
broad societal scale to achieve the sort
of thing that you think we need to do
now okay that's a very good question I
would mention that probably the sterling
example of the application of Buddhist
social principles to the task of
improving the condition of society was
king ahsoka
of india of course the information that
we have about his reign is dependent
upon the rock edicts that he himself
commissioned to be put up but it said
that as king of Sokka
would promote he actively promoted the
well-being of his of his subjects he
built hospitals which provided medical
care for free he set up food
distribution centers which would
distribute food to the needy
he gave wealth to the poorest who is
poor subjects I think he abolished the
death penalty within his reign and he
lived the very pious religious life the
example of King Ashoka was followed by
some of the great Buddhist kings of Sri
Lanka who also built hospitals for the
subjects even hospitals for animals so
that sick animals could receive care
there and if to find out more details if
he you go on the internet you could look
up edicts of King Ashoka
I think you could find it through Google
kind of wondering like for Western
capitalism enlightened self-interest is
a very key principle yeah which seems to
kind of like there was a very direct
conflict with some of what you were
saying so I'm just kind of wondering do
you see that and okay do you see that
okay I think that's a very important
question and one thing we should
understand is that the Buddha's teaching
that he gave to monastics of you know
full renunciation was not the teaching
that he gave to his lay disciples to his
ladis ipols he taught them that they
should work diligently at their jobs
that they should earn money he
encouraged them to be wealthy but not to
earn the wealth by exploiting others and
then he taught the late disciples once
they acquire wealth to use the wealth
wisely in ways intended to promote first
their own well-being and the well-being
of their families he didn't teach them
to live in poverty and to reject all the
normal commodities that one needs to
live comfortably and happily but he also
taught that with the wealth that one
earns one should set aside
made a portion for emergencies this
would be maybe the equivalent to
insurance payments one should set aside
a portion for developing one's business
this would be like new investments and
then one should use a portion for
generosity and charity for helping the
poor and needy and for providing arms to
the renunciants the monks and nuns of
any religion not only Buddhism but in
India was the common tradition for
renunciants in any spiritual community
to get their sustenance by arms round so
the Buddha taught is lay disciples to
give arms offerings to the ascetics of
all the religious traditions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
