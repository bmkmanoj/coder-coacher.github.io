Chinese Academy of Science in 2002 and
he did his postdoc at Berkeley with
James Linda and now he's at the
University of Washington and he's going
to talk a bit about some work he's done
most recently on something called the
activity designer and his because if his
area and interests have been in say
rapid prototyping tools for ubiquitous
computing applications this talk is
going to be external and go up on
youtube so if you've got questions that
are of a confidential nature then we
need to hold them to the end when the
camera is no longer role so without
further ado thanks rich huh let's just a
wee folk slides to show off so sorry for
waiting how can hopefully it's a every
single bit what's going on
okay thanks everyone so I'm going to
talk about my work on rapid prototyping
tools for ubiquitous computing
applications first I would like to give
you a sense of what you become
applications I focused on so you become
applications are those that are kinds of
hard our everyday activities in the
physical world one a nice example here
is a google maps of iphone i think a lot
of you know what it what it is so they
are the application kind of proximate
the users current location using widely
accessible sell our information based on
a sense location of the user it can then
provide useful services such as finding
nearby businesses another example here
is the internet is play it gives
caregivers it continues awareness about
the elders everyday activities that are
detected we're RFID sensing technologies
so for 40 for example when the when the
elder forgets to take her medication are
the icon on the display that depicts the
medication studies will turn red so the
caregiver knows what happened so with
advances in sensor technologies as well
as a computing infrastructure there is a
huge potential to build the applications
like these examples to simplify our
lives and to achieve the vision for
ubiquitous computing so however it's
very difficult to design you become
applications compared to the
well-defined desktop computing
environments we are all familiar with
your word environments are more complex
right and our everyday activities in the
physical world are more dynamic
less structured another problem here is
that you become often your wives
sophisticated technologies so it's
require higher levels of technical
expertise to prototype and the test that
you become applications so before I go
on talking about how I'm going to
address these problems let's first
reflect on the success we have with
desktop computing applications and the
graphical user interfaces so a common
practice in user interface designs the
aterna tivity the iterative design that
involves are rapidly creating prototypes
and testing prototypes with users to get
feedback so many tools have been
developed for the process one of the
earliest successful examples is a I
oppose hypercar hypercard allows people
who don't have much that a technical
background to easily create the
graphical user interfaces another Nampo
is Dunham so it's a tool for the early
stage designer for websites I was
heavily involved your unit development
of denim so it has been downloaded over
100,000 times since the Tucson of wine
so it's really popular too for the early
stage for the early stage designer for
websites so rapid prototyping tools like
this examples have played an important
role in a successor for desktop
computing and the graphical user
interfaces so the purpose of these tools
is not for creating full-fledged final
applications but rather they can lower
the bar for interaction designers to
create interactive prototypes and
testing prototypes with end users to get
feedback so this turns out to be the key
factor for producing useful and the
usable user interfaces
so to achieve similar success for
ubiquitous computing I would like to
provide computational tools applaud for
designers to easily design the test that
you become applications so the rest of
my talk first I'm going to briefly talk
about my earlier work with a topiary for
rapidly prototyping location has the
applications a specific form of you
become applications and then I'm going
to spend the most time talking about my
original work on activity-based the
prototyping as well as its two sub heart
activity designer so when I first
started looking at the domain of you
become design it's a such a broad space
that is difficult to be addressed by a
single piece of work so our focused on
location enhance the applications these
applications can provide useful services
using the location of people places and
things right so I already talked about
what Google our iPhone map does at the
beginning of the talk I can host another
application it's a keeps track of
physical objects patients and doctors in
hospital building so these applications
are useful but they are difficult to
design test so location has applications
often require a high level of technical
expertise to design for the ample
location and the places sensor
technologies are non-standard and cut
and the complex although some turkeys
are available for programmers it often
takes weeks or you months to build a
location enhanced application before it
can be tested with any users together
any feedback so it's too slow and
expensive to iterate on design right so
for people who don't know how to program
such as interaction designers there are
no tools available at all
to address these problems i created the
topiary a tool for non-technical
designers to are easily creeds and the
test location enhanced applications so
there are two major research goals are
intended to achieve well with the
topiary so why is the how we can allow
designers to easily design
location-based the behaviors without
programming right another goal here so
how can we allow it design to be tested
with users in the field without having
to deploy a location infrastructure so
location infrastructures are not always
available especially indoors right and
there are also some complicated issues
such as location to place our inference
okay so here I would like to use a
running example to talk about how
topiary address the design of location
enhanced applications let's assume we
want to design a location-based the tour
guide so these are the list of features
we want to have to design session the
application the first thing we want to
do is to describe location context of
interest such as in or out the place
near or far from somewhere somebody so
to allow designers to easily specify
location location context i created a
visual language in topiary for this
purpose so you can first import it in
map image in a to as background
optionally we can draw a route network
on top of the map right so the road
network will be used for constructing
shortest paths at the wrong time then we
end models of people places and things
right so the map naturally represent the
spatial relationship opportunities and
it is for example bob is in the
bookstore in addition to presidency
contexts such as you know out we can
also specify
proximity contexts such as near far for
example although Cairo is outside of the
parking lot who proximity region
intersects the boundary of the parking
lot which indicates carrier is near the
parking lot while she is far from all
other entities so we can move people and
things on a map to represent diverse
spatial relationships then we can drop a
recording window to capture location
context of interest right so the
recording window works like a screen
capture tool but instead of capturing
pixels on the screen to bury captures
spatial relationships of those entities
that are included by the recording
window so in this case we got Bob is in
the bookstore right so then we can
generalize it capture the location
scenario for example replacing the book
the concrete place boost store is a in
place so of course we can also capture a
richer location scenario such as Carol
miss Bobby in the parking lot it can be
represented by multiple spatial
relationships here so the very language
here that's not necessarily cover the
entire space of location context but it
can cover a useful subset of location
context which are useful for our rapid
prototyping purpose so then actually we
can use the capture the location context
to specify a location based behaviors
are using a storyboard so a page
represent a securing of video output and
the link repair represents a transition
between pages for example when the user
clicks on the get info button or the
prototype will show the bookstore page
when the Bob of Obama is in the
bookstore and show the library page on
Bob is in the library right and when Bob
is neither of these two players
is the prototype to choose a map another
link here starts from the page itself
the link of the transition can
automatically take place as long as the
Associated scenario is true in this case
when anyone moves near Bob the prototype
choose a table of friends so that's how
the behavior of the prototype depends on
the location of the user so once we have
a prototype we want to test the
prototype with users how can we do that
so traditionally a prototype of a
desktop our application is tested with
the participants in a lab right but the
targeted user scenario of location has
applications are often in the field and
when the user is mobile and the a
prototype should behave based on the
change in location of the user so the
control lab environment is no longer
appropriate as a result topiary uses a
so-called Wizard of Oz approach to test
a location prototype so you need such a
test a user walks in the field with a
mobile device for running the prototype
then the designer acts like a wizard
simulates the user's location or a
separate device now I'm going to play a
video clip to give you a sense how this
works so the designer can start a
prototype on a mobile device such as a
PDA then the device can be handed to the
end user the designer can follow the
user around in the field and then
stimulates the user's location on the
map on separate device so the change of
the user's location will trigger the
application behavior and a user can
interact with the prototype on the
mobile device
so topiary has been downloaded over a
thousand times since to song full and
it's used by researchers and the
university students so I'm not going to
talk about details here and if you
you're interested no you can talk
afterwards so here I would like to give
you a summary about why we want to do a
turret of design with the topiary right
so without topiary we can only explore
how so it took us a few weeks to just
explore a single design and we have to
program and deal with sensors but with
to bury oh we can explore multiple
designs just in a few hours right and
all the time during the design process
we only need to deal with the high-level
abstractions such as Maps storyboards
and with Ross ok so after I develop the
topiary a natural thought was how we can
provide computational tools of hard for
people to easily a prototype and test a
broader set of you become applications
to achieve that goal or there are two
central research questions right so why
is a how we can go beyond the location
right so topiary uses a map metaphor to
represent the location context so what
would be a appropriately framework or
structure to incorporate the more
diverse contact remit information into
the design another question here's how
we can go beyond controlled environments
for testing you become applications
right for many you become applications
it's very important to test them in
people's everyday lives so tubulars
design kind can be tested in the field
but it's it's a stale a controlled
environment right so the wizard has to
follow the user
so a one-handed we want these prototypes
to to be created at a low cost on the
other hand we want them to be tested in
people's everyday lives who are extended
period of time which inevitably require
high degrees of realism and the
robustness with the research questions
in mind I focused on a setup for
emerging you become applications so
these applications employ rich contact
information about the people's everyday
lives and they should high value by self
by supporting people's long-term
activities such as keeping feed and
elder care but again these applications
are very difficult to design test it's
more difficult to design test than
location-based applications so to
understand why it's difficult to design
and test these applications here of the
like you are looking to the design and
development process of you defeat the
application developed at the Intel
research Seattle upp to improves
people's awareness about their physical
activities by visualizing their work
health status as flowers or butterfly
for example the more exercises a user
has done the more flowers will be shown
on this play right so first UV fish is
addressing a very complex target domain
it is the past killing field long-term
activity could spend years or you in the
lifetime of the user second you defeat
requires high levels of or technical
expertise to prototype it took a crew of
technically skilled researchers two
years to design develop and deploy unity
and finally because you defeat is
addressing a long-term activity it has
to be tested in people's everyday lives
over x 10
the period of time so that the impact of
the design can be observed right it
would be impossible to observe the
behavior change a short period of time
so it turned out these difficulties are
not just with the particular project of
you be filled my colleagues and I
conducted the interview is with the 11
professional interaction designers and
we find many designers encountered
similar challenges and we found the
field research is very important for you
become design and it's important to
bring field fundings into a design
process as a context for design and
currently there is no tools apart for
that and because of high-level technical
barriers exist for experimenting with
new ideas it's very difficult and
expensive to push a earlier idea to
functional prototype and into the real
world experiment so these are the
problems are I intend to address so my
research goal at the high level is to
pro is to provide computational tools of
hard to allow non-technical people to
easily prototype and deploy what used to
take a team of researchers weeks and
months to do so to achieve that ago I
created the activity designer it rapid
loss ratio the prototype which 24 hour
you become applications so here I would
like to use a real example to talk about
why activity designer is useful in
design you become applications you be
green is a project conducted by
researchers at the University of
Washington encouraged Mellon University
and the Intel research Seattle so you'll
be growing addresses environmental
protection by encourage people to do
transportation activity
that have less impact on the environment
so the designer started the design or by
describing what are possible
transplantation activities right so the
the information can come from field
research or solely based on the
knowledge of the designer then the
designer created a prototype called
you'll be using a phone application
using graphical story body and
prototyping by demonstration as we can
see here the designer used a lot of
examples to describe how the leaves of
the tree should change based on the
number of a guerrilla activities a user
has done okay so then the designer
deployed the prototype to multiple
participants and it only took a few
button clicks and copy paste to deploy
such a prototype so it's really a lot
easier for deployment the prototype was
tested with a multiple participants or
two weeks and participants
transplantation activities were detected
you know combined we are some basic
transportation activities such as runny
or biking or detected by mobilizing
platforms which are developed at the
interview sir seattle and the u-dub some
transportation activities which are
difficult to be detected such as a
driver and taking bus these activities
are reported by users themselves so
during the testing process the designer
was able to monitor multiple tests at
the same time or a remote computer so as
we can see here the designer had two
kinds of designs and the each of them
was tested with the six participants
it's like a between-subjects study the
so the designer intend to find out which
designs tie her
and the designer can revise the design
and redeploy that is on anytime remotely
so the designer didn't have to collect
all the mobile devices back in order to
deploy a new design it could do he could
just do it to remotely okay so hopefully
at this point you got a rough idea about
what activity designer does so now i
would like to flash out more details
about the true and the theory behind too
so the process ie ie internet feels
apart with activity designer is a
saccade are activity-based the
prototyping so the process starts with a
field research then it goes through the
loop of activity analysis and modeling
interaction prototyping and the in-situ
testing at the first glance the process
seems like a simple extension for the
iterative process iterative design
process but what special here is the
important role of human activities are
playing so human activities are used as
a first class objects in the entire
design process activities are
transformed from field observations to
activity models to competition and
constructs so back to the question how
how can we incorporate diverse
contextual information to design right
so how can we encourage the context
which human activities into the design
process that's a to answer that question
are looking into our activity theory now
I'm going to talk a little bit about
theory our bureau before we get to the
technical details so activity theory our
offers a consistent view about the
context
and it also gives activity hierarchy the
hierarchy includes activities actions
and the operations for example for the
long term activity kidney feed it can be
carried out as a set of actions such as
lifting weights and running out
treadmill an action can in turn be
decomposed as a sequence of operations
such as pushing a quick button to start
and running so the hierarchy captures
the essence of a long-term activity but
it's inadequate to capture the
situational factors that might be
associated with our activities such as a
location information we cannot fit the
location information into the hierarchy
so for you become design I introduced a
few new concepts are to the hierarchy
program for further for the running
action it can happen in multiple
situations right joining with friends at
the gym or running on low at the park so
I call the combination of a an action in
a situation is seen so it sees a
directed observation about the people's
everyday lives and then the same action
can serve for multiple purposes for
server multiple themes that's a high
level activity structures of example
running for keeping feed and running for
fun so a theme is a equivalent concept
of activities in activity theory so the
hierarchy actually are the swimmer here
underlies the entire activity designer
system as i'm going to show in the next
few slides so now i'm going to talk
about the key features of activities
energy in supporting each of these steps
so field data may coming as a free text
images are images video clips
Oh metadata such as structure the
questionnaires so this this field data
can be imported in the two as a
collection of scenes our observations so
you do have to do a field of research to
use a tool you can just end these
observations based on your own knowledge
right the bass tone is in the video
observations then we can create high
level activity structures themes esteem
as a nasdaq about the people's everyday
lives for example eating healthy and
having fun are two aspects for staying
healthy right so each team is associated
with a subset of scenes or observations
clicking our team will make activities
einer only to show a subset of
observations so on these activity models
observations and themes are maintained
visible throughout a design process
that's how they can form a context for
design so designers can picture target
activities in their mind as I'm going to
show you the next few slides these
activity models are also important
resource for creating functional
prototypes and that they are also a
basis for generating computational
constructs for running these prototypes
at the runtime okay so then the next
step is to create to create functional
prototypes your activity designer we can
create multiple multiple prototypes at
the same time so we can think globally
in terms of how each of these prototypes
should behave to provide coordinated
support for target activities the story
ball here shows the design of the house
monitor application so I'm going to use
this design to talk about are the key
features of activity designer
okay let's do something concrete here
the first figure feature we want to
prototype here's turns a purple fish to
a goldfish when the user has run when
the user has achieved her weekly
exercise goal which is running in the
gym four times a week so the key product
to prototype with this feature is it to
specify the condition right when the
user has drawn in the gene four times
this week to design such a feature the
designer catracho the running workout
action to the link to create a condition
the default query is a constructed then
the designer can interactively customize
a query into a target form such as a
specified time period confidence value
activities of interest yep so the
activity career language allows
designers to usually specify activity
queries over noisy event streams so we
can specify our activity occurrences of
interest using a list of filters the
specification here represents all the
running work out of the user or her
friend in the gym or park we can also
use the theme to represent a class of
actions of situation situational factors
the second specification here represents
all the actions of the user for having
fun so in addition to graphical story
body for prototyping we can also
demonstrate how the interface output
should change based on the user's
activities for the nampa based on a
three example out at the bottom of the
screen the system can learn the mapping
between the numerical value of the
nutrition status and the video output so
the so the tile will rotate at the
runtime based on the
nutrition staggers for those are
advanced the designers or users they can
also script rich behaviour so I'm not
going to talk about this in detail here
so then we can test a design I need time
with simulated activity data right so in
the in the activity designer we can also
debugger the design like we can click on
we can interact with the prototype like
any user can so we can test multiple
prototypes at the same time okay then we
can test the digit prototypes with the
real users of the target devices so
activity designer provides two options
for running a prototype a prototype can
directly run on the activity designer
virtual machine if the target device is
a high-end device such as a tablet pc
for the low-end devices such as a mobile
phone the virtual machine will not be
able to run so in that case a prototype
can be automatically converted to a web
application it's actually based on
google web toolkit so it's really cool
so at the wrong time users activities
can be detected the veer real sensors or
reported by users themselves I mentioned
this earlier so all these components are
communicating with each other through
activities server it keep a key
component in the activity designer
runtime architecture so the architecture
allows a new component to be easily
plugged in for example if we have a new
sensing technology we can plug the here
and there it will work
so these are our interfaces for
reporting activities and these are
computing constructs such as sensor
wrappers or database structures they are
all automatically generated based on
activity models we created at the very
beginning of the design so it really
makes the deployment a lot easier so the
designer doesn't have to care about all
these technical details and we can
analyze the design easily u- the
designer we can load in your session and
replace activity logs with the prototype
we can also use the same query language
to generate a graph for example like
what's showing here so we can do some
simple statistical analysis engine
activity designer we can also export the
data the query data query the data so we
can do some more analysis in other
statistical tools okay so next I'm going
to talk about how I evaluated the
activity designer so first I conducted a
lab study with ten participants the
participants will ask you to design the
key features over three applications
here I would like to briefly talk about
what I found from the study so
participants were able to finish our
most of these tasks and we got positive
feedback in particular although now my
participants had a background he
activity theory they were able to easily
understand the concepts and the
representation of activity from the work
so the study also revealed the need to
have a more expressive way to specify
courage that's why that's that was a the
motivation for me to enter the query
language in the current version of
activity designer so then I conducted a
lab study to evaluate the query language
in particular six participants were
asked the to specify queries in response
to 15 questions in natural English for
example for the question has a user be
in the classroom of theatre for five
minutes the participants were asked a
were required was required to specify
the query in the dialog box like this so
participant were able to finish most
tasks without help and in particular for
those participants who had experience in
sequel and you become development the
comment is that the query language is
much easier than sequel and it's still
expressive enough to specify a range of
queries activity designer has also been
used by other researchers in their
design projects such as for the domain
of Environmental Protection and the
social awareness so I talked about you
begin earlier so from these studies I
found the framework as well as a to
support of the the activity designer
system were effective for designers to
describe and prototype you become
applications that could address
large-scale activities I found the
designers were able to create and deploy
prototype sincerity in just a few hours
rather than a few months and there have
been some positive results in terms of
how activity designer allows people to
create new applications so i have a
released activity designer as open
source so please download the two and
give it a try
so in conclusion of my research in this
area are contributed to rapid
prototyping tools topiary for
prototyping location has the
applications and activity designer for
design you become application for you in
city testing in addition to software
artifacts are my work I also contributed
a activity-based prototyping process in
particular the activity framework
provides a new way for describing and
structuring contextual information so
looking forward I would like to continue
working on new technologies that allow
people to effectively leverage the
rapidly growing computing power and the
information resources so if we look at
the trajectory of our interaction design
from desktop to ubiquitous computing we
always trying to in cover the more
information into the design process
right so activity designer pro provides
a platform for activity based design so
I hope to work or to explore more to
support for design you become systems
that could address large-scale
activities I also intend to empower any
users to be able to easily create
personal gadgets so these google gadgets
are actually created with the activity
designer so they are fully interactive
and they can behave based on users
activities such as transportation
activities and daily exercises right so
based on my experience with the activity
designer a hope to develop for a higher
level two or more specialized two for
end users to be able to easily create
google gadgets right so we have millions
of godÃ­s easily created and yeah so i
was supposed to give you a live demo but
might
good crap so I mean I can do it too
later so another direction I intend to
work on is the data driven design and
development of interactive systems so as
user activities are getting more and
more complex it's very important for us
to analyze the massive data we collect
and to identify users needs and to
optimize interaction behaviors these
systems are other projects are having
been working on in parallel so activity
prism is a tool for analyzing people's
behavior of activity patterns it
provides mud hallways with for people to
look into activity data and the cars is
a system for automatically extracting
interaction logic from testing sequences
so it can actually extract is a
storyboard from a screenshot data
finally I would like to work on
activity-based context were computing in
particular I would like to study the
issue of how to organize computing and
information resources based on a user's
activity the benefit here so then we can
provide users with information computing
resources that are relevant to their
current activity so I think these are
nice google products such as I google
and google mobile and google desktop
they provide a great platform for me to
explore this research agenda so another
research area I have worked on
so actually that's a good question so I
think so I google can already do
something so we can already do some
activity business stuff with I google so
it's like each tab actually I studied I
google so you each tab here's like drop
search family visit and planning
vacation so like each tab is already
like a container of activity right so we
can add some relevant gaddy's to that
tab so yeah so i will go already has on
the nice feature of this so i think it's
really a nice platform to work on
another area i have intentionally worked
on my sub 10 base the user interfaces so
i have worked out our problems such as
gesture recognition young party and
pen-based mode switching so that's one
example interactive motion at this point
i would like to thank my divisor james
landed as well as my collaborators on
this work thanks very much and i can
take questions I feel so as you move you
have the example of designing for
designers and designing for end users
and you have an example of deploying
this the gadgets to the end users what
what do you have to do to make that
transition from one group of people
designers to end user
a big difference is so like designer
smarter so the assumptions that designer
designers have known so designers have a
more expertise so so for any users oh we
certainly need to provide higher level
support for them right so I think for so
my work has been focused on to support
for designers so with these tools we can
know tell me about her so as we know
that I'm a better we can provide a
better to support for any users so I'm
not sure I answer question yeah so so
it's like the first set of tools for
designers is more open ended in general
and then exactly right ball exactly so
well tools for designers so tooth for
any users normally the environment
should be there should be more stuff has
been used too many that right so we can
only support any users to customize
interaction behaviors in your small in a
smaller range right for designers it's
like everything from is from scratch so
it's like while paper then I draw my
design so these tools allow designers to
explore a larger space so I think that's
a one of the difference to turn tools
for designers and the tools foil and the
users when you mentioned the wizard of
oz model for
feel deserving the users on on the phone
or the device or whatever it is that
you're looking at the experience is
there logging going on or sometimes yes
just capture the screens exactly so all
right let me kind of slow but I can
answer question the same time so all
right so we can actually record and
replay a test right so when we really
play the test and we can observe how how
much time a user spend on your screen
and then we can use so the two can also
show the trio the the user has walked
and we can also analyze the story about
the transition and so yeah so it's a the
entire test is a recorded and we can
really replay the test yeah any other
questions so in the beginning of the
presentation you mentioned that you when
you were designing for you become you
need to design very sophisticated
systems I'm just curious like whether
it's the sophisticated systems or
whether it's more about repurposing the
existing systems work in a new context I
mean a simple example is like you know
many times when you talk about like
super high-end technologies like you
know a very high very high densities a
storage devices stuff like that so like
eight capacity in a very small flash
drive what's it like you know even a 32
will be outdated flash drive might serve
the purpose in the new context so I'm
just trying to figure out like you know
whether it's more about making
use of the existing systems in a new
context versus trying to develop like
super high five systems from scratch and
what's your perspective on things this
so for this I think your question is
whether we want to design our entire new
system from scratch all we want to
enhance existing systems when you're
trying to design for ubiquitous
computing should you directly go for
like you know developing highly complex
systems from scratch versus trying to
analyze okay what are the needs that I
am trying to serve first and then seem
like you know Arden enough existing
technologies which can somehow support
because different technologies have like
you know different curves in terms of
how much sophistication they need right
so that's a good question so I think as
a first first step you always want to
understand the existing technologies and
existing activities right so then you
under the fire what are the BRIC turns
using existing activities with existing
technologies right so once we understand
that oh then the next thing is that we
want to come up some one come up with
some new designs to address those
problems so with these tools you can
create the mock-ups for the new systems
you're thinking about that you test the
new designs with with users to get
feedback then the next step is so how
can we realize the new design idea in
the actual settings right it could be
just the simple extension of the
existing systems or it could be it could
require us to redesign and redo the
hosting so the these tools they provide
a way for people to figure that out
right
actually one of the reasons why I like
it so much because if you look at it
from the point of view of saying
databases it's not a very complicated
database Perseids it's a pretty
primitive I don't want to like you know
say that you know it's but it's
relatively primitive in terms of the
code database functionalities but the
way you have repurposed it in the
context of the problem that we are
trying to solve I think that's really
brilliant right so yeah thanks for
comments first time so I think the good
thing here is also I mean they're
kissing here so we wanted developer
tools not really server for the
preference right you were very I mean
even the truth oh thank fantastic for
one purpose it's it's not necessarily
the right thing for another purpose
right so it has to be appropriate for
the goal you want to achieve yeah have
you actually thought about sort of
scalability of these schools in terms of
sale initially if I say developer gadget
I mean especially the iGoogle gadget
when you mention it's like I google
gadget has the capacity to be deployed
or I will maybe couple of million people
can use it if you have enough adoption
so have you thought about like how this
sort of rapid prototyping who can scale
and in a way it goes back to work at the
point which you are making yeah that's
definitely a good question so I think
one issue these to suffer is definitely
scalability right so the the main
purpose of these two sis is to create a
mock-up right to figure out these a
space to understand what it wanted a
zombies for the iGoogle think that's
something I I so basically I in terms of
scalability activity designer is much
better than topiary and you can you
really create a lot of realistic stuff
with a activity designer but for that
future work I proposed tools for end
users to create two
Curry's google gadgets that part I
intended to create some new tools of hot
writers like even higher level to
support for end users to easily create
the final stuff that's something final
it's not just a mock-up so this is it
thank you very much thanks thanks very
much
