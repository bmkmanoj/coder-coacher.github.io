sorensen founder of Flibe energy kirk
has been a promoter of energy from
thorium for a long time he has a website
envy and thorium comm we're pretty big
community of amateurs and experts from
around the world have been contributing
to the community effort to define what
would be the optimal thorium reactor
nuclear reactor that generates
electricity from thorium this is a
technology that's been around for a long
time since shortly after World War two
it was matured well up until early 1970s
and then and then kind of suddenly ended
in favor of the liquid metal fast
breeder reactor which then also ended
and Curtis can give us a talk today and
explain kind of what went wrong why it
stopped why it hasn't been done
you know if it's such a great idea why
aren't we doing it and there are
actually some very good reasons for that
and many other reasons are cast and
maybe we should start doing it again
so please thank you very much Chris I'm
very glad to be here at Google today and
given another Tech Talk I always enjoy
coming and being a part of these things
the question that I'm going to try to
answer today is one that I'm often asked
as I give presentations on thorium in
fact I'm almost always asked this
question which is Kirke thorium sounds
like a great idea it sounds like it's a
good technology why didn't this happen
we are Flibe energy a new company to
develop liquid fluoride thorium reactor
technology we're following the vision of
Alvin Weinberg he was the director of
Oak Ridge National Labs from the 50s to
the 1970s and he had a vision of how we
could use thorium to advance beyond the
current constraints of our society in
terms of fossil fuels hydropower
and existing nuclear technology one of
the amazing parts about his vision was
how this could transform not only the US
economy but many other places in the
world some of which don't have the
resources that we have in terms of fresh
water or arable land this is a vision he
had of how thorium reactors could be
used to desalinate water grow crops in
desert areas and to some of us like
called terraforming the earth but to
really truly change the economic balance
of the world Weinberg's vision on the
other hand was brought to an end in the
early 1970s and that really is the
subject of the
talk today there really weren't three
options for nuclear energy at the dawn
of the nuclear era there was uranium-235
which was the fissile form of uranium
this was the form of uranium that could
actually be utilized directly in a
nuclear reactor most of the uranium was
uranium 238 this had to be transformed
into another nuclear fuel called
plutonium before it could be used and
then there was thorium and in a similar
manner to uranium 238 it also had to be
transformed into another nuclear fuel
uranium 233 before it could be used in a
reactor there were some significant
differences though between these three
fuels as I mentioned uranium 235 could
be used directly the other two had to be
transformed and that meant they needed
two neutrons to be consumed one to
transform them and one to fission them
and in order for this to be a
sustainable process you had to know what
will they emit more than two neutrons
when they fission and the answer was yes
they did in fact all three of them
emitted more than two neutrons when they
fission here was uranium-235 uranium-238
about two and a half neutrons per
fission and plutonium would vision with
almost three neutrons per fission so it
would emit the most neutrons when
efficient so the first answer was yes
all three of the fuels gave off enough
neutrons to sustain their consumption
and reactor but there was more to the
story this is a busy graph and I
apologize in advance for it but it tells
the story of much of our nuclear history
and what it shows is plutonium doesn't
emit enough neutrons when it isn't being
fission by fast neutrons in order to
continue the conversion of future
uranium into plutonium continue its
breeding it has to be fission by fast
neutrons in order to do this on the
other hand thorium and uranium-233
produce enough neutrons in both thermal
and fast vision to continue the
utilization of that fuel I call it the
threshold of two and it's not just about
how many neutrons they emit but how many
neutrons they admit even accounting for
absorption because they don't always
fission every single time they're hit by
a neutron uranium 233 and plutonium 239
of those two in thermal neutrons only
your
2:33 crosses the threshold of to in fast
vision on the other hand both uranium
233 and plutonium 239 cross the
threshold of two so it would seem well
we just want a fast reactor we don't
want a reactor that uses slow down
thermal neutrons we want a fast reactor
because then we will have great
confidence that we will be able to
sustain the consumption of nuclear fuel
well there's a powerful disincentive to
doing it this way and it has to do with
what are called cross-sections these are
a mathematical way of describing how
likely it is that a nuclear reaction
will proceed and they take the form of
areas and quite literally an area
sometimes called a barn which is 10 to
the minus 24 square centimeters this is
a really really really small unit of
area but this is the unit that nuclear
engineers used to describe how probable
a nuclear reaction is this is the
cross-section of uranium 233 to a
thermal Neutron by comparison this very
very small circle right here is the
cross-section of uranium 233 to a fast
Neutron so it's not hard to see which
one is more likely to have a fission
reaction a thermal Neutron is far more
likely to cause a fission reaction than
a fast Neutron so the advantage now
seems to be for the thermal reactors
this is a general feature of almost all
nuclear materials that their
cross-sections are much larger the
thermal neutrons than they are the fast
neutrons here we see the cross-section
of plutonium it's huge in the thermal
spectrum and it's very very small in the
fast spectrum and that means that
plutonium is much more likely to have a
nuclear reaction to a slow down Neutron
than to a fast Neutron so again why
consider a fast reactor well it's
because look at these red regions those
red regions indicate the probability
that the neutron will be absorbed but
not cause a fission that it will simply
just be absorbed you can see that that
probability is about 10% for uranium 233
and the thermal but if we were to
magnify that cross-section significantly
by a factor of 500 you can see that that
probability become
much smaller in the fast spectrum a fast
Neutron if it is absorbed almost always
will cause a fission this is significant
for uranium 233 but it's much more
significant for plutonium 239 it will
absorb a neutron about one-third of the
time and not cause a fission but in the
fast spectrum it will almost always
cause efficient so to make sure that we
cross that threshold of two it was
necessary to build fast reactors that
would use plutonium on the other hand it
was conceivable that you could build
thermal or fast reactors that would use
uranium 233 this uncertainty was not
particularly appealing at the time they
wanted to move out in directions that
they felt very confident about it so the
United States began to pursue a fast
breeder reactor in 1951 they built the
experimental breeder reactor one in
Idaho this was a fast breeder reactor
this was a reactor that was going to not
slow down neutrons we used fast neutrons
to convert uranium into plutonium and to
breed from it this was actually the
first reactor to generate some power it
lit four little light bulbs and
ultimately generated I believe several
hundred kilowatts of power but it shows
how early the United States was moving
out on the fast breeder reactor it was
followed by the experimental breeder
reactor number two which was also a fast
breeder reactor much larger this time it
made 62 megawatts of thermal power
industry got excited about the potential
for making breeder reactors this was
actually a commercial reactor the Enrico
Fermi breeder reactor in Monroe Michigan
they began working on this reactor in
1957 and it achieved criticality in 1966
but shortly after to achieve criticality
they had a small meltdown at the Enrico
Fermi reactor where the reactor was
damaged and and shut down at this time
alvin weinberg and his colleagues at the
Oak Ridge National Labs were working on
molten salt reactors these were reactors
that didn't operate in the fast spectrum
they operated with slowed down neutrons
and they predominantly were interested
in using thorium and uranium-233
Weinberg wrote an introduction to
series of papers that were published in
a nuclear journal in 1969 and these are
some of the words that he used and I've
always found it very interesting how
careful and measured he was with his
utilization of language because he knew
that most of the effort in the country
was on the fast breeder reactor and very
little in comparison was on the
molten-salt reactor he said the
prevailing view holds that the liquid
metal fast breeder reactor is the proper
path to ubiquitous permanent energy it
is no secret that I as well as many of
my colleagues at Oak Ridge have always
felt differently when the idea of the
breeder was first suggested in 1943 the
rapid and efficient recycle of the
partially spent core was regarded as the
main problem nothing that has happened
in the ensuing quarter century has
fundamentally changed this so Weinberg
begins to lay out the scenario that
physics hasn't changed and unless you
can rapidly reprocess nuclear fuel you
won't be able to realize the benefits of
the breeder reactor he then goes on to
offer an alternative to the prevailing
view the successful breeder will be the
one that can deal with the spent fuel or
the spent core most rationally either by
achieving extremely long burn up or by
greatly simplifying the entire recycle
step we at Oakridge have always been
intrigued by this latter possibility it
explains our long commitment to liquid
fueled reactors first the aqueous
homogeneous and now the molten salt so
he presented a different scenario how
they could use fluid fueled reactors to
achieve the overall goal of the
efficient utilization of nuclear fuel
and the series of papers that followed
in this were some of the first
discussions in the nuclear literature
about the potential the molten salt
reactor it was not well known the monies
that had been appropriated in order to
research the different breeder reactor
types are listed in this graph and I
found this graph thanks to a book that
had been scanned into Google Books
thanks to a project started by my good
friend Chris yulik here so I greatly
appreciate this is one of the many
things I'm sure people have done with
your work numbers are one thing so I
took it through it in a spreadsheet and
made a nice graph the red line shows the
expenditures on the fast
breeder reactor and this graph only
begins in 1968 at that point the United
States had already built in several fast
breeder reactors we're looking at 75 to
nearly a hundred million dollars in 1968
it's very hard to see the the green line
for the molten-salt breeder reactor
technology it's extremely low and then
ultimately it was canceled and briefly
resurrected in 1975 and then canceled
again on the scale of the appropriations
that were made to the fast breeder
reactor you just about can't see the
Appropriations that were made to the
molten-salt breeder reactor in June of
1971 President Richard Nixon made a
speech where he talked about the need
for the fast breeder reactor he put the
United States on record that this would
be a top national goal now we don't have
any video from the speech he gave that
day but later on in that day he called
representative Craig Hosmer from
California to tell him about the speech
about the breeder reactor yeah Craig
Heisner Oh present you missed our
meeting when we had not breeder reactor
you know I wanted you to know that we
sent the message today Craig but that I
guess told Ziegler - I told Ziegler to
tell the press that is a bipartisan
effort that you and Hollifield and
self-aligned had been bugging me about
it and the one thing I want to tell you
too is it I uh
Holly Poole was there last night for the
club thing and I've told the people
around here now this has got to be
something we play very close to the vest
but I am being ruthless on one thing any
activities that we possibly can should
be placed in Southern California in this
field and also in the saline water field
good
you know we need the jobs we need to
stop up those air Plattsburgh workers
now we've got some we're going to do a
couple of new things on water for
example and I decided to throw one big
plant in the Southern California I mean
you know a big one of these implementing
is you know what I mean is it's just a
question how big the plant is but in
this energy field I told dr. David and
of course cbourgin arrest that we do it
so on the committee every time you have
a chance needle up and say where's it's
going to be let's push the California
and well you do that
that's a dynamite president so delighted
you released that 16 million dollars on
the improvement of the enriching complex
good that handles a bad blood roblems
great good good unplug them well they
told me you're interested in it nice as
well as Hosmer's were important all
right let's pause there you can tell
just a little bit from listening to
Nixon's words that the fast breeder
reactor was viewed by him and probably
some others in his ministration as
something that they could use to
economic advantage for the people of
Southern California to get it Nixon was
from California Hosmer was from Southern
California Hollifield Chet Holifield who
ran the Joint Committee on atomic energy
was also from California and I think
some of the phrases in this in this
phone call are very interesting I'm
going to be ruthless on this we've got
to play this very close to the vest it's
about jobs if you're for it I'm for it
it doesn't lead me to believe that the
president was seriously considering
alternatives to the fast breeder reactor
and other paths that could be taken it
was a focus on what can we do right now
to get jobs back home to the the folks
are going to support us in reelection
well a few months later Nixon was at
Hanford Washington which is the site of
many of our nation's earliest nuclear
energy facilities and he was also giving
a talk on the significance of the
breeder reactor and and again note the
economic potential that he puts in front
of people during this talk that is why I
made an announcement on June the fourth
one that didn't get of course the
enormous publicity of the announcement
of the journey to China one that didn't
get the publicity of my announcement of
the new economic policy to deal with the
problems of inflation and
in this country but one which in terms
of the future the country may be in long
term long range terms even more
important in some respects and that is
that the United States was going to go
forward in building a breeder reactor
I don't ask me what a breeder actor is
ask dr. Schlessinger but don't tell him
not to tell you because unless you're
one of those PhDs you won't understand
it either but what I do know is this
that here we have the potentiality of a
no new breakthrough in the development
of power for peace and that means jobs
jobs for this area but jobs in power for
hundreds for millions of people all over
the world jobs jobs is what it was all
about and this area that Nixon was
talking to in Hanford Washington this
was a very well-educated area a lot of
the people in the background there
probably had PhDs in nuclear engineering
and knew exactly what a breeder reactor
was but Nixon was emphasizing the
economic benefits to them of his
announcement that there was going to be
a breeder reactor all of this business
about breeder reactors nuclear energy
and the stuff is over made that was one
of my poorest subjects science and I got
through it but I had to work too hard I
gave it up and I was about a sophomore
well maybe it might have benefited our
country a little more if Nixon had been
able to ascertain the different values
of different types of breeder reactors
and why one might have an advantage over
another but nevertheless the US was now
firmly on the course of making the
breeder reactor a national priority
Nixon emphasized it in his State of the
Union speech he then emphasized it in
another message to Congress the
Democratic and Republican party
platforms in 1972 both included the fast
breeder reactor as a national priority
now this is about the time when Weinberg
story with the molten salt reactor
begins to intersect this much larger
story of the breeder reactor and the
congressional support behind it as well
as the presidential support testimony
given in September of 1972 they noted
that the US government would be expected
to cover cost overruns on the breeder
reactor and the
development cost would go over 700
million dollars at this point industry
had already committed to hundred million
dollars either then year dollars to the
breeder reactor effort representative
Craig Hosmer who was the fellow on the
phone call that we heard earlier said
that if cost targets were missed I for
one don't intend to scream and holler
about it it's not hard to see that they
could see great economic benefits
accruing to their area of the country if
the breeder reactor program was to go
forward in that same month the Atomic
Energy Commission issued wash 1222 which
was an evaluation of Weinberg's molten
salt breeder reactor it was highly
critical of several technological issues
that had been encountered during the
development of that idea more
importantly though it almost completely
ignored the safety and economic
improvements possible through the use of
the molten salt breeder reactor
technology Weinberg himself had a
meeting with Chet Holifield and millon
Shah of the Atomic Energy Commission in
1972 we don't know exactly when this
meeting took place our only record of it
is contained in Weinberg's book his
autobiography the first nuclear era
here's what he said
I found myself increasingly at odds with
the reactor division of the Atomic
Energy Commission the director of the
time was Milt Shaw Milt was cut from the
rickover cloth he had a singleness of
purpose and was prepared to bend rules
and regulations in achievement of his
goal why would he feel this pressure if
he has the president and these
congressional folks pushing for the fast
breeder reactor at the time he became
director the Atomic Energy Commission
had made the liquid metal fast breeder
reactor the primary goal of its reactor
program milk tackled the LMF PR project
with Rick ovarian dedication woe unto
any who stood in his way this caused
problems for me since I was still
espousing the molten salt breeder mill
was like a bull he enjoyed congressional
confidence so his position in the AEC
was unassailable and it was clear that
he had little confidence in me or
Oakridge after all we were pushing
molten salt not the fast breeder more
than that we were being troublesome over
the question of reactor safety and that
was another aspect that was getting
Weinberg into trouble he had invented
the pressurized light water reactor
formed the backbone of the reactor
technologies that were being developed
in the country at that time here's a
picture of some of the pressurized water
reactors his work on the thorium reactor
led him to believe that a significantly
higher level of safety was possible and
this in large part was because the
thorium reactor operated at low
pressures whereas water-cooled reactors
operated at high pressures so he was
beginning to bring these issues up in
support of the thorium reactor but it
didn't have that effect
congressman Chet Holifield was clearly
exasperated with me and he finally
blurted out Alvin if you're so concerned
about the safety of reactors then I
think it might be time for you to leave
nuclear energy but I was speechless but
it was apparent to me that my style my
attitude and my perception of future
were no longer in tune with the powers
within the AEC and I think this was a
very sad moment in the history of our
country and probably in the history of
the world because an entire direction of
potential development was being ended at
that moment by a not well thought-out
comment by congressman Holyfield who was
very powerful Weinberg looked at this
fairly philosophically when he wrote his
autobiography in 1994 he said I look
back on these events I realized that
leaving Oakridge was the best thing that
could have happened to me my views about
nuclear energy were at variance with
those of the AEC congressional
leadership after all it was I who had
called nuclear energy a Faustian bargain
who continued to promote the molten salt
breeder so Weinberg's pursuit of thorium
appears to have had a great deal to do
with why he was fired from his position
at Oakridge and the Atomic Energy
Commission and it's not hard to see when
you stack up the forces that were in
support of the fast breeder and that
effort the money the industrial backing
the confidence they had and here is
Weinberg trying to push something
different why they would attempt to
truncate his work the upshot of that was
in January of 1973 Oakridge was directed
by the Atomic Energy Commission to
terminate the development of the molten
salt reactor April of that year Nixon
went on to reiterate his commitment to
the fast breeder saying it would extract
30 times more energy from uranium than
light water reactors and it was the high
s priority target for nuclear research
and development we weren't the only ones
pursuing the fast breeder reactor in
August 1973 the Phoenix reactor in
France achieved criticality so we had
real competition in this area and I
think it had something to do with the
zeal the United States felt to become
preeminent in this field but then
something else happened in 1973 that was
far more significant the Yom Kippur War
started it led to the OPEC oil embargo
suddenly the United States their supply
of oil was cut back tremendously there
were long lines at gas stations people
were having to alternate days when they
could buy gas people were sometimes not
able to get to work an enormous amount
of economic activity was truncated Nixon
felt great pressure so he announced
project independence which was a plan to
make the United States energy
independent by 1980 this involved
building many fast breeder reactors many
conventional reactors new oil drilling
new refineries new coal mines all kinds
of things to make the United States
independent in energy supply he promoted
these in talks before Congress but then
in March of 1974 the oil embargo ended
and pressure reduced to implement
project independence something else
happened that was very significant in
1974 India detonated a nuclear weapon
that had been built from plutonium
separated from natural uranium in a
heavy water reactor this was a very
significant event in the history of how
the United States approached nuclear
power because they became quite fearful
the plutonium that could be separated
from uranium in reprocessing facilities
would be able to be used in a nuclear
weapon and there are many arguments why
that is not feasible in conventional
light water nuclear reactors but there
are also other arguments and how changes
in how you would put fuel through a
reactor could lead to so-called
weapons-grade plutonium rather than what
we call reactor-grade plutonium which is
not suitable for nuclear weapons the
entire fast breeder program was
partially built on the assumption that
separated plutonium would be available
from the light water reactors that we
had already built if we were able to
take that plutonium out we would be able
to start
these fast breeder reactors because they
required significantly more nuclear fuel
to turn them on than a light water
reactor did and that had to do with
those relative cross sections I showed
how big the plutonium cross section was
in the thermal reactor versus how small
it was in the fast reactor that's why it
takes so much more fuel to start a fast
breeder reactor for the same electrical
power rating than a thermal reactor
Nixon resigned in 1974 and Gerald Ford
became the president he put some changes
in place for the Atomic Energy
Commission splitting it into two new
divisions the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the energy research and
development administration which would
go on to become the do-e the Joint
Congressional Committee on atomic energy
led by Chet Holifield
was abolished the balance of power was
changed when Ford came in in 1974 and
made these changes to the AEC and to the
congressional committee but Ford still
supported the fast breeder reactor he
mentioned it in several of his speeches
including in the State of the Union
address he increased funding for R&amp;amp;D for
the fast breeder reactor and he
highlighted how the fast breeder reactor
could be used to extend uranium
resources for centuries as the 1976
election approached though it was very
close between Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford Jimmy Carter wanted uranium
reprocessing to be abolished he did not
want it to take place only about a week
before the election on October 28 1976
Ford took Carters position he said we
are not going to reprocess uranium any
more we're not going to separate
plutonium and he highlighted the risk of
proliferation as one of the main reasons
why he was making this decision but it's
almost certain that pressure from Carter
and an attempt to improve his potential
to win the 1976 election had to have
something to do with it at that time the
proposal was to build another fast
breeder reactor this time in Tennessee
very close to Oak Ridge on the Clinch
River so this was the proposal that was
before the nation as Jimmy Carter became
the president in 1977 and Carter was not
a supporter of this fast breeder reactor
he considered that the fast breeder
reactor
it's concentration had had something to
do with the lack of technology
development in solar energy he blamed
the focus that had been on the fast
breeder reactor he called our society a
plutonium society that would use the
fast breeder reactor in April he
reiterated Ford's ban on reprocessing so
not too much of a surprise Ford had
basically assumed Carter's position
Carter says yes we will continue that as
national policy he also called for a
cutback in funding for the Clinch River
breeder reactor however he announced a
new energy plan focused on petroleum and
more on coal he said there's no need to
enter the plutonium age by licensing or
building a fast breeder reactor such as
the proposed demonstration plant at
Clinch River and again he blamed the
emphasis on the breeder reactor for slow
progress made in the progress of solar
power surprisingly Carter knew a thing
or two about thorium and the reason he
did is because at this time Admiral
rickover
was working with his naval reactors
branch to load a thorium dioxide uranium
233 dioxide core into the Shippingport
reactor Carter was able to turn the
switch that turned the first and only
thorium breeder reactor in US history on
several times he mentioned how we wanted
to try other approaches to breeder
reactors than plutonium specifically
light-water breeder reactors using
uranium but then a meltdown happened at
Three Mile Island public confidence in
nuclear energy and particularly the
light water reactor really went down
even after Ronald Reagan was elected and
lifted the ban on commercial
reprocessing no reprocessing plants were
built in 1982 the Shippingport reactor
which had been running for five years at
this point on a thorium uranium 233 core
was shut down and when they examined the
fuel they found that there was one
percent more fuel in the reactor than
there was when they started this proved
finally a thorium breeder reactor was
possible in a thermal spectrum it had
actually been done
it wasn't a thorium molten salt reactor
but it was a true thorium breeder
reactor another consequence of the
decision not to reprocess nuclear fuel
meant that we had to have a new strategy
for the long term disposal of plutonium
preview
it had been assumed that plutonium from
light water reactors would be sent to
fast breeder reactors but without that
we need to know what to do and so
President Reagan signed into law the
nuclear waste Policy Act which continues
to be the law of the land to this day
and led to things like the Yucca
Mountain repository the funding that
went into the fast breeder reactor
surprisingly Pete even after the United
States had made a decision not to
continue with reprocessing and even
under the Carter years from 1976 to 1980
you can see funding levels for the fast
breeder were very high so this was a
reactor type that dominated the
long-range planning of the United States
for many many years the Atomic Energy
Commission saw plutonium as a sure bet
in the fast breeder it could cross the
threshold of - there wasn't uncertainty
there there was a degree of uncertainty
with thorium they invested early and
heavily in the fast breeder reactor
despite failures and meltdowns
an industry got involved with hundreds
of millions of dollars of investment in
1971 Nixon made this the u.s. strategy
how we were going to go forward was
going to be based around the fast
breeder and surely thereafter Weinberg
was fired and the molten salt reactor
program was cancelled before it
cancelled the fuel processing program
and Carter extended that ban without
fuel reprocessing the fast breeder was
not a viable candidate anymore and
nobody as far as we know in DC ever
revisited the question it was it a
mistake to cancel the molten salt
reactor effort should we have gone back
and said you know now that we're not
going to do the fast breeder maybe we
should have done the molten salt breeder
reactor in all of my studies I have not
been able to find any indication that
that ever took place that there was a
true revisiting of that decision to shut
down and a rethinking the team that
worked on this at Oak Ridge disbanded
and dispersed and over the decades that
followed the knowledge was slowly
forgotten so now here we are in 2011
asking why is now the right time for the
liquid fluoride thorium reactor which is
the modern form of the thorium molten
salt reactor originally proposed we know
that we need much more energy at much
lower prices and we have to do this with
a much lower impact on the Earth's
environment we know that we're facing
severe chain
challenges from global climate change
melting of glaciers rising sea levels
changing weather patterns we need to
reduce the amount of carbon dioxide
we're putting into the atmosphere
dramatically there's tremendous
uncertainty amongst the public about
nuclear power because of the events at
Fukushima Daiichi even though no one was
killed there the coverage and the tone
that it took has made people question
the safety of nuclear power primarily
the light water reactor to be able to
have a different technology that doesn't
have some of the risks of operating
high-pressure fluids and and and
reactors that have the capability to
have meltdowns is significant our
alternatives in the form of fossil fuel
caused tremendous environmental
degradation not just in mining and
processing but also to our atmosphere
transporting these fuels it's not cheap
to build electrical power transmission
lines either so even if we wanted to
build renewable energy sources dispersed
in a wide variety of places they would
face challenges in order to get
transmission lines built from here to
there to give you an idea of just some
of the things we do in our high-tech
online society today this is a picture
of a data center for Facebook that has
been built just a hundred miles south of
the Arctic Circle in Sweden it consumes
a hundred and twenty megawatts of
hydropower has 14 backup diesel
generators to provide 40 megawatts of
emergency power it costs 760 million
dollars this is one of the largest solar
installations in the world
it's sited on a hundred eighty-five
hectares of land it provides 20
megawatts of peak energy for 15 hours a
day at 420 million dollars or about $33
a watt that's six to seven times what it
costs to put other power transmission
and so this is in Spain and the data
center is in Sweden so here is an
example of a customer that has a dense
power demand it wants continuous power
no interruptions and it's in frozen
Sweden and here is a diffuse power
supply in Spain so to run this building
off those solar power systems we'll need
at least six but we need more because
these plants can only provide power for
fifteen hours a day so we'll need
probably ten or more of these sites to
run
these data centers plus we'll need
intercontinental transmission lines to
get power from a place like Spain that's
nice and sunny to a place like Sweden
it's frozen is this what's going to
happen probably not probably what will
happen is something more like this where
a dense power supply in the form of coal
this is the prettiest coal plant I've
ever seen in my life this is in Germany
but it provides 1600 megawatts of
continuous power by burning lignite coal
look at that we could run 13 of those
data centers with one of these coal
plants sounds great right well unless
you're the environment if we try to use
expensive intermittent and alternative
energy that's not going to be the answer
most populations most people on earth
can't afford unsubsidized alternative
energy it's just too expensive what
they'll go towards is cheap reliable
dirty energy that's not a viable answer
for the world either but it's the one
will be taken because most people don't
have alternatives we believe natural
inexpensive and abundant thorium is the
answer this is the material that is
dense enough and reliable enough to
provide the energy that the world needs
but the machine to make it work is the
key
why molten salt because molten salt is
the only one of the four potential
coolants in a reactor that can run at
both high temperature and low pressure
it also has a remarkable feature because
of the properties of molten salt in the
event of emergency the fuel can be
drained into a passively safe passively
cooled configuration this is something
that you can't do with a solid fueled
reactor finally the advantages of the
molten salt reactor are significant
inherent passive safety through having
fluid fuel and operating at low pressure
you can operate at high temperature
which means you can get high
thermodynamic efficiencies your fuel
preparation costs are very low and
there's no fuel fabrication costs
fluorides also trying to be an excellent
chemistry match with uranium thorium
fuel cycle they're chemically stable and
they're impervious to radiation damage
that enables us to achieve unlimited
fuel burn up and continuous recycling of
the material from core to blanket the
rhenium 233 is highly unsuitable for
weapons diversion because of
contamination with uranium 232 and it's
easy to down blend it in number
see now we do have challenges these
salts can be aggressive towards most
metals and structural materials it
requires special materials to avoid
being corroded by the salt high
temperature operation is also both a
blessing and a challenge but I think the
fact that the technology base has
largely stagnated for 40 years is our
single greatest challenge towards going
forward and also the unknown nature of
this within the nuclear community it's
very different than what we do today
with water-cooled uranium-fueled
reactors they are the basis for today's
regulatory environment and so there will
be a great deal of Education needed for
this technology to go forward but I
think it has great potential because of
these attributes and five energy aspires
to be the world leader in the design
development and manufacture of these
liquid fluoride thorium reactors thank
