with google.org a colleague of mine sent
me an article called ecosystems in the
age of Cassandra that was on science
progress and it was a fantastic article
I knew as soon as I read it that I
wanted to get in touch with its author
who we have here today cristin maher
haver is a Caribbean coral biologist at
UC Merced and she's here to talk about
basically what sort of I guess following
on to what she wrote about in that
article which is how to make scientific
information organization relevant to
policy and to the public so sort of
moving beyond the way that things are
done today so it is a distinct pleasure
of mine to introduce Kristen to talk
with you today thanks very much for
being here I know there are so many
distractions it seems amazing that you
guys can avoid the coffee maker and end
up over here next to my powerpoint
slides instead never mind and thank you
also to Adam because nobody who
organizes a seminar I think ever gets
enough gracious praise for jumping
through all the hoops and doing all the
logistics so I really appreciate your
help and in hosting me here so the title
of my talk is kind of hysterical on
purpose because one of the take-home
conclusions of this talk is that
scientists don't really get many chances
to tell the public what's going on in
the world and so when we get our chance
every few years we yell hysterically
because someone's about to cover a mouse
and send us back into the lab the next
day I'm going to move my bag can
everybody hear me okay all right
otherwise it's going to get kicked so my
name is kristin mar haver i'm a coral
biologist in the caribbean and I
currently work at UC Merced just inland
from here a few hours and I do my
research in the Caribbean on the island
of Curacao at Karma be foundation
research station but I finished my PhD
just last year at the Center for marine
biodiversity and conservation in san
diego at scripps institution of
oceanography and while none of these
groups necessarily endorse anything I'm
saying
you're the people at Scripps were very
important in helping these ideas take
shape and encouraging me to go out into
the world and start yelling about them
so they get credit I guess for anything
intelligent you guys have a really cool
workplace and I'm sure you're used to
people telling you that but mine is
pretty cool too this is where I were
just want you guys to know I I study
this coral right here that takes up most
of the screen it's one of the longest
live and it's one of the most abundant
corals in the Caribbean and I try to
figure out how a baby coral decides
where to live given that it has to spend
500 years sitting in that same location
and they start out the size of a poppy
seed so they start out looking like this
and they somehow manage to withstand
everything that the ocean has thrown at
them and everything humans have done to
be the size of a car so I was actually
working in the Caribbean when I wrote
this article for science progress and
that's how I ended up here today so it's
this idea of the age of Cassandra
scientists are making warnings that the
public's not listening to and then that
things are happening when we could have
prevented them and when I was I was in
what somewhere in the tropics and I got
an email from Adam and maybe some of you
guys know that being emailed by Google
feels like a hand has come out of the
sky and tapped you on the shoulder and
so I asked my friends like how did they
find me and he said well they're Google
they know everything and I didn't think
that was a good answer i said well what
did they google for that where i showed
up and so i went back to the article and
i tried to figure out what it was and I
realized that I'd written this sentence
this may be the age of Cassandra but
it's also the age of Google so I think
you guys go yourselves and that's how
that's how you came up with me very
creative now I know how it works around
here so the talk i'm going to give us
sort of loosely structured on what i
wrote about but it's a little bit more
targeted toward you guys as Googlers
thinking about organizing information
and thinking about helping the world be
a better place so take home conclusion
is as follows there's a problem with the
way that we're organizing scientific
information i think it's because
scientists tricks themselves and
everyone else in
thinking that things like date and
author and citation number were
sufficient enough to find our way
through the literature and that didn't
used to be such a big problem but the
more scientists learn about things going
wrong in the world the more urgent it
becomes that we have better ways to find
our way through this information so
you'll see we talk about not only how
scientists sort the literature but also
how policymakers get to it how the
public like my tattoo it there's so many
different levels of confusion and I'm
going to try to present a vision where
we can get everybody that our access to
science I'm certainly not saying that as
soon as we organize this better the
world is saved so there's lots of nuance
and complication to figure out too so
this is the agenda for this talk I'm
going to talk about fishing then I'm
going to talk about how science is not
the news beer and makeup because those
are interesting to most people the most
boring parts of the internet i'm here to
tell you what they are and the
information age so starting out with
fishing as you can imagine being a grad
student in conservation biology in the
2000s means that you're exposed to story
after story about how the world's oceans
are doing and i'm not going to spend a
lot of time telling you about that but i
want to give you one example of the
kinds of things that were worried about
the kinds of things that make us write
hysterical titles on our talks so a
classmate of mine scripps named lauren
McClenaghan did a study in which she
went to Florida sport fishing charter
boats and found all of their pictures
from recent years and all their pictures
back through the 60s and the 50s and she
used those photographs to measure and
track how sport fishing catches have
changed through time a two-by-four has
not changed sighs and 50 years and the
average human hasn't changed much and
some of these fishing charters actually
still exist in the exact same place that
they did 50 years ago so she did a
really quantitative study of not only
which fish species we were catching
through time but also how big they were
the amazing and sort of useful thing
about her study is that there's pictures
that come with it so this is what you
would catch if you went sport fishing in
Florida in the last couple of years
and here's what you would catch if you
went sport fishing with the Greyhound in
1958 so that's what humans did to the
ocean their groupers and sharks they're
mostly Goliath groupers which are now
endangered actually people are
considering releasing the protection on
the Goliath Grouper because they
recovered eighteen percent from their
level in say 1994 but if you realize
that that's where we started and then we
went down to almost nothing and we came
up eighteen percent that's not really
the most spectacular of population
recovery so it's currently illegal to
take those out of the ocean so this is
the kind of thing that scientists have
hanging over their shoulders marine
biologists are thinking about this all
the time and saying we need to do
something about this it's not an
abstract we love earth for her resources
kind of thing it's we're running out of
fish almost down to the last fish um and
this this is a story that we not only
have to be able to tell each other well
until policymakers we have to get this
story out to the public if you would
like to see another talk in which these
two photographs are followed by more
stories about how the ocean is doing
this is a TED talk that you should spend
time watching this is a talk by jeremy
jackson who is actually a professor of
mine at Scripps oceanography and who is
the PhD advisor for Lauren McClenaghan
whose photographs I just showed you and
the story is not it's not the title is
not complicated or nuanced we wrecked
the oceans now professor Jackson is sort
of the the focus of the anecdote i'm
about to tell because he not only was
the professor who charged our class with
the coming good science communicators he
also said the sentence that got me to
sit down and write for science progress
and that got me involved in this issue
so he he had a class that we all had to
take when we showed up in grad school in
in addition to learning biodiversity and
environmental economics and governance
we also were trained in science
communication
and on one day we had publicists and
press agents and journalists come they
talked about how to get your science
into the news so professor Jackson had
written this paper in 2001's called
historical overfishing and the recent
collapse of coastal ecosystems and what
that paper basically said was that it's
not as bad as the difference you saw in
those two photographs it's much worse
than that because humans have been
degrading the oceans ecosystems for far
longer than we had realized so since the
time of the colonists we had been eating
all of the seals and whales and turtles
and sharks and getting down to the big
grouper was already halfway to nothing
so that's a pretty important piece of
scientific information and professor
Jackson and his his co-authors sort of
launched a media blitz they said let's
write a press release let's send
photographs and interviews and quotes
and video clips and let's send it out to
all these media outlets so that people
will talk about this in the media and so
professor Jackson said this sentence
which which rang through my ears in
which I still remember to this day he
said most scientific articles are only
in the news for one day but we got this
science article from 2001 in the news
for three days some of you how the
reaction I did so here here are those
three days of news I went back and tried
to reconstruct them a science magazine
publishes the article on july twenty
seven two thousand one and then various
news outlets pick it up and report human
plunder of the seas historical fishing
started the problems of the oceans and
two days later it was still interesting
enough that the new york times published
it three day old news in the new york
times and then here's the news coverage
on day four so here's what's still wrong
with the ocean on day four and so when
Professor jackson said that he had he
was describing a real achievement in
science communication getting somebody
to listen to science for three whole
days but i was in a panic i'm sitting
there in the first year of grad school
thinking
how am I ever going to do science fast
enough to make a big enough scene about
what's going wrong and how we should fix
it and that has bothered me for a long
time and I think only recently I've been
able to describe this this problem well
enough to try to figure out how to solve
it so the the question that's been
hanging over me all through grad school
is can we ever do science fast enough
and I think that the answer is we can't
if we continue to treat it like it's a
series of news articles so that brings
us conveniently to the next worth of
talk which is science is not the news no
this is going to be a little bit overly
detailed but I think it's worth
considering what the news is and whether
science fits in that category or not so
features of the news the news produces
itself like nobody has to go out and say
I'm going to make some news happen today
it happens and then we talk about what
just happened and it's created to inform
people but not necessarily to benefit or
to be useful it's just created to tell
people what's going on and it's created
rapidly it doesn't take a long time to
create the news because it's just
happening and that means you can fact
check it quickly to it only takes a day
to fact-check a piece of news that means
you can update it and revise it every
day and that means old news is not that
valuable to us as a society after a
couple of days we have newer news in the
old news is old news and that means that
we sort it mostly based on when it was
published and then where it was
published and who published it so what
I'm going to try to convince you of is
that science does not fit in these
categories and it's not the news it's
actually a product so consider your
favorite product don't think about
science think about sneakers or
pharmaceuticals or software or some sort
of invention some sort of product that
people make products are produced to
serve a need to fill a purpose to fill a
role of some sort they don't just come
into being on accident on any given day
and they're created to benefit people
they're not just created to inform
typically they're created to serve a
purpose
and they're created with lengthy forms
of quality control with error checking
with stress testing with drug trials
with durability tests and that means you
can't make a new product every day or
revise it every day but that's okay
because old products are still useful
and we let them stick around in society
and we keep making them for as long as
we think that those are good products so
that means when we want to go buy
something we want to go find something
useful we don't search for it based on
when it came out we searched for it
based on whether it does its job whether
it's a good product at doing its job so
think about all of these two categories
and think about which column a piece of
scientific information should fall into
I think it falls into every category of
every it has every feature of a product
except the fact that we currently
organize it based on when it was made
and where who did it so so this I think
is the problem we're having with science
communication we're treating science
like it's a flood of little news bits
but each piece of science took an
immense amount of work to create and it
was made to benefit people for a long
time but journalists and news cycles are
bored with what we have to say after
just one day so how do we search for
good products well this is this is the
part of the talk where I tell you about
beer and makeup um the reason i sat down
to finally write for science progress is
I got really aggravated one week when I
bought new tires for my car and I bought
new mascara and I went to a new
restaurant and all of those were really
easy decisions to make and I could
confidently find the best in each
category with about 15 seconds of
clicking through consumer reports or
Amazon or Yelp and that's because
everything that we organize in society
nowadays is based on user rankings based
on how good stuff is so if you want to
go find the best beer in San Francisco
you ask Yelp and then they tell you to
go drink some anchor steam that anchor
steam is what 300 years old every other
beer that's been invented in the
meantime we don't think is as good as
anchor steam in San Francisco and that's
fine because anger
the best it's the most useful we like it
the most and the users of yelp told us
so so you have a pretty good chance of
having a good experience if you go drink
a pint of anchor steam this is also
really efficient so this is the wisdom
of crowds it's other people telling you
what's good and it's easy to get through
there's also the idea that that good
products can stay useful for a long time
so I'm I hope that everybody at Google
who's interested in searches or the
wisdom of crowd or just what people do
in their free time that can benefit
others knows about makeup ahly com this
is an absolutely fascinating website
there are thousands of people on makeup
alley at any given time and their rating
beauty products and they're swapping
their beauty products in this sort of
like underground beauty product market
place and there they have there's like
people in chat rooms providing on the
spot Beauty disaster remediation advice
it's absolutely fascinating and so now I
don't buy anything unless I go ask the
tens of thousands of makeup Ali people
what they think so you can go to make up
Ali and find a specific product or you
can go ask what's the best beauty
treatment there has ever been and the
most fascinating thing about this is
that if you ask makeupalley that you get
that some of the best beauty treatments
are honey which is what you see here
along with oatmeal and aspirin and lemon
juice and olive oil the Cleopatra took
honey and milk baths and the wisdom of
the crowd and the Internet age tells us
that that was a smart move everybody
thinks honey is a great beauty product
so the the ridiculousness of this is
trying to convey the point that if
something is good and it does its job
and it's useful we let users rank those
things and we keep those things above
the rest of the list where everybody
else can use them too so that means that
shopping for a product is efficient and
easy in this world even if you know
nothing about the product on the other
hand if you try to go shopping for good
science is really difficult even if
you're a scientist so this is the part
of the talk where I tell you about the
most for
parts of the internet and I'm sorry to
google scholar that one of them is going
to be a google scholar page but I really
do love scholar and how it culls PDFs
from I don't know where it's amazing but
there's one useful point to make their
I'm going to stop waving my tea around
quite as much so compared to the way
it's easy to shop for everything else
I'm going to show you a little bit about
how scientists try to shop their way
through science the paper that Lauren
wrote with those photographs of the fish
changing through time lives here now
other places in the internet but it
lives in web of knowledge with a little
title and a couple buttons and there's
no there's no marking there that tells
you like this is really important and
fascinating and useful for people that
are trying to save fisheries so as
anyone ever going to find this and then
make a good policy decision or write to
their congressperson and then if you
find that can you even get to the
article so almost all science is locked
behind a subscription wall of some sort
and you can only get past it if you have
the sort of super powerful rich academic
library buying access where you shell
out fifteen dollars an article or you
call your friends who are in a school
and you get their password and you
promise not to read their email and
weird stuff like that if you search on
PubMed it comes back with the most
recent science first so pubmed has
defaulted to new science must be the
best and in this case actually the first
the first paper is one from my
classmates at scripps and it's really
fascinating because they showed a
tremendous recovery of fish stocks in a
very short time by just protecting them
and leaving them alone and having the
public engaged in protecting those
resources so in this case pubmed
actually does a good job of bringing a
pretty great piece of science up first
but it's because it was the most recent
thing doesn't actually have anything to
do with what the science says then
there's the case that sometimes you
search for literature and you get
something that has a tremendous number
of scientific citations so that's the
way the scientists sensibly rank each
other's quality but it
a really weird metric to use to try to
talk about quality of publications it's
basically the way that we salute each
other in the literature but it takes a
while for that to happen because your
paper has to be seen and then cited and
then that paper needs to make it through
peer review so it takes a while before
you'll even have a sense of how many
citations you're going to get and it
ends up being almost well a citation can
mean a lot of different things to it can
mean this was amazing and it inspired me
it can mean this was crap and i'm about
to refute it it can mean here's some
stuff I found hidden sin my introduction
and I can't wait to get on to the
results or it can mean this was the
first person who coined this phrase and
so now I have to give them credit for
the phrase so when you see a paper with
4000 citations what that means is that
Joe Connell is very famous and he wrote
that paper a long time ago and inspired
a lot of basic science but it actually
is more about tropical forest than is
about coral reefs and it doesn't tell us
anything about coral reefs now so
scientists only real official metric of
quality is not a very useful quality
metric and then sometimes you're
searching for science and you get a
thousand hits back and you don't have
any other way to navigate through past
that so if we look for coral reefs and
we get 1043 papers then what you can
keep typing keywords in there but what
if you just want the best information on
coral reefs there's no other narrowing
capability it's just a list of journal
article titles and so we can take this
to the almost absurd extreme and I can
show you that I don't even know which of
my own pieces of science is the best if
I go to Google Scholar and put myself in
I get papers in the order reverse order
that I wrote them because the older
papers have more citations than the
newer ones so as a young scientist time
is not really an informative metric of
whether one piece of literature was
better or not but that's the only way we
have to sort it and then if you go not
too far down you find somebody
acknowledging me for um scrubbing
underwater cages and catching fish and
drinking beer at sharkys pub in Key
Largo
which is a highly rated pub on yelp com
so the only information we have now is
where to drink in Key Largo but not
actually whether this was a more
important contribution to science than
the stuff that appears near it so this
is a silly version of a real problem
scientists have a hard time even finding
their way through their own literature
each other's literature their own fields
and so imagine how hard it is for
anybody else to dig through this stuff
so if I can't figure out which one of my
own papers is the best what about
science writers who are trying to
communicate this stuff to the public and
the policymakers and their aides that
certainly don't have time to become
experts in a field but want to use this
information to make a difference and
then there's interns and NGOs who show
up and they know nothing except they
want to save the world where do they
start how do they find their way through
then there's people who are looking for
medical literature doctors and
therapists that want to make the best
diagnosis and prescribe the best
treatments and they're actually buried
in a lot of literature and locked out
from a lot of it too there's school
teachers who would love to teach the
most official the most pure form of the
facts that they can and they can't get
access to this and their science-fair
nerds who would love to dig through the
scientific literature then everybody has
some friend or family member who's got
some decision-making power somewhere out
in the world and maybe they want to be
able to use science to make good
decisions marine park managers on little
islands don't have very much money and
they're isolated from everyone else and
they would love to make better decisions
based on what is a good way to conserve
marine resources and they actually have
a tremendously difficult time getting
into the literature and figuring out
what it means and then finally barack
obama if he's going to make some good
decisions about ocean ecosystems it
would be great if he could also dig into
this literature and find as quickly as i
found anchor steam on yelp com some good
prescriptions for helping the ocean and
the earth so here are all these people
who would love to get at basic science
get at the
the raw data the literature in the
scientists word or something very close
to it and almost none of them can find
their way so this isn't really just me
complaining about the organization of
scientific literature because scientists
seem to be doing well enough on their
own I'm starting to worry that this sort
of problem is becoming more and more
dangerous for us as a society so what
used to be just the quirks of old-time
academia we did our thing hidden in the
ivory tower and we chatter amongst
ourselves and we didn't bother talking
to the common folk it's now starting to
be a threat because we're running out of
time to make good decisions and to get
information into the right people's
hands and this is happening at many
different levels so the dangers of being
disorganized when it comes to science
first of all I showed you how scientists
are pretty swamped by even their own
field of expertise we have a hard time
jumping out of exactly what we know very
well in finding the right good
literature I want to sort of branch into
terrestrial ecology a certain quark of
terrestrial ecology it takes me hours to
figure out who wrote the best piece
what's most authoritative then if you
make this literature hard to navigate it
makes it easy for people to just come in
and cast doubt where there should be
none so there's actually a sort of a
whole industry of people who like to
just glaze good scientific information
with a layer of doubt in order to stall
decisions from being made this actually
happened with the link between smoking
and lung cancer quite famously and
there's a great book about it called
merchants of doubt by Naomi Oreskes and
Eric Conn way in which they describe
exactly the how these people went about
adding doubt to science where there
deserve to be none that's pretty
dangerous then because we have a hard
time telling what is the best science
it's easier to make fake controversies
with in science and journalists love to
talk about human drama so that's what
they end up focusing on when I talk
about science so where you might have a
urged scientific consensus and one
dissenter a journalist will see that as
controversy and report both sides of it
equally equally with equal weight I
actually remember reading the New York
Times article about the Large Hadron
Collider and I had no idea at the end of
I should be worried about black holes
because that concern was presented with
equal weight to the physicist who said
this is going to be fine and I got
really mad thinking great now now this
could happen to me on my way to work too
so so scientists who have a consensus
should not be undermined by the sort of
single person who wants to create a
scene who has an agenda there's always
the case of the one scientist who was
right when everyone else is wrong
Einstein was right but we can't let
Feinstein as an example rule our way of
thinking to a point where we ignore
scientific consensus when it's important
and it's there what happens when all of
this squabbling is going on is that the
public just Tunes out because we report
different things every week in the
literature this happens a lot with
health research does it help your
cholesterol does it not is it good to
stretch before running is it not and
people just tune out they can't figure
out what we're talking about and it just
looks like a little steady stream of
random bits of information so that's not
useful to the public and then if you're
a decision maker who needs to make
difficult decisions that are going to
cost a lot of money and piss a lot of
people off it's way easier not to make
those decisions when you can't get
access to the raw information driving
those decisions and neither can your pop
and neither can your constituents so in
the case of ocean policy and
conservation we're just kicking cans
down the road because nobody's really
able to show why we should stop and make
a tough decision this is getting
depressing peoples peoples faces are
sinking but I promise I'll make it
funnier in a second the conclusion to
all of this is that we're wasting time
we're starting conversations over again
we're squabbling about stupid little
stuff we're talking amongst our
selves when we should be talking at the
public at policymakers so we're wasting
time and this is a weird irony of the
whole situation it's the information age
and yet scientific information the kind
of information that we inferi think is
the most valuable has somehow not kept
up with the tools of the information age
that to me is so weird I keep having to
stop and think is this really true is
this really a problem but almost
everyone I talk to about this in
academia sort of has their own version
of this this frustration that they want
to express so i think that the
information age could better serve
scientific information so that brings us
to is this this information age
everything that we are surrounded by
nowadays comes along with phrases like
these almost everything we do involves
user rankings culling preferences from
your search patterns and from your
tastes makeupalley would you repurchase
this item there's there's a button nixed
almost everything in our world where you
can click it and say how you feel about
it and so this is the information age
and as I said before us the age of
Google it's also the age of the remix I
actually think that was like 2005 hip
hop but scientists work in long awkward
blocks of time like that so 2005 wasn't
that long ago so why not do all of these
things with scientific information that
might sound absurd but I'm going to
present a way that we could maybe make
it work and I apologize for my cutting
and cutting and pasting is the only
skill I have besides being a scientist
so what if we gave scientists a way to
rank the literature right in their faces
as they're using it in their daily
scientific lives science is objective
it's objectively created information but
it can still be better or worse it can
be better executed it can be better
funded it can be more thorough it can be
based on a false assumption it can be
wrong
so scientists can rank this stuff and it
doesn't take that many user ratings to
come up with a consensus that tends to
be pretty accurate reflection of what
whether something is good or not and you
could give this to scientists right
alongside the stuff that they're already
using like citation data citation
organizing software and PDF accumulating
software and dishwashers because
scientists are too busy to wash their
own dishes why not do this for scientist
put this in their faces and let them
rank it and then that is how you can at
least allow scientists to find their way
through this stuff one of the things in
my PhD advisor would really love to see
is this little piece at the top here we
have recommendations for you again it's
easier to shop on amazon that is to shop
for science but what if this sort of
platform took what you're interested in
science and found things distantly
related that fit in in some way because
of some underlying theory or some basics
essence of that piece of literature
instead of some ecologist tromping
through the theoretical literature in
physics you could tell them exactly
which things might fit in with what they
already know you could spur a lot of
cross-cutting interdisciplinary research
by exposing scientists the best stuff in
each other's fields if we knew what it
was you could even do this inside the
peer review system if you really wanted
to scientists already ranked each
other's quality we just do it in these
hidden parts of peer review under the
anonymous curtain of a peer review but
you could have a process in which you
said this is really important for policy
this is the best one that they've done
so far this is grab and and embed that
with the literature so there's no reason
we couldn't do this for scientific
information it's just that scientists
themselves have never really asked for
these tools because they they failed to
realize that this is the way that we
need to organize it they're still sort
of wondering why this public isn't
listening but they don't understand that
there's no way to listen so at the same
time why don't we give other people as
much access as they can to this stuff
along
a bunch of tools to understand it yep
the cutting and pasting continues so
what if we put scientific literature
right alongside photographs and the raw
data and information about who the
authors are so you can figure out
whether they're experts or not what if
we add the media coverage and the blog
posts and the radio interviews right now
we have these things in two different
parts of the internet and so if you want
to learn about science you sometimes
can't even figure out from a piece of
news coverage which article they're
talking about why not but doesn't same
place and you can dig in as deeply as
you want or stay as shallow as you want
but the whole story is presented what
does the other thing that I wanted to
say here oh and you could put a raw data
in there you can you can put a lot of
data and let people see for themselves
we particularly photographs like
Lauren's is a tremendously appealing
sent form of raw data but put under
water put the photographs of the bottom
of the ocean with the graphs put a big
heap of data let people sort through it
themselves a friend of mine wants to
have like a Google a virtual google of
the ocean floor just wants to be able to
swim around in the ocean see all of the
corals and then see them change through
time so if you had a picture of the
ocean from five different reefs and
you're trying to make the argument like
this protection is working better than
this protection put a picture of the
ocean floor and put a picture of the
water column and let people see for
themselves more and more science is
based on photographs and visual
information as we get better ways of
doing imaging and gathering visual data
so that makes the perfect sort of
material to just give people to see for
themselves and then of course you need a
way to +1 it I don't even know if that's
the verb plus one it you guys have to
tell me that need a way to plus it add
add it I don't know so here's something
a little bit more controversial what if
you put the policy implications right
alongside of the literature we tend to
wait a long time for pieces of science
to be summarized into consensus
documents like this one here is from the
National Academy of Sciences
is talking about how fishing has changed
ecosystems if we know what's wrong and
what to do about it I don't see why we
shouldn't put those things near each
other it used to be very uncool for
scientists to step out into the world
and say what might be done but I think
scientists of my generation are much
more comfortable with saying I can do
objective science and I can make a
recommendation about what should be done
to me that's as easy as I can accurately
read a thermometer and I can also make a
slightly biased recommendation about
whether the air conditioner should be
turned on but if I can explain my
reasoning there's no reason that you
should expect that that has influenced
my ability to read the thermometer and
then finally I I would really love to
know which sunscreen is number one among
Caribbean coral biologists so you could
you could add all sorts of money related
features into a platform like this you
could sell me sunscreen and I would
probably buy a lot of it if I knew it
was the right one this is a little bit
campy but the idea is a sort of
important because so much science is
locked behind a subscription wall if you
could pay to get it into the public
arena in many different ways more people
could get at it and if you could pay for
it by me clicking on sunscreen ads all
better you could also imagine ways of
giving funding agencies credit or
declaring what the restrictions of the
funding agencies were you could sort of
award funding agencies who made that
research publicly available give them
little props out in internet space you
could even link in ways to add to
fundraise more so you could say this was
supported by national geographic and if
you want to give them more money here's
how to do it linking the people who want
to get at this information to the
information itself could happen in a lot
of different ways and you'd also have to
find some sort of user interface
designer because this is not going to
really work so well there's so much
plagiarism on this page but I hopefully
sorry internet
it's fair use that's a it's a remix
that's who it's a there's no one piece
that I've played too heavily okay so is
this totally naive is this something
just excessively optimistic that I would
I want because I'm a child of the
Internet age and I want everything to be
easy and clickable well I think there's
some sign that this might not be
completely absurd and that's because I
stole one of those squares from
alongside the scientific journal of the
public library of science or PLoS so
there they are there are the star
rankings right alongside an article from
my PhD advisor and professor jeremy
jackson and quite a number of my
classmates so the weird thing about
these star ratings is that nobody seems
to ever use them on PLoS which is
interesting I think it's because it's
not anonymous and because no scientists
realized the value of doing something
like this yet so it feels sort of like
we what do you want me to you need to
click some stars but the fact that it's
here right alongside a scientific
journal is at least a signal that this
is an okay thing to do to science and I
should I should stop and actually
acknowledge what public library of
science is doing for for scientific
communication because they're making a
lot of different tools that are helping
push the raw science and an
interpretation of that science out into
the public arena so they make all of
their articles open access they have a
space for comments they have a journal
club where different experts get
together and talk about different pieces
of literature they even have public
summaries that they ask their authors to
write write 200 words and that's going
to come alongside your primary
literature so that more people will be
able to understand what it means so
they're doing a really great job it's
just that every other scientific journal
in the world is not doing this and
doesn't even really have a sense that
this is where we should be going so to
tie all of these random
topics together in one or two sentences
fishing and a lot of other human
activities have been racking the ocean
and nobody's paying attention to
scientists when I talk about it in the
news but that's because science is not
the news science is a product and it's
meant to be sorted and ranked the same
way that we sort other useful things
like beer and makeup but instead we're
leaving science sort of hidden in dusty
corners of the Internet in the most
boring places in the internet where
nobody really wants to go what we should
be doing instead is using the power of
the information age to put this
information out where people can get
access to it so that we can start fixing
things like overfishing keep this earth
working for everyone who's coming down
the line after us so one last thought
about the ocean and it will hash it out
it used to be that humans could be scale
bars in pictures of marine organisms and
I I actually was lucky enough to get to
be a scale bar of my own not too long
ago this is one of the corals I study
and I think even that is hard to get a
sense of this coral is bigger than me
with fins it's the size of a VW Bug and
it's 500 years old and I realized when I
when I found this photograph that what I
was doing was setting myself up to be
the before picture in a really
depressing pair of photographs 50 years
from now so what is the photograph going
to be that comes after this one that's
what worries me and that's why I care
about this issue and that's why
scientists are struggling to try to
communicate what they know to the public
but having a hard time doing it so when
we're thinking about boring and weird
and vague things like data organization
what we're asking is you know what's
going to be after this photograph what's
the picture in 2016 so um with that I
would like to thank you guys for your
attention and the various people who
helped move these ideas around and make
them more public and I might be happy to
answer questions now
or at lunch or buy your favorite form of
communication Plus Ones phone underwater
hand signs whatever might be so thanks
very much oh I think I think Adams going
to be my question host actually we're
going to we're going to do the
microphone so that everybody else can
hear them hi I really enjoyed your talk
and I love the sentiment I completely
agree with you I'm going to question a
particular assumption you've made which
is that more data more transparency more
availability of data is necessarily a
good thing I want to believe that in my
heart of hearts here's the problem is
that if for example you go to Maine and
look at the lobster catch over the past
20 years it has been going up and up and
up and up is that a good thing the data
would suggest so and the lobstermen
think it's so but there's good reason to
believe that the fishery eggs actually
being dismantled okay so the problem
with a lot of data is it requires some
kind of interpretation and that's what
sites like many eyes and other sites
like you know Fusion Tables allows
people to do is to actually take data
apply some measures to it and so for
example looking at the average history
of temperatures in Houston Texas for the
past couple months it's been you know is
that a signal plus or signal- and so it
what I'm trying to understand is how can
we frame these large data sets in ways
that are helpful rather than more
obscure obscuration 'used right that's a
good question so it is just showing
everybody the raw data going to help are
we just going to have different
squabbling arguments about different
parts of the data that the lobster
issues actually really interesting since
we ate all the cod no fish are eating
the lobsters and so now we have this
huge lobster catch which we shouldn't
have because we should have cod so so
people love to use examples like that to
stall decision-making I think you can
start to worry about
what about this data set that's going to
give people the wrong conclusion it
seems like what we need is for the the
whole conversation to be more open and
more honest so that somebody says will
Kotter lobster catches are going up and
then there's 10 other papers that show
well that's because we ate all the cod
so if we have these conversations
alongside the data and we have them in a
more transparent way I'd like to think
that cherry-picking of data as we like
to call it doesn't gain any sort of
traction it's not easier to tell the
wrong story because we've put more data
out there but it's certainly an issue
that's the floss system actually has a
set of moderators where if people are
just being really hysterical and
ridiculous they say you're not being
you're not acting of the way scientists
and academics should act it's you I
guess what you're bringing up at point
is it's that humans are still human so
we're still going to have our different
incentives and interests and we have to
keep that in mind that's a good question
and it's a good thing to think about I
were thinking about that +1 system it
may result in somewhat unexpected
consequences if it is implemented for
one some people would think they'd hire
themselves they would want to Plus
hundred it instead of +1 and they would
want to discount others so they would
definitely demand some ranking based on
whatever achievements and if they do not
get it they properly would not
participate another consideration about
it is along which access along nice
pictures sure a lot of public will say
that is really great and then you know
that what is the scientific value of the
text in the in the in the surgical
that's another axis and then even
presence of this rating would somehow
here's the science from doing something
that is scientifically worthy right to
something that looks
so what they are thinking about it those
are great points and there are things
that you have to consider when you try
to is what you're hitting on is that
beer is easier to shop for than science
it's just true a lot it's a lot easier
to make a subjective reading about a
glass of beer the it's certainly true
that we would be giving scientists sort
of a new incentive to chase after things
that get high ratings but I think that
that's okay I think scientists need to
be brave enough to say like okay it
didn't get that highly rated but that's
because it was about something that was
not policy relevant or that's cuz I
didn't try that hard or that's because
it was the third version of that that I
had published so there's a in a sense I
think scientists need to sort of swallow
their pride and say like okay let's
really see what's better than not and
there's lots of different ways that you
could there's lots of different axes
that you can rate along you could say
that we just want something to be like
this is urgent for policymaking or you
could make an axis that's reliability
thoroughness I think I'm plus there's
three different stars that you can fill
out and they kind of average them all
you could have it be much more lengthy
than that I guess on Wikipedia they have
four different ratings thorough accurate
etc etc so that's I guess that's for us
to figure out next right what is the
rest way to rate this stuff but I don't
think that the the complications and the
potential side effects are going to be
severe enough that we should avoid it
altogether figure out a way to make it
work good question so unfortunately the
tech talk teams scheduled to like back
to back so it can take maybe one or two
more questions live but then a
crystalline I will be having lunch
somewhere else so feel free to join us
for lunch and I think anuraag will be
joining us as well so ah boys is so hard
as so many okay i'll i'll try to do
quick request or queer answers uh how
big of a problem do you think the
restricted access to like journal
articles is memory on the right track
with that with plots or is that a big
limiting factor too right how how big of
a problem it's a huge
problem my little sister just finished
physical therapy school and then her her
academic subscription ticked off and now
she can't see the best physical therapy
literature it's a problem in so many
different professions Google Scholar is
amazing because it just finds PDFs from
I don't know where and brings them up to
the surface and I love it for that and I
know that that helps a lot of people in
the middle of nowhere do their
conservation jobs and plazas on the
right track by putting everything open
access but that means that the
scientists themselves have to pay three
thousand dollars an article for all of
the costs of publication so then if
you're a poor scientist or you ran out
of funding you have to figure out how to
deal with the financial limitations so
we could definitely find better ways to
fund it so that everything was open
access I think that's the goal
everything one last question i draw
computer sorry so when you're a academic
and you're starting your first job and
you want to get that tenure track
position one of these things you need to
do is to publish and it's not just
published in general you want to hit a
couple of key publications today those
publications generally insist on being
the first to publish and that you don't
you know open access your stuff what do
you see the barriers of being too let's
say a new person trying to establish
himself in the field to let's say
convince their university that what they
ought to do is make the new criteria for
publication to be this internet channel
as opposed to let's say the old school I
actually talked to Professor Jackson
before I gave this talk so the question
is how do we make this the standard the
norm to this idea that ranking is
somehow the way we define quality I I
told professor Jackson I was giving this
talk and he said people love rankings if
I think academic committees would love
another way to sort through the quality
of their scientists and it might just be
that we need a little bit of time for
the the newest generation of scientists
to get there they're footholds because I
think everyone in my generation is okay
with that kind of thing it's just the
old guard might be a little bit more
assistant the the one thing that
scientists are kind of starting to do
along those lines is use the
index which is where you take the number
of papers with a number of citations
they each have and you have to have h
papers with H citations so that's kind
of a measure of bulk and quality of your
research but again corrupted by the what
does a citation mean issue and the
aspect of time but there's signs that we
are we are looking for new ways to
measure each other's quality so it
wouldn't be completely absurd to
introduce a new one good question okay
thanks again Kristen for coming and
challenging us as some of these ideas
engli really important so anyone who'd
like to join us for lunch just come find
us over here thank you thank you guys
