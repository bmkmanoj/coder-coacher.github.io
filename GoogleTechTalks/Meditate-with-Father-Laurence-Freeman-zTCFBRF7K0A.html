first
Google and I asked Meng does anybody
here actually do any work because we
looked around we saw everybody having a
great time eating and exercising and
sleeping areas and playing areas and
everything else so it's actually quite a
good preparation I think for a talk on
meditation and I'll invite you to take a
little time to practice it as well when
we teach children to meditate we always
we've been doing that quite
systematically in our community for some
years now and one of the great things
you discover is the children can
meditate first of all even the more
hyperactive ones can meditate and they
like to meditate they really take to it
and you know limited research we've done
about 30 or 40 percent of the children
will say after a few weeks that they
choose time to meditate on their own
outside of the school the classroom or
other setting so and I think the reason
the children seem to take to meditation
much more simply and intuitively than we
do later in life we take it bit more of
as a we think more as a challenge we've
got to do a discipline we have to master
all and so on is that they are very
close to seeing it as play children
enjoy playing and they they like rules
Jordan like rules if they just start
playing with other kids they will make
up their rules and enforce those rules
with each other and this basic sense of
human justice or fairness at work
probably and but I think when they
meditate they can see it as play a kind
of a sacred play that's our word for it
and I think if we could be a little bit
more playful about life in general and
certainly about meditation we might find
it all a little easier I'm not saying
the children don't find meditation
challenging I think they do the very
first group of children I I
sated with reluctantly because I thought
it was going to be a waste of time
taught me so much about meditation but
they had very few comments and no
questions about him but after a few
weeks I remember one little girl after
the meditation said whoo that was hard
and then on another occasion a little
boy his comment was it was nice and I
think the whole history of meditation
all the literature you read on it and
all the all the great traditions can
really be summed up by those two
comments it's hard and it's nice well
the word meditation is related to the
word medicine and the prefix made a
Greek prefix means care or attention
when you go to see a doctor for example
or you expect to receive good care and
good attention and the combination care
and attention is very important I would
say doctor recently just get some
antibiotics for something and go through
the whole process and did not have a
moment I contact with him it was just a
very routine encounter he and so he I
suppose gave me kind of technical care
but certainly not much personal
attention so care and attention I think
constitute the basis of all human
relationship and if you think of your
personal relationships as well as your
professional relationships it's the
quality quality of attention that you
bring to those relationships as to your
work itself that really constitutes the
quality of the relationship and in a
relationship where you stop paying
attention to each other
you get distracted at a certain point
from the other person the element of
love of course or the element of
attraction the element of caring and
attention you could say care and
attention add up to
begins to diminish and the relationship
changes one way or another or needs to
be renewed or rescued or whatever so I
think that that it points about care and
attention is really essential to
understanding meditation in all the
great religious traditions and it can be
expressed in a wide variety of human
languages and vocabularies and as
reading mains book recently is coming
out shortly and there's a it's a very
contemporary language it's a very
engaging vocabulary for describing what
we're talking about and and I think
today at a unique turning point in human
history a tipping point
really we are rediscovering at a very
auspicious moment the universal
importance and value of meditation I
think teaching it to children which is a
priority of our organization or
community at the moment and as well as
inter-religious dialogue as well as
dialogue with the secular world the
technical and scientific approaches I
think all of this is is timely and we
were talking over lunch about the
financial crisis we're in and my friends
in that field tell me that we were
probably going to have to endure this
time of recession and slow growth for a
good 10 10 years and that 10 years might
be a you know something we see just as a
desert we have to trek through or we can
also see it I think as a unique
opportunity in our cultural evolution
and global evolution to really change
some of the values by which we have been
living and some of the values that got
us into this problem in the first place
so I think meditation is very timely and
very
Universal I was taken part recently in a
conference on Environment 'l scientists
and they asked me to come along just to
give a kind of spiritual perspective on
the largely incomprehensible scientific
presentations and i think what what
struck me was the openness of their
minds and above all their realization
that the the solution to the
environmental problem is by no means
just a technical one a scientific one
the sciences isn't so difficult the real
challenge is going to be a human one
it's going to be changing the approach
the mindset and the insight which
governments and organizations and
business are going to have to work with
in order to bring about a common policy
so I speak as a Christian monk
Benedictine monk and my own tradition
goes back to the teaching of Jesus and
the gospel when I read the Gospels I see
Jesus as a teacher of contemplation he
doesn't give us many rules and
regulations doesn't give us a lot of
dogma or theology as such he's a very
direct teacher of contemplation go into
your inner room he says do not use many
words lay aside your worries and
anxieties be mindful he says be mindful
of the kingdom of God which means the
presence of God and live in the present
moment do not worry about tomorrow
tomorrow will look after itself and in
the context of his whole life and
teaching and the Gospel story I think
it's very clear that Jesus is a teacher
of contemplation and very early in the
in the Christian tradition
as the monastic movement began monastic
tradition is really as old as human
civilization all the great civilizations
have generated some form of monastic
life and as the Christian monastic
movement began in the third and fourth
centuries they developed ways in which
they could put this core teaching of
Jesus into practice and the early
Christian monks were called the Desert
Fathers does it fathers and mothers you
hear more of the fathers and the mothers
but the mothers were there as well and
they taught in apodictic style and in
very in short wisdom sayings and stories
rather like the Zen stories Zen fathers
and masters I've actually done a number
of dialogues with with Zen teachers just
using combinations of desert father
stories Christian monks and and Zen's
tourism very often we end up using the
same story so some shearing hits left
behind over some campfire or over some
unrecorded encounter in the middle of
the desert took place and they told each
other these stories and used them in
different ways so that's the tradition
I'm coming from and it's the it was the
beginning of a long contemplative
mystical tradition within Christianity
and of course this tradition also got
got sidelined particularly in the
Western Church over the centuries it
never got completely lost but certainly
became sidelined and was seen as a sort
of a specialization for certain for
certain people but not something that
certainly not children or so not
ordinary people would be would be
interested in or capable of and that's
actually an attitude that you find in
Buddhism and other other traditions I've
spoken to Buddhist abbot to what they
said the same thing to me that you know
laypeople are not really cut out for
meditation you really ought to be living
in a monastery to meditate seriously so
I think where we're seeing a confluence
of contemplative traditions in our time
a renewal of the contemplative dimension
of faith and this is of great interest
and I do think it's something that could
have been planned it's a sort of an
epiphany
raelia store something that's appearing
it's appearing at the right moment and
it's something that touches people in
every walk of life and people of who
belong to a tradition people who had no
faith tradition that they want to name
or whatever or people who just want to
approach it as a as a as a technique
you're more likely I think today to be
advised to meditate by a your physician
or your psychotherapist then you are by
by a religious or spiritual teacher we
just had a seminar in London on part of
our meditate Co outreach program on
meditation and mental health of course a
great deal of research which mentions in
his forthcoming book shows that
meditation is is good for you both
physically and psychologically it
reduces your cholesterol improves your
blood pressure it helps you deal with
him boosts your immune system it helps
you sleep better at night it helps you
with anxiety or panic attacks early
intervention with meditation helps to
prevent a recurrence of depression
cycles and and so on and so on I own
quite limited contribution to this
scientific research is to prove without
any shadow of a doubt I think that after
30
as meditation does not restore your hair
but in every other respect meditation
works wonders as great things for you so
we can certainly approach meditation
simply on the basis of those benefits
and that may well be enough for you for
for many people and yet I believe and I
think this is an interesting area of
research as well this is where dialogue
comes into the picture I believe that if
you faithfully practice this meditation
even at that level of motivation you
will begin to push the frontiers of
consciousness a little further it will
become a little clearer and rather than
focusing just upon the psychological and
physical benefits which are natural then
you will also become aware of a
spiritual dimension however we might
define that that's where we need
dialogue but the spiritual fruits of
meditation are the spiritual foods
mentioned again almost in the same terms
by many religious traditions in the New
Testament for example st. Paul speaks
about the fruits of the spirit the
harvest of the spirit and it's almost
the same list of qualities that you find
in the Dhammapada great Buddhist texts
st. Paul calls them love joy peace
patience kindness goodness fidelity
gentleness and self-control now at the
end of the day or at the end of your
last day on earth you will be more
concerned about those qualities I think
than your cholesterol you won't be so
you'll be asking about your cholesterol
you'll be saying how much of my life has
actually been an experience of love how
much joy have I
found have I lived with peace at a deep
level and you know and so on and so on
so I think meditation certainly brings
us to explore the but the universe of
our own being we may focus upon one
small aspect of it to begin with but the
more we grow in self-knowledge and
self-acceptance those are basic
psychological premises for the expansion
of consciousness but to know yourself
you've got to accept yourself as you are
and then something happens then you
begin to grow we all want to grow we all
want to move on so I think as that
growth happens as an expansion of
consciousness happens we begin to see
we're actually part of an expanding
universe and that we are as much a
wonder to ourselves the depth of our own
being as the universe is that we gaze
out at through our Hubble telescopes and
radio telescopes so so meditation it
seems to me is very local you can
practice it from a purely technical
point of view with a focus upon the
benefits and the advantages it's also a
communal experience because I think we
learn to meditate through some kind of
network some kind of community all
learning takes place collectively we
learn much better on our own we learn
much better not on our own but by
sharing in the learning experience with
other people my own teacher John Mayne
Benedictine monk who taught me and
helped to recover this Christian
tradition of meditation believed that
meditation creates community and that's
quite a puzzling idea at first you know
you might say yes okay I need other
people to meditate with because that's
going to reinforce my motivation and I'm
going to meditate more regularly which
is a good thing for me if I hang out
with other people or I get get support
from them but the idea that the
meditation actually creates community is
a little different from that and it
introduces us to what we might call the
mystery the mystery or at all because
it's not going to be so it's not so easy
to explain why that happens all I can
say is that it has happened in my
experience and I have two monasteries a
monastery with walls my mother houses in
Italy and but I spend most of my time in
this monastery without walls a community
that has grown up in more than 100
countries now so why that happens is a
very interesting question to be explored
I think so I'd like to share with you
then is is how for example we would
teach meditate how we teach meditation
how we would teach a class of whether
they're six year old or ten year olds or
even 16 year olds how we would teach
them to meditate which is essentially
the same way that we would teach any
group of older people or a group of or
people in a hospice you can learn to
meditate at any stage in your life
perhaps the easiest groups to meditate
to teach to meditate to learn to
meditate would be children respond
immediately to it people in recovery at
a certain stage in the 12-step program
when you hit the eleventh step by prayer
and meditation to raise our conscious
contact with God as you know him
that that's a very responsive group you
don't have to do a lot of persuasion
when they're at the right moment and I
would also add engineers actually quite
honestly I've often thought engineers
engineers and missionaries
very responsive to meditation and I
think one of the may be here at Google
you're both engineers had missionary
engineers you have a you have a message
to proclaim to the world
maybe the reason for that is that both
engineers and missionaries are practical
people and they take a long-term view of
things and then now you've got to lay
foundations and they've got to work and
then you've got to build you've got a
slow process of construction but anyway
this is a teaching that we give it's a
simple teaching and I think the
simplicity of meditation is very much
the key to its universality it works
universally because it is simple and I
could not begin to understand the
technical complexity of how you run this
company if you do run it maybe it's just
a big playground burn away if you do
actually work here that icon I can't
understand the complexity of your of
your science that would be interested
but I don't need to scratch the surface
however I imagine that it's truths in
this field of engineering as in every
other field of life that when you have a
complex problem the best solution turns
out to be the simplest you come closest
to the truth and when you get the best
available solution simply that usually
opens up new ideas it's not the final
answer to all problems but it's it's the
solution to that particular question or
problem and then when you've begun to
implement it you start learning
something else the horizon begins to
expand again that to me is the meaning
of simplicity so simplicity doesn't mean
easy by any means it means a lot of hard
work sometimes too but
shouldn't focus only on the hardness of
the work like the children we should
think of the playfulness of the work as
well it's enjoyable work so the essence
of all meditations I say in the
beginning is really attention careful
attention and the first thing we
discover when we come to meditate is
that our minds are full of cares but
often not occupied in careful attention
we're very distracted preoccupied by our
worries by our fears by our anxieties by
our fantasies by our memories by our
plans for this evening or next day
so the mind at a certain level of
consciousness I think the basic starting
point of meditation is that is that we
are not just that superficial stream of
consciousness that the mind has many
levels and that the deeper you go into
those levels the clearer your
consciousness becomes and that deeper
clarity then begins to reflect upon all
levels of consciousness and in daily
life and I think that's why we meditate
basically so the essence of all
meditation is attention and we need some
simple practice that is going to focus
the attention and there are in different
traditions different methods and rather
than give you an overview of them all
because there's so many of them I'll
just share with you the method that is
most common within our own tradition but
you'll you have any knowledge of
meditation in other traditions you'll
you'll see some many resonances even at
the methodological level many resonances
with other traditions and one of those
early desert monks that I was talking
about was called Casa John Cassian he
was a teacher of Saint Benedict whose
rule
I follow my life and a cassian was
preoccupied living out in the middle of
the desert with not many distractions
but preoccupied with the fact that the
mind was constantly distracted even at
the time of prayer and so he went to one
of his elder gurus and sat at his feet
and said you know I pray a lot and I
tried to do my practice but my mind is
all over the place what can I do to come
to stillness and clarity of mind and the
advice that Abba Isaac gave him was this
you're asking first of all he says you
asking the right question and when
you're asking the right question he says
you are next door to understanding so
the first question the important
question is how do I get through this
this very agitated level of mind which
we call distraction and he said to take
a single verse or word he called it in
Latin a formula we can call it a mantra
or a sacred word prayer word and repeat
this same word continuously in the mind
and heart during the time of the
meditation letting go he said of all the
riches of thought and imagination and
that's that's the nub of it really and
there's the rub letting go of all the
riches of thought and imagination at the
time of the meditation now that's quite
a challenging I think for anyone because
first of all we have the just the volume
of the and the momentum of our
distractions letting go of them isn't as
easy as it sounds but also we have our
attachment to this richness of thought
and imagination you know I've got 20
minutes now
I'm sure I could use this time for some
good ideas for some problem-solving or
for some you know thinking through
issues that I got to resolve so actually
committing yourself to that time which
what he calls the poverty the poverty of
the single verse that's the crucial
thing three months ago we had a meeting
of our national coordinators in the
North American region we had the US
Canada Caribbean and it was wonderful to
hear the u.s. coordinator sitting with
the Haitian coordinator richest the
poorest countries in the hemisphere
talking together brought together by
this experience of the poverty of the
single verse and speaking about
different kinds of poverty the poverty
of our over active and over consumptive
society here and the poverty of Haiti so
this this this element of poverty is not
a very attractive word but comes close
to the Buddhist idea of emptiness this
is crucial I think to understanding a
deeper transformative practice of
meditation you can meditate just to calm
the mind
very good doesn't restore your hair but
it can do all those other things but it
can also take you into a deeper level
where actual personal transformation
takes place so this idea of poverty is
crucial I think to that transformative
process so he said way back then take
your word or phrase and repeat it
continuously during the time that you
set aside for the meditation and when
thoughts arise or different states of
mind emerge you simply let go of them
you don't become attached you don't try
and change your state of mind
you don't try you don't try and control
your thought process but you keep your
attention carefully I would say lovingly
on this object of attention upon your
word on your mantra and then the rest
follows by itself we recommend people to
meditate every day morning and evening
the the technique itself or the method
itself is is not more complicated than
that
but of course once you start practicing
it seriously it begins to evolve and
you'll find that the level at which you
are doing the practice becomes more
subtle and more transformative at first
at the first level it may seem as if
you're just battling your thoughts and
distractions and not making any progress
so you need someone group to say keep
going don't give up and you're not
failing at this success and failure not
relevant to evaluating this experience
at all so we need some help too to keep
going at that stage so choosing the word
is important because you want to stay
with the same word all the way through
the meditation and at each meditation
same word that then enables the word to
sort of sink on the mind into the heart
it sort of becomes flesh or mist becomes
part of you and then contributes to
really a new way of being and seeing and
acting thinking and feeling in daily
life and describes in his book
so the basic advice would be to take a
word that is sacred in your own
tradition or word that is meaningful to
you
I think it's helpful not to take a word
that's in your own language because if
you take a word in your own language
it may be meaningful the court's verdict
might also stimulate your thought and
imagination and you don't want to be
thinking about the meaning of the word
as you say it meditation is not what you
think so it's helpful to take a word
that is as a good sound good length and
can at the same time not stimulate your
imagination the word we normally
recommend is the word Maranatha or an
Arthur is an Aramaic word Hebrew Hebraic
word word language that Jesus spoke and
it means come Lord but you're not
thinking about the meaning of it as you
say it and actually even as a sound it
resonates with similar words or mantras
in other traditions the sound is a
calming sound an open vowel sound helps
to calm the mind and the length of the
word the four syllables make it easier
to say it in a rhythmic way so that's
the basic method really sit down sit
still sit with your back straight close
your eyes please relaxed but alert and
then silently interiorly your mind begin
to say your word articulate it clearly
in the mind but I would suggest not to
visualize it because all the screens you
have here we have enough visual
stimulation so don't visualize it but
sound it and listen to it as a sound as
you as you repeat it as thoughts arise
just gently let them go if they grab at
you and distract you then as soon as you
realize that that has happened just let
go of the thought the plan memory and
come back to your word child's play okay
so if you like we can try that for a
little bit and then take some time
for some discussion afterwards so we
have got a lot of time so we won't do
any physical stretching perhaps but
maybe just take a moment to sit
comfortably in your chair with your feet
flat on the ground sit with your back
straight and put your hands on your lap
or on your knees relax your shoulders
and relax the muscles of your face where
we carry our stress very often in our
forehead relax your jaw you could keep
your mouth very slightly open close your
eyes lightly very lightly let's take a
few moments to watch your breath helps
to reconnect body and mind
and then I gently peacefully begin to
recite your word your mantra silently in
your mind and heart listening to it
wholeheartedly with your full attention
gently faithfully don't use too much
force faithfully keep returning to it
and above all simply without analyzing
or evaluating what's happening you'll
hold attention focused on this word that
then leads you on this journey the word
again I would recommend is Maranatha naw
naw naw naw naw naw naw naw
you
good
so when we teach children to meditate we
did one minute per year of their age so
we were about 15 years old
so I didn't remember the time or what
was a good time we supposed to finish ah
sorry about that yes sorry Robert I
somehow thought we had now okay hold on
this room owners comment okay well I was
going to do another you know meditation
I think is a foundational practice for
one's life and it's a life skill that
one should learn
you wouldn't think much of a school that
graduated children without knowing how
to use a computer and I think we should
learn how to meditate as a life skill
but I think it's a foundational practice
but of course we need other practices to
supplement it and contextualize it and
so on and I was going to do one of those
with you but remember I don't of time
which is a form of prayer called Lexi oh
by which you you take a passage of
Scripture it could be from any scripture
and you chew it rumination it's a room
in Osseo you choose the scripture you
stay with the same short passage and
squeeze it by repetition and reflection
and letting the mind sort of focus in
upon its particular meaning for you at
that moment but perhaps we better first
us to take a few minutes for any
comments that people would like to share
any questions you might like to raise
well the youngest is difficult so how
you define teaching really but we would
start in schools at about six but more
and more I have I did it the other day
with a four year old which is seems a
little impossible that is it seems
possible yes well I think at one level
it has a meaning conceptual meaning a
contextual meaning and historical
meaning so it can be a sacred word in
that sense because it belongs to a long
tradition of meaning so and at one level
the mind can recognize that accept that
but then you don't stay at that level
you're not staying at the analytical or
conceptual level of the mind you through
the repetition through the act of
attention you're going to another level
it's not essential but in fact I was
speaking to a woman the other day who
was wanted to introduce meditation to
her grandchildren and she said that her
parents of the grandchildren are not
religious so she didn't want to give
them a religious word case they might be
upset so so she said to the children we
choose your own word so the grand son
chose shepherd's pie
you know shepherd's pie show us pies a
very tasty English food
meat and potatoes and but the little
girl being smarter said she was going to
choose the word dictionary because it
contained all words it's fine
so I mean theoretically you could and I
think if you if you really wanted to
stay away from anything remotely
spiritual or religious then you could
you could choose your own word and it
isn't essential that you choose a word
not in your own language but I think it
is easier actually even though the mind
at first begins to resist the idea of
repeating the word that you don't know
the meaning of immediately and it but
that resistance is actually a sign that
you are shifting to another level of
awareness consciousness so if you know
the reason behind it I think it makes
sense
yes meditation and prayer relate to each
other well the early Christian monks
spoke about this as oral copr
or pure prayer so I think if you're
looking at it in a context of Prayer it
expands meaning of the word prayer and
we realize there are different kinds of
Prayer I often think of prayer as a
wheel and the different spokes of the
wheel or like the different forms of
Prayer and actually it's not pushing
pushing here too much I could say as you
walk around the building here you could
see different forms of prayer these
potentially present in the different the
different zones of activity or rest or
recreation and so on that you're doing
hmm
what I can't Pali yeah you're going to
come back so there are different forms
of Prayer and some are specifically
religious and some maybe not so
religious you know exercise I think you
know as a form of attention anything
really that focuses your attention
becomes selfless attention and is it
something you do for itself it in a way
although you know it's bringing your
benefits but you're doing it selflessly
I would say it leads you to deeper
attention and has that selfless element
which is reflected in the enjoyment of
it then even if there's a discipline
attached you can still enjoy it
exercise so I would say you could you
could call that a form of prayer so but
then all the spokes of the wheel
converge in the hub of the wheel and
that's that's where the great spiritual
traditions have you know come into play
really what how do you describe what you
find at the hub of the wheel well you
could say well there's nothing at the
hub of the wheel is emptiness but it's a
in
or fullness it's a stillness
if there's no stillness at the hub of
the wheel correct me as an engineer if
I'm wrong the wheel can't turn around it
but that stillness is not dead it's not
static really it's a it's potential
energy and it's reflected in the
movement of the wheel so in the
Christian understanding I would say this
is where you find the mind of Christ
so there are many ways of describing
them the meditation I think in one sense
is another form of Prayer and that it
you have to fit it into your day but in
another sense it is the it is the
interface really between the the hub of
the wheel and all of those different
forms of practice and so I would say
meditation is the prayer of the heart
for example whereas many of the other
forms of prayer that we are familiar
with you know speaking to God religious
ritual chanting external forms of
worship Scripture and theology
philosophy religious philosophy so on
all of these incense are forms of mental
prayer or maybe physical prayer
whereas meditation is prayer of the
heart okay good one I'm here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
