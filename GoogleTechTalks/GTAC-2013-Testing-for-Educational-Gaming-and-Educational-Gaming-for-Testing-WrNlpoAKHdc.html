more talks today very fascinating talks
that are coming up we have this first
talk is from academia and we have a
couple of talks from academia here this
next speaker is tashia and he is from
north carolina state university and
we'll be talking about testing for
educational gaming and educational
gaming for testing and one nice little
fact is he is actually a u-dub alumnus
so he is a dog d AWG so that thank you
thank you Tony afternoon next I'm going
to talk to you about some recent work in
collaboration with microsoft research
including new Crichton man Jonathan the
whole eggs along with Judas bishop that
seemed would be about the synergy of
testing and educational gaming um on the
test inside I will talk to you about the
dynamic symbolic executions
incorporating in the tool called packs
for microsoft research along with
parameters unit testing as a way for you
to incorporate behavior check in for
your testing and then with this
foundation of technology we have these
gaming as a pic for fun as a way for you
to teach students or teach yourself
about different kind of skills including
software testing skills in the rest of
talk I will basically give you the
background first on the testing and then
we move on to educational game in
particular I will give the back one and
then I will give you a little bit brief
introduction of a writing code in the
browser in your like a favorite browser
of your choice and then we talk about a
gaming type code in dues in the pic for
fun website and further discuss how we
could leverage such gaming type in
educational setting including teaching
and learning and then conclude the talk
here is a screen snapshot of the two
packs released by Microsoft Research
it's a publicly a variable to on the URL
is near the button of the slide
basically it's a plug-in for visual
studio currently it supports different
kind of a dotnet language including
c-sharp visual basic and f sharp like
here basically it's very easy for you to
use and install the plug-in and then you
could just several mouse clicks for you
to generate a set of test inputs as
displayed near the button of the video
studio windows let me give you a little
brief overview of the key technology
called dynamic c MOS fusion impacts how
we could generate test data
automatically to achieve high code
coverage on the sides I have this very
simple piece of code as a CO under test
as you can see the input would be an
integer array and then inside we have
three conditionals on the first one
checking whether the array is a null
pointer and then the second one checking
whether lens is greater than zero and
then the third one is checking whether
the first element is a good at very big
number in the case we will sell an
exception to indicate a potential bug in
that particular colocation dynamic CMOS
cution was proposed back in 2005 and
these days have been incorporated in
different conversation tools including
security testing tools along with specs
dynamic CMOS fusion would start with a
default input for the arguments or
actually selected or randomly selected
input value for this case are we could
just use a default value as a null
pointer for the integer array we execute
the program being instrumented with
additional code to collect rent on
information particularly which path this
test execution which inverse and what
constraints on the inputs we need to
certify in order chambers that
particular pass as we can see if we SQ
non pointer we will chambers the true
branch of the
first conditional at the same time we
collect the constraints record as a past
conviction as a a equal to null pointer
after we finish the execution next we
want to generate new test data right
because we want to excise different
behaviors of the code how to do that we
pick the already collected past
conviction and negate part of it in this
case it's simple because we have only
one constraint we negate it we have
eight not equal to null pointer we fit
this new consent to a conjoined silver
or serum pool the second gen soul will
give us an input concrete input value
that will satisfy this particular
concern for this case is easy we could
see we just need an empty array to
certify the constraint that array is not
not none then we further execute the
program with this new input data further
we could see now we reach the second
conviction now and we take the fourth
branch because a double ends now is
equal to zero not greater than 0
similarly in the next iteration we need
a part of the constraint in this case a
lens greater than zero we fit the new
consent to a conscience over we'd get
the new new concrete input as a 1 array
with only one element that element is
equal to 0 ok with this new input we
further go through the process we had in
this particular case we now reach the
last condition now but the first element
of the array is not equal to do a bit
number is equal to 0 so we next would
negate the last constraints of the pairs
conviction finally we fit to the
constraint to the concerns over we get
this big number in 02 chigger the
exception so in statement for this
particular simple example we are done
because we actually explored all the
paths in this simple program in reality
many reward application or software and
the test wouldn't be that simple we may
have an infinite number
of the past or at least a huge number of
the past in the code we need help some
advanced technologies including those
incorporating impacts to deal with those
complicated situations in this talk I'm
not going to go into the details about
these technologies but the basic idea of
dynamics in persecution is exactly what
I described so far we focus on crashing
or exceptions throwing situations right
in the previous example we know if you
want to assure high quality assurance in
terms of a functional correctness only
catching these crashing or robust issues
may not be enough we need to go one step
further to write down some strong enough
assertions in order to catch these like
a functional correctness box to do that
we could leverage primer unit testing
which is a methodology to help you to
engage diverse and test generation to to
work together in order to exploit the
best out of this test automation in
conscious conventional unit tests which
do not have parameters right when you
write unit tests you don't have
parameters you just rise and test
measure and then you execute the body of
the test methods but in primary unit
testing a unit test has parameters like
the one I put on the side as you can see
down here we have two parameters list
and an integer item the body of this
unitary is testing adding an element
into at least to see whether the count
of the list has been increased by one
very simple behavior how to do that how
to check the behavior next we would put
several lines of code very similar to
what you have been doing in traditional
unit tests basically you write down the
method call that you want to test and
then a right on the assertions that you
want to check the behavior keep in my
here the assertions you are put in here
need to be general enough to deal with
all different kind of argument value
coming in not just a
Cody like 10 or 20 or push one element
to an empty list that kind of specific
situations and to allow you to write
these kind of like general properties as
assertions we have some specific kind of
assumptions which may not exist in
conventional unit tests basically you
could contend in this case least not
equal to null pointer otherwise as you
can see we will show exceptions in the
body of the unit test as you can see for
this kind of like a primary unit test we
basically separate two constraints to
concerns more precise a first we want
developers to write down what you really
want to check the behavior checking us
the sequence of the method course along
with assertions then we allow test
generation tools like pets to generate
high-quality test data to excise
different portion of the code if
possible violating the assertions that
you put down there so it's a nice way of
separating the concerns of these two
paths one being done by human the other
being bound by test automation okay an
actuary primary unit testing all primary
unit tests have been supported by quite
different testing frameworks like
including different kind of a net
testing frameworks along with j unit
four or be young for the java I mean
unit testing and the primary unit
testing would be fully exploited in
terms of the power in practice when you
are using primer unit testing in
combination we SAT test generation tools
like pecs okay for the dark net programs
we have pecs I mentioned already for the
Java unit testing we have some tools
such as agita agita one for allowing to
use test generation for primary unit
tests written by developers so far so
good like today we already listened to
qui Santos engage in so many different
color testing tools including
one that I just described the pecs but
after the thoughts all like in our
typical scenario when we get our
tutorials at industry contacts or
academic settings then quite an audience
may not have the exact tools install on
your laptop after the top of the
tutorials they may not actually spend
ever to install the tool and try out the
tool so that's the issue we have been
observing site without actually seeing
how things are what kind of benefit you
would get they may not border to install
different kind of tools in their
environment so that's a an issue that we
commonly observed in terms of the to
adoption my collaborators at Microsoft
Research have the similar observation to
how to do we said that basically put the
tool online not just I put in a 2 online
for downloading actually making the tool
usable within a browser so that's how
the peg for fun website would come into
the place actually if you have mobile
device or laptop or your desktop you can
actually enter the URL pick for funcom
try things out to get the sense of what
benefits you could get with the power of
test generation and the line packs um
here's a website that screen snap shop
as you can see in the middle you could
enter the source code that you want to
test under particular name like puzzle
with certain parameters you could view
that piece of code as a problem how you
need test okay then you just click the
button near the middle left hand side
aspects then packs with generate test
data and send back the test data to the
browser being displayed to you near the
button of the web page okay so that's a
basic functionality of this website it
could allow you to quickly get a sense
of what these two could do for you I
think that kind of experience would be
could be borrowed by many other two
vendors or other tools in terms of
giving people's and quit overview of
what their tools could do for them but
indeed and like them have to be some
limitation on the brow
the version of the two for example the
total length of the code and the test
might not be too long you only had 15
being copy paste in that browser text
box for the coen detest single-threaded
no environment interactions such as you
cannot use i feii all network
communication that kind of things in the
code and the test now non-deterministic
behavior you would try to avoid
floating-point computation which cannot
be handled well by existing concerns
over we also impose these 20 seconds
exploration time for test generation
when you click the button aspects but
some of these issues are just specific
to the browser version not to the like
visual studio plug-in version in summary
so far I discuss the dynamics in
persecutions how it works and how pets
could be used and how pecs could be
migrated to the browser version so that
many people just open up their browser
and then get a sense what it could do
for you and in order to make this
browser version really usable to have
similar user experiences as they were
doing within their typical ide for
example video studio on my collaborators
and Microsoft Research put a lot of
efforts in creating this nice features
such as I auto code completion when you
just type in for example consult w it
with palm Batson I mean suggestions for
the message that you want to put in
along with the description of these API
methods very nice features just I allow
you to feel the similar experiences as
in the normal typical IDE so basically
for this kind of a browser version of
the tool you could leverage the cloud to
do the computation do the test
generation and you use the browser as
the front end for the user to enter the
code that would like to test and then
also use the browser to
display the test data being generated
back to the users um so far so good we
have pecs and we have the dynamism
execution in Corbin impacts my
collaborator Microsoft Research put
these packs for fun website so that you
could pray with him but think about it
unless you are really like a geek
otherwise you wouldn't come back to this
website like Oh every non then you just
type in Senko and create the buttons
that oh how fun it is right you
generates young for detection capability
I mean like the the interns of test data
and then you pray again and again I mean
I think few people would do that right
um then we think about like how we could
leverage this website and the test
generation engine to some to do
something more fun and more useful in
our work in life that's how the coding
dues come into the picture as a major
game type for picked for fun website so
far and for the code in dues our game
types particularly for the aspects
button basically you click one ton of
aspects button that will indicate one
iteration of game playing about what
months ago we had more than 1.1 million
of the clicking the button okay so many
people around the world are like using
this website to to do like a different
kind of thing like for London particular
for learning why having some fun or you
being used in classroom setting let me
give you an idea on what a coding do
would be like and the idea is very
simple for a game creator like myself or
actually anyone around the world you
could create a secret implementation on
the right-hand side okay basically you
write a very simple piece of code and
then you also release a player
implementation which could be empty
implementation or could be incomplete
version of the secret implementation
then the players would
to complete or finish the player
implementation so that the player
implementation would have the exact same
behavior as a sequel implementation okay
and you would say I cannot see the
secret of entation how could I type in
the code to make the behavior the same
as the underlying secret implementation
right its mission impossible okay that's
how aspects or pex come into the picture
okay pex would give you feedback to tell
you under what inputs you have the same
behavior between these two version under
what inputs you had different behaviors
in addiction pets would be the judge to
determine whether these two
implementation have the same behavior or
not let me use a example to walk you
soon on the left hand side I already
create like secret implementation very
simple one recursion function on the
right hand side are released to the
player with the prayer implementation
basically the empty one you just return
X ok then when the user the player tries
to play this game first the prayer will
create the button aspects because
without any hint the player has no clues
on what direction the prayer needs to
modify the code then after the player
click the button aspects behind a scene
we actually have this test driver being
synthesized it's more like a primary
unit test right you have the input
arguments the same as the signature of
the two implementations and but we
construct a new branch there saying that
if the return value of the secret
indentation is not equal to the value of
the prayer implementation with some
reception as you can see dynamic CMOS
cution would try to cover all feasible
pants of course or feasible brands and
if possible pecks or dynamic same
execution with fire test input to cover
that branch what does it mean if you
could cover that branch it means that
you have at least one test input
to cause the behaviors of the two
implementation to be different okay so
that you have a fairly intense so in
reality if you click the button for
these two implementations you will see
the table this praying to passing tests
and one fell in test basically we are
saying that if you your argument value
is 1 then return value is 1 for both
implementations two similar thing return
value will be two for both implemented
but if you have input value as 3 the
cyclamen tation will return six instead
of three which would be returned by the
player implementation okay so as you can
see as a player you when you see this
kind of a feedback you try to modify you
try to do some generalized
generalization objection reflect on how
would you modify the code implementation
so that you could certify the constraint
of the three test inputs basically
making the passing tests to pass but
making the pherion test also pass okay
we use these kind of a game means we
send middle school students we see very
interesting like behavior there they may
just focus their energy on the failing
test without thinking about making the
past in first two thousand tests also
pass that more like over over fitting
the concern solving in their in their
mind so to summarize these code induce
basically we provide these kind of fun
and engaging experiences by allowing the
user the player to have this iterative
game playing over time by clicking ask
impacts over time when they change the
those player implementations based on
the feedback the feedback are is adapted
and personalized like you play the same
game you may write down different player
implementation make different revision
then the feedback you are getting would
be different because dynamics of
execution or pets would leverage both
the player implementation and the
securement ation to generate specific
test to show the differences all the
commonalities of the behavior
on it's very difficult to do cheating
Kyle I you may say oh because earlier I
mentioned that floating-point
commutation would not be good for
concern so let's just put a bunch of row
the important commutation there to full
packs or full dynamic CMOS you and they
would then work well okay it's very
difficult to defeat that in Syria you
could but in practice very difficult to
cheat we have very clear winning
criterion basically as long as pets
cannot generate like failing tests then
you win again okay we had quite some
users posted posting their feedback and
the experiences on liar just released
through some of the interesting ones I
used to love the first person shooters
and this affection of broken away a
whole team of newbies plain rain rainbow
six but this is far more fun okay the
user was referring to pet for fun that
playing pet for fun the second one
apparently as you could guess the second
one is a profession profession note
rather than a student life and free I
have to consider myself to spend just an
hour also a day on this really exciting
stuff so I really start with work okay
we don't want to like impact your normal
work load there but on the sides good to
help some kind of like entertaining like
why London I mean yourself um the third
one is talking about the learning and
teaching aspect right it really got me
excited the part that got me most is
about spent spreading inches in teaching
computer science I do think that it's
really great for teaching and learning
okay we had many many more different
kind of a very positive feedback from
the users on recently like two years ago
we have this code into competition at
our major software engineering
conference international conference on
software engineering 2011 we provided
these 30 coding duels for other
conference attendees including students
and researchers as you can see i zoom in
there we saw one of the podium do is a
numbers 10 on basically the
in like entries were indicate like that
user actually soft the codeine do win
the codeine do um for the red ones will
indicate like the user makes an attempt
but fair okay the number there indicate
how many attempts the user made
basically how many time the user click
that aspect before they actually finally
got it for the green one or the red one
in the end they still couldn't wind
again it's very ancient to see for this
particular code into is not that evil as
you can see we had one like a user
solving again for ton that's very good
right for tons actually got it but we
could see we even have 147 times and
finally got it right you could reflect
that user is real patient all determined
it's up to you to judge whether you want
to hire this person to be your tester or
not right so you could have different
interpretations on them but as a later I
will describe more another very
interesting for you to see is that as a
teacher who would create this kind of
again for stealing the try teacher could
actually see every single step the user
actually try for this particular we
should actually go inside to see for
that user with 147 what in the unearthed
did this user finally got it right like
what what's a ton in partner why do you
need so many times odd for the fourth
one like what exactly the magic happen
I'd four times you got it right it's
very in tune to see the process besides
Justine and result so to summarize what
we talked about Cody induce basically
it's a given a particular securement
ation and an empty or incomplete prayer
implementation we ask users to try to
improve the player implementation so
that the behavior would match the secret
implementation one the students need to
infer the intended behavior of the
securement ation that they couldn't see
and then they were iteratively trying to
generous a behavior to the co
implementation that the hibachi
we also have this kind of a social
experience e to make it more fun and
engaging we have this life feat been on
the website you can see like at this
particular moment who are so in what are
they successful or are they fail in
still try very hard it would be fun to
watch if you don't have much things I
mean many useful tasks at hand right
especially when you create and codeine
do they just CEO who are so we might do
right that's kind of like an interesting
life it's there we also have these rank
lists for different users a user could
gain some point by creating coding dues
for other people to pray also gains and
ponds by solving successfully solving
certain cody induce okay we have this
kind of a ranked list of people around
the world I mean been like in on this
website we had the readable and along
with other nice features for social
experiences we would like to take
advantage of this preference so that we
could really get much in terms of the
teaching and learning rather than just
say oh we put it there so that anyone
who would like to try I'll just try it
out right to do that basically we
provide different kind of features for
example as a teacher we could create a
course by assembling different webpage
like the course page we already have
different materials on different topics
testing along with different programming
topics and here is a screen snapshot
they're basically for the teacher this
is a like sample course we could see
that on the right hand side we have this
kind of like like a dashboard of showing
the students progress of solving some
exercises in the form of codeine dues
and in the real time the teachers could
look into like what kind of problem they
are facing are they struggling on
particular thing or maybe the exercises
are not the clear in terms of giving
students and
like a requirements we used a code
induce in a graduates of engine course
typically you were saying oh like these
kind of a nice games could be used in
intro programming costs course indeed
that would be the case for example if
you are teaching loop you could just
take certain piece of the loop head out
and then our student the feeling that
particular for example the upper bang of
the loop this kind of thing okay but at
same time we actually tried it out at
graduates of engineering course in terms
of teaching then specification writing
requirements testing design patterns
many different kind of topics here's
just a screen snapshot of a particular
exercise that we prepared for training
students specification writing as you
know in testing in order to write very
strong test articles you need to write
strong properties right for the topic of
primary unit testing to write that unit
test with parameters you need to have
strong assertions all properties to
really check the behavior that you
wouldn't want to check so this exercise
actually have some natural language
descriptions of some properties of a
particular API method and then we are
students to actually translate these
natural language descriptions into some
form or a check herbal properties okay
so on in this particular exercise as you
can see students may not have much space
for guessing because you exactly solving
the given exercise but the nice things
about it is that you actually get
automatic grading okay both the
instructors edna tears are very happy
right because in the end you just look
at all like fell in how many fell in how
many passes into the green entries and
the red entries you just calculate the
scores right rather than we go inside to
grade them miss tiny details and here is
just one example of how we use code in
dues for teaching testing on the code
and the test
she is a step is a bangy stack we create
this coding do by passing in some
parameters like the elements array
element capacity that's upper bound for
the stack and the element which could be
the element you want to push into the
stack or you want to check whether the
state has this element but we don't know
we don't tell you exactly how we are
going to use them but the earlier the
first two lines are basically talking
about the assumptions we put in okay and
then we had the next four lines
described in the set top of that stack
okay basically we just put this array
element into a step so that you could
have a head you can allow the test
generation to to generate particular
stay for you in this particular setting
and then in the end we put down the
assertions we really want the code and
the test to be checked but we keep the
middle empty as you can imagine the
middle part Emily part that and needs to
be filled would be about what measure
under tell you want to invoke understand
in addition you may also need to add
some assumptions to really make sure
that the assertion would be passed okay
so if you have inches you could go to
the the URL to try it out yourself to
see the different kind of exercises how
do you speak for fun I already
demonstrated some scenarios we as we all
know MOOCs has been very popular massive
open online courses are there are at
least two major challenges there to make
things work in MOOCs first Grady all
right you had thousand or even meaning
of a student you cannot afford heileen
TAS to create these student submissions
right because typically they are free
okay in terms of the other cause then
he'll if you use Peck for fun you will
create exercises and get in this
automatic grading for free as a nice
feature on the side but indeed is an
open challenge in terms of like a chick
adjusting Chitti
if like like one still don't just copy
paste another student solution they
working on the same do I mean we're II
don't have certain control in terms of
that it's open change for for many
different technologies it can be used
for course assignment in regular
constituent setting both academic
settings or industry setting for
training okay we have done that in terms
of like the topics from intro to
programming or soft engineering include
interesting topics we actually could
have these competitions including
student competition professional
competition we have this experience at
HC 2011 and finally as I hinted on
earlier it would be very interesting for
you to actually observe one particular
player or users problem-solving process
right you are as a recruiter or a
company's employees you want to hire
some some potential employees you want
to see how they are doing but basically
you could creation we all design coding
duels for them to solve not only seen
how many attempt they are making you see
the problem solving process that kind of
simulate what you typically would do
using the whiteboard to to like to see
how a particular person would do on
solving some problem so it could be used
in that way for you to really assess
people and improve people like for
example your children that you want to
see how they are doing on programming on
particular problem solving so to
summarize what we discuss in teaching
and learning basically if you want to
become the picture to really create a
course for students or like employees or
friends for to play with and see in
their problem-solving process you could
sign in with Microsoft account like a
hotmail account exec sure and then you
pick a nickname and send us the nickname
and then we could enable you with
teacher row and you could as a teacher
you could create courses you could
monitor the progress of students problem
solving processes you could interact
with them in different ways so in the
future there's a lot of exciting things
ahead like how to provide
tutoring support for student if they are
Fey facings and difficulties right as
you see that 147 user I mean trying 147
times I mean typically student would get
frustrated after they try a number of
times for this case we should then just
say oh you keep trying or your fair
right you may have some hints on the
side like in the real world setting okay
and how to detect pad reason I mentioned
it already is open problem for the
ranking so far we use passing or not
right whether you have behavioral
differences or not but we really want to
have other criterion like coca-cola tea
and other kind of a criterion for us to
take into account in terms of providing
better grading support other language
down three more detail in this upcoming
paper is a variable for my homepage and
in conclusion I talked about two
different kind of technologies but they
are I mean created to each other
supporting each other dynamic CMOS
cution along with specs and primer unit
testing and pick for fun as educational
platform to conclude that my email
address is there are we react on
collaborations on this exciting period i
would say in 40 or 50 years you may
retire right educating the next
generation to do a better job than us or
at least as good as us is very important
assuming that besides just too
interested automation it's a good
opportunity for the thing about how to
make education and learning more fun and
more variable for the next generation ok
thank you
great thank you Tom very fascinating so
I had forgotten earlier I had a few
things up here so ah for some live
questions I was going to throw this out
to a live question will determine the
the best one here so this is a little
android e so we have the Dory up we go
to the Dory sort of a moderator here
it's not a door so first question up
says how does a tool like pecs fit into
the software lifecycle okay so um it
pets could be used like the other test
generation tools like you finish your Co
implementation and then you apply pecs
to generate test data to exercise
different portion of the code in
addiction they actually could fit in TDD
test-driven the woman but in this
situation you right primer unit test
first without actually having your Co
implementation but in this setting
keeping my primal energy prospects would
be very powerful to force you to write
quite a lot of functionality when you
try to like pass the test I mean it's
debatable whether there's a good thing
or a bad thing in terms of fellows of
your TDD right but it could allow you to
spend more time on writing the code
implementation rather than these various
minor increment increment of adding new
features yeah interesting um there's one
live question here so go ahead tell us
who you are where you're from and then
your question please i'm jessica nicole
i live in new york city and i work at
target spot I was in education for 10
years before transitioning to QA testing
and I find this really exciting and I'm
just wondering if there are plans to
develop a curriculum around this so that
way that teachers can be guided who may
not be so technical but who are
interested in incorporating this into
their classrooms yes yes actually there
are question materials already on the
website for for you to customize you use
in your setting including like initial
programming a long ways like a primary
unit testing we are still like
putting quite substantial efforts in
getting more materials to cover
different topics and customize to
different levels yeah and we also work
on collaboration in terms of this
particular aspect like developing more
course materials so that more people
could benefit from these discourse yeah
great question by the way I was a good
question in the first one up so I'll set
that there for you okay um I think we
have one more live questions so please
go ahead who you are where you're from
and your question please hi my name is
mark university of malta and so I can
see how symbolic execution is really
good for generating a bunch of test
cases which maximize your coverage how
does tex hand the lyrical side of things
so once you've generated the test how
can you be sure the system is behaving
properly for that particular test right
so that would fit in what I described is
a primer unit test of course you could
just apply pecs like any other type
generation to you don't write anything I
you just rely on crashing or not or
throwing and conception or not that's
already there right if you want to have
higher confidence in terms of behavior
that you are checking you write this
carnival primary unit test we shown
enough assertions so that it's not hard
coded for some constants input value but
more general okay so you would get the
benefit by addition Airy doing primer
unit testing thanks to the question so
up here on the the moderator it says
text only identifies unit testing
parameters right it will not handle
functional or integration testing okay
um so basically as you can see pics
basically with the nicely specify
interface that's the test data the pecs
would generate test you could encode
your integration tests or functional
tests inside this primer unit test but
the next questions that could scare well
that's another question we need to it I
mean see like what kind of Korea during
ways where the code you are testing
would have dependency we say
environments maybe you need to
environment isolation is actual I do
mocking this kind of thing so I mean you
may have to do a lot of this additional
tech
typically you would do in your
transitional unit testing yes
interesting and we have time for one
more question so is this a live question
we'll take it please hi I'm Daniel wagon
whole I'm a Googler the parameterised
testing assumptions and assertions
reminded me quite a bit of code
contracts but also felt kind of like the
opposite like you're rather than
specifying within your parameters you're
writing the test which is meant to be
kind of auto verify those on there if
you could kind of contrast those
approaches of it okay very good question
so in co can check that pre post
condition or design by contract you
write the pre post condition in the
production code okay so typically people
would write mostly preconditions and
very few people would write
postcondition why because it's very
difficult to write post-conviction
because it's very complicated to capture
the behavior of that particular piece of
code if you write primary unit test year
you also have a sumption assertion
notice here the assertion there would be
specific to the scene Aaron that you
constraint which this message sequences
in the middle and assumptions that you
put in okay so that you have a much
easier time for you to specify the
behavior but indeed kokhon check would
have more applicable scope or testing
different situations or on the SQ the
physical prominent a would be just
applicable on the scenario that you
specified there with whatever test data
coming in so I think that's a trade-off
that we are making I mean the decipher
country have been going on for prior why
but we haven't seen enough practitioners
I mean pick up in a substantially
hopefully primer unit tests would allow
people to actually get some benefits of
these formal methods but at the same
time they are still for in their
traditional practice of doing unit
testing writing unit tests okay thank
you thank you tell right thank you thank
you
