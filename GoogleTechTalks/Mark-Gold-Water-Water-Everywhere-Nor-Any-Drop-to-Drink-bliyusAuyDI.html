FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi everyone.
Thank you for coming.
This is Mark Gold, our speaker.
And I have a very
long bio here for him,
but I'll just read a
few sentences from it so
that we can get started sooner.
Mark is the director of the UCLA
Institute of the Environment
and Sustainability, and he's
also the longtime president
of Heal the Bay.
Mark has his doctorate
in environmental science
and engineering from
UCLA, and currently he's
working on developing an
integrated water management
approach for the city of LA
that will maximize water quality
benefits while optimizing water
supply, flood control, habitat,
and recreational
open space benefits.
So without further delay, I'm
going to pass the mic to-- oh,
he has his own.
MARK GOLD: I got my own mic.
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.
MARK GOLD: All right, thanks.
All right.
[APPLAUSE]
All right, thanks for
coming out everybody.
So background-wise,
for those of you guys
who live in the region,
so I was the first hire
ever at the environmental
group, Heal the Bay.
And I worked there for 23
years and ran the organization
for almost 20 years.
So I did that first before
coming back to UCLA.
The university's meant
an awful lot to me.
I got all my degrees there.
I met my wife there.
I was born there.
My brothers went there.
It's pretty pathetic.
And now my son, who's finishing
his degree in marine biology
from Stanford-- so water seems
to be the family business--
is actually coming back into his
PhD at UCLA in marine biology.
So there is a big
Bruin connection here.
So a lot going on--
water, and really I'm
going to go through
things pretty quickly
on sort of what's going on in
the state in water-- what's
going on locally on
the water issues.
But this is going to be a lot
more enjoyable for everybody
once we start getting into
Q&amp;amp;A and whatever questions you
may have on that.
Another thing, just for
background on the water side,
is that I also sit on the mayor
of LA, Eric Garcetti's Water
Cabinet.
So there's a group of people at
Department of Water and Power,
Bureau of Sanitation, et
cetera, and I'm pretty much
the only outsider, if you
will, who's on that group.
All right.
So California Drought,
you guys have probably
seen this sort of diagram.
They come out once a week,
and this pretty much says,
we're screwed.
[LAUGHTER]
And so as you can
see, the whole state
is pretty much in drought, and
the vast majority of the state
is in, what's called,
exceptional drought.
I always thought extreme was
worse than exceptional but not
for the drought monitor, and
so what you can see obviously
is that what's
really extraordinary
about this is you
don't see this looking
like this in April, May.
Generally, there's snow
pack, those sorts of things.
There's the Sierra.
Anyone have any good
ski here locally?
I don't think so.
And so we basically have
a Sierra Nevada that's
completely devoid of snow pack.
And so it's bad
enough that this is
the fourth year of
an extreme drought,
the worst one in the last
century plus that people
have been measuring.
But on top of that, it's
not going to get better
for the next five months.
So maybe if we have a wet
winter, that'll be some relief,
but that's a long ways away.
There's not water that's
going to be running off
the Sierras in a real big way
and replenishing our water
supply systems.
So pretty, pretty
scary times that
are unprecedented
in state history.
Literally, the last time
they measured less than 5%
of snowpack compared to a
normal year in the Sierras,
and now it's literally
at zero, so it's just
an incredible, incredible time.
So you see how
extreme the issue is.
And we'll talk a
little bit about what's
going on in the state and some
of the things we're doing.
You know, I'm from UCLA.
I have to talk a little bit
about what we're doing as well.
So we're doing something
pretty exceptional at UCLA.
It's called our Grand
Challenge, and it's
sustainable LA focused.
And so there's two of these
that our university are doing.
And one of them is
on the environment,
and how do you make Los
Angeles truly sustainable,
and I'll talk a
little bit about that.
And then the second
one's on depression,
and I don't know
if it was sequenced
that way intentionally
because anyone
who works on the environment
is going to be depressed,
but those are the
two things that we've
decided to go for so far.
And a lot of this
was inspired by-- we
have someone in our atmospheric
and oceanic sciences, a very
well known professor
named Alex Hall, who
was one of the lead authors on
the IPCC climate change report.
And he was the lead on chapter
13, the climate modeling
section.
And what he did was he
was the first person
to really do this downscale
the major metropolitan area,
and he did this on the
LA area a few years ago.
And what he found-- he looked
at temperature, precipitation,
snowfall, Santa Ana,
and wildfire risk
among other things and using
the various different climate
models out there and his
downscaling techniques.
And the sorts of things that
he found, and I should've
brought a map of this, was
that on average a four to five
degree increase by 2050 using
the various different models
that are out there.
Precipitation, believe it or
not, remains about the same.
Santa Ana's don't really
change a huge amount.
Snowfall in our local mountains
would decrease by 50%,
and wildfire risk goes up
substantially just because
of heat.
And then there are some areas
that really would suffer
disproportionate heat impacts.
Those of you who live near
the coast, you're golden.
And those you who live inland,
if you live in the San Gabriel
Valley or San Fernando
Valley, you're screwed.
So the number of extreme
days goes up dramatically,
over 95 degrees,
within those areas.
So the thought was,
well, what can we do?
Are we just going to sit
idly by for the next 35 years
and just turn into Phoenix?
Or is there something we
can do to sort of thrive
in a hotter Los Angeles?
And so that's where this
research concept came up.
How do you get people
to break across silos,
work together on these
sorts of research areas?
And so what we said was
100% renewable energy,
100% locally-sourced water,
and enhanced ecosystem health
by 2050.
The grand challenges are
supposed to be really grand.
And we have 150 faculty
working on these issues.
It's a big thing that we've
literally just started.
Our research plan should
be done by the end of June.
I bring that up
because obviously
a significant part of
that is how do we get
to 100% locally-sourced water.
To put that in
perspective, right now
in the city of Los
Angeles, any guesses
on how much we get local
water supply, what percentage?
AUDIENCE: 5%.
MARK GOLD: 5%?
Great, make me look worse.
Thanks, 11%.
Gees, no way more than that.
Double what you think.
[LAUGHTER]
So yeah, 11%.
The other 89% comes from
more than 200 miles away.
Not exactly the definition
of sustainability
in any way, shape, or form.
Yeah?
AUDIENCE: What does
locally-sourced mean?
MARK GOLD: Locally
sourced, by the definition,
would be is it coming from LA.
So it'd be local ground water
or local recycled water.
So that's what that would be,
and we'll get a little more
into that in a minute.
All right, so one of the
things that we just put out
at the university and I was
the lead on, maybe you saw it,
maybe you didn't, was we did
an environmental report card
for all of Los Angeles County.
And so this came out
about a month ago,
and there's a
significant water section
in here among other things.
We looked at water, air,
greenhouse gas emissions,
climate, environmental quality
of life, et cetera, et cetera.
So it's a pretty
comprehensive look
on the data that's available
that's truly county
wide on what's being
monitored on a regular basis.
One of things also--
so you heard how bad
LA was on local water-- overall
we get roughly 42% of our water
from local water
supplies in LA County.
So that means 58% is imported
from more than 200 miles away.
So we've definitely
got an issue on where
our water is coming from and how
much better can we actually do
on that.
And so this was just
something we put together
to sort of give some examples
of some of the reasons
why overall the LA region we
ended up giving a C on water.
This was water quality
and water supply both.
I'd be glad to answer
any questions you
have on water supply as well.
I seem to do a lot
of report cards.
I created Heal the Bay's
beach report card, beach water
quality report card,
way back in 1990.
It now grades more
than 500 beaches
along the whole west coast
of the United States.
And so now I'm
grading, again, how
we're doing overall on water.
And water quality
is very, very poor
for our groundwater
supply in a big way.
So when we talk about how do
we get more of our local ground
water, that's a big
impediment is that we have
a lot of historical
chemical contamination
from things like solvents,
perchlorate is another example.
So there's a wide variety
of different contaminants
that are posing problems
within our groundwater, which
makes it tougher to
get the most out of it.
So what's interesting is so
we put this report card out
about a month ago, and about
two years before that in 2012
we did something
a little bit novel
for a university, which is we
put together a sustainable city
plan for LA.
It was aspirational.
What would we want
a sustainable city
to actually look
like in Los Angeles?
And so we put that
out in 2012 right
before the mayoral primary,
and so we were lucky enough
that both mayor
Garcetti and then
council person, or actually
then-controller Wendy
Greuel, both endorsed the plan.
And what ended up happening
once Eric got elected was he
said he was going
to put together
the city of LA's first
ever sustainable city plan.
And so that happened,
and that came out the day
after the environmental
report card.
So I guess that was sort of
intentional on their part
because I've been working
with the city on their project
as well, on their
sustainable city plan,
in that they get a
bad grade one day
and then the next day
say, oh, well we're
going to do a lot
better from now on.
So really the hit was
pretty minimized for them
on what they were doing.
But there were some
transformational things
within their plan that I think
are important for you guys
to take note of.
One, which you hear
about all the time,
was the 20% conservation
goal by January 2017,
which is really a huge deal.
I mean, if we're, on average,
using 130 gallons per capita
per day-- and what that
means, just so you know,
is total water use divided by
population, not necessarily
residential water use.
It's a different number,
so a lot times you'll
see different numbers
that are compared
that are apples and oranges.
And so the 20%
reduction would get us
down to about 104 gallons
per capita per day
in a very short
period of time, and so
that's a pretty ambitious
goal on the mayor's part
to do something that quickly.
And a lot of times when
these sorts of things
have happened before,
it's been a lot of times
sort of temporary
measures just based
on education and
that sort of thing;
whereas, people can revert
back to their wasteful ways
pretty quickly.
The city's trying to do
a lot more than that.
Obviously, the most prominent
thing that you hear about
is paying people
way too much money
to change out their
lawns because they really
want to provide a
tremendous incentive
for people to do so
right away because that's
a permanent change.
If you're getting rid
of a very thirsty lawn
and putting in native
plants, then that's
going to make a huge, huge
difference, especially
when on average, and this
is true for urban areas
within the LA region,
we use over 50%
of our residential water
uses on outdoor irrigation.
So that that's the area
where we can really
make the most difference.
And to put that in perspective
on some of the other things,
so a lot of times people focus
on the indoor and fixtures
and those sorts of
things like, oh,
do you have the latest
low-flush toilet?
Or do you have the right
aerators, water restrictors,
et cetera?
What are using for
your dishwasher?
What are you using for
your washing machine?
Those sorts of things,
those are really critical.
But to put that in
perspective, when I first
started working at Heal
the Bay back in 1988,
the average flow coming into
the Hyperion Treatment Plant--
so that's the sewage going
into that big coastal plant
on the beach, you know, sort
of right near El Segundo,
that area-- was around
400 million gallons a day.
Today, actually, the
lowest was peak recession.
They averaged 254 million
gallons per day at that plant.
Obviously, population
increased, what happened?
What happened was people have
actually done a pretty good job
on indoor conservation,
and so back then everyone
had five-gallon flush toilets.
Now everybody's got at least
a 1.6, a lot more 1.2s.
Now people are you talking
about putting in 0.8s,
so I mean there's a lot of water
conservation effort that has
occurred there.
The same thing-- whatever
you buy today on a dishwasher
or in a washing
machine is a heck
of a lot more water
efficient than it
was, obviously, decades ago.
All right, so the other
long-term transformative goal
that's in this plan, which is
very helpful for our UCLA Grand
Challenge, is the 50% reduction
in imported water by 2035.
And so that's a big, big deal.
And it's one of those
things where you just
look at the number,
and a lot of times
you don't think about, OK, so
what does that actually mean?
Well, what that means
is rather than having
to get all of our water from the
Colorado River-- or this year
not quite so much and
last year not so much
coming from the Bay-Delta area.
Last year we only got
5% of our allocation
in Metropolitan Water District.
This year is 20%.

And then if you look at the
water coming from the Eastern
Sierras, from the LA aqueducts--
so those are the three
imported water sources
within the city of LA-- two
of those are pretty
much dried up,
so we have full allocation
from the Colorado River.
You can imagine how bad a
state we would be in right now
if the Rockies and the
Colorado River Watershed
had as bad a four-year period
as we've had on the Sierras,
but luckily that hasn't
happened even though there has
been drought within that area.
So you think about that
and go, well, where's
that going to come from?
And so for them, they have to
transform their water supply
almost completely to
get there, and so that
means getting more out
of their recycled water.
That means looking at
stormwater capture, which we're
doing very, very poorly
within this local region
and doing better on
conservation as you said.
Obviously, that
helps the bottom line
as well and getting more out
of our groundwater basins
even though they're
highly contaminated.
What can we do to actually
get water out them?
So I'll talk a little bit
more about that coming up.
But that's a
transformational change.
Yeah?
AUDIENCE: When we talked
about less imported water
and using more ground
water, is there a risk
that people start trying to
overdraw their groundwater
basins, which has been a problem
in other areas of drought where
they just overdraw the
groundwater basically
[INAUDIBLE]?
MARK GOLD: So that's
a great question.
So the question was, what
about the risk of overdraft
for groundwater basins?
And we keep hearing
about or reading
about what's been
happening, specifically,
in the San Joaquin Valley
where the degree of subsidence
in the groundwater basin
has been tremendous,
some places 30, 40 feet.
And what happens when
you do that is you
lose that storage capacity
of that aquifer forever.
You can't put it back.
So in the LA region,
what's interesting is
we don't have an
overdraft problem.
As a matter of fact,
in LA because-- this
is the weirdest
thing you're ever
going to hear-- because of
the contamination problem,
we actually don't withdraw
the amount of water
that we actually
legally are allowed to.
So our groundwater basins,
from the standpoint
of a volume perspective, are
actually looking pretty good
right now.
A little more stress on the
San Gabriel Valley area,
but if you look at
the San Fernando
Valley, West Basin,
Central Basin,
they're both very, very
healthy from the standpoint
of the amount of water there.
Now that being said,
one of the laws
you may have caught that past
in the last couple years,
Fran Pavley was the
author, state senator,
and the environmental conscience
of the state of California
in the legislature, is the first
ever groundwater management
law in California.
We were number 50 out
of 50 states, yay,
even behind Texas on
groundwater management.
And the fact that we
have a law, it basically
isn't going to be
implemented in a value
really for about 20
years, so maybe that's
something that the
drought's going to change.
But the way the
law was written was
it gives local groundwater
management, the folks who
have the water rights
within those basins,
the management responsibility
first, and then
they sort of provide
groundwater management plans
to the state over
the next two decades.
But that's just way
too slow, and we
can't afford to go that slow.
But the key thing is if you look
at the aquifers is basically,
you know, we're so used
to thinking of storage
as being giant dams that
are destroying some salmon
river somewhere.
And the reality is storage
can be your aquifer.
How do you get more out of it?
And so if you put more
in, you can pull more out.
And right now to be quite--
it's called conjunctive use--
and to be quite candid, we are
not really doing that as well
as we could within this region.
They do it a lot more
aggressively, again,
in the San Gabriel Valley.
The most aggressive area
in Southern California
would be the Santa
Ana River Watershed,
so they have a
Santa Ana watershed
group that has been
working together
for many years in managing
the basins as a whole.
And for them, they look at
stormwater, every single drop,
as precious.
The end result is if you've
ever been to the Santa Ana
River, people surf sort of on
that Newport-Huntington border,
if you've been down
there, then you'll
see there's really not
much water coming out
of the Santa Ana River 330 days
a year because they're doing
such a good job capturing it.
San Gabriel River, they're
also doing a decent job
capturing it.
But you know there's ecological
impacts to that as well.

We don't need to get into that.
That's just more stuff
within the sustainable city
plan on some of the goals.
Let me-- on the water supply,
how do I blow this up?
All right, let me turn
around, take a look.
All right, so one of the things
we're doing on the research
side, and I'm not
going to bore you guys
with too much of
the detail here,
is that we're looking
at the whole city of Los
Angeles and their water
supply, and what can they
do to sort of get to
these aspirational goals?
And so we're doing it on a
watershed by watershed basis,
and so the first
watershed we're looking at
is the Ballona Creek Watershed.
You guys are almost in the
Ballona Creek Watershed here.

But if you look
at the city of LA
overall on where
the water comes from
and what the potential is,
what we were looking at here
was to say, look, if you look at
the Hyperion Treatment Plant--
right now the way
we've always dealt
with waste water on
the coast is we've
got to treat it to a level
that it complies with the Clean
Water Act and make sure
that's not harming marine life
or posing some sort
of public health risk.
But we don't really look at our
coastal sewage treatment plants
as water supply, and
that's starting to change.
Orange County obviously
was the big lead
on that with the Orange
County Water District,
and you've heard about, you
know, they have a 70 million
gallon-per-day
facility that takes
a secondary treated wastewater.
They run it through
microfiltration and reverse
osmosis, advanced oxidation,
and by the end of it
you could literally
drink it, and it
would comply with every single
of the Safe Drinking Water Act
standards.
But instead, they put
it into the ground,
and then it commingles with
the existing groundwater,
and then they pump it back up.
But 70 MGD, it's a pretty big
part of their water supply.
So if you look at
Hyperion, and even
with the amount of conservation
that's going on right now,
you could look at
that and say, look,
we can get maybe
200,000 acre feet out
of that facility
per year, which is
enough for well over
a million people,
and so that's something
that really looking
at our coastal treatment
plants more for water supply is
something that we need to do.
It's not just the
small inland plants
that have been really good on
water recycling for a long time
although not so much
in LA, it really
are also these big
treatment plants that
are near the coast that have
tremendous potential as well.
And so we took a
hard look at that
and realized that we
could get 200,000 acre
feet with conservation.
I mean, that's like 40%
of LA's water supply
if the conservation goals are
met if you look out 20 years,
so that's a pretty
big portion if we're
saying how do we get water
supply to 50% plus by 2035.
So that's just an example here.
And anyway, so I don't
need to break down Ballona.

This sort of gives
you an idea of where
things were in an average year
in 2010, so back then only 52%
of our water-- that was like
the last average year I think
we had was 2010--
about half of our water
was purchased from
Metropolitan Water District.
Last year it was
over three quarters,
and so when you see anything
purchased from Metropolitan
Water District, just realize
it is coming from a long ways
away.
So it's either coming
from Bay Delta,
or it's coming from
the Colorado, right?
And so that's a big, big deal.
And LA aquifer, like I said,
because of the drought,
is just shrinking and
shrinking and shrinking.
So I think last year
it was still up to 10%.
This year, it will
be lucky if it's 2%,
so there's just no water
coming out of there.
And so the city also has
2025 water portfolio goals,
so they're trying to diversify
how they're looking at water.
They want to cut their Met
Water down to 40% or less
by that time frame and
looking at still more
capture, conservation, water
transfers, recycle water,
those sorts of things.
So a diverse portfolio is the
direction everybody is going,
and 2035, if you're going to
get to 50% local, one scenario
could look like this
where a third of the water
comes from Met, LA
Aqueduct about 11% percent.
But then we look at groundwater
increasing dramatically,
recycled water and stormwater
increasing dramatically.
So those are the sorts of
things that people are talking
about changing where
our water supply comes
from in a big, big way.
And so related to
that, some hot topics
in water going down
to the [INAUDIBLE] you
have Proposition 1, which
everybody-- we voted for.
2/3 of the public who did
decide to vote last November
voted to support Prop 1.
It was $7.5 billion for water.
And what was different about
this water bond in comparison
to other water
bonds was that there
was a real big focus on
these local urban supplies,
and so as an example
for water recycling,
there's more than $500 million
in there for water recycling.
There's another
$500 plus million
for groundwater remediation
and I think a similar amount
for stormwater capture.
And so if we think about
that, and how do you--
I think talking
about groundwater
remediation probably deserves
another minute or two.
So you keep hearing
me say, oh, we
need to get more out of
our groundwater basins,
but I'm also saying
our groundwater basins
are really contaminated.
So you guys are probably
going, what the heck?
How do you do both those things?
And so here's a situation
where it's actually being done.
Who here lives in Santa Monica?
A lot of you guys.
Hey neighbors.
So in Santa Monica
in the mid '90s,
the local water supply
back then was 0%.
And the reason why
it was 0% was we
had TCE contamination
in our groundwater so
trichloroethylene, we
had perchloroethylene,
and we had MTBE, so that's
the smog additive that you
see in your gasoline.
And so all of those got
into our groundwater.
MTBE is specifically
troubling because it's
very water soluble and
incredibly difficult
to remove from water.
And so what happened
was, Santa Monica
took matters into
their own hands.
This actually was one
of those great things.
My wife is an engineer, water
engineer in Santa Monica.
This is her life, so
I'll talk about her life.
And they basically went
after the polluters who
polluted Santa
Monica's aquifers,
and they ended up getting, at
this point, almost $400 million
in settlement dollars to
build treatment facilities
so that they're now pumping
contaminated groundwater
from their aquifers,
the Charnock aquifer
if you know where Windward
School and Mar Vista Park is,
so it's actually on the
Windward School campus.
And then there's also another
treatment facility right
at Bundy and Wilshire that
you may have seen right across
from Cafe Literati.
And so those two
facilities, they
take this contaminated
groundwater,
and they run it through
granulated-activated carbon
among other treatment.
And then they actually provide
drinking-water-quality water.
So now Santa Monica, 70% of
our water supply is local.
And the goal-- and
this is a policy
that I helped put
together with the city.
I've chaired their environmental
task force for 25 years--
is how do we get to do 100%
local water supply by 2020?
And so how do we make
that 30% increment up?
A combination of conservation,
which now, of course,
is mandated statewide, but also
looking at other water sources
as well in doing so.
So stormwater is an example.
And if you've been
to Santa Monica Pier,
and you've seen that little
treatment facility right
next to Santa Monica pier, the
Santa Monica Urban Runoff Reuse
Facility, SMURRF, have
you guys seen that thing?
All right.
Yeah, I know, it should
be blue and white, right?
But so the SMURRF actually
treats water and they use it,
then it gets recycled for
irrigation purposes, toilet
flushing, and various
different other uses.
So those are the
sorts of things that
are being done there, so we
could do the same thing in LA.
And so the place
to do this in LA,
we have a huge super-fun site
in the San Fernando Valley,
not too far from sort of
the Universal City area
if you know that part.
We used to have a
ton of aerospace
sort of in that Burbank, San
Fernando Valley area there.
And because of that, a
lot of the contamination's
been there forever.
People have been fighting
in court back and forth.
Super-fun EPA really hasn't
been able to get much cleaned up
there at all.
And so finally, after all these
years and seeing the success
story at Santa Monica,
the city of LA is saying,
we're going to do the same thing
that Santa Monica is doing,
but we're going to do
it in LA, and we're
going to do it way bigger.
And so getting more out
of the San Fernando Valley
aquifer, which is really the
key to success for LA's water
future, means an awful lot.
And so their hope is
to get a lot of Prop
1 money out of that, at
least a quarter billion,
to help pay for that
so it doesn't all
fall under DWP rates but that
the state's paying for it as
well.
And so look for that
project to move forward
within the next couple of
years, and it's a big deal.
And as long as I was
talking about that aquifer
and why it has so
much potential,
there's more than two
million acre feet of storage
available for use
within that aquifer,
and we're barely scratching
the surface on that use.
Another aquifer that we've
barely scratched the surface on
is West Basin.
Any of you guys live
in the South Bay?
Not that many.
OK, well.
All right, so on what's
interesting there
is about 30 million gallons
a day from Hyperion water
gets treated by the West Basin
Municipal Water District.
They have a plant
right off of Sepulveda
called the Ed C Little
Water Recycling Plant,
and they also highly
treat the water
to the point I take my
students in my water class
to actually-- they
go to Hyperion,
and then they go to
the Ed C Little Plant
and because it's
advanced microfiltration,
reverse osmosis, advanced
treatment, advanced oxidation,
they drink the water at the end.
So otherwise they don't get
a grade for the day-- no.
[LAUGHTER]
So that is very, very
highly-treated water,
and it's used for seawater
intrusion barrier water,
so big concern is you
have sea water infiltrates
into your groundwater basins
and contaminates the basin salt.
It costs a lot of money to
remove through treatment,
huge amount of energy.
That's why if you hear
about ocean desal,
very, very large energy costs.
That's why it's
about $2,250 an acre
foot for the new
Carlsbad plant that's
going in near San Diego
compared to advanced treatment
of wastewater would be
about $1,400 an acre foot.
So that's a pretty
big difference,
and it's all due to energy
use and basically running it
through the reverse osmosis,
very high pressure needed.
So there's this big plume
of saline groundwater
that's in West Basin
that if that was actually
pumped and treated, you would
get an additional 600,000 acre
feet of storage
within the South Bay.
I just bring up those
numbers, they're huge numbers,
because again that's
enough for more than city
of LA's water supply
for an entire year.
So we've barely
scratched the surface
on what we could be doing with
our local groundwater basins,
and that's really the point
of me overwhelming you
with too many numbers.
All right, so other
hot topics and water
that I'd be glad to talk
about on the mandatory 25%
statewide target
for urban areas.
That's been interesting in that
the governor basically said,
let's try it for a
year voluntarily.
It didn't work.
What a surprise.
Every single study would
say that voluntary water
conservation doesn't work.
You might be able to get a
few percent here and there,
but overall it doesn't
have a major impact.
And so we'll see
how this goes now
with these mandatory
water budgets for each
and every city.
I think it's done a
really good job just
basically daylighting
all the information
and letting you know that, wow,
Malibu uses a lot of water,
or what about those water
hogs in Beverly Hills?
What do you think about that?
You know, and sort of giving
you an idea of comparing
how some cities do
on water conservation
compared to others.
I can tell you off the record,
there are like some people,
boy, if you start doing
that on an individual basis,
I think that would really
be a pretty hot thing to do,
but it's illegal at this point.
But I've been told by some
source in Santa Monica
that there are some people
who use more than three
acre feet a year for one house.
And you're just like,
you gotta be kidding me.
That's enough water
for almost 20 people.
And so just to think that one
house north of San Vicente--
I wish I knew the address--
uses that much water is
pretty frightening.
And to give you an
idea about people
who really have just
way too much money
to burn, there's even
a concern about people
putting in their own wells,
their own drinking-water wells,
into the local aquifer because,
at least for getting irrigation
water-- it's not high enough
quality for drinking water
directly without
treatment-- and to do
that because it's what's
called a non-adjudicated basin
under Santa Monica.
So in other words, there hasn't
been a judge who says who can
and cannot take x amount
of water out of that basin.
So can you imagine having that
much money where it's like, oh
yeah, I'm just going to drill
a well in my own backyard
and have that going.
So that's a pretty scary thing
so if that turns into a trend.
Conservation, we talked about
the turf removal subsidies
$3.75 a square foot.
I mean, that's crazy, right?
So turf terminator
showed up overnight.
They have almost 500
employees, and they've
existed for year and a half.
I know there's some good
about them and some bad,
but the fact that
there's now an industry
to do this in a big, big
way is pretty exciting.
How long those subsidies are
going to last is a big issue.
I don't know.
I don't see $3.75, personally,
lasting for another year.
So if you're thinking
about doing it,
I would do it right
away if you want
to get the most out of that.
The water budgets, I touched
upon already the fact
that, you know, you
have individual cities
being told you gotta
reduce 36% or 16% or 6%.
And I'm sure one of
things that has not
been lost on this audience
is the more affluent you are,
the more likely that your city
is wasting a lot more water.
And so the allocations
are much more
strict for a Malibu or a
Beverly Hills than they are for,
obviously, a
Compton or something
like because the water use is
just very, very closely related
to household income.
And that was a
research study that
was done at UCLA by
Stephanie [? Penselle ?]
that really mapped that out
very, very well, where it's
like, just in the
city of LA, you
see Brentwood and Bel Air,
et cetera, and Palisades.
Enormous water use even compared
to some very dry, hot parcels
in Reseda, but obviously the
household income in Reseda
is much, much, much smaller
compared to those other areas.
Fines you've been hearing a
lot about in the last week,
and so making that a true
deterrent is a big thing.
I don't know how many
$10,000 fines that are going
to occur anytime soon.
I guess they felt the
$500 fine wasn't adequate.
The reality is someone's
got to start giving fines
for water wasting, and that
really hasn't happened at all.
On the rate structure
side, this has
been a hot topic that
pretty much makes
people's eyes glaze over.
But in a weird way,
on conservation,
it may be the most important
of all the issues, at least
in urban areas.
There was a recent Fourth
Circuit appellate decision,
state court, on
San Juan Capistrano
and their conservation-based
water rates.
And the appellate court judge
upheld the district court
decision, which stated
that basically you
couldn't have a water-waster
rate in your block tiered
structure.
So if you guys pay, I think,
if you're in the city of LA--
if you're in Santa
Monica, you know
you have a four-tiered rate.
And so there's four tiers.
And so there's sort
of the low two tears,
which are very cheap water,
and then it ramps up pretty
significantly, tier three.
And then for tier four,
it's pretty much saying,
you know what, you really should
be paying through the gills
for being such a water hog.
And what this basically said
was not that that kind of rate
was illegal, but that
the cities needed
to demonstrate that there was
a direct nexus for the increase
in rate for water hogs in
comparison to the next tier.
And the problem is, none of
the cities or water districts
have really done much
of a job on that.
They've looked at this
more from the standpoint
of we want to
force conservation,
and we also want x
number of dollars
to be able to operate
the entire system.
And the court said, you've got
to do a lot better than that.
So that has just been absolutely
chilling to water rate
structures throughout
the entire state
and not being able to do as
strong a conservation-base rate
structure.
I can tell you as
someone who's worked
on this both in LA and in
Santa Monica and others,
Santa Monica saw the
writing on the wall.
They decided that
they weren't going
to go for these extreme
conservation base rates, which
I wanted like the top few
rates to be like double,
double so you'd
really pay a fortune.
If you want to grow a
vineyard in your backyard,
you should be paying a
lot to do that is pretty
much the way I look at it.
But with that court
decision, there
has to be
substantiation for that.
Like, you know, well what
additional infrastructure
do we have to build?
Do we have to
capture stormwater?
Whereas, before
we didn't have to.
All those other
sorts of things you
need to take into account
and economic analysis
before moving forward
with that rate structure.
So what happened is you
end up reverting to fines,
and so there were water
budgets given to individuals.
Have you guys seen those
on your water bills
yet in Santa Monica?
So you actually now
have a water budget,
and if you exceed that by a
certain amount for your billing
period, you can
actually get a fine.
And the cap for the
fine for Santa Monica
right now is $1,000 a year,
but that's the approach
that they went.
If you're a total water hog, and
you do this for seven billing
periods-- so that
would be 14 months,
right, each billing
period's two months-- then
they could actually
fine you up to $10,000
and shut off your water.
And that would make
people take it seriously
if all of a sudden you turn on
the tap and nothing came out.
But those are the sorts of tools
that are sort of being forced.
It's not the right
tool maybe to use.
I think a block-rate
structure would be better,
but this is kind of where
things are because of that court
decision.
All right, so the next issue,
agricultural water use.
This is like the big issue that
drives everybody nuts, right?
We urbanites, we
use how much water
in the state of California?
Everyone knows it by now, right?
20%.
So 20%, so it's 20 versus 80.
So if we do our job and do
a 25% reduction, then great.
We've reduced California
water use by 5%.
That's great.
And at the same time, if we
read one more story about
it's a gallon per almond, right?
Did you guys get rid
of all your almonds?
[LAUGHTER]
You know, pistachios are worse,
but walnuts are even worse.
But those sorts of issues
have been interesting
because the state, I think, has
completely flubbed how they're
dealing with those issues.
Lumping all cities
together is stupid.
Lumping all agriculture
together is equally stupid.
Believe me, the people in the
San Joaquin Valley, not all
of them, different
water districts
have different water
rights, and I'm not
going to bore you guys
all with senior water
rights versus
junior water rights
and what that all means because
that'll make people's heads
explode, or you'll go to sleep.
But suffice it to say that
water rights are a huge deal,
and so people with
senior water rights
are going to do a lot better
than those with junior water
rights.
And so we've seen that those
with junior water rights,
they're getting cut off,
and so their farms basically
are dying.
So it's not like the
water's coming, you know,
if they're in the
San Joaquin Valley.
Other areas that are
really getting hit hard,
if you know people who are
growing wine or other crops,
olives are pretty common out
there as well in the Central
Coast, they're getting hit
a lot because basically they
rely on local
groundwater, and they're
going to have a huge
overdraft problem.
So a lot of those guys are
in really deep trouble.
And then you look
at, I mean, to me
the area that
drives me absolutely
insane is the Imperial Valley.
Everyone know where
the Imperial Valley is?
So that's like the hottest
corner of California,
and so our water rights
from the Colorado River
overall is 4.4 million
acre feet per year.
Urbanites, Metropolitan Water
District, gets about 1.2
million acre feet
a year from that.
So Imperial Valley
gets the rest,
so that's like 3.2 million
acre feet per year.
They're growing alfalfa in the
middle of the desert, you know,
when it's 120 degrees outside.
And you know why?
Because they can.
The reality is they
have the senior water
rights on the Colorado River.
And so short of some
incredible legal action,
that's one of the big things.
So when we want equity
across the board saying, hey,
we're going to cut our
water use here as urbanites,
we want to see the same
thing in agriculture.
The tools that are really
available to the State
to force that to occur quickly
are very, very limited,
and that's a huge
frustration, and I'm
equally as frustrated as all of
you guys that that's the case.
These guys, they
could cut way back,
and they could sell
the water or store more
of the water for the future.
I don't know if
you know, San Diego
has their own deal with the
Imperial Irrigation District,
and that's where they
get a lot of the water.
That deal is expiring in 2017.
It's going to be really
fascinating to see
what happens.
I can tell you, who do
you think the big loser
in that whole
thing's going to be?
Salton Sea man, disaster.
You think the Salton
Sea is bad now?
The amount of
agricultural runoff that's
going to go into
that sea is going
to get less and less
and less, and that
is the only water supply going
into the Salton Sea right now.
And so that is a very,
very horrifying thought.
If you thought the dust problems
were bad up at Owens Lake,
they're going to be at least
that bad at the Salton Sea
if things are not done to
actually remedy that situation.
It's very fascinating
to me with all this
going on that Salton Sea, it's
been talked about a little bit,
but how big of a
crisis it is I think
has been really short
changed in the public eye
and how those stories
have been told.
So just keep that in mind.
There's a lot to do.
So on ag use, I
think there's more
that the State can be doing.
I think they should be doing
the same thing on water budgets.
You've seen some writers, George
Skelton, &quot;LA Times,&quot; who said,
OK, we should order people what
crops they can and cannot grow.
That's not going to
work in this country.
I just don't see that happening.
But you can give water
districts the same thing
you're doing in the urban
areas, why not give them
a water budget and basically say
you've got to meet that budget?
Even if you have
the water rights,
you got to meet the budget?
And so I think that's
something that needs to occur.
And then lastly, I'll just
say other solutions that
would help, you might start
seeing this more and more,
is net-zero water.
Hopefully, we'll see something
like this in Santa Monica
as a leader on this
very soon, which
is for all new and
redevelopment to make sure
that they would
use 25% less water
than the pre-existing
development.
And so even if somebody
builds a big mixed-use project
with condominiums or apartments
and those sorts of things,
and it used to be a one story,
that they would be on the hook
for reducing the water
either on that parcel,
and if they can't do
it on their parcel,
then they got to do it
off site within the city
by two to one multiplier.
And so that is a big,
big-- so in other words,
it doesn't stop new and
redevelopment, but what it does
is it basically says, look, that
whole issue of let's use water
consumption to stop
development, that goes away
because at least it
says, look, and you
can do the same thing on
greenhouse gas emissions
as well to have these
net-zero concepts for new
and redevelopment.
So it's a cool concept
I think would really
make a big difference.
And so we'll see how that goes.
And I will spare you 218 reform.
So with that if you
have any questions,
I'd be glad to answer them.
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Because it's recorded,
please use the microphone
for your questions
rather than have me
walking around handing
the microphone in the audience.
MARK GOLD: Great.
Yeah?
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for the talk.
I just wanted to ask, if
we cut water this much
in the city of Los
Angeles, it's hard for me
not to imagine the temperature's
going up all over the city.
Like you know, if we cut out
the irrigation and all the grass
and things like that.
So are there efforts
going on in parallel
to like put in just more plants?
MARK GOLD: There are, and
that's a great question.
So the question is what's going
to happen with the heat island
effect?
And so one of the
things that came out
of the very, very strong
component in Mayor Garcetti's,
sustainable city plan
was on heat island.
He actually had a
heat island indicator.
I can't remember what the exact
temperature was, but actually
for temperature
reduction over time
that was going to occur
over the next 20 years.
And I think it was about
three degrees, not everywhere,
but in mostly areas that have
the most extreme heat island
effect.
So how do you do that?
So cool roofs is one way.
So obviously, we want white
roofs instead of dark roofs.
And the same thing
with cool streets,
so from the standpoint
of black tar asphalt
pavement and turning that more
into wider streets, lighter
streets.
That's going to make
a huge difference
from the standpoint of helping
on the heat island effect.
So those are the sorts of things
that are being talked about.
Yeah, planting a whole
bunch of thirsty trees
isn't going to help us
on the conservation side,
so being much smarter on
what our canopy is made up
of needs to occur as
well as opposed to,
well, we've had ficus on
this block for 90 years,
so let's keep doing that.
We've got to be much smarter in
what we're actually planting.
Yeah?
AUDIENCE: Hi,
thanks for the talk.
I have a lot of
questions, but I'm
going to just keep getting
back in line so everyone
has a chance.
MARK GOLD: I could
do a quiz, no?
Yeah?
AUDIENCE: Or I'll talk
to you afterwards.
MARK GOLD: OK.
AUDIENCE: I promised people
that I would report back
with my findings.
So one of the big things
that's happened recently
on the UCLA campus and in
Hollywood that kind of brought
to light the fact the
infrastructure for the water
is pretty crappy.
It's been there for 100 years
and not really maintained.
What's being done about that?
Because we lost a lot of water.
I mean, maybe not a
lot in the big picture
but a lot of fresh water.
MARK GOLD: Yeah, we
had 20 million gallons
in Pauley Pavilion.
That wasn't really good
for our basketball floor.
I don't know if that's what's
impacting our recruiting,
but it's not doing too well.
But the gist of it is that we've
got a crisis, an infrastructure
crisis, in this country
that's dramatic.
In LA it's interesting.
Department of Water and Power is
probably the most hated agency.
You know, DMV, IRS,
people like then
more than Department
of Water and Power,
so when you actually get to
the point of saying, look,
we really need a water
rate increase so that we
can actually have a system that
their current pace of change
out of their water
infrastructure
is once every 300 years,
and that's not made up.
And so clearly so the pace
is we're not getting to it,
and it's a huge problem.
And so the city needs
to be a lot more
bold on infrastructure,
and then the problem
is you're not
going to see anyone
risk their political
lives for DWP
to do a water rate
increase unless they
have more trust in the agency.
And so that's what they're
working on right now,
and I can tell you things
are a lot better than they
were a couple years ago, but are
they good enough to basically
say, look, we need to do a water
rate increase for our decaying
infrastructure to get more
out of our recycle water
for stormwater capture, for
the things that people want?
I really feel like if the
public gets 100% assurance
that the rate increase
will go to all the things
that they really want and they
believe in, that that's what's
needed to get the trust back.
And I think it'll have to be a
very innovative rate structure,
otherwise it's just going to
be like a one-year emergency
thing, which isn't going
to be transformative,
which is what's needed.

AUDIENCE: Hi.
I mean, right now it
seems like a lot of people
understand we need
to have conservation.
I think, generally
people seem pretty
supportive of Jerry
Brown's statements
that we're just doing
mandatory water restrictions.
You guys need to
start conserving more.
Do you think there's
going to be a problem?
If we do have a wet
winter, everyone's
going to go, oh
OK, we're done now.
MARK GOLD: Yeah, I do.
AUDIENCE: There not going
to actually understand
we're not really better off.
MARK GOLD: This is why at least
I'm optimistic about things
like this whole concept
to it's bad to have
a lawn that at least if you're
changing out and planning
natives, that's a
permanent solution.
If you're putting in new
water-conserving technologies,
that's a permanent solution.
So the fact that we're
not doing anything
that's permanent on the ag
side is concerning to me.
So even if it was basically
saying, well, let's use this,
and let's use the bond
dollars, the $7.5 billion,
and we're going to do
conservation retrofits
in the most water-wasting
of our agricultural parcels.
And we're not going to do
it on a voluntary basis.
We're going to actually
come in and do it, right?
I think that sort of
aggressive approach is needed.
Otherwise, yeah,
it is human nature.
It's like, oh yeah, so
much for climate change.
We had a cold winter
in New England.
And so we've seen
that, snowballs
on the floor of the
Senate, come on.
So that's the sort of
thing-- I agree with you.
That's why permanent solutions
are critical, not just
behavioral change.

AUDIENCE: Hi, so I have another
kind of an infrastructure
question with the
recycled water.
MARK GOLD: Sure.
AUDIENCE: So I notice,
at least in our city,
that a lot of the parks are
irrigated with recycled water
and was wondering if there's any
chance that that would extend
to houses, or would that just be
cost prohibitive trying to run
a whole new set of water lines?
MARK GOLD: Now what's
interesting about that,
so there's a lot of things
that's held up the city of LA
on water recycling.
One is the Department
of Water and Power
and the Bureau of Sanitation are
completely separate and often
competitive against each other.
So the Bureau of Sanitation
treats the waste water,
DWP sells the water, and
so that's been an issue.
Why would Bureau of
Sanitation treat the water
to a higher level
if they don't get
the economic benefit
of selling the water,
so those things need
to be worked out.
Now that being said, purple
pipe costs a lot of money.
Laying any sort of pipe
costs a lot of money,
and that's the
recycled water pipe.
I can tell you,
based on the research
that we've been doing
on the Save LA project.
I came in here thinking
purple pipe was
going to be a real major
part of the solution.
The more and more
I think about it,
better utility of our
groundwater aquifers
is far more cost
effective and far smarter
and allows us to store during
good times and bad times,
and we're not getting
the most out of that.
So if you look at a
Hyperion building,
a whole bunch of purple
pipe to Playa Vista
has really not amounted
to much of anything.
I mean, it's like a
million gallons per day
coming out of Hyperion,
which is a joke.
And that includes [INAUDIBLE]
and Westchester and the golf
course right there.
There just has not been very
much use on recycled water.
The quality of the
water is not as good
as it should be because,
the volumes are low,
and they've actually
had regrowth problems
in the pipes, a little
bit of odor issues.
It's high quality coming
out of treatment, but not
by the time you
turn on the pipe.
You're like, whoa,
what's that smell?
So to me, better utilization,
a better future for us
would be getting more out
of our groundwater basins
and really, either through
injection or infiltration,
putting it in the groundwater
and then pulling it out
and [INAUDIBLE].

AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.
Thank you--
MARK GOLD: That was
probably intentional
because I was getting blind.
Yeah?
[LAUGHTER]
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming to Google again.
MARK GOLD: Thanks.
AUDIENCE: I would like to ask
to deliberate a little bit more
on the Imperial
Water District swap
as they did with San Diego.
What is the size of this deal?
Maybe explain why is
it so controversial?
And what's your general view on
this kind of swap or monetizing
of sea and water rights?
MARK GOLD: All right, so the
question was on the Imperial.
And so that deal was
negotiated about a decade ago.
And the overall
view, just getting
to that point of agriculture
selling their water supply
to urban areas, is that
it's OK, that water's water,
and if someone needs it more
than you do, then that's fine.
And so that's a good thing.
There was specific
requirements in there
in how much went to
San Diego and then
how much went to the Salton
Sea, and with the water pressure
being what it is right now,
there's a big, big concern on
whether or not the
Salton Sea would
get any allocation whatsoever.
So the loser in this
whole thing will not
be San Diego because
San Diego will
be able to pay more for water.
I mean, heck, they made the
commitment to 2,250 an acre
foot for Carlsbad for
50,000-- what is it?
How many acre feet a year.
50,000 acre feet a year?
I think 50,000 acre feet a
year out of that facility.
And they're about
to make a $3 billion
commitment to taking water
recycling to the next level
and actually going
to do, what's called,
a different type of indirect
potable reuse where I've
been talking a lot about
where you actually treat water
to a high level.
Put it in ground water, and
then it commingles, and then
you pump it back up, but
you get soil benefits there.
Because there is no significant
groundwater in San Diego,
they're actually looking
at surface water reservoirs
and combining highly-treated
advanced exudation
recycled water with surface
water and reservoirs.
So that's the direction
they're going.
But some people have gamed
the system in a big way,
and that's where you see anger.
You know, where
people who aren't
really farmers but
really are just
out to make a buck as much as
possible or getting very, very
cheap water based on some
old water rights rates
from many, many
decades ago, and then
just making a fortune
on reselling it
for an order magnitude
or more for urban areas.
And that sort of opportunism
without any sort of regulation
has been a big concern as well.
Yeah?
OK.
Two more questions.
AUDIENCE: So what about
the policy cost waste?
Say like Santa Monica.
One day I saw them using
high pressure water
to wash the walkway because
there's a law preventing people
from using the air blower.
And that looks to me to
make no sense, and now
what about that problem?
MARK GOLD: Yeah, you know this
is the problem when you've
got environmental issues,
it's not as simple
as like let's just focus
on water and ignore air.
So they banned leaf blowers
because of the impacts
on people with
asthma and breathing
because a lot more
dust in the air
and there's noise
pollution, et cetera.
And so they ended
up going to these--
the city uses these very,
very high pressure washers
to try to recover the water to
some extent because, remember,
a lot of people
don't realize this,
that water is all going to
the Santa Monica urban runoff
recycling facility.
So even though you may see
a flowing down the drain,
they actually are
able to capture it
and treat it and reuse it.
But that's not true
in most cities,
so you're bringing up an
interesting point, which
is why the requirements under
the county stormwater measure
is that there's a
county stormwater
permit is that these high
pressure washers have
to be water efficient.
And I can't remember what
the exact numbers are
on gallons per minute,
but it's very, very low.
And so that's been a response
because it's definitely
illegal to use just a regular
hose to wash off debris.
So it might no be a
satisfactory answer to you,
but that's sort of the
genesis of where it came from.
Last question.
AUDIENCE: Yeah
MARK GOLD: Sorry, you
don't get your list.
AUDIENCE: Maybe I'll
talk to you afterwards.
So has anybody done
any kind of study
to determine whether or not, in
these like very extreme drought
or exceptional drought areas,
it makes more sense for people
to use disposable
dishes and silverware
rather than washing dishes?
MARK GOLD: Haven't heard it.
Haven't heard
anybody look at it.
AUDIENCE: That's a good
question though, Right?
Like because it depends on where
those things are being made.
Obviously, when you
make paper products
it takes a lot of water
to make paper products,
but if it's not here, than
it's someone else's problem.
Like if we do it
on the east coast,
they've got lots of water.
MARK GOLD: Yeah.
No, this embedded
water question's
a really good
question, and I think
people are thinking
a lot more about that
as you know about food.
You're starting to see a
lot of that publicized more,
you know, it's not
just the animal.
I can tell you my son, Zack,
went vegetarian his freshman
year in college, not because
for animal rights purposes,
but it was strictly
because of water.
So it was pretty interesting.
So because of him, I
gave up beef and pork,
so I gave up meat.
I'm not going vegetarian
right anytime soon,
but I get the water basis
and the embedded water part.
And I'm wearing jeans, you
know, which aren't great either.
So your point is a good one.
I have not heard even the
most extreme situations
where that has occurred.
You know, I mean
obviously you see people,
oh, you don't give
people water unless they
ask for it in a restaurant,
and those sorts of things
we all see.
The same thing for towels
and sheets and all these
are the sorts of
things in hotels,
but I have not seen to
the point of saying,
we're giving you
disposable paper plates
and those sorts of things to
save water within our region.
So it's an interesting
way of thinking of it
because embedded
water is something
that we need to really
appreciate a great deal more.
So all right.
Thank you.
