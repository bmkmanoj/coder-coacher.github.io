hosting this tech talk for ha no sander
he's coming in to talk about some of the
work that he's done with education
robotics and getting kids more involved
in robots and technology ha no
originally went to school at Stanford
and I don't hold that against him even
if it is a second-rate school some of us
went to Berkeley but hannah has actually
been very lucky to be able to combine a
lot of his passions he's passionate
about his kids he's passionate about
education and he's passionate about
technology and robots so he's quite
fortunate to be able to work on all
three so without too much further ado
punim Thank You Charles and thank you
google for having me again this is my
third google Tech Talk I live in
Christchurch New Zealand and I'm a
father of two kids a five-year-old son
and a six-year-old girl and every year I
make it out here and talk about the new
projects I'm up to and this year I'm
very excited about the teapot a
educational robot my 12 blocks visual
software and the curriculum that we're
developing to help schools roll out
robot education classes so why do we
need to education with robots all
computer is he getting smarter deep blue
was already more than 10 years ago and
beat the best chess players in chess and
just recently Watson beat the best
jeopardy players in common questions so
computers are getting smarter and as a
result we people also need to be getting
smarter especially about technology and
how it pertains to computers so tech
education needs a boost specifically
there are four subjects that I like
talking about science technology
engineering and math and these are
technical concepts that have a lot to do
with computers
with the world around us with software
and in order to excel at these you need
a very solid foundation these subjects
can be hard because too abstract
counting vocabulary reading writing
those are much more complete you can
point to an apple and ask a child to
count it but you can't pound you can't
point at a formula you have to learn
that you have to understand it and a lot
of engineers become good engineers by
playing with things by playing with
circuits by playing with robots or by
playing what code and so that's what we
want to do more this is an image that I
think illustrates very strongly that you
have to do something in order to learn
it I've learned how to do pottery and I
didn't learn it from a book I didn't
learn it from a video I learned it by
taking some clay putting it on a wheel
and then feeling how it gradually became
into a pot and people guided me through
it and that's what we're trying to do
with robots now so get people get kids
playing with robots and let them learn
by themselves so a lot of science
technology engineering math is currently
taught by books by blackboards and by
looking at complicated formulas like
this hopefully robots can bridge this
gap between these abstract concepts that
make up the foundation of science
technology engineering and math and
hands-on learning that kids can do by
having a handheld platform that they can
interact with they can play with that
they can call their own and they
customize to make it their own so robots
have been around for a while started 100
years ago where people wrote books about
them build mechanical models of them and
only recently have they really grown to
provide a very rich learning environment
and what I mean by that is that
they have all the capabilities that are
interesting for a wide variety of
different kids some kids like to play
music some kids like to choreographed
dance moves some kids like to build
things and some people like to program
and a robot can suit all those kids and
can provide a good learning environment
for all those kids so there's a lot of
concepts that can be learned from robots
on the science area by looking at
experiments and learning from that
applying that to another experiment
performing measurements there's a lot of
sensors on robots in terms of measuring
proximity in terms of measuring motor
current technology looking at ultrasound
and infrared sensors engineering
understanding center of gravity making
sure the robot doesn't fall over and of
course math so the logic and even simple
things like how many degrees in a square
and how do you make a square how do you
make a circle so this is what I'm
spending a lot of my time on these days
I'm having a bunch of kids play with
some software play with a robot and
being helped by other adults to make
that into a very satisfying experience
for all and what these kids are doing is
that are controlling something typically
a kid six seven ten years old might have
a dog might have a sibling but they
don't have things that they directly
control of course they try to control as
parents but robots are one of a few
things that they can program and then
they can hit a button and watch as a
robot does what they want to do they can
create things Lego is very popular and
robots take that to the next level by
combining motion combining programming
combining it all together so that they
can create very complex things and
customizing so taking a platform that
already provides a lot of function
aldi and adding to that so modifying it
and calling it their own so robots that
are just out there and that the kids can
play with are okay but it's nice when
the kid has ownership and can say yes I
built this robot I added these
components and I build that together so
robots can be used from simple
demonstrations so in physics classes
engineering classes to show concepts
like acceleration and measuring
velocities it can be used in challenges
like line following maze I'll show a
video of a Robocop dance clip later and
competitions so there is a wide variety
of competitions aimed at different
different ages and different
capabilities so why aren't robots in
every school right now well they used to
be very difficult they used to be
difficult for the kids to succeed with
and they are certainly difficult for
teachers to succeed with teachers
typically don't have a lot of time and
energy and money to get started with a
new product and they want something that
works robots also aren't in every school
right now because they're limited and
they used to be limited in functionality
and too expensive so robots used to have
to be soldered together and screwed
together and then you have to program so
to be successful you really need it to
be an expert electronic engineer a
computer scientist a mechanical engineer
in order to put all the pieces together
nowadays robots come in can be
preassembled and the code as I'll show
you in my demos is much more visual and
friendly to the novice programmer there
are a lot of sense or is out there now
and typically they are very inexpensive
and they're much more capable than that
touch sensor that we had many years ago
it was microphones as cameras there's
altra sound infrared proximity and this
makes it much easier to have a much more
engaging experience to take the kids
further and robots used to be a very
expensive primarily in time so in the
amount of time that it took to build
something that was interesting also of
course also in the financial sense they
were expensive and we're hoping to
change that as well so I'm from New
Zealand or I live for now and I have to
show this picture wherever I go and we
are currently rolling out these teapots
and 12 blocks in New Zealand here's a
primary school with Macintosh computers
running 12 blocks and with kids
programming the tpod educational robot
and what they like to do is start simple
but keep it fun all the way through so
i'll do a couple demos with 12 blocks
and with that he bought over here that
shows what a primary school stood and
typically starts with so here is 12
blocks and we can start with a guided
tutorial and the tutorial tells us what
we can do so it guides us to this
process I can have it show me what it
wants to do and then I can even have it
do it for me and so i'll do some of
these steps by having a do it for me and
then at some point i'll get the hang of
what we're supposed to be doing which is
taking these blocks from this library
and moving them over to this work area
and so it's now telling me to move this
weight block from the control section
over here and each one of these blocks
does something so this pause block is
used to pause for a direction and it has
an argument which tells it how long to
pause
so it's this language where it's very
easy for kids to drag on blocks around
from one of each section and then the
blocks engage to each other and then
they have these parameters that define
the behavior of a block so nothing's
hidden everything's accessible for
teachers it's easy to look at a program
and see what that students up to in this
case we want to this little light in the
front we want to flash it red wait for a
second and then flash green so we're
going to change the color to green and
now we need to add one more block which
is the weight block and so this is our
first program and we finished our
tutorial so we can close that and now we
can run this and it'll compile it to a
text language and here is our red and
green blinking light on the robot you
can just make it out there um this is
live so i can keep changing these
parameters so if i want to make it blink
faster i can change the duration of the
weight so now it's linking faster or
slower i can also add some other blocks
to this so we can start a another stack
of blocks and in this one start reading
some of a sensor input so we can use a
repeat loop again and in this case look
at a sound input and so there is read
microphone and we can read that into a
variable so we can say set X to read
microphone so what we're doing here is
we're doing two things in parallel we're
blinking our light and we're reading in
the microphone and this
is loaded back on and now we can look in
the values view and this is now plotting
the value of x over time so there's a
connection from the pc with the editor
and the robot and that connection can be
Bluetooth it can be Wireless or it can
be a USB cable and we now have a time
scale knob so we can look at shorter and
longer periods of time and it graphs
these this value of x in front of us so
if we come clap we can see that the
value of x periodically goes a bit
higher we can use that as an input so we
can switch to slightly more advanced
concepts so 12 lakhs has either 32
blocks at the beginner level 90 blocks
advanced or I'm going to go into expert
mode so now I have a bunch more blocks
um and we can for example use the when
block and now type in a condition in
here so we'll say when x is greater than
500 so now we already have
multi-processing by having two of these
start blocks start to things running at
the same time and we'll have one that
trigger is based on an event so this
event is when the value of x is greater
than 500 x being what was read from the
microphone and to make this a little bit
fun so we're doing leds we're doing
sound and now let's move every time that
x is greater than 500 and we'll run this
okay so so far everything's good we're
still reading xn we're still blinking
LED and we're plotting the value of x
and now when I clap my hands
the value of x goes over 500 and the
robot starts to move so it's a simple
demonstration of what you can do with
these types of blocks and get the kids
interested in something because it's
moving it's blinking lights sounds are
happening of course is many more blocks
so in the control section we have things
like a state machine and a teapot
section we have the wireless and
bluetooth connectivity we have terminal
blocks that send data back and forth we
have sound one of the interesting things
here is this is a synthesized plucking
of a harp like instrument so I'll put
this block in here so this is all these
all just blocks that exist in 12 blocks
and rely on lower level code to get
something done let's go back to the
presentation and let me introduce this
so what we're doing with kids for
competitions is taking these blocks of
moving and lights and sounds and one of
the competition's was the robocup dance
competition where a group of kids 12
kids 5 to 12 years old took these robots
and took this code and then dressed up
robots in costumes and dress themselves
up and took some music choreographed
some dance moves for themselves and for
the robots they had multiple robots and
then the competition was to do something
creative inside a 2 by 2 meter space and
this is the result this is the Robocop
Nationals in Wellington of last
okay so that was a story of a MOA one of
our birds that was extinct in New
Zealand I'm flying around and being
speared by the hunter and then coming
back to life later on and yeah lots of
fun so in the second demo I'll build on
the foundation that we do previously
with some more sophisticated behaviors
so we'll look at more at variables
advanced functions more sensors control
theory and do some fiducial computer
vision as well okay so here was our
program and we can add some functions to
this so I'm the way you use functions is
you can take one of these function
headers and then a function caller gets
made for you and so we have it here and
now we can stick a bunch of blocks we
can stick a bunch of blocks with the in
here and now keep that in there and
these functions can we factor so I can
call this blink and so now the caller
block changes and we can give it some
arguments as well so we can put an
argument p in there and this is how long
will blink for so this 1000 gets passed
into this function and p is now a
argument in here and we can wait for p
and here so that's how we do functions
with this block based approach on and
and of course we can have multiple
functions and keep going so let's run
this one more time in 12 blocks I'm just
to see working so X
updating and the light is still blinking
we can still change the parameters of a
light and when we clap it still moves
and plays a song for advanced
programming we can still stay in here
and do everything we wanted to do in
here or we can combine this with a
traditional text language so 12 lock
supports different architectures like
the parallax propeller chip like the
pickaxe the Lego Mindstorm the Arduino
and in each one of those cases there is
a lower level language and just like a
web page we can take our code and we can
save it and then we can view at the code
we can view the code by click on view
code and here is this lower level
equivalent of what we just typed or what
we just dragged together so here is this
function blink and here is this X is
greater than 500 and in this language
I'm we can then run it so this is just
running that same code but this time in
a as a text language and here is a
different way of visualizing X from the
microphone there's also a logics data
analyzer in here to look at the pins
from the from the chip so we can really
get down to the hardware that were
running us on we can also run a source
code debugger on all this so we can run
this with a debugger let me switch back
and um just um make a little bit simpler
so we'll just
blink one light so we'll do this slide
and we'll just do one item here so what
we're doing here is just setting X to
the value of the microphone and now when
we view this code and when we start the
debugger running on this now we can
place breakpoints and even though this
is running on multiple processors so the
tpod uses a parallax propeller which has
eight cogs so 8 32 bit microprocessors
we can stop one of those at a time so we
currently have X updating here and we
can put a breakpoint in that line and
everything else will keep running on RT
bot except for the processor that's
running this function of updating the X
variable and there's also a profiler
there's also a memory map so there's a
lot of ways of debugging this code once
it's running maybe something not for the
primary age kids but definitely for
upperclassmen and we can keep this
running once we're familiar with the
text language we can make some changes
in an init so here we could say that
instead of repeating forever we're just
going to read the microphone in 100
times and then we'll stop and we can
save this and now when we switch back to
12 blocks the visual way of writing
programs it asks us if we want to reload
it um and first off and and it reloaded
and now it's saying repeat 100
so you can make changes in the visual
metaphor or in the text language and
then switch back and forth between both
of us let's do some demos with what
sensors so we already we know about the
microphone let's switch this back to
just a normal repeat and this time from
the t bot there is also a sensor in the
front that measures the proximity to
something so here's proximity will move
this away and now we can I have to run
one program at a time okay so now we can
set X to the proximity to something in
front of it um and so I'll graph it over
here and now when I move this book you
can see that it's nicely measuring the
proximity to add book um and once we
measure something we can do something
with that information so I'm going to
run a separate stock here and over here
i'll drive the motors of the ki baat and
so we've already seen how we can make it
move a set distance or time and this
will just move a given speed so let's
move it by X and actually we'll move it
by by Z and Z will be some function of
the distance so we know how far away the
book is so now let's set Z so we'll have
a variable set Z to X minus a thousand
we notice that X is about a thousand if
we keep it this far away from the book
and just to be nice to the motors we're
going to restrict it to minus five
hundred to five hundred okay and then
we're going to set the motors to that
okay okay so at first glance not much is
going on but that's because X is already
equal to pretty close to a thousand and
if we look at it sideways I can now
control my robot by moving the book back
and forth in front of it and it's now
trying to keep a set distance away from
the book so it's a very simple program
it's just looking at the proximity to
the book and trying to keep the motors
at a value so that that distance is some
value 12 lakhs does have pit control
blocks and other fancier block so we
could make this even more exact but
that's sort of a first introduction to
feedback loops for a lot of students lot
of kids and obviously with the same type
of control we can stay on a black line
to do line following or we can do more
advanced control logic see if we want to
control it remotely we can do that from
within 12 blocks as well so 12 blocks
has interface blocks and just like we
hit the sea x and z on the side over
here we can put a joystick block out
it's a very old school joystick so now
we're combining computer science
programming blocks with user interface
blocks and I can couple this user
interface
into the firmware that's now running on
the robot so now instead of setting my
motor to a variable that's dependent on
the proximity we can just set the motors
I lost it um we can set the motors to
the value n which is the x position here
so let's um so I'll set it to the y
position ok so here's why and why and
now when I press run nothing's moving
and I still get the position information
but now when I move the joystick if I i
have to multiply this by 10 in order to
get into the range that the motors react
to so we go let's try this again so why
is currently 0 and my robot is parked
but now when I move this um I can remote
control the robot just by moving us back
and forth this is me doing it manually
so by interacting with this joystick of
course we can plug in different
peripherals and one of the most
interesting is computer vision and
that's where people sit in front of a
computer and control of remotely so what
we can do is we can use a fiducial
engine here is reactivision and couple
that with 12 blocks so now instead of
feeding it with the joystick here i'm
going to get my fiducial engine there we
go
see
see
okay one more try
I saw I'll describe this one so i have a
fiducial engine here and it's now
tracking the pattern that i have on this
little stick it's always writing which
pattern it's recognizing and inside of
12 blocks there is a block which is I'm
working right now which is supposed to
give me the XY and angle of this
fiducial pattern and I can then take
those values and use them to control the
robot but I'll move on to the wrestler
presentation and so this next video is
of some students using line following to
find a cocaine and push that outside of
a maze so they're also using the tpod
program than 12 blocks with the sensors
to look for a black line and then at the
end look for a cocaine and push that out
ok so all these programs are very simple
they're take blocks and move them
together but they can be very complex so
they can go up to a lunar lander shown
over here or beyond and with t-bot and
12 blocks we're now developing a
curriculum that starts from primary
school kids so getting them interested
and inspired by robots that they can
hold that they can attach LEGO pieces
mindstorm pizzas and vex screws as well
and then at the high school level doing
more things with feedback and sensors
and at the university level looking at
how text languages and robots can do
something together 12 blocks is a nice
common language so there are now a
couple people that are translating
libraries and books written for other
languages
and then from 12 our get different
processors and architectures so that the
same code runs on them as well and the
results Rick ulam so from the University
of Canterbury postdoc roads as some for
Coulomb that maps specific will bring it
up that map specific achievements and
standards to exercises that are done
with a robot so that the students are
fulfilling requirements set by the state
and still actively engaged in robotics
so this curriculum this one over here is
a robot that is looking at a black and
white pattern and by doing this exercise
kids are learning about error control
coding and parody checks and using
variables and arrays and following
patterns as well and the goal of this is
to make it very easy for a typical
teacher to first read about the concepts
that the students will be involved with
and then guide them through activities
one block at a time until everything's
there and so we're making it easy for
students to learn and for teachers to
teach and at the principal level taking
this technology and making it so that
it's a easy decision okay so besides the
teapot and the 12 blocks I'm also
working on view port which is the
debugging tool that I showed you earlier
for text based languages on the prop
scope which is a analog USB oscilloscope
I'm sold by parallax so it's also
targeted at the educational space where
with a book that takes kids through
simple DC electronics to AC electronic
sine waves op amps with a use the
soulless cope I've also written a book
and starting on another one about
advanced robots and I'm working on some
project like the America's Cup race so
taking some sensors and logic to improve
the ships for racing any questions so
the design philosophy of this language
is sort of to take basic and replace the
statement syntax with graphical blocks
while keeping the expression syntax is
text what motivates that cut off do
students really find it harder to place
braces than they do parentheses and so
visual languages have been around for a
while okay I I think people have ok I
will Peter question and sort of question
is about the cutoff between texts
languages and visual languages so the
nice thing about a visual language is
that students don't have to learn the
language they don't have to learn what
were to type in in order to get
something done they don't need to learn
the semantics of whether to use a curly
brace a comma indentation and they don't
need to learn about the syntax they
mainly need to learn about the what
blocks are available and if they like a
block then using that block and putting
it somewhere some languages are iconic
based where they put fancy icons in
these boxes and then once you have more
than five or six it becomes pretty
difficult to understand what each one
means I used text in there and the text
describes what they're trying to do
the whole concept with the blocks is
that it's not just representing it's not
just replacing one line of code but it's
putting everything that you need to get
something accomplished so importing
additional libraries allocating space
variables so all of that is done behind
the scenes in each one of them surely
but to the contrary in your what was it
when statement I think you wrote x
greater than 50 and X was not a
graphical object greater than was not a
graphical object and I was wondering why
you drove this design half way rather
than building the entire language
recording to a single organizing
principle okay um so okay the question
was that I 12 blocks some things are
represented in visual blocks and some
things are not some things are kept in
text and I did that very much on purpose
there are other languages like scratch
out there where everything is kept as a
visual item and that's good for people
starting out where people can drag
together a plus block and then another
an equal block and less than block and
so you're putting everything together
with these blocks I made the decision to
leave conditions and expressions as text
because that makes it easy for people
that have played with it for a little
bit to type in whatever they want so
it's very freeform at that stage and
there is and what people what kids
typically do is that they start out not
needing to type in any conditionals and
expressions but by the time they get to
the point where they need that they're
it n confident enough to use some text
they're not at that point able to type
in all the different
language elements to make something move
but they are certainly able to say well
here is X and here is greater than or
I'm going to multiply by 2 or I'm going
to do some math and then leave it up to
the language to do it for them so it's a
hybrid approach that still keeps the
language syntax and semantics of the
major language elements in a block world
but it gives the people that are a
little bit more comfortable which they
will be at the point that they're doing
conditions and expressions and letting
them just type something instead of
having to drag 20 blocks just to add and
multiply a couple of things together yep
um kind of a long similar lines how you
chose the language design it seems to be
very procedural have a bias towards sort
of a procedural view although I like
what you're doing with kind of threads
and events but I'm wondering you could
also kind of trick people into learning
about data structures or other kind of
programming concepts for example I don't
see much in the way of data structures
what's the thinking beyond that and
going to be a kind of great platform to
accidentally teach people even even more
about programming and so on I wasn't
able to show all of 12 blocks a question
was about 12 lakhs being procedural and
if there was more to it so certainly
I've shown a little bit that there are
multiple that multi-processing is easy
that doing a vent base is easy that
there are there's a whole way of dealing
with state machines so those are also
first level objects and 12 lox and every
one of those worksheets is a is its own
object and you can import other objects
as well and
run code in there so you can take code
and let it run in its own space with its
own variables and build libraries from
that go from there is language in fact
event-based from your example I couldn't
tell whether when suspense or whether it
was simply iterating forever I miss a
first is the language actually
event-based or is the when statement
actually busy waiting so the nice thing
about the parallax propeller is that it
has eight processors running at all
times and so what 12 blocks is doing is
allocating one of those processors to
manage the events and letting the other
cogs the other processors deal with
other parts of a program so when I had
the lights blinking and another part of
a program looking for a microphone there
were multiple processors running that
code so yes one processor is busy
waiting I'm and is polling at all times
but other ones are truly running on
their own they do share memory through a
global memory last year I showed
