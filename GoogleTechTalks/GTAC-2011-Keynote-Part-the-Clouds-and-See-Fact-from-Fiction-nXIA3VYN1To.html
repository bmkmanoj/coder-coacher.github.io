he started at Microsoft with many many
many decades ago but only at Google this
year so he and I have overlapped at both
of those places and for the first six
months of his google career he reported
to me and then you know the whole test
thing and here we are he is the in
charge of all of our cloud testing but
he doesn't call his group testing he
calls his group fundamentals and so
there's far more to this guy and far
more to his group than testing he's
about reliability he's about performance
he's about security he's about privacy
he's about doing things right from the
beginning our cloud platforms are a lot
deeper I think when you think of Google
Cloud you probably think of App Engine
app engines part of his domain there's a
lot of other stuff that is in the
process of being released and is
forthcoming in the Google cloud
offerings and antoni is going to talk
about the depth and breadth of all of
that stuff so welcome Tony Vella
great hang on this is an accident it's
an accident yeah you have to love a guy
who hired you to accompany to transform
TAS and then becomes a developer lead so
thanks James in terms of those those
cloud pins i actually think they're like
the Yeti because i have yet to see a
cloud pin myself so if you actually does
anybody actually have 10 so they
actually do exist I did hear somebody
that flies an airplane and she is in
this room seems to have some buttons so
if you can figure out who that is you
might track her down so before I got in
one of the things I wanted to do is say
yeah thanks a lot for all the great
conversations that you know we've all
had the last couple days and in
particular you know a shout out of avec
from yo Finn calm and geo from Mozilla
it was interesting after Alberto's talk
yesterday we're all like yeah it's
tested what does it really mean and the
more we talked we sort of came on this
whole idea of tests as risk managers and
its really interesting is we've all done
our job today the way we've kind of
manage risk is we go find bugs but
there's a lot more you can do to really
drive product innovation and and really
add a lot of value and part of that is
things like security and performance
like James talked about it can be
engaging you know don't you know
communities on how to use your tools and
so I kind of leave that as a thought to
you that hey maybe our job really isn't
testers but our job is really risk
mitigators or risk managers and
explaining to people why or why not to
ship our product and if that helps you
think about your job differently I hope
it does so with that I want to dive into
part two clouds and see fact from
fiction so what I want you to get out of
this this talk today really don't want
you to get three things number one I
want you to get understanding of what
the cloud is there are discussions
yesterday but I want to give you some of
the history and some foundation so that
it can really show up you know your
knowledge base that you have number two
I really want to talk about cloud tests
and I say test cubed because there's
really three dimensions
to you know cloud test and we'll
definitely cover that and then the third
thing is I really just wanted the boot
Alberto and this grim reaper off this
stage because while test might be dead I
actually I'm going to go through lots of
examples of ways you can transform
yourselves into the cloud and actually
how I believe test is only beginning I
think the whole idea of you know really
driving new innovation we're just at the
beginning of this and so with that you
know I wanted to kick the Grim Reaper
off and income in you know as an angel
of kind of vision so so I'm going to
cover a couple topics here in the
context of helping you get the three
things I want you to get I'm going to go
to the beginning like where did the
cloud start and how did we get to where
we are I'm going to definitely go
through some common fact in fiction
which will be pretty exciting and then
cover you know a little bit more detail
in the cloud testing domain and then
talk about the path forward and give
lots and lots of ideas on things that
you might do in fact you can take any of
these ideas and run with them so the
beginning so when did the cloud really
start the cloud the idea of the cloud
actually was first thought of by John
McCarthy who rest in peace died on
Tuesday he was the father of Lisp and
and a I in fact he's one of the fellows
if you got here and look at the plaques
outside the room here he's on one of the
plaques very phenomenal guy and in back
in nineteen sixty one he made this claim
that you know one day computing would be
a utility and it's pretty interesting
because at the time there were only six
thousand computers when he said this in
the world and this notion of time
sharing was there but only the elite
could get access to machines and so when
you think about a utility means
everybody can get access and so he saw a
time when we would get there however it
wasn't until really 1997 and I
apologized to the name ramnath k
chellappa xalapa that actually came by
and tried to give a definition the cloud
computing and really tried to define it
as a paradigm you know where the
boundaries of computing will be more
economic than technical and so that was
really like the
first incarnation of the term cloud
computing in fact he's coined with you
know you know he's he's a kind of
determined as coining that term of cloud
computing and then I didn't put on the
slide here and I should have you know
another thing that happened is in 2006
amazon web services launched and some
see that is kind of a you know a mark in
the in the path to computing which is
really interesting which if you think
2006 was only five years ago which gives
you an idea of just how early we are
into this whole thing so what is cloud
computing and like how do we
differentiate it there's a couple
properties here the first one is is it's
nobody cares where the resources that
you're using our and I use the term
resource loosely but it's like computing
and databases and this is only possible
because we have really powerful networks
today and so that's that was kind of the
first thing we needed networks to for
cloud computing that really happen the
second thing is utility you pay for what
you use and so if you look at the
different resources there's different
models you can pay eight cents an hour
you can pay you know five dollars a
month but really what you're doing is
you're only paying for your piece of the
computer and sort of gone are the days
where you would spend a lot of money put
a machine in your office and you have a
five-thousand-dollar machine which you
use maybe a couple hours a week the
other part is its elastic you can sort
of grow up or grow down your use of the
cloud and so if I have one user I'm only
using a little bit of the cloud and if I
have a hundred thousand users your
applications tend to scale up
automatically to meet that demand which
is pretty cool it has to be programmable
so all of the cloud platforms out there
have api is that you can get to and the
programmability part is a really
important piece of the you know the
finding cloud computing itself I mean
you get things like an access control
model and something called multi-tenancy
where you're actually kind of colocated
with other you know other businesses
that might be running with you where you
might have like a bank of america and a
Wells Fargo running in the same system
and you can imagine from a test you know
perspective could be very interesting
how do you make sure you don't have data
leakage across these boundaries and you
know what are the complexities that are
there if you want to go deeper down into
you know somewhere the cloud computing
terms and definitions
actually threw out there is a expo
called cloud computing Expo and in fact
there's another one that's going to
happen in this area sometime soon called
up so you can look for those and
actually goody / in the cloud so with
that let me put some context around
cloud because I really want you
understand what's available and where
things sit and in fact we heard about
technologies from multiple layers
yesterday so sort of in the beginning
there was this whole notion of
infrastructure as a service and so this
is what I is is and this is really the
idea that was out there of hey we have
all these computing resources in our
data center we aren't ourselves not
totally utilizing them how do we get
these out so others can use these
resources and we can kind of reduce the
cost that we have and so you see things
like Amazon ec2 came out where you can
buy you know virtual machines in their
data centers you have RDS or Microsoft
Azure you know there's there's a lot of
players in this this tier of
infrastructure as a service I mean you
have also Google here where we have
things like Google Cloud storage you can
store you know five terabyte files in
the cloud and and kind of push them up
and suck them down from anywhere in the
world which is super fast and cool and
also just recently we put out into a you
know early preview trust a test or
invitation only but you can request an
invitation for the Google sequel service
which is part of App Engine it puts a
relational store behind App Engine which
was something we had been missing for a
while and so at this bottom piece of
infrastructure as a service you really
have like compute storage and networking
and these are kind of maximal complexity
but maximum flexibility at this layer
you have a lot of management headaches
that you have to worry about so if you
have an ec2 instance you have to patch
the operating system that's running
inside your virtual machine you have to
keep it up-to-date you have to manage
all of your software in this stack and
so while you have maximum flexibility
you can literally do anything you also
have this maximal complexity it tends to
be the very easiest point to sort of
enter into the cloud r you're like oh I
have a database locally running in my
you know my enterprise and I just want
to put it into something like you know
Google sequel service and so I can just
move my database over and run it there
are for sure you can do that but really
that's only just the sort of the
beginning of the power of the cloud is
this infrastructure as a service layer
so then you move up into tier and you
hit this layer which is called platform
as a service and the platform as a
service does require some rethinking
your applications and it does require
rewriting some of your applications but
what you get in the platform as a
service layer is you get automatic you
know load balancing you don't have to
program this yourself you get automatic
scale up or scale down so did anybody
use the google doodle the guitar google
doodle out there that was an app engine
app and what was cool about that is the
developers that wrote that could focus
on writing that app and not have to
worry about like oh well what if 5,000
people use it or four million people use
this app they say okay here's my app it
goes into Google App Engine hey App
Engine you control like you know scaling
up or scaling down the usage of my
application so you can see there's a lot
of power there you have less flexibility
because you can't do anything you want I
mean you have a lot of flexibility with
languages like Java and Python that are
hosted in this tier but you don't you
can't do anything you want you can't
really run C programs today perhaps one
day but not today and so you also have
other other players in the space like
amazon elastic beanstalk or salesforce
com Heroku they're both Java hosting
platforms as well with similar you know
benefits but there are definitely
differences too and you should go look
into those and as we move up the tier a
little bit further we move into the
whole domain of software's of service
and then the software as a service
domain you have the least flexibility
but you get rapid application
development because somebody already
comes to you and says here's an ERP
database just build your widgets around
it and you can use this database and
that's some of what like salesforce.com
does and for google you have sets of
things you can build around like you
have the Maps API that you can use or we
have the Google prediction API where you
can do you know linear regression
analysis or clustering and you basically
say here's the data set tell me like
interesting things about my data and the
prediction API will tell you though
or like google translate API is and so
you can take these components and build
on top of them so you have the
programmability aspect but you don't
have a huge amount of flexibility like
you can't control the algorithm that we
use for say translate or in like the big
query which is a data mining capability
it's an OLTP analysis tool where you can
take terabytes of data and query it
using a sequel syntax in like a second
so you can't really control how we do
that but you can program what it's going
to do for you which is very cool so as
you look at the cloud all of the tiers
sort of fall upwards and the last thing
that was one of the things that was
mentioned yesterday was testing as a
service and that sort of falls up in
this software as a service domain where
you could ask it to do something on your
behalf so when you look at the cloud you
know the the bottom I is is maximal
flexibility but maximal complexity and
as you move up you get less flexibility
but sort of maximal you know
programmability and so you get a lot of
you know very interesting capabilities
there if you want it more in depth talk
on cloud computing I put a link in the
deck you can check it out later it was a
whole 75-minute talk so there's a lot
more to this particular topic than then
I'll be able to cover here so the
question that is okay hey we have all
these capabilities but why now you know
in fact in the 90s we had actually tried
to do something called application
hosting where we would take your
application and we'd run it off site for
you and what was interesting is that
kind of failed there was some success in
that domain but it largely wasn't
adopted and and so some of the concerns
were well hey i'm putting my data
somewhere else it's out of my data
center hey you're running my application
how am I sure you have the licenses that
you're supposed to have and so it didn't
work and so the question that comes up
now is well why does the cloud work now
because our I'm still putting my data
somewhere else you know what's changed
here a couple things have changed first
the cost is much much lower than it was
in the past largely to the ubiquity of
virtualization and both in the Intel and
AMD platforms that made things super
cheap but actually more importantly than
virtualization is economics you know the
whole recession is really helped cloud
computing a lot
because no gone are the days when you
could go ask for a budget of 200
thousand dollars to get equipment to go
run you know tests on now you can go pay
eight cents a minute or whatever or
eight cents an hour and get you know
almost a similar type capability so
economics have really driven the
adoption of cloud computing and so where
is cloud computing going and well you
can't really see this this graph just
know that it's like a you know today
it's a pretty you know pretty healthy
sized market around 20 some-odd billion
and the projections go all the way up to
240 billion so what you're going to see
is more of your corporations are going
to adopt the cloud to deploy
applications and so you're going to have
to know how to test on these you're
going to have to know how to use these
for testing and so if this adoption
really does happen I believe it will
happen very similarly you know now it's
a time to really brush up on your skills
and understand what's there so with that
I'm going to transition into some common
fact in fiction and so with that here's
some of the topics i'm going to cover
things like hey the internet and the
cloud are the same you know cloud
computing locks me in actually that's a
common you know topic and i invite you
at the end of the talk to ask your other
tough questions about cloud computing
and i'll do my best to answer them so
let's go through each of these the first
the cloud and the internet are
synonymous I mean hey everybody loves a
buzzword and so all you have to do is
put cloud on there eek loud pcloud
iCloud whatever cloud and suddenly like
things sell but you know the cloud and
the internet or not are not the same you
know the cloud is really the you know
cloud computing is really about enabling
you to build applications enabling you
to do deployments and what's interesting
is yes a lot of the world our customers
are using the cloud and to them it's
just the internet but there are
differences one example here I used of
you know the adoption of the cloud is we
have over 200,000 active applications a
week an app engine running which is a
phenomenal number and like 1.5 billion
page views a day and so you can just see
this kind of growth happening this is
happening for just about everybody
that's working in this space so the
cloud is not the internet and and the
you know the internet contains the cloud
but they are different and
and it's all about the aspects I talked
about before about elasticity and
programmability number two you don't
have to worry about this ass recovery
did anybody hear this like hey like
throw your stuff in the cloud and like
life is good anybody hear this yeah we
all heard this right this is great in
fact it's so easy to get resources in
the cloud it's actually seductive it's
like whoa i just got a database I didn't
install anything I just like like put my
credit card in and suddenly I have this
you know capability I didn't have before
but with that comes an interesting
challenge which is the way we build
applications we sort of forgot some
things we should think about and in fact
this year we've seen a couple challenges
where you know companies have had you
know big down times where they've taken
down you know multiple corporations that
were running things in the cloud and it
was largely the way these applications
were architected it well you know we all
know that things are going to happen you
know data centers will catch on fire
hurricanes will brush in and so forth
and so as testers we have to think about
our our corporations really ready for
this and you know are we multi you know
homing or our technology are we putting
it so that it runs in the east coast in
Europe or the East Coast and the west
coast and are we making sure that our
applications are redundant or at least
have the ability to to come up quickly
in a different location and one company
that was interesting that sort of
survived some of the outages this year
was a company called smugmug and I'd
love to maybe next year we could
convince them to come in and talk about
how they built their applications and
you know while a lot of the other sites
like Reddit you heard that mentioned
yesterday we're kind of down in this
period smugmug was one that actually
stayed up and it was because they
remembered this whole tenant of hey even
though the cloud is cool and easy and
fast and fluid and powerful you still
have to plan for you know disasters and
that means doing good engineering and
really thinking about it that's a lot of
the infrastructure as a service layer if
you go to the platform as a service
layer you actually don't have to worry
about tenancy is you know like location
or as much or disaster recovery but
definitely read the fine print of of you
know the technologies you're using and
make sure that they are as resilient as
you want you know fiction number three I
don't have to worry about location this
is a really interesting one
which is when you go and move your
applications in the cloud you have to
plan on where it's going to land
typically you say Oh run me in you know
Taiwan or run me in you know the east
coast or run me in Europe and what's
interesting about this is if you deploy
your application and say you know the
west coast and your customers are all in
South Africa there's a 500 millisecond
latency you know ping time roughly 200
to 500 milliseconds to get a packet of
data from the west coast to South Africa
and back and to put this in perspective
say you how to database and you're
fetching a row at a time out of it and
you have 10,000 rows it'll take you one
point three hours to download this data
if your same customer or another
customer is now running you know in
California for example running the disk
West Coast database they'll fetch that
same data in less than 10 seconds so you
have to think about location as you're
building your applications it's really
you can't you can't ignore it geography
is also interesting from another
perspective so one is the performance
aspect but another's privacy where you
know privacy laws matter all around the
world where you have your data so if you
have your data in the US it's subject to
US laws if you have your data in Europe
it's subject to us or to European laws
and there's actually been this thing
where world governments have started to
say hey if you're going to contain our
citizens data it must be within our
country and so Australia was one of
these that put out this whole kind of
specification for anybody building
things for the Australian Government
about how it must be in Australia which
is really interesting so that you know
you definitely still have to think about
location here I also threw in things
like you know natural disasters so if
there's a hurricane coming to the east
coast and all of your applications are
running on the east coast maybe it's
time to migrate we've all seen that so
some other things that you have to think
about so I say the conversion of capex
top X this is a really fancy way of
saying the cloud allows you to sort of
convert money up front to money you pay
later and so you know the way we would
do testing or sort of gather equipment
for testing in the past as we go spend a
bunch of money create our labs and we go
do our testing
Labs would cost a lot of you know tens
the hundreds of thousands of dollars and
that was capex that was upfront money
but we don't have those budgets anymore
so how do we still do the testing we
need we need like 20 load generator
machines how can we get that we need you
know something to you know some place to
store our test data it so that's the
whole notion of op x and so op x is like
hey i'm going to pay you for exactly
what i use that utility computing so the
eight cents an hour or the five bucks a
month for the service and so you kind of
pay as you use it what's interesting
here about op x looks very cool like oh
wow it's only eight cents an hour but
it's a lot like your credit card bills
where you know you go out you have a
latte every month or every day and at
the end of the month you look at your
billing like whoa how did I spend five
thousand dollars i only spent a dollar
at a time so you do have to watch that
when you go into the cloud in terms of
you know cost and cost structure in some
corporations you know you get charged
for egress and ingress and lots of other
things most corporations now don't
charge you to put their data in the
cloud because we want you to put it in
there and you know you sort of have to
pay to get it out good marketing
strategy isn't that Wow so I like it
which kind of leads you into the next
sort of fiction hey the cloud locks me
in um yeah absolutely it does I don't
think there's any you know there it's
not a bad thing you're getting something
right like hey I'm able to go in and put
my applications into an ec2 instance or
I'm able to host my applications and an
app engine and yes you made an
investment and there is some lock in but
you have to look at the the other part
of this which is one of the things
google has done is we actually don't
want to lock in your data and in fact
we've actually gone to extensive lengths
to make sure you can get your data out
yeah we want you to stay with us we want
you to stay with us because we're the
best not not because you're stuck with
us that's not a that's not a strategy
we're interested in so if you look at
something like data liberation org every
API at google tells you how to get the
data out may not be super simple all the
time but at least there's a way to do it
and so when you look at where you're
going to deploy your testing and and
where your business is hosting their
applications really look into are you
locked in or not it's an interesting
thing to focus on
so all clouds are equal you know it's
it's you know everything sort of looks
the same it's over the wire everybody
has an API a JSON or a REST API or
whatever you know REST API or like a
soap or XML whatever it is but they're
not all created equally everybody has
their different s la's everybody has
their guarantees of uptime and so this
is something to look into you know the
all clouds are not equal but there is
data that you can get out such as here
you know for App Engine we tell you
things about how much up time if we had
and so you can go look at this data and
say wow this service looks really
reliable to me okay this is something I
can count on others do the same thing I
just use its example because it's a
Google one but yeah you can take a look
at this which is you know hey there are
different capabilities there's different
underlining technology like if you go to
Azure it's a Microsoft based technology
if you go to you know Amazon or Google
or other places it's very likely you
know some sort of Linux you know based
technology and so you can kind of choose
what you want to do and then the last
sort of fiction is testing is easy but I
really suspect i wasn't going to trick
anybody with this one and it definitely
is not one slide so what I'm going to do
is go into a bit more about testing and
testability in the cloud in fact I'm
going to talk about what I call testing
cubed so what is testing cubed testing
cubes really falls into three buckets
the first to everybody in this room will
be faced with I suspect within the next
couple of months or year the last one
not many people will face but it will
give you some insight into the
challenges of say building a cloud
infrastructure so there are three parts
of the cloud there's testing in the
cloud this is your applications and how
do I test it in the cloud there's
testing with the cloud like the services
we saw yesterday like the testing as a
service type services and then there's
testing the cloud like things like App
Engine or the google sequel service so
let's start with testing in the cloud it
actually kind of varies by provider and
what's interesting is testing in the
cloud is actually quite challenging it
was cool to see the the example
yesterday around page layout and like
how you could
if the applications rendering the way
you want largely because you know we
have the cloud which is sort of the back
end but you have to access the cloud to
something so it's going to be tablets
it's going to be phones it's going to be
laptops and it's going to have you know
your access your entry points going to
be different for everybody mm-hmm and so
the challenges there are copious I can't
say anybody solved it in fact you saw
some solving it yesterday so it's a
wide-open problem for you to go solve we
have multiple browsers we have multiple
form factors makes testing very exciting
so some things like testing the cloud
like if you're at the infrastructure as
a service layer it's pretty much party
as normal you have j unit you have pi
unit eggplant selenium you can drive
things kind of like you've always done
it it's not very different some things
that do get different are like
performance analysis if you are running
you know like an ec2 virtual machine
clocks lie so if you used to look at
things like oh I'm using twenty five
percent CPU and that's good those
numbers are totally useless when you go
to the cloud what you really need to do
is kind of pivot your thinking and
actually look at rates like how many
operations per second do I get because
that's something that is going to be
immutable from platform to platform
where as percentages just just don't
matter so there's definitely you know
deep and complex issues in testing
performance security is important
because something is different right
suddenly you've taken your really
valuable data and applications and put
them somewhere else and so the security
model is something you have to go
evaluate do i want all users to have the
data specific users and it's not that
much different than what you have today
but you have one additional layer which
is you have access control and
authentication to the control of the
resources which is different than
control to your applications and so yeah
now actually have something extra you
have to look at in the cloud at the
platform as a service layer this is
where things get really tricky and
you're kind of subject to what the
vendors provide because things like j
unit aren't going to work for you
anymore they may in some contexts like
you can run it locally for example if
you build an app engine app you can run
it locally and everything works but then
you push it to the cloud and does it
still work that's a good question right
and how do you test that and it's hard
you know some of the state of the
right there today is printf none awesome
you get email like you got to crash you
get an email back so there's definitely
some work that can be done in that space
of how to do better testing you know in
these any services but one cool thing
about platform-as-a-service testing is
you have a new tool you've never had
before which is stage deployment you can
have your current application in your
next application and you can be
delivering them both and you can say a
lot ninety percent of all the users that
visit my site to get my current one and
ten percent to get the new one and you
can look for failure modes and you can
use your users to find your bugs right
they may not be happy but you can say
hey these are the power users if you see
them coming in serve them this new
application and get their feedback on it
so you have some new powerful testing
tools that you might not have explored
in the past you'll also get a lot of
monitoring so we heard that tenant
yesterday monitoring monitoring
monitoring and it's really true so we
don't have to find all the bugs anymore
but what we can do is we can go look at
data analysis and this is an example
from App Engine where we're looking at
requests per second to our application
and if there are spikes you know we want
to say hey life is really good and
people are using our application but
maybe those spikes are indicative of
sudden failures and people are just
rapidly trying to get to the site
because it suddenly failed and so you
can definitely use very detailed
monitoring and analysis to look into
into failures in the cloud and so think
monitoring so kind of moving on software
as a service so this is more testing in
the cloud you know salesforce.com does a
really good job here in fact they have
this whole framework around you can how
you can write unit tests in their cloud
and they you know have goals around code
coverage and you know they have this
thing around seventy percent for you to
move code into production and I actually
think they're doing a really good job on
this front in terms of testability in
the cloud here was one example from
their site where they're actually
showing you a dashboard of how you could
go in and say hey my applications out
there run unit tests and so as like
Salesforce iterates on their platform
they can run your tests to ensure that
they don't break themselves or you which
is a very cool thing so there's more
work that can also be done in this space
so let's switch from testing in the
cloud to testing we're testing you know
your application the cloud to testing
with the cloud and so testing with the
cloud actually has a nice coin term now
testing as a service and this is where
you can go use other infrastructure to
validate your your site and it was
really interesting because we talked
yesterday about why wouldn't it be cool
to have this security you know doohickey
application or even that jscript
coverage application we saw yesterday
why isn't that just a cloud application
why can't they just go somewhere and say
hey you know go run code coverage on my
app for me those are the innovations
that are going to happen and testing as
a service and there are lots of good
starts here but totally wide open to
everybody in this room to go innovate
here some things that are out there
today or like Google PageSpeed where you
can go measure your site it'll say hey
we notice you have like 5 image is if
you put them all together and like sort
of dice them up you could get better
performance and it has ideas about
compression and you get a lot of great
data out of it so it's a very useful
service skytop if you haven't used them
this is a dev test environment in the
cloud you can run virtual machines and
they give you extra tools to do analysis
on your applications and then there's
others cloud testing you know Gomez will
monitor your service from all over the
world and so you can see how that person
in South Africa is experiencing your
application and so there's lots of great
you know testing as a service tools that
are there but more can be done I mean
largely you're going to focus in three
areas and so you'll hear me always say
you know the three big or reliability
performance and security these aren't
new there are also lots of other
interesting and important tenants around
testability like internationalization
and accessibility and those are super
important but the things that I've seen
in my career that make or break an
application are all around reliability
security and performance and so we need
more testing as a service services here
so my shout out to you is go build the
best on that you can build and share it
because there's a lot that we could do
there are some other things you can do
in the cloud if you want to use the
cloud to test your applications and say
you're building a file system like
extent 2 or X 10 4 and you had this
question around reliability like how
reliable is e
you know extent to vs x10 for which
one's better actually I don't know the
answer but I threw out a you know an
experiment that could be run where you
could actually go out to something like
Amazon ec2 boot up 500 machines by the
way whoever had 500 machines that you
could just boot up instantly go kind of
start your tests using fio or something
like that and kill all the VMS and look
at how much data corruption has happened
so there's new ways you can actually go
test like you have amazing amount of
resources like load generation it's a
thing as a pass like you can generate
load because you can get access for very
little money to hundreds or thousands of
machines or App Engine apps or whatever
to go really do things for you so I just
want to give you some ideas of what you
could do here in the cloud so a little
bit more about testing in the cloud you
know we talked about crowdsourcing and
using people to solve problems but now
that machines are so cheap and
ubiquitous I sort of throw it out there
like what Oh crowds of machines look
like in testing it's interesting
question how could we use things like
the Google prediction API to do
regression like is my test failing or
not like if I've written a really good
test could I use something like the
prediction API to say okay hey these are
my stimulus my input here's the lines of
code that have changed here the
components that been impacted here the
failure rates i'm saying is there
actually an issue or not and have the
prediction API give you an answer saying
yes or no there isn't likely a failure
here so there are ways you could use the
cloud that are very interesting and then
there's bigquery where you could do data
mining so we talked about monitoring
monitoring monitoring one of the
challenges with that is you have
terabytes of data that come out and logs
and how do you analyze this data and so
actually google has something that's out
there it's been out kind of in test mode
for the last year called bigquery where
you could put your data set in the
google and run queries over top of it
it's unstructured data so it doesn't
have to go into a database and so their
capabilities you can definitely leverage
out there so testing the cloud so now
I'm shifting so we talked about you know
testing your applications in the cloud
and then we talked about testing with
the cloud and now I'm going to talk a
little bit about like how do you build a
cloud
and what are some of the things that are
done and actually building these types
of infrastructures first and foremost
what's interesting is there are no
agreed-upon benchmarks today for the
cloud so nobody really knows how to
measure is one cloud better than another
cloud so in the database industry we had
the TPC benchmark so like T PCC and you
could say you know sequel server
Microsoft sequel server is better than
Oracle or you could get these
comparisons that doesn't really exist in
the cloud but there are some beginnings
so one cloud benchmark that's out there
today is something called cloud stone
this is done by berkeley and it's
interesting what their they were doing
here where they're looking at something
like okay i have a front end you know
load balancing i have a set of my
applications running in a database and
so they're trying to get at the core of
the lamp stack most of the world is
built on you know you have your code
running you have your database and you
have your visualization layer which is
your your XML or you know HTML output I
mean so this benchmark is really trying
to target that where it's like I have my
front end I have my application in my
database and you could implement
something like this in any of the tears
of the cloud there's another there's a
company out there called cloud harmony
and they've done some reports in fact
they've actually gone out and measured
all the clouds around io networking mmm
CPU memory efficiency and they tell you
they try to give you data like which
cloud is faster I don't put any of the
data here because it's tears but you can
go out and look at it and so if you're
trying to make decisions of which cloud
to use that could be a possible resource
and then in terms of another possible
benchmark there's a start called cloud
cmp cloud compare yeah we're really
creative cmp compare um we're we're
actually trying to compare clouds but
what's interesting is nobody's agreed on
any of these so if any of you love a big
challenge and want to like make it
impact in the cloud you know industry go
create something that we can all agree
on in terms of how we might benchmark
one cloud against another I actually
think it's something important that we
need but one thing you can also find our
interesting reports there was a report
that I linked here around
reliability like whose cloud is more
reliable or not and it's very old and
data data so it probably doesn't apply
anymore but it gives you some ideas of
questions to ask about reliability in
the cloud so what are some of the things
Google does to test our cloud well we
pretty much do all of the things I've
mentioned so far you know we run
whatever benchmarks we can find we run
you know different types of scaling
tests and loading to load tests we use
some of the services we've talked about
to dry big load or do monitoring and so
we do quite a bit we spent a lot of time
on fuzzing we want to make sure that if
you're trusting your data and your
applications of Google that it's very
secure you know fuzzing is kind of a you
know as much an art as it is a science
so we run all different types of fuzzies
you like I know this and others that are
out there and then performance you know
this is where we run benchmarks like oh
we have you know see you know Google
sequel service are there tpc see like
benchmarks out there that we can run and
look at and analyze how things are going
and so from a Google perspective we're
going to use the you know the best of
what we can find and the best of what we
can build to test the cloud and if you
guys have suggestions and after this
talk around how we could better do this
I'd love to hear them too so with that
what's the path forward here so a lot
has been done and a lot of you know in
the cloud so far and there are a lot of
opportunities still wide open some
things I really think we need is an
industry for cloud is I think we need to
have more of these benchmarks we talked
about I think we need to have more
research in fact I've seen some
suggestions of you know testing or
testing as a service research but it
seems very limited right now so if you
have any impact on that it would be
great to see more research around what
does it really mean to test in the cloud
I think we're only beginning to
understand some of these questions and
then look at you know new ways to use
these technologies in ways that haven't
even thought of like you know if
machines are ubiquitous why don't we use
more machines in the past we try to be
efficient and use less of resources what
if they're so cheap could we use more
and solve the problems better than we
did in the past so with that some things
I had learned in the earlier talks were
like flames and sharks for cool so
found a flaming shark to end the talk
and so go forth and multiply in the
cloud and be happy thank you
well done Tony okay we have time for
questions so raise your hand wait for
for the mic runners do we have somebody
Bonnie's back again and ask question
into the mic so that the stenographers
get it and we get it on video as well
well the way I know I speak super fast I
saw everything coming up amazingly well
so thank you thank you thank you Tony
for amazing talk so when you are
speaking about testing in the cloud you
mentioned monitoring is an essential
part of it so you said screenshot I saw
it it contained mostly like CPU
networking kind of monitoring so mostly
hardware level heavy of it like an air
face obviously have you ever tried using
like user level monitoring sort of like
some business metrics that actually
affect your application like if I work
to use to test whether i would probably
monitor amount of tweets postage amount
which view the amount of like three pics
posted stuff like that do you think it's
useful to monitor things like that is it
actually relevant irrelevant so the
general sorts yeah absolutely so what's
really interesting about testing is
they're tears of testing and the panacea
is the end user customer which is why
monitoring is so important and so do i
think it's important to understand what
the customer is going to do and how
they're going to do it and use the
applications or the services as they're
going to use it absolutely in fact
that's where i always start the first
thing i do is figure out okay what are
the end-to-end scenarios that we're
looking at and how do we do you know how
are we going to test those and then you
can kind of break it down into smaller
and smaller sets of tests all the way
down to what are called like micro
benchmarks where you're you know you're
saying hey I see a lot of like IO and
cpu and memory test my opinion is those
tests tend to lie they can be Canaries
in the coal mine which is if you have
sets of unit tests you can really see
insight into what may happen in the
system but I'm sure everybody here has
seen it like I have all my unit tests
they all run great well my application
fails and you've seen the opposite which
is your application runs great but all
your unit
sir are you know or your applications
failing and year and the tests are good
and so you can see these these
dichotomies where they go back and forth
so I don't think you can test it any
kind of one layer and testing I actually
think you need to go from end-user
customer code if you can get it you know
scenarios if you have to build them all
the way down to unit tests so absolutely
we do all of it okay thank you to an
injured you talk my name is Leonard from
version one arm so I was just curious
what your thoughts are in terms of
performance testing and the cloud
because of so many factors of variance
you know from internet usage from ma you
know bandwidth and all that how much
reliability do you think you can get
with performance testing in the club yet
so my expertise actually is performance
I love all of the fundamentals I call
them but performances particular this
question could not have been more teed
up for you he is the perfect guy
blogspot com is Tony vellum so yeah I've
run multiple performance teams and and
it is quite challenging so we used to
have tools before the cloud like AMD
code analysts you could run on your
machine and do analysis you could use
like intel vtune you could use you know
microsoft if you're working on a
Microsoft stack you could use visual
studio you know the f1 profiler to do
performance profiling we would do things
like looking at cashing performance and
I think all those things still matter
but they're really hard to do in the
cloud and as you're alluding to and as I
in a kind of mention clocks lie in the
cloud and so the way you have to do
testing in the cloud is you actually
have to do it from the end-user
perspective because the end-users clock
likely isn't going to be wrong and so as
you look to test you have to definitely
you know do the constructions as we're
talking before around
hey if I am with my application is
heavily database dependent I should make
sure that all the crud operations work
like the create read update delete so
I'm going to do lots of insert and
delete testing I'm going to make sure
that checkpoints in the database don't
impact my running application and so
it's hard to get to the data but if you
stick to things like rate counters
you'll do well but my honest opinion in
fact on ax I don't know she's out here
today was asking me yesterday about
performance and I said honestly all
these other benchmarks don't matter like
in fact I solve most performance
problems without ever looking at the
code what I do is I sit down with a set
of you know developers and architects I
say let's walk through the system and we
starts at going through and we're like
oh here's our application and and we
want like a hundred thousand users to be
able to access it and they're all going
to do updates into a database and oh
yeah in the back end database is going
to have one disk okay well discs can
only do about four hundred or two
hundred transactions a second I ops are
pretty limited and so if you're telling
me you want a hundred thousand of this
and and like the capabilities of the
hardware only give you 100 yeah you you
can't do it in the cloud which you'll
notice though a lot of the SLA tell you
what the level of expected performance
is supposed to be and so you can build
up your use case as you're going to
design reviews and it's those design
reviews where you then go and and create
a set of you know test or end user
scenarios that everybody agrees on and
once everybody agrees on it now you have
carte blanc to go open all the bugs you
want driving performance is really hard
if you don't have everybody agreeing
because everyone's like yeah it's slow
okay but if everybody says hey we're
going to sign up to make sure it's not
slow then you now have their permission
to go drive it in fact I tell proof
engineers the best book out there is how
to win friends and influence people by
dale carnegie if you've never read this
book it is your secret weapon to to
driving testing and in particular
performance
thanks for a great talk if we think
about high-level services software as a
service if you you can measure things
like how many API calls you can service
in a second you effectively have insight
into what is important for the user as
you go down into the stack is you get to
the level of infrastructure as a service
you lose the insight as a service
provider into what's important for the
user how do you close the loop between
providing your service and hearing back
from the customer and hearing back about
what they really care about yeah that's
a that's a really deep and thoughtful
question a lot of it comes with sitting
with your customers asking for feedback
some of it comes from understanding
behavior around what customers do for
example I'll give you some metrics if
you're building like a mobile phone
application or a desktop application for
example if you have one second of
non-responsive application a customer
knows it they instantly know it within
five seconds they're going to go take
action they're going to click the X to
close it they're going to go in the app
manager and close that they're going to
do something in the cloud you have a
little bit more flexibility people are
generally willing to wait up to 15
seconds but if you go beyond 30 seconds
of Vaughn responsiveness in the clouds
people will never come back and so it's
these usability studies that you can use
to understand some of this data but
you're right in the in the lower tiers
you don't get any the powerful
monitoring that you get in the top tiers
which is why you know while I is is you
know infrastructure as a service is a
great entry point into the cloud I
really think it's the platform as a
service layer and the infrastructure
service layer is where we all ought to
be thinking about building our
applications I think you know this
maximum flexibility of maximal
complexity you lose too much you spend
too much time kind of rebuilding which
you already get in these other layers so
I think you bring up some great points
but I think it all comes from talking to
customers looking at monitoring data and
just understanding behavioral
characteristics and doing usability
studies
thanks for the talk my name is Brad I
work for Sky tap it appeared on your
slides a few time there so I wanted to
mention with performance testing we deal
with this a lot with our customers and a
couple things to keep in mind is people
tend to focus on on loss of performance
or slow performance another thing that
actually tends to bite you or bite
customers for us is that you can
actually get better performance than you
typically expect so our disks in our
system for example might be backed by a
sand and you're going to get twice the
disc throughput that you might get on a
on a typical server so I wanted to just
raise that as an awareness factor and
the other thing is that is that how so I
know how things work in our cloud but
how have you seen so what we found is
that a be testing over the short term
like I run a test now and then I run and
make a change and run it again in five
minutes that's actually reliable like
there's no you know there's no dramatic
changes happening in the short term it's
over the long term that's like I did it
today and I did it in a week from now
that you really lose all sort of context
of how how performance was you know
changing over time like how have you
seen that when you've tested other
places is it reliable in the short term
yeah what's interesting is generally
that is reliable in the short term but
there's something cyclical that happens
on the internet which is like you know
during the week the internet you know
during the day has heavy usage and you
can see this and things like you know
how many you know queries to google com
you get or how many application
activations and then suddenly you'll get
these periods on weekends where you'll
move from one technology to another I
mean you'll see drops right and so one
of the things that you contend with is
you go into the cloud is kind of the
internet weather and it will impact your
testing which is why you have to look at
long-term trends there's things in
performance like if you look at the
tests back to back that's great but you
can see degradation zou verte I'm it's
called death by a thousand cuts squared
today it looks good tomorrow it's only
off by like a thousandth of a percent
and every day you lose this thousands
but by a month or two later you realize
you've lost ten percent of your total
application performance and so I think
it comes from analyzing the trends and
knowing that things can be cyclical and
so that's my best suggestion is having
very reliable and robust
in fact on my blog I write about how to
create these reliable and robust tests
and then understanding that things can
impact the internet over time and look
at trends and those things will help
insulate you but and thank you by the
way for the comment about skytop you're
absolutely right your your application
might have run slow hosted locally and
suddenly you get amazing performance
when it goes to something like you know
ec2 or Google App Engine so it's
actually pretty awesome that that
happens but it can actually break your
application at the same time because you
weren't expecting a race condition to
happen hi so you talked about different
laws in different countries but the
providers also have a service level
agreement so is that something part of
the testing that needs to figure out
that it's failed over in the East Coast
but now the data is suddenly coming up
from a different location in the world
if you're using the app app engine as an
example do have you had any experience
with such kind of cases yeah so for
applications applications tend to be
more resilient to location and where
they're placed versus the data that the
applications access so in the end of the
day it's the the data itself you know
for example pretty much everybody has
what's called a CD and a content
delivery network and so when you access
a file it actually gets geocache local
to where it's getting access so you get
better performance it's like the first
time you access that might be slow but
it kind of speeds up over time I do
think it is the responsibility of the
developers and the tests are is to
understand the service level agreements
of the providers and to understand okay
the provider says we have this much up
time and in fact if you look there are
some really great articles written by
you know amazon saying hey you should
think about how you do disaster recovery
and here's how you ought to write your
applications and think about these
things in the future and so yeah it is
our responsibility I don't think we can
get away from it and so it is
understanding local laws and it is
understanding you know the agreements
and sometimes they even have competing
laws in fact I was talking to two Hugh
laughs night where he is saying Telek
O's have this problem where they have
customer data in one country but the
customer and the
as a citizen of that country but there
look they're living in another country
and one law says you must delete this
user's data within 30 days and the other
country says you must delete it you must
retain it for 60 days and so now they're
on in conflict and so it suddenly
becomes a business decision of you know
you're going to violate somebody's law
how do you handle that and that is way
out of my preview I you know don't even
ask you those questions go talk to your
 but they exist yeah yeah way
above my pay grade you're good at
breaking laws all by yourself Tony any
more questions all right thank old much
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
