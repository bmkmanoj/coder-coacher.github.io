stron schedule I'm a UI designer Herr
Kobel and I'm gonna welcome ed ro and
Rob Christensen from Adobe they're gonna
be speaking on Adobe AIR and it's a
great technology and I hope that you
guys get a lot out of it thanks John
I'm Rob Christensen this is Eadie I am
we understand that is it that there's a
celebrity chef here today at Google and
we really appreciate everyone you
decided to choose us over the celebrity
chef so thanks for coming appreciate it
you said there's a celebrity chef here
yeah yeah stay here please don't go so
we'd like to keep this pretty informal
so if you have questions at any time
just feel free to fire them out and
we'll repeat the questions and and
answer them I'm one of the product
managers on air and it runs engineering
and John had said so what what is air
how many people here have heard about
air today or if okay so that's good how
many people have built on it okay
that's pretty good so the way that we
define Adobe AIR is that it's a cross
operating system runtime that allows
developers to leverage their existing
skills with web technologies like flash
HTML Ajax JavaScript to build rich
Internet applications for the desktop so
what exactly does that mean well what
we're saying is that the one thing that
we it was really kind of an impetus for
this project is that we noticed an
incredible amount of innovation
happening on the internet for the last
15 years and the user experience is
getting better and better so much to the
point that it seemed like desktops
weren't really keeping up so we were
pretty pretty excited about allowing web
developers to take a lot of their
existing code and use their existing
tools to build desktop applications and
our design is our intention is really to
complement existing websites we're not
necessarily suggesting that air is
designed to to displace websites or
anything like that this is really
designed to extend the user experience
outside of the web a website to to the
desktop so we'll be showing some
examples a little bit later on in fact
most of our presentation will be showing
what some of the early adopters of air
have been building including some of our
partners and just
interesting developers like yourselves
who are just out there wanting to push
the limits so if that said I'm gonna
transition this over to Ed he's gonna
talk a little bit about just kind of the
architecture pretty briefly and we're
going to move on to talking again about
some demos right so as Rob said this is
a sort of a simple picture of the
technology stack important thing to know
about err as as like Rob said it's
totally independent of the web browser
so it runs external to the browser as a
desktop runtime but air itself is really
behind the scenes so you know the star
of the show is an application not the
runtime so the yeah the application sit
on top of the runtime the runtime is
just behind the scenes you know taking
care of business just like in the
browser you know the users not thinking
about an HTML engine or a flash engine
or or realplayer engine or any of these
other things they're just thinking about
the content and the experience that
they're getting so we're with err we're
trying to extend you know the developers
ability to bring those experiences to
the desktop but not actually to put any
of our own chrome or any of our our own
experience on top of it so just in brief
the operating system is on the bottom of
this stack we're gonna ship air 100
early next year both on Mac and on
Windows we're also currently working on
a Linux version and that will come a bit
later so you know our goal to bring it
across operating systems runtime sits on
top of that provides a bunch of
functionality and api's to the
applications that sit on top of that the
applications can be built primarily in
flash based technologies so that might
use Adobe's flex and ActionScript
languages or the flash authoring product
or they can built be built using HTML
and JavaScript technologies and all your
standard Ajax frameworks and so forth
you can pick either of these things you
can write a pure HTML and JavaScript app
if you want you can write a flash or
flex based application or you can mix
mix them and match them so you can take
an HTML application and use flash in it
just like you see in the browser today
or you could take a you know primarily
flex based application and use HTML in
it very seamlessly and we've merged
these very seamlessly together both in
the imaging model and in the script D
model and I think we'll have some
examples of both of these cases in our
demos you can also make use of PDF
documents within these air applications
similar to what you can do in the web
browser where you can display a PDF
document in there a brief tour of some
of the capabilities and then Rob is
going to show a bunch of them to you
because air is fundamentally based on
web technologies including the Flash
Player there's very rich support for
multimedia s-- o your typical vector
animations h.264 video as well as h.263
you have full screen hardware
accelerated video so it's it's a great
engine for media playback for both an
audio and video standpoint we've added
the ability for these applications to
access the local disk so these are
outside the browser they're desktop
applications they can read and write the
local file system they also have an
embedded SQLite database to work with so
you can you know use SQL to store your
information locally the applications are
multi window applications as you would
expect so same application multiple
windows and briefly the HTML engine with
what we're using is the WebKit engine
which is inside Safari and is also the
engine that you guys are now using an
Android Open Source engine based on HTML
in the beginning and that is the engine
that's inside air so you have you know
the same sort of HTML capabilities that
you'd expect to have in a modern web
environment just like any desktop
application you need to have access to
Desktop Services so these applications
can integrate with drag and drop so you
drag and drop between other applications
like say Excel or the desktop you have
access to the local clipboard we've also
added some other integration
capabilities that aren't quite as common
where we've put in the capability to
detect Network transitions so if I yank
the network cable the application can
get an event and adapt to that or if I
put the cable back-end same sort of
thing I can also integrate with the
system's notification mechanisms so in
Microsoft Windows down on the lower
right you've got the system tray and you
can see icons down there and pop-ups and
so forth the applications can wear
with that they can also do things like
on Mac bounce the doc are we showing any
of the install sequence we can again we
the up so the applications get installed
via an install sequence generally that
it's triggered by the browser so you're
at some website it says hey do you want
to get a desktop app of this you click
on it you go through some screens that
say hey security this and that and then
the application winds up being installed
our job to take care of that the
developer doesn't have to worry about it
so so like everything else in air
cross-platform sort of comes first so
you write the app once it's based on
HTML or flash or whatever you package it
up and essentially a zip file and then
the runtime itself takes care of getting
that deployed onto an operating system
and integrated in the ways that the
operating systems want for an app so on
Windows it gets into the control panel
for example so you can uninstall it from
there so at the end of the day you have
something that feels like a regular
desktop app even though it's completely
cross-platform and built with web
technology
yeah so these are built with web
technologies and you just use the same
tools that you use with web technologies
so Adobe has a variety of these tools
but by no means does anybody restricted
to those so Adobe has flexed the flash
authoring product in Dreamweaver which
target respectively flash slash flex
flash and HTML there's also great
support in a third-party IDE that's
called aptana which is a really cool
ajax ide that has built in air support
at this point we're also giving out a
free SDK with command-line tools so it
can be integrated into build
environments or into any other
environment that you want to use so if
someone wants to use VI or notepad or
Emacs or whatever it might be it's
completely possible to write air
applications just using that tool chain
this is a quick picture of some of the
authoring support that we've built into
our tools flex builder 3 which will also
be shipping early next year has some
great support for integrated debugging
source level debugging with breakpoints
and everything we've just added a very
cool feature which is a profiler letting
you both check out CPU and memory usage
with pretty advanced memory dumping
capabilities seeing what your object
where your objects are going turns out
once you start building real apps you
start really needing to worry about that
we've also extended both Dreamweaver and
flash cs3 to have built-in support for
air debugging in the case of flash
authoring and code hinting and creating
the applications and all this can be
downloaded from labs Adobe comm and
preview versions with that I will turn
it back to you rob just just wanted to
ask if there any questions at this point
we're kind of moving pretty quickly yeah
sorry actually bring the mic so my
question was kind of about the model you
guys are using to build applications I
mean I think it's interesting that you
have so for example you're talking about
profiling in the tool support but I
guess the model is pretty much that you
have a web server or at the back end
doing most of the computational heavy
lifting for whatever the application is
and sort of air is providing a front-end
what if I wanted to say kind of use air
as a replacement for a traditional
desktop GUI but for a desktop
application so you certainly could have
a server use you know do most of the
heavy lifting on the back end with the
server but that's not our assumption I
mean on the client you have both the
JavaScript engine and the tamron virtual
machine that adobe recently open sourced
to Mozilla which is a JIT 'add scripting
engine so it's substantially faster than
your typical JavaScript engine so you
can sort of choose how you want to put
the computation load whether it be all
on the client all on the server or what
we see most steps which is doing a
combination of both I think we had
another question up front
I just wanted to know how it integrates
with like native code like if you wanted
to write a component that used OpenGL or
something and incorporate it into it
using the doing the rest of the GUI
using air so there is not any capability
for loading native dll's if that's what
you're asking about what would you
imagine doing with that doing some
computation locally or something that
was intensive that couldn't be done in
the scripting language fast enough so
your concern would be about performance
yeah I'd be performance or maybe some
native api's that I needed access that
didn't have access to okay yeah not not
doing that right now
you're a Greek reader essentially so
yeah the the question here is about
native code and our support for that and
at least for now we're 1.0 is very much
focused on being cross-platform that's
our goal for now and and the future is
uncertain we're certainly interested in
hearing your feedback incorporating it
into our future product but for the
moment we want to make sure that the
developer that builds an air application
targeting Windows and Mac for version 1
when the Linux version becomes available
it just works that's that's what we're
after with air right now so just from a
high level what are the main advantages
of building an arab versus just a pure
web apps and some writing most of it in
all these things that work on the web
well a lot of the system capabilities
that Ed spoke to not available in a web
browser for one will show quite a few
demos for in fact that's kind of what
we're moving into so I might suggest
that we come back to that particular
question and hopefully you'll see based
on some of the capabilities that some of
our our customers are taking advantage
of right now how they're using it but a
lot of it has to do with with branding
being able to really control
pixel-perfect precision over over the
design and interaction models some of
that is available obviously in the
browser but there are certain things
that you can do in an operating system
level outside of the browser that are
also quite interesting being able to
display to system notifications things
of that sort
GG's top 5 list I mean it's hard for me
I mean that list that that Edie had
presented those two slides I mean all of
those are compelling for different types
of applications it really depends on
what you're building there are some
applications that you'll see in a moment
where nobody has taken advantage of
certain API as whereas other ones if
you're building a very rich visually
interesting application then probably
the h.264 video and the AAC audio are
going to be very compelling to you so
just out of curiosity what do you what
do you do here at Google
maybe we can API is okay so well we have
a great example I think of a eBay's
application they have an application
that bill call the ebay desktop it takes
advantage of all of their API s and I'll
show that in a minute so okay so with
that said I'm gonna switch over and it's
kind of air has been out now in the
public view beginning earlier this year
and in October first we had our first
beta and so I'm sorry our second beta
we've had three public releases so far
and that's attracted quite a bit of
interest and so some of the customers
that we're working with right now pretty
closely with to build out their building
air applications include the ones that
you see here on this list will show a
few samples of some of these many of
these are available to download on the
internet right now - and which is pretty
exciting and that we haven't quite hit
one out yet and yet people are already
releasing software and in fact the first
application that I'm going to show you
I'm curious have people seen the Google
Google Analytics demo looks like some
people have so I'll touch on that very
briefly just to kind of touch on it for
those people I haven't seen it
so basically I haven't shown the
installation sequence here but this
installs very much like a native desktop
application you launch it on Windows you
launch it from the Start menu and on the
Mac you would find it in the
Applications folder or wherever the
developers specified they wanted to
specify provide it this particular
application was built not not by Google
but a third-party developer who was very
interested in providing a sort of
different experience for looking at the
analytics functionality that Google
provides some of the things that are
kind of interesting about it are its
ability to interact with other data
types so you can basically export
reports out to PDF and Excel files this
application is designed to run offline
so you don't have to be maybe your your
on the plane and you want to do a quick
check and see how your Google Analytics
is doing you can you can do that but
quite easily kind of tilt this over here
so for example here let me go ahead and
show an example of the different views
this app was built in flex it's taking
advantage of some of the karting
components available in Flex but they've
been skinned and customized a bit so for
example this is kind of a nice view here
as well siege
looks like the maps not coming up
I collect them I think my network
connection might be little gonna let off
of it but anyways you could still see
here in a second that it integrates with
the Google mapping API is to display the
locations of visitors which is pretty
nice and you can zoom in as you might
expect with the you know Google Google
Maps I'm going to take this this app
here and no sorry there we go so up here
at the top you can see for example I can
click on a PDF button and I click on it
it'll basically generate a view of that
particular report when I double-click on
it it will launch in an acrobat and go
fullscreen here you can see the very
quickly again it's it's very responsive
taking advantage of some ActionScript
libraries available for doing PDF
generation and you can see I have a nice
clean report so maybe I wanted to hand
this off or forward it to a colleague
I'm going to switch over to the the Mac
and show a few more demos here any
questions about this particular
application No
so the the next time I'm gonna show is
let me plug in something well rubs
plugging in that you'll notice now that
we're on the Mac he's just launching
these apps out of the dock you know
they're just there isn't some special
launcher or shell or anything like that
the user they're just regular old apps
so yeah air applications can be designed
to run offline this particular app
actually they require that your online
to watch these videos this is an
application built by AOL AOL has a
enormous collection of artists that they
work with through their time warner
label and one thing that they're
experimenting with is well how can they
share a lot of the content that they're
producing with with those are interested
in artists and so right what you see
here is a listing of the top 100 artists
that they they want to showcase for this
particular particular time this app a
couple things to kind of notice about it
is it's been heavily customized if you
look at just even though it's running on
the Mac it doesn't quite look like a Mac
window and it wouldn't look like that it
would look exactly the same on on a
window Windows machine as well you can
see there's a slight drop shadow effect
it's very subtle but the designer may
wanted to have a drop shadow so that was
very easy for them to do the minimize
button the close button have all been
customized and they're basically just
accessing air when doing ap is to be
able to modify the application state so
as for an example here I've already
added a few that are sort of some of my
favorites I'll click on one here this is
a maroon 5 a couple things that are kind
of interesting here one of them is that
as edit said air support supports
fullscreen video this particular video
is not you taking advantage of the new
beta 3 features which which isn't out
yet but will support h.264 in our next
public release so but it what's nice
about it is that you can still see that
there's an interface here I can decide
if I want to to maybe high the interface
focus on the video
the audio little I can move the mouse
back over the UI slides back out
everything goes up to the designer for
how they wanted to create this
experience that's a good point if you
haven't made use of the flash API is
that much video is essentially a
first-class citizen so it's not like
it's just stuff to the front of the
monitor like you often see in video
frameworks it's you know completely
integrated into the imaging model so
having those controls on top of it or
partially outfit to it it's it's simple
it's just you know standard drawing
stack stuff that's not any sort of
portable compositing that you have to do
specialist you could easily imagine AOL
who they provide api's for their Instant
Messenger integrating some of those
capabilities and maybe building a
version of this application that has
additional collaborative capabilities I
hit escape I bounced back out they added
another interesting feature which is
basically sliding this over is kind of a
widget on the left side so maybe I want
to go about my work and you know
actually browse the web or do whatever
that's you know we think about it is
basically taking flash and flex in HTML
to the desktop will show some example
applications as well of apps built using
HTML and JavaScript so the next
application we mentioned eBay Desktop
eBay has I don't know thousands of API
is that they've introduced for their
developers and they're actually taking
advantage of their own API is to create
a rich Internet application for the
desktop and again eBay cares a lot about
their brands so you'll notice the the
whole color scheme the way that the
window the edges of the window it seems
like the eBay logo kind of is just front
and center and pops out a little bit
it's all been been customized by their
designers so I can go in here and I as
you might expect I could search for an
item I have existing items that I have
already been watching so for example I
missed out on the porch but it looks
like this interesting Tesla coil thing
that I found last night by accident I
was actually looking for a Tesla vehicle
but Amanda put this thing instead but
you can see here that I've zoomed in now
and I'm looking at this particular item
it's very interactive so I'm sliding
through and looking at the images I can
go and I can get additional information
on the seller so again it's just calling
out to all those api's that that eBay
makes available I can find out more
information whether or not I trust this
person it's a slightly more interesting
experience than the browser it works
offline as well which is which is also
quite interesting this particular app
right now gonna show the HTML oh yeah
sure yeah you want to speak to that so
something interesting to point out here
is this application is making use of
both flex flesh fleshed flex and flash
HTML
everything this actually the most of
this application is written in flex it's
not for a sec Rob you scroll back up in
fact this whole panel we're seeing here
is flex this sort of structured view of
the data from the site and the photo RIF
ler but if you could scroll it down a
little bit Rob yeah right here starts
HTML and unfortunately in this case it's
not very interesting
HTML and the Oilers do not need too many
images but yeah there you go so this is
H this is the HTML form eBay this sort
of unstructured HTML that is with this
item listing and you can't tell the
dividing line if I don't tell you
because you know essentially the HTML
region is just here again just like
video is really a first-class citizen in
the flash display model when you've got
HTML in flash HTML becomes a first-class
citizen in the display model so it can
be composited with the flash content and
scrolled and everything else so this is
currently available on eBay's website
which is pretty exciting for us because
obviously we want people building and
they're pushing the limits right now
yeah it's actually real live data we
have accidentally bought stuff before
during demos and odd things have showed
up at Adobe so Rob don't get on the car
yeah and there's additional things that
can expense that it's a little too
expensive about fifty thousand you can
add annotations there's a lot of
additional things that you might want to
do in a desktop environment that maybe
you wouldn't think to do in a on a web
page those are those notes restored
locally so that I can access them
offline so we'll keep moving here one
other thing to point about out about the
eBay application as well it's it's not
in this version they certainly intend to
have it have notifications where on the
Mac it might bounce the dock icon and
give you a growly sort of notification
you know you just got outbid or
something and in Windows have something
in the system tray that pops up and says
hey you just want an auction that sort
of thing so they're they're interested
in sort of doing some stuff like that
that you would not see in a browser
application
so another application is called
fine-tuned desktop and fine-tuned as a
website it's kind of a social social
website where you can basically define
the types of music that you're
interested in and then the site makes
recommendations based on the artists
that you've already indicated that you
like the this this application was
already originally built using flash or
maybe been flex actually I don't not
positive but it will say flash and
what's interesting about it is that it
shows integration with an online service
so I'm actually logged in right now when
I first launched this app I had to do a
login it went out and and authenticated
and then took advantage of the local
encrypted store in error which is a way
of preserving protecting login
credentials for example so now that I'm
logged in it's already extracted
information about my music interests
it's also inspected my iTunes library so
something unique again desktop can't
really do in a browser but and it'll
make suggestions based on the artists
that I already have so I'll select an
artist here I hit play one of the
motivators for fine tune was that even
though this player was available inside
of a web page it's not always people
don't always want to have an extra web
browser open they don't think of that
necessarily as a media player wouldn't
be nice just to have this other app that
kind of sits around and I can launch it
because it really is more of a music
player and then necessarily a website so
I've got music dirty
so you can hear music comes on maybe I
decide I don't I don't like this
particular song loop try to go forward
maybe connection issues so here's
another artist maybe I decide I like
that you can see one thing we didn't
really talk about much it's just really
the performance users these are very
fast applications I can launch multiple
at the same time and they'll feel very
native something that Rob just touched
on it's worth drilling into a little bit
is that you know because it's using HTML
it's using flash using Flex the kind of
stuff that you're running in a web page
and in fact these guys had a web version
of something that looks almost exactly
like this well before they had an air
version it was way easier for them to
get the desktop version working than if
they'd said okay I want a desktop
version now I got to go learn C++ or
dotnet or something like that they said
oh okay I can stick with my existing
tools I guarantee that that
visualization up the top of the the
flippin album covers was not something
they rewrote they already had it on the
site and they said okay cool we can
reuse it in the desktop app so it
becomes really easy to reuse your UI
elements between a desktop app and a
browser-based app it's quite likely that
95% of the code that used to build this
app is just the same code they're using
on their website and they're just the
extra code is to take advantage of the
air api s and then add additional
capabilities for the desktop like
searching itunes for instance so another
example of an application this
particular app was built with a a ajax
framework called XJS it's basically an
RSS reader it's called fresh what you'll
notice about it is it it feels pretty
rich it it the skinning of the app it
feels like a native desktop application
to some degree you can add feeds you can
work offline it writes that to the
sequel like database went to go offline
it has preview so I'm basically taking
advantage of our web browser
capabilities here so I can save you in
tabs rendering the actual web page here
if I wanted to see the real site not
necessarily the feed yeah
I think the key point of this
application is that it is a pure HTML
Javascript application we've shown you
some flash and flex apps we've shown you
some integrated apps this app has no
flash or flex at all it's it's pure HTML
Javascript it's using as Rob said the
XJS Ajax framework and if we cracked it
open and showed it to you you'd see you
know HTML files and J's files and pings
and that sort of thing make up the
entirety of the application so an
another application this one's available
for download this was built by an Adobe
employee and designed by another Adobe
employee sort of a designer developer
type of application the idea with this
application is it's it's kind of a
executive-level dashboard designed to
for a whoever is in charge of sales per
se for example to determine how much
revenue they're anticipating for the
next quarter so the way that that's done
is they're thinking about opportunities
the size of those opportunities how much
revenue they represent also the
probability that one of those deals will
come through so you'll see here is I
move around this particular opportunity
is called the Malibu project it's
supposed to bring in 700,000 I actually
don't think that's going to be happen
I'm gonna reduce the probability you can
see the probability is changing here and
the tooltip and the projected revenue up
here is also declining as well so when
maybe the chief financial officer the
head of sales has to give an accurate
estimate to to shareholders or for the
accounting purposes they have a more
accurate number so moving ahead here
there's different views this is really
designed just to show kind of an
executive style dashboard in a way and
it may be a bit like the Google
Analytics application so a listing of
accounts this is all sample data I can
drill down into a particular account get
additional information
it's very rich UI maybe I want to see
exactly the relationships between
different executives and who my contacts
are in case I need to call them and kind
of push them a little bit make that
probability go up on the the deal is
gonna happen this quarter it's a really
nice application
and again it's this particular app is
built in flex primarily has really nice
search capabilities too so if I type in
Adobe for example here you see that kind
of has spotlight style search
capabilities which which I kind of I
really like oops so I'll close out this
application show another media player
this is one that Adobe is working on and
also available for download on our
website it's a little different than the
previous application in that this is
really about providing a way for you to
personalize what you want to watch and
the way that's done is that different
broadcasters will provide RSS feeds that
describe not only the content and the
video clips that they that are that they
want to share but also branding
information about how they want this
particular player to look so it's
customized to the to to reflect their
brand there's an example of that I'll
move into a show it's very subtle here
PBS decided in this particular case that
they Oh in fact I don't even know that
you can see it then we find a better one
here but there's a slight PBS logo in
the background let's find one that's a
little bit more obvious let's try this
so here I think you can see a little bit
better but you can see for example
there's a logo up here there's kind of
this faded out transparent image in the
background that they've decided to
customize broadcasters obviously like
this because they can kind of instill
more of their brand into the user
experience but they also don't
necessarily have to worry about all the
the maintenance of the player itself
which is very time consuming so if I go
in I'll move back to the wired show cuz
I'm I enjoy this one so you can see here
that the here's the video as you would
expect again it's not showing h.264
video that's something that will be
coming soon so if the video quality
looks a little it's actually not too bad
here it looks reasonably well these
files can be downloaded to the local
machine it's really up to whoever is
sharing the files to decide on how they
want to distribute their content
one of the other things that's nice
about this particular app is I done a
nice job even though it's it can be kind
of difficult to navigate through an app
or there's different levels of content
different sections but they're using
this nice sort of breadcrumb UI up here
so I always know where I am I can move
back the subtle effects that you saw the
way the UI is kind of shifting around
kind of indicate where I am where I'm at
am i moving forward in the experience
I'm moving backwards our XD team at
Adobe spent a lot of time working on
this application and it's actually
getting better and better it's a
slightly older older build let's see so
one that I thought I also like here it's
called air talker it's a very I don't
know if you've seen this one
edie actually this might be kind of
interesting but this was built by one
person who lives in I believe it's
Singapore he's like in his early 20s he
loves just a loves flash looked at air
we had a contest to basically get as
many people to build as many interesting
applications as possible for our last
beta and so this is what's something
that he's submitted I've already
configured my account here but if
anybody's used something like me bow
before where you can log in to a single
site and basically have multiple you
know you can connect into your Yahoo
your Google your you know whatever
system that you like and so that's
basically what he's built here so I can
see now that I have some friends online
and so I can see who was offline Dave
he's also integrated with Flickr which
is pretty pretty cool so right now I
could type in a search maybe I wanted to
look at Adobe AIR so here I can see some
in fact pretty cool our new logos
already showing up that's interesting we
just released this logo a few days ago
so I click on it and getting a nice
preview of that image maybe I want to
save it locally view in the browser I
don't know why I'd want to do that but I
can close it down huh it shows nice
integration not only with instant
messaging technology technologies but
also day
services with storage of images and then
also of course I can see the images that
I've taken because I logged I logged in
and authenticated and gave it permission
to display the images so here's a trip
that I took earlier in the year to
Finland and it was extremely cold but
very beautiful city so again this is
just what one person built in a very
short period of time and there that they
have their own website for you can
download it and I believe it's just air
talker calm also incidentally that
Google Analytics application was also
built by an individual as well so it's
pretty we're pretty amazed at what
people are pulling off right now with
you know not large teams another
application that's that's pretty pretty
original probably one of the more clever
applications we've seen it's called
snippet and basically what it allows you
to do is create your own little widgets
based off of existing web pages so show
an example here maybe I want to go to
grab the latest I don't know
and click here expands out to a browser
maybe I want to go to well cnn.com
you can see when I load the web page it
has this little frame here and I can
move it around its rendered the web page
in the background I'm gonna I always
want to know what the latest news is on
CNN and sure I could subscribe to an RSS
feed but I just I just like seeing the
headlines I want to be able to click on
it have it launched into a browser so I
define the area I go ahead and I create
my widget and there you have it so now
it's always there it'll update I can I
can tell it the interval that I wanted
to refresh so maybe every 10 minutes
maybe it's you know every hour it's
really up to me to customize Rob is that
sort of UI that's dancing around is that
flash or flex pay store this app is I'm
99% sure it's flash but I haven't spoken
see there's substantial use of HTML but
then there's also
some of that chrome is being done in
flesh yeah so again that was just one
developer working on that since we've
still got a fair amount of time I we
could open it up for some questions or I
can keep showing additional demos of
people people are interested are there
questions maybe we can take a a skiff
you good flesh has 90 percent of the
browser's installed in the world
so enough as for plugins who this air
stuff are you going to be starting from
scratch again with the install base a
great question so one thing that adobe
in and Macromedia which of course no
longer existed and it used to run and
operate the Flash Player excel at or
distribution of software so PDF is also
heavily penetrated there something on
the order of 300 million PDFs out on the
web
Flash Player it takes about nine nine to
ten months now to do a full upgrade of
98% of the population to a new version
of the player so we're looking at
different ways we we we tend to think
that content really great killer
applications are going to drive adoption
and we haven't shown the experience
maybe I should take a quick second and
just kind of show what the experience
would look like for installing a new
application I have the runtime already
installed so you won't be able to see
that see if you can find that HTML
Twitter app you know the one I mean
right
Twitter HTML
yes best
actually I think that's just a story
about him so we're looking for another
app that's a pure HTML app this in this
case our Twitter client it was a fellow
out in the development community did and
we'll show the install experience using
that hopefully he's got it set up to do
it under projects
okay yeah this is a great example you
want to talk through this one sure so
you know a bunch of stuff about his page
but the install badge here the clickable
UI here is what's going to kick off the
whole experience so frog will go ahead
and click that
this is install experience that saying
hey do you want to save this you know
essentially installer do you want to run
it we're gonna run it this six this all
this UI is being provided by the air
runtime now it's saying hey in this case
he's not used the code signing to sign
his app if he had it would be able to
identify in music as cert that he got
from Verisign or thought or wherever he
hasn't but we know him so we will go
ahead and install it it's fine now it's
installed as an application and in this
case Rob said it to run right after if
we were to go look in the Applications
folder on Mac you'd see this hapless now
there has its own icon again all that
stuff is up to air to take care of you
provide the icon and say hey make this
my apps icon and when that gets
installed on Windows we make it the
right sort of icon for Windows when it
gets installed on Mac we've made it get
the right kind of icon for Mac's there's
a bunch of stuff like that going on to
make these things work properly and now
here we have an app this app is totally
HTML it would look the exact it would
look exactly the same on Mac and Windows
and it is a Twitter client and that was
the whole install experience so we just
went through it now if he had he already
has the air runtime if he hadn't had it
the install experience would have almost
been identical the there would have been
one extra little dialog in there and
then during the install sequence it
would have told you by the way we're
installing the air runtime with the
application the install experience is
kicked off by flash yes
no so we won't push out air as a sort of
mandatory upgrade to the flash player
you know it's it's on demand the first
time you hit an air based application
you'll go through that see some sequence
very much like we just saw but which
will get the application as well as the
particular application as well as the
air runtimes altogether and a sort of a
very seamless experience this question
is how big is the air runtime it's nine
Meg's right now on Windows I think the
Mac size is similar types of
applications Web Apps or features of web
apps that really lend themselves to this
and maybe conversely are there things
about web apps that that don't lend
themselves to this so applique of
reasons to want to do this and jump in
when you get out so that's rough but you
know so something a common thread you've
seen a sort of a desire for persistence
like I'm gonna use my Twitter client all
the time or I'm gonna use my IM client
all the time or I'm gonna have my media
player or my audio radio station thing
all the time
you know in those cases where it's an
app you use and interact with all the
time fundamentally I don't think the web
browser is the best way to do it if you
have now have extra Chrome whose purpose
is to let you surf around for a
persistent experience turn it around for
certain applications and certain usages
that are more transient it makes no
sense to do this right I you know let's
say there's a site that I use once a
week once a month whatever it might be I
don't want to persist an experience for
that I want to go use it briefly use it
hit the back button or type in a
different URL and be done with it
so definitely part of it is just sort of
what the engagement model was with the
user how often you're going to use it
how long you're going to use it whether
it kind of needs to be its own thing
whether you want it to have its own icon
in the dock or on the windows taskbar
and really feel like its own thing or
not from and that's from a user
standpoint certainly from a developer
standpoint
if you want your brand to sort of be
front and center and if you want users
to be interacting with your application
or your content all the time you know
you can see the appeal for for having an
application like this of course you know
there's a variety of capabilities that
you can get at because of the security
model being a desktop app security model
the persistence the popping
notifications the reading and writing
and local files and so forth that you
wouldn't want to offer in a browser
model because the security contract is
different if I surf to Google or I surf
to ebay I've not given you permission to
mess around with my local machine but if
I go and install an application and it
said hey we're installing an application
look it's from eBay or you know are you
willing to give it these powers and I
say yes and I've opted into having you
know a tighter relationship with what
they're doing so if all your HTML is on
a server it's pretty easy to roll a new
version if it's on the client you have
to somehow update does air have a
mechanism to allow apps to self update
yeah and in fact when Rob ran the AOL
app it asked him if it wanted he wanted
to update it and he said no but say yes
Rob let's see what happens actually
there's a there's a bug with her
particularly all right don't say yes
keeps asking you and Devon yeah so it's
very easy for an application to
essentially check to see if there's an
update available and then kick the run
time to say there's a new version of me
take care of this up update we've built
low level support in and we're also
building framework level support so what
I mean by that is at the low level you
get a very raw API that says this is the
new installer make it so and air takes
care of the sequence of doing the
upgrade and restarting the app and all
that sort of thing the higher level will
be built framework to help you detect
hey is there a new version available go
out paying some website or something but
it's not required so is a developer you
can do whatever you want so you could
you know make some app where somebody
has to type in their credit card number
to get the new version or you know it
pulls only on alternate Tuesdays to see
when it launches to see if you know it
doesn't matter to us if somebody can
write that at the end of the day just
tell us here's the update go do it
so you'll be able to use sort of an
out-of-the-box thing that's got limited
customers ability or just write it
yourself and then use our low-level API
so you demonstrated some clear benefits
to building an air app versus of pure
web app I have a similar question now
which is it when if you're building a
desktop app what are the key reasons
that people use this versus just
building a native app is it ease of
development or are there other reasons
too yeah obviously it depends on the
application that you're trying to build
I mean if you're trying to build a a you
know a full-on word processor it can be
done we have an example of that it
requires a significant amount of time
but if you're building something
relatively straightforward that's taking
advantage of services that has data
visualization that's doing lots of video
it's really rich we think that you could
do that much quicker than you could if
you're coding say in C++ or some other
other language so what's interesting is
it with air again web developers are
starting to get more interested in
building desktop applications so a lot
of the first thing the things that we're
seeing so far I feel a little kind of
web-like but there are doing some
desktop stuff in the long run we
anticipate there'll be richer and more
sophisticated applications one thing for
example that we've seen which was quite
impressive is something called the
digimax is a application that is
basically a full-on mixing did you mix a
full-on audio mixer built in air and you
can drive dropout you know files you can
do mixes you can save them out as WAV
files so i won't i won't demo this
application but you kind of get the idea
you could do very typical desktop type
applications in air i mean i but there
could be exceptions i you know depends
on your use what your particular trying
to build yeah let me just add to that a
little bit partially it depends on your
skill set so if you're already
well-versed in the web technologies then
going and say hey go learn adders or c++
or whatever pretty steep learning curve
ii cross-platform so you know developing
some of these media players and so forth
across
form is something I've done before in
C++ and it's no fun at all developing
using things like flex and flash and
HTML takes care you know for certain
things a lot of things become a whole
lot easier just because you're building
on what's already there you're able to
do it cross-platform there's also the
code reuse a spective if you want to use
a lot of the same code in the browser
and not in the browser so way of doing
it I guess I'm thinking from the
perspective of a company that like like
Google for example that cares about
performance probably above almost
anything else and it's like I can see
how I could build something with air
that might take a month that might take
a year otherwise or something but the
question is is that worth it for you
know the performance overhead and
requiring the users to install a runtime
and and things like that yeah so it'll
depend regarding the requiring the users
to install the runtime obviously you
know Adobe will be working to get the
runtime deployed to everybody and as
more apps drive it you know that cost
will get amortized across apps as far as
performance it really depends what
you're doing like if you're looking for
video playback for example we're gonna
be doing really really good video
playback h26 you know our code is also u
plus plus and optimize it to be like
crazy and hardware accelerated and so
forth if you're talking about raw like
I'm gonna sit in the loop and and crunch
some numbers even the jaded code is not
gonna be as fast as what I could write
in C++ or assembly if at the end of the
day now we're gonna keep investing in
the virtual machine technology and make
it faster and faster but you'll always
be able to posit it a case where you
could go faster to the metal and it just
depends on how much you need and what
you need to do
yeah this is kind of relate to my
previous question but who I mix that
application did you mix that you just
showed off I'm a little confused so I
understand some of the benefits that air
is providing in terms of like you said
tighter integration with the native look
and feel and also you don't need to have
this browser running all the time and
but I'm curious about the extent of the
api's you guys are providing that are
not available inside the browser so I
guess my question is did you mix is if
let's say I had a browser where I said
I'm going to allow my browser
application to access files on disk what
I guess my question is what is digimax
doing that a browser could not do apart
from accessing native I mean is it do is
it taking advantage of processing power
on the client that is not available in a
browser is it because it's is it taken I
mean sure you might have a faster chip
enabled VM that's not available on the
browser right now but so for example
let's say I built a some sort of Twitter
client like you showed would you have
any network API that let me control or
let me find out information about my
particular client like how fast it's
going or how busy the network is that's
I mean you know what I mean like apart
from the look and feel what is air
giving me that's not available in a
browser in terms of like native
integration so it's certainly the case
that certain applications and certain
feature sets of applications you could
absolutely run both in the browser in in
air and we're not here to pitch desktop
desktop desktop don't use the browser I
don't care like if it's the right thing
to use in the desktop make it desktop if
it's not don't I mean from our
perspective you know we're trying to
extend the web platform out of the
browser into the desktop where it makes
sense our technologies and our goals
work both in the browser and outside the
browser so if something works best in
the browser keep it in the browser
there are so didja mix for example
probably largely could work in the
browser
I haven't deep dive this particular app
I would guess that some of the
drag-and-drop capabilities for dumping
in and out mixes are probably
difficult in the browser reading and
writing the wave files and mp3s off of
the disk sort of opening up the whole UI
from a chrome standpoint but yeah
fundamentally I think most of this app
and by this app is probably flex I'm not
sure but the legit adverse machine is in
Vail available in the flash player in
the browser so our goal for example is
not to have air apps have higher
performance than desktop apps sorry then
browser based apps unless there's
something special about the desktop or
the security model that lets us do that
one feature by the way I don't think we
talked to you about too much but just so
you know there will there will be a
capability to launch an air application
from within a browser so you could
basically say oh well now that I have
that Google Analytics application
installed maybe users
I don't think users are ever gonna find
it in the in their Program Files folder
they're just never gonna touch it again
well you could you could stick a button
on your website and say launch and so
that might be a different way to
interact with the desktop application
you touched on this a little bit but
what do you guys think of gears peers
it's cool we've had some discussions
with the gears team and yeah obviously
we were both using SQLite and both
putting in you know offline capabilities
so you know in air you have the same
databases you have in Gears and we've
had some discussions about putting in
some adapter layers so that the same
sort HTML code could be used both in air
and and gears and we've had some initial
discussions with the gears team about
that sort of thing and in fact the
community has already started to write
those those data layers this application
that I actually don't yeah I showed you
this one very briefly but this oh yeah
oh no and I didn't show you didn't show
this it's another HTML pure HTML app
this one this particular app the the
author of it basically created layers so
that you can write out either two gears
you can write out to an air and and it's
just a matter of whatever you want to do
so that's we think that's a great way to
integrate with gears and we anticipate
we'll see more innovation like that but
we're excited because obviously working
on the same code base
just makes everything stronger so more
Minds working on harder and problems
together so looks like we're at a time
where we appreciate you all for coming
here and we'll be around after so if you
have questions and if anyone's
interested we want to you if you want to
join our pre-release program please come
see us because we certainly love to have
have you join it provide feedback we can
help answer questions we've been working
a lot of these customers so if there's a
particular scenario you're curious about
would this be a good application for air
let us know and give you our contact
information as well so thank you
