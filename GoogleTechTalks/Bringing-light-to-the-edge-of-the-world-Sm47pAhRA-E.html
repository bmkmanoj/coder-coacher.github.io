went to Birkeland MIT with me and it's
my pleasure to welcome to google and
listen to his talk about blue energy
thanks Steve everybody hear me I just
want to thank Steve turn invited me here
today and thank Google and welcome you
all for coming and also like to welcome
my friend Bailey who's in seattle or
Kirkland good teleconferencing in first
of all I just wanted to ask you all a
question how many talks about wind power
you guys had here last year you had a
few couple none with that not about wind
okay I'll pretty hot topic this whole
and now so just wondering how many
people to know about it how many people
have seen other rocks on um I thought
I'd start by just jumping the gun and
answering the question why most of the
wind turbines in the Altamont Pass don't
turn because that is invariably for
people in California within like five
minutes of my talk the question comes up
right away but those things don't ever
seem to work they never spin even when
it's very windy I drive through there
all the time of 580 and never work so
the short answer that question is that
most of those wind turbines and this is
unrelated to this talk really but I
thought I'd just start with it most of
those wind turbines were put in around
nineteen eighty when there was a heavy
tax just a tax structure that was
heavily in favor of wind power so a lot
of people invested in wind power the
technology was not mature at all in fact
some people prepared to it to just
taking helicopter blades off the
helicopter and slapping it on a
generator and seeing if it would work as
a wind turbine that technology didn't
work very well most of those wind
turbines never worked more than a month
or two in the first place and the
companies went bankrupt and the turbines
have stood there ever since so it's not
really a reflection
of wind powers of viable technology and
that should be just kept in mind that
the new wind turbines are working much
much better anyways on to what I'm here
to talk to you about which is blue
energy a nonprofit organization that I
started in 2003 focusing on micro wind
so it's nothing like what you see in the
Altamont Pass these are wind turbines
well we're currently building between
eight and 12 foot diameter rotors up
here this is an eight foot model right
here this is about 500 watts that 12
foot models about a 1 kilowatt machine
the project that we're doing is actually
in Nicaragua we're a very disperse
organization we have we're headquartered
here in San Francisco we also have a
sister organization in France called el
dia or blue energy France and all of our
project work is in Nicaragua
not only is it in Nicaragua but we're on
or even in the remote side of Nicaragua
she's the Caribbean side the country is
terms of civil infrastructure culture
and everything is very different from
the Pacific to the Caribbean side we're
on the Caribbean side very remote
now what blue energy does to provide a
low-cost sustainable solution to the
energy needs of marginalized communities
through the construction installation of
maintenance of hybrid wind solar energy
systems we build the system's locally in
Bluefields nicaragua on the caribbean
coast in order to be able to work
building the local capacity to maintain
the systems if you can build it you can
maintain it also it's it's a social
effort so there's an element of economic
development providing jobs to people in
an area where it's desperately needed
the reason why we're in Nicaragua what
brings us to one of the most remote
places in the world is his family
history my mother was a linguist is a
linguist working on an indigenous
language on the Caribbean coast of
nicaragua the drama language she
documents dying languages and there's a
specialist and amerindian languages so
we used to travel there pretty
frequently when we were young my brother
and I so that's how we got to know the
area because it's not so obvious how
somebody from Morgan who lives in
California would have any relationship
with the Caribbean coast my interest in
wind power started when I was an
undergraduate student at Berkeley I was
civil engineering major but I spent a
lot of my time studying and working with
the energy and resource group headed by
Dan Cayman and dick nørgaard among
other people as Steve said I I went on
to MIT and did graduate work my studies
were never actually in wind power
specifically that was always more of a
hobby on the side but I was studying
engineering and learning a lot of
relevant stuff when I was at MIT that's
where the idea for blue energy came
there was a class in the media lab
called development on developmental
entrepreneurship taught by sandy
Pentland
founder of digital nations and former
head of the Media Lab at MIT and that
class the the whole concept was to
develop business plans to deliver
products or services to the world's two
billion poorest instead of products for
you know the top of the pyramid as most
consumer products are the deliverable
for this class was a business plan to be
submitted to the MIT 50k
entrepreneurship competition we we
entered in the fall in the warm-up
competition in the 1k warm-up
competition and we won in the global
markets category which came as a
surprise to us we're very excited we
were everybody around us was huge
biotech companies and all these other
things so we sort of slid in there and
won the global markets category that was
a small prize in terms of money was a
thousand dollars you can't really do
anything with that but just in terms of
momentum that was a big bush for us to
get us out the door out of school so
then when I graduated I went on to
incorporate blue energy as a as a 501 c
3 public charity tax-exempt organization
and the reason for that because I say
with a twist because we're not like most
nonprofit organizations we were into
manufacturing so we're into hardware and
that's a pretty rare domain for
nonprofit organizations and people look
at us here we are building energy
systems installing energy systems why
can't you make a profit doing that so
why wouldn't you incorporate as a
for-profit and the answer to that
question is that we chose to be
committed to Nicaragua at the beginning
of the project in one of the remote
places most remote places in the world
it's very it's very difficult business
environment it's not a great market it's
not where you would go if you were
for-profit and if we had shareholders
they would they would force us to go to
Mexico or some other place where these
systems would be applicable and but
where there's a lot more money for
people to buy them commercially so
that's why I say a public charity with a
twist and that's weak the original
business plan competition that was
submitted to the MIT the MIT competition
was was actually a for-profit model but
after more groundwork in Nicaragua
studying studying the market and talking
with some potential investors basically
it came up that the project was just too
high-risk from the social perspective
political perspective technological
perspective pretty much no private
investment were coming where we stand
today is that we have for energy systems
in communities on the Caribbean coast of
nicaragua we're also conducting an
ongoing market study and environmental
impact study and also very importantly a
wind resource study to see what the
energy production potential is in the
region for small-scale wind power there
have been industrial scale studies done
by swara of the United Nations and NREL
here in the United States of Nicaragua
but as usually the case the Caribbean
coast is almost completely ignored and
where they did actually study yet they
were only studying things at 150 200
feet today we're a pretty small
organization but I think we're on the
verge of something big we finally gotten
the interest in the attention of the
government of Nicaragua after we got to
Nicaraguan in june two thousand four so
we've just sort of been plotting along
with the government change at the end of
two thousand six the Sandinistas coming
back into power they have a much
stronger interest in rural development
and we're all of a sudden being invited
to meetings the ministry of energy
and everything so I think and also the
United Nations and the World Health
Organization is starting to take note
nom pretty much everybody who who has a
development project they want to do in
that region but very few of them have
any experience with energy so you know
you want to build a rural health clinic
down the middle nowhere first thing you
have to ask is how are you gonna get
clean water and how you gonna get how
you gonna get power so what makes us
different from other energy development
projects I would say the number one
thing is our commitment to a lasting
long term solution it's not that there
hasn't been in the energy development
work they'll take on this region on
Jason might a bit no sort of power
development of power diesel diesel power
for isolated mini grids etc but almost
without exception they failed and the
question is why you know we won
community we work with for over the last
15 years they've received for diesel
generators and none of them is wrong run
for more than six months why because
they were because the cost of fuel is so
high with diesel at four and a half
dollars a gallon in a region where you
know GDP per capita is four hundred
fifty dollars five hundred dollars i
mean that's a decent salary for a year
who can afford fuel if four and a half
dollars a gallon no local capacity to
maintain the systems you know nobody
there has been trained on nobody's ever
have it the first idea of how to build a
diesel generator let alone and you have
to have some knowledge of how to build
it if you need to be able to take it
apart to fix something put it back
together
so what makes up what are the components
of building a lasting sustainable
solution first thing is use appropriate
technology diesel power in that region
it's not the diesel powers of bad
technology it's a great technology but
is it appropriate for an area where
there aren't any big diesel shops and
nobody's been trained on diesel
manufacturing your maintenance you know
the answer history has shown the answer
is no what we provide is and I'll get
into more detail about the turbine
itself is is an appropriate energy
source for that area second thing is
building local capacity we spend a lot
of our time and effort training people
so we do workshops in Bluefields we go
out into the communities we work with
the system operators and then we also do
a lot of sort of social institution
building around the energy system you
can't just go put an energy system in
the community and just let it be
expected to run we format it we work
with the communities to form energy
Commission's which have operators to do
the sort of the technical operation of
the system and then a treasurer to
collect say charging fees I mean a lot
of times though that infrastructure
isn't in place in these rural
communities aren't any banks there
aren't any so who's gonna take records
of who's charging their battery when
who's paying who's collecting all the
management that surrounds an energy
system and thirdly is is our long-term
commitment most energy development
projects are pretty fleeting it's either
the government or it's um it's
oftentimes in this region it's a church
in the United States you know well
intentioned but they raised five
thousand dollars from four members of
the church they go down on a one-week
mission of goodwill by a bunch of
equipment go install it out in the
jungle and then they're disappointed
when they come back six months later and
none of it's working so we've
we've had a long term commitment to that
area of the last 20 years and we've been
now in Bluefields permanently for last
three years and we plan on blue energy
being there forever whether it's us or
not remains to be seen but it's the
institution will remain second is
understanding understanding and
respecting the local way of life it's
the Caribbean it's a different business
climate two different everything is
different and to be successful takes a
very delicate balance of persistence and
patience if you if you don't follow up
and if you don't push people and nothing
ever gets done but if you push too hard
you end up frustrating people
frustrating yourself and things just
come to a grinding halt also so it's a
very delicate balance it's sort of the
hurry up and wait philosophy where you
always have to be ready you always have
to be following up that's not always
reciprocated but it's sort of a gentle
push thirdly is that you know we're
keenly aware that it's not a
one-size-fits-all for small renewable
energy systems the key is understanding
each particular case whether it be a
community who's getting a system or an
individual or an institution you know
what are their needs what are the what's
the level of their technical capacity
what's their ability to pay how much
energy they need when do they need it
why etc so each time we look at doing an
energy project there are different
variables we look at the location
physical physical location of the system
who's gonna be served as this sort of
household electrification for private
use or is it a public school or clinic
who's gonna own the equipment after it's
installed management and operation how
much of this is being delegated to the
community um how much how much is blue
energy doing how much is an institution
handling
cells and physical configuration will
see a little bit more about that later
as we get into different types of
systems that we build so the core the
core of what we do actually one more
fact that I think it's important that I
mentioned is is the state of
electrification in Nicaragua today fifty
percent of the people in Nicaragua
overall don't have access to electricity
and on the Caribbean coast where we work
very isolated region eighty percent
don't have access to electricity so
pretty much everyone who lives outside
of blue fields or outside of pearl
lagoon which I'll show in more detail in
a map a little bit outside of those two
towns on the Caribbean coast don't have
electricity and you know there are
several reasons for that partly because
they've tried with diesel and that just
hasn't worked because the high cost
petroleum but also there's essentially
no civil infrastructure of any kind on
the Caribbean coast there are no roads
going in or out of blue fields for
example you have to either fly in or go
in by boat all of our work that we do up
and down the coast we have to solve boat
transportation by see 25 35 foot pongas
or slow diesel boats removing heavy
materials so there are no roads up and
down the coast there's no electric grid
on the coast outside of blue fields
there's no running water so it's
difficult for a project to sort of
succeed in isolation but you don't have
Road you don't have all these things
supporting your work it makes every
small task difficult
this here is a picture of the wind
turbine that we're building today in
Bluefields this picture is a fresh one
this is actually from last week we just
completed our fourth installation the
community of Kaka bila the few basic
things about the turbine design itself
because it's fairly unique compared to
you know we're not the only ones
building small wind turbines or
southwest windpower there's burgy this
there's a lot of other companies the
United States and in Europe but this
design is fairly unique for a couple
reasons well first of all I was it was
the base design comes from a gentleman
named to Pigot of scoring wind electric
he sort of considered to be the Guru of
small wind power do it yourself and he's
from what I call the school of heavy
metal he believes you know in using
steel not plastic building things strong
they're heavy they're robust the wind
tends to destroy just about anything in
its path so if you put in more materials
it costs a little bit more up front but
the idea again is long-term energy
production he along with with a fairly
large community of interested people
developed the turbine from the ground up
for ease of construction that was really
number one this isn't this isn't like a
burger or some other high-tech us wind
turbine where they stripped away
components to simplify it they really
designed this from the ground up for
ease of construction the fact that we're
able to manufacture this in Bluefields
with basic hand tools and a few power
power tools speaks to that robustness
again tied to the heavy metal idea and
also the other side of robustness is it
doesn't have a lot of fancy electronics
if you look at a southwest wind to run
like the air x of the 403 or the
bxl you know those have fairly fairly
high tech electronics which squeeze out
a little bit more energy from the wind
give it a slightly higher efficiency but
the trade-off is that those parts are
difficult to manufacture they're
difficult to maintain and they're liable
it's just one more thing that's liable
to break out in the jungle so this is n
so this turbine it doesn't have those
features which is a good thing in this
environment and it's also it's optimized
for energy production in low winds which
means that no you know the way you build
the blades and you match the blades to
the alternator you have to pick where
you want your peak efficiency to come
and this is designed to be more
efficient in low ends and less efficient
in high winds primarily because when
you're in isolated system you're
charging batteries when is if it's very
windy your batteries are most likely
full so that's a less important time to
worry about efficiency more important
that you get some power every day the
key design if there's one design thing
that really separates this from other
more traditional designs it's the
configuration of the alternator there
will be some better pictures later on
showing showing exactly how that is but
this is most most generators most
alternators are our radial flux that's
magnetic flux so you'll have a casing
like this the rotor could either be the
inside or the outside you have your
copper on one end and your your magnets
on the other I'm in the other object the
one of the two of them is rotating and
it's a three-dimensional object one
rotating very closely to the other it's
very difficult to build
three-dimensional components like that
to a high precision in a low-tech
environment so essentially if you
imagine the inside here is rotating like
this you've got say your what your
copper outside your magnets on the
inside what this design did is it
flattened everything out like this so
you have the copper coils in a
which is essentially a two-dimensional
object with a little bit of thickness in
the middle and then you have a plate on
either side with the magnets and they're
attached to each other so it goes north
south so you're the magnetic flux goes
along the axis of rotation so that's
what we call it an axial flux alternator
and then as I mentioned before what you
get from ease of construction it
logically is ease of maintenance if they
can build it they can repair it and what
that means is low cost over time see
what we don't like and what there's a
problem in the renewable energy market
place of talking about say dollar per
watt so dollar per power dollar per unit
installed but that's not what really
matters what matters is dollar per unit
of energy delivered over the lifetime of
the system if you can buy a system
that's cheaper but it's gonna break in a
year you know what good does that do you
better to pay more get a system that
will produce more kilowatt hours over
its lifetime so if you can maintain
something that dramatically lowers the
lifecycle costs
just want to tell you this is actually
one of our towers in Bluefields but she
won't tell you products and services so
that was just a little bit about the
wind turbine I'm gonna go in a little
more detail in a second about the
turbine itself but this is just to give
you an idea of the kinds of things that
we build we don't just build wind
turbines we do hybrid renewable energy
systems that means we build these from
scratch in Bluefields we build all the
components we wind our own copper coils
cut our steel carve the blades all of
that done in Bluefields towers we also
build from scratch we do all the welding
and assembly for solar we do all the
framing for the solar and then we
actually purchased the panels
commercially one of the other major
components of the energy system is the
power center which I'll get into a
little more detail later but that's the
inverter the charge controller the
battery bank sort of the brains of the
system and then we also build home
electrification kits where one of these
boxes will go in a home and provide
power for one small home it houses a
battery a low-voltage disconnect device
to protect the battery and some electric
sockets for services a lot of the work
that we do is system design there's not
a lot of know-how about how to design
appropriate renewable energy systems in
that region so a lot of our work starts
with this when we put in for grants or
when somebody comes to us say hey we
need energy you know we do our studies
and then we come up with diagrams like
this we also do site evaluation that's
that's the wind resource study to make
sure that the the areas are appropriate
that's an example of a wind arose there
it just shows you the it's not zoomed in
we'll have to see the detail but the
general idea of the wind rose that tells
you what direction the wind blows from
predominantly how often and how strong
so each of these colors is a diff
represents a different wind speed
top here is north so you can see here
the wind blows primarily from the north
and northeast for that particular site
as I mentioned we also do a lot of
operator training again that's that
touches again on the social aspect of
the organization that we're a nonprofit
organization were that allows us to do
things like operator training which
which our money losers you know why you
make money by building the product and
selling it never going back seeing those
people but that doesn't deliver a
sustainable energy source installation
work we do all of our we don't outsource
any of that we do all of that in house
that's digging the foundations pouring
foundations anchors building and
assembling towers out in the field and
then also maintenance which again we do
some let me hear two of our technicians
and near three local guys so we do some
of the work but we try to get them
involved as much as possible and over
time the ideas that will move more and
more towards the communities themselves
as once they've received the training
just a couple key points i want to touch
on just really briefly history of
nicaragua why is that region why is
there no civil infrastructure on the
caribbean coast of nicaragua why is it
so remote basically it starts with the
fact that nicaragua was colonized by the
Spanish and the English at the same time
Spanish on the Pacific side English on
the Caribbean side the way that went
basically the Caribbean side never has
never felt that it was really part of
the national government and it actually
wasn't until about nineteen hundred with
the help of the US Marines that the
Pacific side the central government in
managua invaded the Caribbean side to
say realign it or reappropriation or
something but the Caribbean coast really
views it as a just an invasion where
they were integrated and that's where
you get really the forming of nicaragua
as as a as one country but that didn't
change the fact that people in the
caribbean never saw themselves as part
of
the national government this manifests
itself in a lot of ways I mean for
example just demographics the Caribbean
side the English and Spanish pursued
very different policies on the Pacific
side the Spanish trimmers decimated the
local population therefore the people
you have that today are lighter skinned
spanish-speaking more of Spanish descent
on the Caribbean side the English for
more hands-off but there was some
slavery so there are black Creole
communities a lot of the indigenous
communities have survived on the coast
as well so it's much more diverse on the
Caribbean side and over fifty percent of
the population on the Caribbean side
speaks english as a first language
creole english so and then after after
the US Marines invade the caribbean side
give a long period of dictatorship about
40 years with the samosa family and they
banned educate they always viewed that
as sort of a resource pool the caribbean
side is a resource pool not really part
of the country they banned education
over the fifth grade level during that
entire time so i mean all these things
speak to why there isn't much technical
capacity there why there isn't civil
infrastructure is this pretty long
brutal history there and then also
natural disasters that hurricanes in
hurricane Yvonne in 1989 destroyed
ninety percent of blue fields so let's
just give you a sense of of the context
of where we work again as I mentioned
before the fact that blue energy is
nonprofit and has sort of a social focus
you know that means that we're that
allows gives us some room to focus on
sustainability and not just on
maximizing sales we've actually we only
have we have six energy systems
installed in for communities right now
we could have had way more we could have
had 20 30 by this time and we have a lot
of people coming to us asking to
purchase systems but we've sort of held
back on the reins because of our focus
on sustainability we don't want to go
install one more system in some
community that we can't support right
now
so we're we're waiting to scale the
organization so that the number of
installations we have is in proportion
to the strength of the organization and
just on one technical note many of you
probably already know this but just want
to point out that there's a big
difference between power and energy when
we talk about production and battery
storage and everything it's remember
important to remember that power is a
rate so I said as analogy if you thought
of as water the rape of water flowing
into a storage tank for example energy
is the amount is an amount it's how much
water you have in a storage tank so
think of a battery a battery stores
energy a battery doesn't store power but
it but a battery can deliver power in an
instant the turbine is the same thing
the power we talked about a wind turbine
say it's a 1 kilowatt wind turbine that
means that at a particular wind speed
when it's spinning it'll produce 1
kilowatt at any given instant but the
really important question is how over
time how much energy is at producing so
energy is really our focus and the fact
that the marketplace really focuses on
power they want to tell you how many
dollars per watt how many dollars per
kilowatt is very misleading and we we
and other responsible advocates of
renewable energy rather people focus on
energy
so here's just a few pictures talking
about the different major components of
the wind turbine itself since that's
really our focus start with the blade
rotor which as I mentioned now the ones
that we're carving and making our about
12 feet in diameter so there's six foot
blades they are carved out of wood we
are currently investigating some
fiberglassing options some injection
molding but still to this date wood is
uh wood is our primary raw material has
the advantage of being really nice to
work with its pleasant it can also be
very environmentally friendly if the
logging is not appropriately the problem
on the Caribbean coast of nicaragua is
that generally is not it's either being
clear cut or it's either there's a lot
of overt is overproduction of wood or
there's under production because the
government bans it they sort of cycle
back and forth after the blades are
carved we we treat them to prevent salt
water damage bugs dust so sort of
strengthen them and then we assemble
them this is what the 12-foot rotor
looks like three blades
as I mentioned we also build the
alternator's from scratch this sort of
pancake alternator we start by winding
our own you start with copper wire we
wind our own coils do all the wiring
this is set in a in a wood mold and then
we cast it it's a fiberglass resin and
this is what it looks like in the end
you this is a magnet rotor disc so this
is a steel disc this white here is a
North magnets blue here is a South
magnet north I mean direction pointing
in the yellow disk is the stator that
has the copper coils embedded in it you
can see a little bit of one of the
copper coils here and then there's an
identical disc like this on the back
side except that the magnets alternate
so this is North pointing in then on the
back side at South pointing in so that
gives you your magnetic flux that cuts
through the stator so the blades
attached here and this is all mounted on
a wheel hub for the for the rotor
bearing so the blades attached here when
this disc spins the disc in the back is
locked in sync with it so you get an
alternating as this moves around first
you have North cutting through this coil
and then as this magnet passes by you
get South this magnet comes around you
get North etc that gives you alternating
current it produces what we call wild AC
it's called wild because it's variable
voltage and variable frequency as the
wind turbine speeds up that's
essentially its its power that can't be
used directly because if you you know
you can't plug your appliance into
something that's got the voltage going
up and down up and down so what we do is
we we rectify it with bridge rectifiers
into DC current which then gets stored
in batteries and then can either be used
directly as DC current or can be used as
clean AC with an inverter
for the body of the turbine so here's
here's the back side of the alternator
so there you see the second disc on the
back side we make this body out of angle
iron weld it all together here's the
back of the wheel hub that's pointing
basically into the page this is the
bridge rectifier box this is where the
wild AC comes out of the stator here
goes in here gets rectified to DC and
runs down the center of the tower down
in the power center one of the other
major sort of geniuses of the design of
this wind turbine is the furling system
because in with wind power you always
have to worry about high winds
especially in regions like this prone to
hurricane and other strong winds how
does the wind turbine protect itself in
high winds like what's the overspeed
protection because copper coils have a
limit you know you can't produce
infinite current without melting and
things just can't rotate at infinite
speed and with a strong wind and no
method for furling out of the wind these
things will will spin very fast and they
would melt without any protection so the
design what you can see here if you look
carefully these are the hinges for the
tail vein so the wind turbine has a tail
vein that's mounted at a net you'll
notice the nets not straight up and down
it's at an angle so the tail vein sits
like this under normal operation say the
wind's coming from that direction the
tail vein keeps it pointed in the wind
the wind switches direction comes that
way catches the tail vein and it'll
pivot into the wind but because of this
angle here when the wind reaches a
certain speed the tail vein which is
mounted at an angle and with likes to
sit down in this rest position will
actually rise up against gravity and
will actually fold up and then the wind
turbine will pivot out of the wind
and then as soon as the wind stops
howling because of gravity because of
this angle of the tail vein it wants to
fall back down so as soon as the wind
stops howling it falls back down and
then catches the wind and pivots back
into the wind so it's a passive furling
system no Springs no pulleys no
electronics just gravity so it's a very
high high reliability design here you
can see they're mounting the tail vein
on a 12-foot turbine this is from about
a month ago
now the towers the tower how are we
doing on time by the way
in a few minutes oh boy
yeah I still got a little ways to go
okay um the towers we build and build
two types of towers lattice towers like
this sort of radio they look like radio
towers and then we also build tilt up
towers which is just tube sections we
generally prefer the tilt up it's much
cheaper however these types of lattice
towers are used when there are space
constraints the tilt up tower sweeps
through the air all the guy wire cables
that support the tower sweep through the
air when it tilt up goes up so it off
eyes a lot of space so if you need to
put something between structures between
buildings between a tree use the lattice
tower here's a basic diagram showing the
overall system got the wind turbine here
with your guy wires supporting it about
every 20 feet every 15 to 20 feet
concrete rebar foundations here you have
the power center usually with these
solar panels integrated here you have an
end-user say a household that's not
connected by any cables what they do is
they have a battery box they carry their
battery to the charging station pay a
fee and then they take their battery
home once it's charged and they're able
to use light in their home
I already talked about this talked for
this one too not too much time i'll skip
through some of these I have some more
than it I would like to show you at the
end a proposed already talked about that
this is this is a diagram here of the
power center itself break switches for
turning the wind turbine off for
maintenance work breakers to protect for
short circuits charge controller which
is really the brain of the system it
decides how much energy to send to the
batteries batteries sort of being the
heart of the system where all the energy
is stored and then we also have a dump
load the other thing is wind turbines as
opposed to solar panels when the
batteries are full what do you do the
energy has to go somewhere you can't
disconnect the wind turbine from the
batteries or it'll just speed up the
actual the batteries actually create
drag essentially on the wind turbine and
keep it operating at a reasonable speed
you can't just disconnect the battery
bank so the energy has to go somewhere
so we build a dump load which is just a
basically heating filaments in the air
the charge controllers job is if the bat
if it detects the battery banks are full
it just diverts the current to the dump
load dissipated as heat which is a waste
but it almost never happens it's sort of
a protection for during storms for
example
okay this is just what I say in the end
user yeah not not physically tied to the
power center I guess I'll probably skip
over this for now if people have
questions we can come back to this a lot
depending on the audience some people
are really interested in cost you know
how much does it cost why I can come
back to this I'm also this a brief
comparison of of our wind system
compared to solar or diesel doing a
lifecycle energy production cost
analysis as you can see a lot of
assumptions going to these things you
have to play with these models a lot but
shows that our our systems can be very
competitive but you notice this is what
kills diesel systems over 20 year
lifespan a 10 kilowatt diesel system
fuel costs per kilowatt hour 38 cents
lifetime operating costs and this
doesn't include maintenance which diesel
turbines require a lot of maintenance
just in fuel over a 20-year period is a
quarter of a million dollars so it's
talk about communities that's just way
out of reach this is a power curve for
our 12 foot wind turbine showing power
produced at any given wind speed
this is some example data of a wind
resource study that we're conducting
here's some sample data just from one of
our sites and blue fields the end of
2006 beginning of 2007 showing average
average wind speed in meters per second
by month somebody to keep in mind about
with wind systems as wind powers way
more variable than solar power so some
months have more wind than others we use
the solar panels to compensate for that
they tend to mix pretty well together so
when there's not a lot of wind it tends
to be a lot of Sun and vice versa this
is some energy production data for one
of our 12-foot turbines from februari
you can see this is so this is
production by day so you can see how
variable it is this is why it's
important to have a decent sized battery
bank where zero is it wasn't actually
that we produce zero those were just
days where measurements weren't taken
but overall our 12-foot system with a
hundred watt solar produces about three
and a half kilowatt hours per day the
logical question is what can you do with
that if you only put if you only use our
system for one day you would produce
basically three point five kilowatt
hours questions what can you do with
that amount of energy here are some
examples are you running just that one
compact for us in bulb would last you
213 hours of power runtime this is
interesting for say a small clinic a
small rural clinic three lights a radio
could be either for communication or for
music a laptop and a small
high-efficiency freezer for every day of
energy production it could run all these
things for 24 hours and it probably
wouldn't run lights for 24 hours etc but
this gives you a sense of the scaling
one of our systems could power a clinic
sustainably
ok
Oh queen is there any way we can connect
to the internet this is just want to see
I uh we did a little integration with
google maps to sort of plot out where if
you quit on that I mean I'll be able to
fly us to bed anyway what you would have
seen here as you would have seen this be
an interactive google map and you can go
in these are our four projects start for
current project sites if you click into
those the information windows that pop
up have flash slideshows showing a lot
of pictures of the sites also some video
of the different sites the
specifications of each system and short
text descriptions that's really a bummer
that we can't Oh
maybe just took a little while to find
the internet
incompatible ah don't check
I just want to make me just show you
want cuz then you burial
so here we're based out of blue fields
and the blue fields Lagoon here it's not
a whole lot of mapping in that area just
a little description of what the system
is being used for specifications of the
system this the system that we have in
Bluefields is actually on the campus of
the National Technical Institute which
is where we have our shop three winter
runs and a solar array here's another
example of wind rose again showing this
is one year of data showing what
direction the wind is blowing from and
what speed
slideshow just showing a couple pictures
of unitech
so all of this is the campus of the
National Technical Institute we have
about a third of one of these buildings
for our shop there's two of our systems
they're showing the two different kinds
of towers the regular tube tower and the
lattice tower here's one of our power
centers to inverter battery bank charge
controllers breakers the whole works are
our entire shop now is actually powered
by our wind systems so now every wind
turbine that's got that nice ring to it
but every wind turbine we build now is
built from wind power it also provides
backup power to the administrative
offices of the school turn the frequent
blackouts this is our office
I know this is a video that one of our
our biggest funder is actually the
government of Finland and they sent a
small film crew to to do a two minute
documentary on the project and it's in
Spanish so it's fine that it's muted but
you guys can check this out some of the
time if you're interested but it's got
some good footage of the systems in
action
what you can do to get involved if
you're interested in working with us
just spreading the word about what we're
doing donating a lot of our most of our
work comes from either private donations
or from the government of Finland the
Government of Canada multilateral
international development institutions
if you have a personal interest and you
want to just learn how to build a wind
turbine like this you can go to this
website this guy gives this is hieu
Pigott the original designer give his
workshops that's it you can find us on
the web here and be sure to tune in
we're gonna be on CNN in July they're
gonna send the film crew down and and
shoot another two minute documentary
about blue energy so thank you Steve
thank you google now questions if you
have any
structure under what with the demand for
energy like what
the demand relative to say uses here is
obviously very low you can get a lot of
bang for your buck just a little bit of
energy it's primarily primary interest i
would say it's lighting for schools they
often like the communities will have one
public building that'll be a community
meeting center school for the kids and
they also want to like adult night
classes and so to jam it all in they
want to extend the hours since the
evening so lighting a radio for
communication is sort of the new hot big
one because there's no telephone lines
or anything so the communities we work
in down south into the egg yolks Indian
communities there's no phone so that the
quickest way to communicate with
somebody is to get on a boat if the
weather's not too bad and go six hours
by boat up to blue fields to tell
somebody something so it makes for us
project coordination really difficult
and then just for living you know
difficult so it's a big push right now
between the indigenous communities to
set up a radio communication radio
network so actually we're doing the
insulation that CNN is coming down to
film and June is actually for battery
charging water pumping and storage and
radio communication integrated facility
and then there's the whole interest from
the World Health Organization the United
Nations is often rural health clinics so
the freezers for vaccinations and then
some lightweight industrial uses like
cacao processing that's a big one cacao
drying and processing and and some other
light industrial uses obviously these
systems you know they're limited in the
amount of energy they can provide so
you're not gonna run a steel processing
mill off these wind turbines but you
could do some good micro business stuff
and that that plays into the
sustainability of systems if you can
generate extra revenue from the
operation of the systems
all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
