D Smith their name is Michael Smith that
D is very important and this will allow
you to Google him if you want to get a
copy of the paper which I assume is up
on your website
Michael for what seven years maybe six
or seven years we met when he was right
out of grad school and he's done some
fantastic work in this area of marketing
online activity intellectual property
and a number of other areas of that sort
so welcome to Google Thank You Howlett
so that's a wonderful introduction it's
a wonderful opportunity to be here
really excited to talk to you all and I
should acknowledge right up front thank
Google and WPP for providing funding for
this stream of research that that we're
doing so that the talk I'm going to give
is entitled channels and conflict
response to digital distribution
channels this is joint work with my
colleagues
Rahul tulang who is co-director with me
of the Center for Digital Media Research
at Carnegie Mellon and our very very
fine doctoral students
Brett Danaher Samhita Denisovan and and
Anushka Maher what I'm gonna try to do
is present three papers on the same
theme okay so the theme is sort of
motivated in part by you know if you can
think back to the heady days of 1998 and
and the speculation about what was going
to happen when you added Internet
markets so there are a lot of wonderful
quotes one of them this nice quote in
Business Week that says the Internet's a
nearly perfect market information is
instantaneous and the result is fierce
price competition dwindling product
differentiation and loyalty and that was
sort of part of the conventional wisdom
in 1998 untested by data and it turns
out if you if you go out and you look at
what actually happened in internet
markets not all of these hypotheses hold
up there's a lot of price dispersion
brand matters a whole lot and if you
don't believe me you can google that and
you know and and product differentiation
still still matters what we wonder is
whether we're
a very similar time right now with
respect to digital media in the sense
that there's a lot of conventional
wisdom about how consumers will approach
digital media channels and very little
of it is tested rigorously and
empirically so here here are two
representative quotes one from James
gianopolous chairman of 20th Century Fox
when people say reinvent your business
model because the ubiquitous
availability of piracy there's a huge
flaw in that you can never compete with
free that's an economic paradigm that
doesn't work okay on the flip side of
this is Steve Jobs by no means a
disinterested observer in this debate
but Steve Jobs saying you'll never stop
piracy what you have to do is compete
with it okay so this interesting
question how do I compete with free in
general and in particular how do I
compete with free pirated content ever
get those consumers back and if I if I
can what does that look like the second
debate is is in my mind almost as
interesting if not if not more
interesting the the question about if I
add a digital distribution channel what
is that going to do to consumption in my
existing physical channels and here I
think the conventional wisdom is in the
industry that when I add a digital
distribution channel it's going to
primarily cannibalize my existing
physical channel so so a set of quotes
Jeff Zucker CEO of NBC University
Universal our challenge is to monetize
these digital channels we don't end up
want to end up trading analog dollars
for digital pennies okay another one
from Netflix also not a disinterested
observer but saying when when Studios
distribute through Amazon unbox their
cannibalizing they're within the DVD
window and they're cannibalizing their
own sales and and the last one
unfortunately I've been able to get a
good quote on this for soon to be
obvious reasons but apparently when
Disney started selling their movies on
iTunes Walmart which makes up something
like 35 to 40 percent of their sales was
so annoyed by this that they sent back
crates and crates of Disney DVDs in
protest target did a very similar thing
took down Disney Disney in caps and
replaced the
with their competitors and my favorite
piece of this is if you believe the
press reports Walmart sent out
emissaries to Hollywood threatening to
retaliate other studios followed Disney
into the the iTunes Store
okay I don't know if horse heads were
involved but but nonetheless it's a
rather strong response possibly so these
are the research questions we're
interested can you compete with free and
what does that look like and then what's
the dominant impact of adding these
digital distribution channels does it
cannibalize your physical sales or might
it have an impact on piracy and and not
to spoil the punch line for you but but
what I'm hoping to convince you is that
number one you can compete with free
distributing content for free actually
can stimulate sales of paid product for
the same content and number two is that
the dominant impact of adding a paid
digital distribution channel seems to be
reducing the demand for piracy and
having no effect on existing DVD sales
okay and I'll try to I'll try to get
through the talk and leave some time at
the end where we can interact on these
questions and I hope we can have a
healthy fun discussion around these okay
this this contributes to a couple
different academic literature's I won't
spend a whole lot of time on these the
first one is there have been a set of
very interesting papers looking at the
impact of primarily music piracy on
sales of CDs primarily and typically
these papers I'm going to oversimplify
them but typically these papers take
Napster as an event and look at what the
introduction of Napster did to sales of
CDs and these papers acknowledge the the
important question which is you know
when they find that Napster resulted in
a reduce and reduction in CD sales is
that because Napster was free or is that
because Napster was digital because I
wanted to get the the content for free
or is that because Napster was just so
darn easy for me to use
compared to going down to that's or or
you know
HMV or what-have-you and browsing
through the sales of browsing through
the racks of physical CDs there been a
couple other studies on on video the one
I want to highlight partially selfishly
and partially topically as a paper Rahul
and I wrote where we looked at what
happens to DVD sales around the time a
movie is broadcast on television and
what we found is that when a movie is
broadcast on television there's almost
an immediate uptick in demand for DVDs
on Amazon and in demand for piracy but
that the availability of content we sort
of used that as an exotic shock and then
say that the availability of content on
piracy whether the movie is available or
not doesn't seem to affect the uptick in
DVD sales okay which which kind of had
us scratching our heads because we
really do believe piracy hurts but here
we were seeing you know here we were
seeing something that sort of I don't
know challenged that view where the
presence of piracy on the digital
channel wasn't affecting DVD sales and
so what we wanted to come back and do is
is try to gather data that would help us
explore that question in a little bit
more detail so and and the way we're
gonna do this is is with exogenous
shocks in in the market so there's some
classic challenges associated with
measuring the impact of piracy you know
if I if I regress demand for piracy on
demand for sales you have an obvious and
dodging ad problem how do I break that
in dodging a ax T okay so let me let me
talk about the data sets that we used
for the first two studies so the first
two studies we went out and gathered
data the first place we gathered it was
amazon.com and I had a very bright
doctoral student who went in and
realized that if you indexed the Amazon
top 100 selling DVDs and added 200 in
place of 100 in the URL you could sort
of scrape the whole site what was fun is
that 48 hours later than that ability
went away so some somebody was was
watching but fortunately she had all the
Asin so she has been scraping every DVD
sold by Amazon on a daily basis
collecting the price you know
characteristics that DVD and importantly
the the DVD sales rank okay so we're
going to use that sales rank as a signal
of changes in absolute sales so so it
turns out if you assume a Pareto
relationship between the ordinal sales
rank and the cardinal number of sales
that you can that you can impute a
different change in in sales rank as a
percent change in in sales we have that
for all DVDs at Amazon from November
2006 hopefully through yesterday if if
things are going well and you know these
numbers seem so much more impressive
when we present them to academic
audiences they're much less impressive
when you present them here at here at
Google so you'll you'll you'll forgive
me for my humble data count here the
flip side of this is how do you measure
piracy so we scratched our heads for a
long time about how do you get a
reliable measure of you know a reliable
signal of piracy demand and and we
finally decided to go to the Oracle of
all piracy knowledge I asked one of my
undergrad classes how they steal movies
and and they cheerfully answered back
that at least at that time the primary
tool they used was BitTorrent so we
found a the most popular BitTorrent
tracker site mininova at the time
indexed all of many Nova's television
content movies and video games and what
we're going to use television content
for this so we have a daily scrape and
again this sounds much more impressive
in other context but we have a daily
scrape of every torrent posted to
mininova including the number of cedars
number of liters and and cumulative
number of downloads so we're gonna we're
going to use that we're going to use
primarily the Downloads as as a signal
of changes in demand for these pieces of
content we're going to go through a fun
exercise of trying to code the the names
of the torrents sadly pirates aren't all
that disciplined about adding good
metadata to their to their torrid names
but we're gonna we're going to go
through an exercise of trying to code
these back to the right pieces of
content and and we're going to use that
we've got
data from November 2007 up through last
November when mininova started filtering
their content and again we've got what
we believe to be a fair number of
observations at least for somebody
working for pizza and on an old computer
ok so I told her let's start gathering
this and and let's just wait for fun
things to happen in the market all right
so the fun thing number one was NBC
kindly presumably to support the
academic research endeavor decided to
pull all of their content from Amazon so
our from Apple so NBC got into a fight
with Apple about a variety of things
some of them revenue some of them
pricing and some of them content
protection but the upshot is that in on
December 1st of 2007 they removed all of
their television content from Apple
iTunes and restored it later in
September of of oh eight I'm going to
focus on the the December event we can
talk about what happened in in September
okay so this gives us the nice sort of
event that we want to have we've got a
set of consumers cheerfully buying
iTunes content from NBC and on December
1st they can't anymore where do they go
okay so we're going to extract again the
piracy and DVD data and we're going to
use this as a sort of a difference in
difference or control treatment group
model we're gonna use we're gonna try to
measure NBC changes in NBC's piracy and
changes in NBC's DVD DVD sales with ABC
CBS and Fox as the control group okay
all right what what I need to convince
you though is that ABC and CBS piracy
looks like I nbc's piracy in the before
period that is ABC CBS and Fox are a
decent control group for NBC in in the
before period for the for this to work
so let me let me see if I can convince
you of that with the pretreatment
falsification test the model we've got
is the log of downloads on to date
dummies episode dummies and then a an
NBC indicator for for the actual event
and what I'm hoping to find is that in
the period before NBC took their content
off of iTunes that that dumped that
dummy variable for NBC is insignificant
and in the period after it it's it's
significant and you already know the
answer to this question this is this is
sort of the chart of the conditional
values and what you find is that NBC
seems to map nan in nan NBC pretty well
in the period right up to December first
and then after that we see that NBC
piracy levels are higher than ABC CBS
and Fox okay in percentage terms we can
run this and just stare at the
coefficients we interpret these
coefficients as percentages and what
this is saying is that the demand for
NBC piracy increased by about 11 percent
in the period after they removed their
content and and I should I should point
out this is we have data up through
Christmas I'd love to tell a wonderful
story about how we decided to exclude
the Christmas holiday period the the
fact of the matter is my very talented
doctoral student went home for Christmas
over the holidays and write about
Christmas many know of a change the way
they index their pages and so I'm not
entirely sure anymore what happened
after after Christmas but I can say you
know the reasonable amount of confidence
that up until Christmas this was an 11%
increase the other interesting thing
going on here is this variable says what
happened to non NBC piracy during the
same time period it's statistically you
know marginally significant and it's not
well identified I don't know what would
have happened had NBC not done this but
if you just if you just interpret that
on the face of it what it's saying is
not only was there an 11 percent
increase in NBC piracy but there was an
additional 5 to 6 percent increase in
non NBC piracy which might mean that
these consumers who were buying on
iTunes and decided to go pirate their
content through BitTorrent not only
pirated the NBC content but also pirated
some ABC CBS and Fox content while while
they were there ok that makes sense
I'm sorry go ahead they were all in
iTunes during the whole time so so it's
it's a it's a proper control group yeah
the the nice thing about this is Hulu
was still in private beta during this
time frame so the number of Hulu users
was relatively small and there were
there was no big changes in distribution
digital distribution for any of these
folks so it's a good good question so
the other thing you can do with this
data is you can carve it up by genre so
if you wanted to characterize the
typical pirate as a young male these
data would would be consistent with that
view so what we see is a much bigger
uptick in demand for pirated content for
sci-fi shows comedy and to a lesser
degree action then then for drama okay I
don't know I don't want to push this too
hard but but you could you could draw
your own conclusions from this so then
we can go and do exactly the same test
on DVD sales at Amazon so here the
dependent variable is the natural log of
Amazon sales rank and we're measuring
sales of NBC DVD boxsets for television
versus ABC CB CBS and Fox DVD boxsets
for television and what you find is is
no statistically interesting change in
sales for NBC content relative to ABC
CBS and Fox okay so you scratch your
head for a little while about this
second event is ABC and Hulu okay so so
here we have NBC CBS and Fox are showing
programs on Hulu Disney announces that
they're going to add their content to
Hulu and we can do basically the same
thing just in just in Reverse all right
so May 1st of 2009 ABC announces they're
gonna add their content July 6th ABC
starts streaming their TVs TV shows to
Hulu we're going to use the same
difference in
difference model we have eight ABC shows
and 42 non ABC shows and these are the
shows after eliminating categories where
that you know that might be unusual so
game shows reality shows talk shows
these are sort of the you know might be
systematically different and we're gonna
look at a two-week period before and
after July 6th of of 2009 ok so here
again we're gonna interact the ABC
variable with the after variable and
what you find is about a 37 percent
decrease in piracy in the two-week
period after ABC adds their content to
to Hulu which is larger than I was
expecting but it but it's it's
statistically significant I've asked
I've asked to me to beat this up in a
variety of different ways and it just
doesn't go away so huge huge decrease in
the demand for piracy and then if you
look at DVD sales you know nothing
statistically significant if anything
it's directionally negative which again
because these are sales ranked a
decrease in sales rank actually means an
increase in sales so if anything there's
there's a slight increase in sales but
but not in any any statistically
significant way ok yes
yes oh this is this is so as I
understand the question what you're
saying is we're looking at two different
context iTunes is one where I pay for
the content and I get it
whereas Hulu is one where I get it for
free or free with commercials so they're
they're different contexts yeah and I
buy that completely and that's that's
part of the reason I think you know it's
it's kind of interesting that the DVD
sales change is directionally positive
right I think broadcasting so if you go
back to what I said about the paper
Rahal and I did with what what does
television do what's the dominant impact
of broadcasting the whole movie on
television it's to encourage people to
go out and buy the DVD here we've got a
setting where you you put it up on Hulu
I can get the whole piece of content and
it might be encouraging some people
although not a statistically significant
number of them but it might be
encouraging some people to become
interested in that content and possibly
buy it on on DVD yeah
exact exactly the same series yeah so
typically the DVDs are released in
season season long so it was exactly the
same series and the same seasons that
were being put up there
good question any other questions on
this we were looking at whatever they
were putting up so so I that'sthat's a
good point I have to ask to meet I would
I would suspect what she did was a match
set because I know that's what we did in
the in the NBC study a match set of DVDs
and whatever seat but they had to be
available on both sides whatever DVD was
available matched with a season that was
also available I think that's right yeah
haven't done that would love would love
to do that right there's a bunch of
anecdotal evidence and speculation that
you know shows like It's Always Sunny in
Philadelphia gained the following
through Hulu and then became popular on
on broadcast it's a natural still over I
just haven't haven't found the data to
identify it's a cool question any other
questions on this alright so the summary
here ABC's availability in Hulu is
correlated with a thirty seven percent
decrease in piracy and no change in DVD
sales so we see we see a similar effect
here to what we saw before let me add
what I'd like to do is spend the last
half hour focusing on the last paper
this last paper is the most recent so
this is very much work in progress so
I'm hoping we can crowdsource some you
know some other cool analyses we should
be doing on this and this is also the
paper that that Google and how and and
WPP are are supporting okay so we found
a studio let's call them studio expert
for a moment and studio X has the
problem all Studios do when they license
their movies to HBO HBO asks for an
exclusive broadcast license which means
that you can't also show it to other
competing channels but it also means
that you've got to take it off your
other digital distribution channels so
studio X has to take it off video
on-demand and they have to take it off
of iTunes so we have a very similar
structure we have you know movie enters
the theatrical window about 28 weeks
later it goes into the DVD window and
it's typically release DVD iTunes and
video on-demand all at the same time and
then when it enters the HBO window they
have to take it off of video on-demand
and est it stays up on DVD primarily
because there's just no way to get it
out of the channel once it's once it's
in the physical Channel and it stays up
on piracy obviously pretty much
through this whole period now the first
the first challenge we had was how do
you isolate the window effect from the
broadcast effect again this previous
paper suggests when you broadcast a
movie DVD demand increases the fun thing
about this is that when you the the
contract with HBO starts on the 1st of
the month that the movie is broadcast on
HBO and the first broadcast of the month
is almost always the first second or
third Saturday of the month and so we're
going to use that variation between the
first of the month and the first second
or third Saturday in the month as a way
to identify the window effect from the
broadcast effect does that makes sense
okay all right it's very similar
questions where do these customers go
except here we get to look at hopefully
both former video on-demand customers
and former iTunes customers separately
so where two former video on-demand
customers go when they can't get on
video on-demand anymore and where two
former itunes customers go when they
can't get it on iTunes anymore and also
you know what does this what does the
broadcast do as well another another
example of of competing with free okay
all right the data we got from studio X
was their DVD VOD and est sales for 10
movies that entered the HBO blackout
window from December oh 9 through March
of 10 we have each of these data at a
DMA level for the top 150 3d mas in the
United States the Amaze are sort of
regions of the country is everybody
familiar with okay and we have the pot
we have weekly observations of
peer-to-peer activity through one of
their vendors also broken out by DMA
based on the IP number of the of the
person committing the the piracy okay
all right so we're going to use the HBO
window entering the HBO window as an
exogenous shock to demand for both VOD
and iTunes
okay so the first thing I need to
convince you of is is that entering this
window is exogenous as near as we can
tell it is so talking to studio X they
negotiate with HBO sort of collectively
for all their movies and determine a
period of time after theatrical where
it's going to enter the HBO window and
that's set before they ever see what the
DVD demand is okay it's also comforting
that when you go and look at the lag
between when it leaves the theater and
when it when it enters the HBO window
there's no systematic difference in that
lag as a function of either DVD sales or
theatrical sales this really does look
like an exogenous shock okay and as I
mentioned before we're gonna try to
exploit the lag between the introduction
of the window and the broadcast to try
to isolate out both the broadcast effect
and the window effect broadcast effect
the entering the window effect from the
broadcast effect that makes sense okay
if you do this so this the simple model
for this shows that there's an increase
in both via both DVD and piracy demand
when it enters the window although not
particularly large and not statistically
significant and then there's a big
increase for both of them when you
broadcast let me show you the model
that's going to tease out the two
effects I want to see so this model I've
got s is either the log of DVD sales of
piracy for movie I in dmaj in week t
after after DVD release date or piracy
for movie ID Maj in week T I've got a
set of movie fixed effects of DMA fixed
effects of dummy variables at the end
I'm gonna try to dummy out the Christmas
weeks for for those for those that were
released over Christmas and then what
I'm gonna try to do is I've got a dummy
variable for the HBO window which is
here I've got a dummy variable for the
broadcast period so a separate us I'm
gonna try to separate out the broadcast
period and then what I'm going to try to
do is I'm going to take
a prediction of what the lost sales on
VOD would look like for movie I dmaj in
time period t so we just use a couple
different exponential decay curves it's
not particularly sensitive to this but
I'm gonna try to predict what would VOD
sales have been for this movie in this
DMA and I'm also going to try to predict
what would iTunes sales have been for
this movie in in this DMA and I'm going
to interact those two variables with a
dummy variable for for the broadcast
period okay and what I'm what I'm hoping
here is that this tells me for dmas with
high levels of VOD sales that they have
a higher than normal change in DVD sales
and change in piracy and DVDs with
higher than normal iTunes sales so they
have a higher than normal change in DVD
sales and and piracy okay does that make
sense
all right cool and so this is what we
see so if you if you look at changes in
DVD sales you can see an increase in
sales during the blackout period
although not statistically significant
you can see an increase in sales during
the broadcast period consumers see this
on HBO and go out and and buy the DVD
you can see an uptick in NH in DVD sales
for DMAs that have high that have high
VOD sales so lost lost VOD sales seem to
be moving towards DVD sales
I see no statistical change in in DVD
sales as a function of D mas that have
high levels of iTunes of lost iTunes
sales and on the flip side for piracy I
see similar coefficients over here
showing the movie on HBO leads to an
increase in the demand for piracy as
we've seen in other papers and DNA's
that have a large number of VOD sales
have no statistically significant
increase in piracy and D mas that have a
high loss do two EST sales have a have a
statistically significant positive
increase in in piracy okay another way
to see this is you can just plot the
the lost DST sales and lost VOD sales as
a function of the conditional predicted
VOD CMAs DVD sales and and and an piracy
and and again what you find is you know
a nice a nice strong correlation here
not much not much correlation here and
not much correlation for DVD sales but a
nice strong correlation for the change
for 4d mas that have higher levels of
lost est sales with respect to with
respect to increases in piracy does that
make sense all right cool
Bobbitt asked me to finish in about 40
minutes and I think we've actually done
that so the the punchline here I think
is it sure does start to look like it's
possible to compete with free now this
isn't a huge shock for marketers right
competing with free is is really just a
special case of price competition I've
got to figure out a way to differentiate
the paid product from the free product
and what this what this suggests is that
I can differentiate that in a bunch of
different ways I can differentiate that
based on usability based on convenience
what-have-you but showing it on
television showing it on HBO and
apparently potentially showing it on
things like Hulu might increase the
demand for the paid pieces of those
content the other one that I like is
that consumers sure seem to be much more
tied to their mode of consumption than
they are to the legality of their
consumption so I think the conventional
wisdom in the industry was you've got a
set of pirates and you've got a set of
legitimate purchasers the Pirates you're
never going to be able to get back and
the legitimate purchasers are going to
choose between your physical channels
and your digital channels if I had a
digital channel it's going to suck away
people from the physical channel without
sucking away many people from from
piracy and we see in in each of these
three cases exactly the opposite that
adding and adding a digital channel you
know at a reasonable price and a
reasonably convenient format reduces the
demand for piracy and doesn't have a big
impact on the demand for for the
physical good
the way I'd be interested interacting on
this but the way I think about this is I
think consumers decide I want to I want
to consume digitally and once I decide I
want to consume digitally I'm gonna find
it at least some of these consumers are
gonna find it in a legitimate channel if
I can and if I can't I'm gonna I'm gonna
steal it or whatever whatever your
preferred word is for for piracy
okay the other piece here is I think
they're they're a bunch of interesting
opportunities to try to understand the
impact of these digital channels through
through these now these sorts of natural
experiments and and so we're out here
talking to different companies talking
to Facebook earlier today talking to
Yahoo tomorrow to try to see if we can
identify some of these experiments or
changes in digital distribution and used
in this ways to better understand how
consumers respond okay all right so I
think almost at 40 minutes I would love
to take questions and interact on this
because I know you guys have seen some
interesting experiments along along
these lines
sure
yeah we talked so the I'm sorry yeah the
the the question was have we looked at
revenue impacts is is is I you know what
one interesting question off of that is
is it true that the digital channel is
lower March and then than the physical
channel I don't know whether that's I
don't know whether that's true or not
and I'm not sure the studios have a good
have a good idea of whether that's
whether that's true or not
you could imagine a world where you know
I cut out a whole bunch of production
phases and I cut out a whole bunch of
middlemen and I can go directly and get
higher margins I could also imagine a
world where the competition from piracy
leads to lower margins I don't know with
Studio X we were interested in it in a
different question for them and and yeah
that's that's the fear right
yes this is the challenge and again I
think the conventional wisdom in the
industry was if we if we ignore these
digital distribution channels will keep
people longer in these higher margin
physical channels that is you know
adding a digital distribution channel
will cause people who otherwise would
have bought physical to go over to
digital distribution and we don't you
know well that's possible we don't see
that in the data it sure looks like the
people who want to consume digitally are
already gone and they're they're getting
it in in another way so you know
managerially you might worry about am i
am i leading consumers to a lower margin
channel I don't know whether it's lower
margin or not but I think practically it
sure looks like the the consumers are
going to figure that out on their own
and and go and go there directly so I'm
not sure how
that good question so house question
I'll try to remember if I if I forget to
repeat the question somebody raised
their hand but house question is how do
sales I know this best for for studio-x
they gave us weekly DVD sales so I can't
I can't see it with a whole lot of
granularity I know it best for the poor
the previous study we did where we were
looking at it on an hour-by-hour basis
and in fact if you sit with your browser
open if you're if you're geeky enough to
sit with your browser open and I know
how is while a movie shows on television
you you can you can almost see an uptick
in sales rank almost immediately after
the movie stops showing on the East
Coast or it's it's it's really it's a
beautiful thing
yes
yeah that's that's what that's what
we're hoping to find settings where we
could do cool things like that because
again I think I think that's that's how
the industry is going to move forward is
is understanding these these subtle
changes to to how consumers respond to
their to their digital distribution
channels yeah it's a very good idea
there's one question back here
we have we we have we're looking at that
question it's probably the best way to
put it we think we've got a cool
experiment
so the climb sorry the question is have
you looked at the impact of prices that
is how sensitive or people you know is
is $3 is an iTunes episode at $3 is
there a significant amount of elasticity
versus an itunes episode sold at $2 the
anecdotal evidence I've read suggests
that the change in iTunes music pricing
from $0.99 to a buck 19 actually showed
a fair amount of elasticity and and
we're hoping to look at at that question
the other related question is actually
dealt with in the first paper represent
at the NBC the NBC paper so what we
tried to do again as an economist if I
see somebody buying something on iTunes
that they could get for free
my perverse response to that is there
must be some non-monetary cost
associated with free or else this person
would have wouldn't have bought it they
would have gotten it for free so the
question is is that non-monetary cost a
marginal cost you know is it is it that
each download I make just has less less
usability or less convenience and that's
why I choose to get it on iTunes or is
there a fixed cost right is it that I
don't know how to use BitTorrent and
there's this big fixed cost associated
with that and that's what's keeping me
away and in the NBC paper all the
results we got sure pointed towards a
fixed cost component that that you know
people were avoiding bit torn because
they didn't know how to use it
once they couldn't get it on iTunes
anymore they invested that fixed cost
and then they were harder to get back
yes oh no it's a great point so the
question is you know as I understand it
what's what's the is is there also a
moral component associated with this or
is sort of Mike my consciousness I'm
aware of this the other piece we
explored was is there a moral component
and originally we thought a moral
component would primarily have a
marginal cost effect that you know sort
of each time Bob I shouldn't use real
names each time each time this gentleman
sitting here
pirates something you know he gets he
gets a slightly more bad feeling about
about himself we presented this to our
faculty who includes some very prominent
criminologists who said you know what
the literature says that actually
there's a fixed cost to to crime that
the first crime you commit is the
hardest one and after that it becomes
much easier so we had to model the moral
cost is both a fixed in and a marginal
component but but everything lined up
with with sort of fixed cost so you know
maybe maybe it's when you sell your soul
to to piracy it becomes much easier to
pirate over that and I see some people
nodding okay that'd be a good title for
a paper action sure
right it's an interesting question I
haven't looked at that right but you can
you can stare at iTunes and you can
wonder whether that whether the DRM that
Apple was able to control created this
wonderful ecosystem for them where the
more iTunes you bought the more you
wanted to buy ipods and the ivor ipods
you bought the more you wanted to buy
from itunes and and turn them into
whatever market share they have you know
ninety ninety percent market share which
makes them a very tough downstream
negotiating partner for all these all
these record companies you know that
they like Walmart does in DVDs Apple can
be a very tough downstream negotiating
partner and you wonder how much of that
is due to just Steve Jobs being
brilliant and how much of that is due to
the DRM scheme that was put in place
that was proprietary it's an interesting
question yeah
yeah there's there's there's a pretty
dramatic difference the the question
thank you Bob
the question was do you see any
difference in behavior across dmas and
and the answer is yes there there's
there's you know obviously there's
correlation you know DNA's that have
high iTunes sales also have high VOD
sales but there's enough variation and
there's there's a decent amount of
variation across these DMAs that we were
able to identify it and I should have
pointed out that the model has we
cluster the standard errors at the movie
level so so we're controlling for
potential correlation across across the
different DMAs but there's enough
variation there that you can that you
can pull it out it's kind of cool I
don't know how to take questions from
these nice people up on the screen okay
cool
any other questions any other personal
anecdotes the nice thing is the camera
isn't facing on you do we have any
questions from our audience in the cloud
can you guys still hear me in the cloud
okay they're all they're putting thumbs
up okay no questions there all right
well thank thank you very much I think
