we need coils from Colombia
it's a professor at the i/o department
at Columbia is a recipient of the NSF
Career Award IP in faculty award and
Google faculty research award and he's
interested in the design and analysis of
algorithms this particular robust
data-driven algorithms for dynamic
optimization problems today is going to
talk about hospital fish problems
differentiating heroes for the waters of
an optimization here back the motivation
is the same we're super in a districts I
think that well for arranging this and
and the introduction it's a pleasure to
come back and again speak about
assortment of conservation so today I am
going to talk about this problem under
distribution over permutations models
and in particular a mixture of Mallos
distribution over permutations this
joint work with my student on two on the
sea and unshaken project over to LA who
is faculty at NYU Stern and vanetia gave
whose expansion - so so so just to set
up the setting of the problem of
assortment optimization let me let me
describe a concrete model so think of M
substitutable options you have n
substitutable options with exogenous
prices P 1 2 P n now the preference of
customers is specified by an ordered
list over these
substitutable options so ordered list or
or a permutation and a seller needs to
decide what options to offer to the user
with the goal of maximizing the expected
revenue if now if a subset of options is
offered to a user the user would select
the highest in their in his or her decks
for instance let's say I only offer
options 1 and n the first user
she has a preference list of 3-1 and
then nothing the empty set just says the
user exists a system so the first user
would pick a product once and the second
user will go to options would look for
option 3 not there so would not would I
get the system it and in general in a
most general setting preferences can be
modeled by as a distribution over
permutations for what we substitute
substitutable options it's here you're
not Plagueis prices for example so the
prices the products are exogenous they
are there all the features including
prices are fixed therefore I'm the
Preferences of the population is fixed
there are images critics also considered
simple stress models that you can pick
Saltzman to sell prices
exactly so pricing is a more general
problem than assortment because I can
set the price to infinity which implies
that I am NOT offering the often the
that product because you say this is a
like particular subset of pricing
Snickers this is a subset of our pricing
one yes yes so as you can imagine this
this arises this kind of problem would
arise in in many setting in e-commerce
Amazon Product Search recommendation so
this this arises in a variety of setting
where the goal is to from the sellers
point of view to maximize the revenue
now I mentioned distribution over
permutations this is a nicely this is a
useless model like I cannot hope to
estimate a nonparametric distribution
over over permutation it but really what
I don't really need this the
distribution of a permutation
I actually need the following object
that if X is the subset of options
offered by the seller what is the
probability that a random user from the
population makes or selects J I'm just
mapping it back to the distribution over
permutation it is probability of all the
permutations where J
becomes the first offered item in there
in that list yes and completely the
assortment optimization problem is
finding the subset that maximizes this
objective of maximizes the expected
revenue from a random user in the
population and here I'm stating the
unconstrained version but you can have
constraints like budget like button a
cardinality or budget constraints or
more general constraint over yes I think
yes so is there a restriction that you
have to include a null choice because
otherwise what keeps the seller from
saying the only car I sell it Alexis you
gotta buy it
great so you know choice is there for
the users it's not up to the seller to
include or not include users have that
choice so if you do that then you will
have you will what you send for that you
will make hi revenue but your market
here will be very low
okay so as always includes now as always
eventually the new rule is not
gentleness as the set of products and
those are the set of preferences so the
preference is a permutation on the items
plus note okay and the set if they set
intersection the preferences nothing
then you know if you combine a collide
if there is therefore if you only offer
like this maybe if it's true that Nexus
is one of the options then what you say
the correct but if they keep null in
their preference before that then so
that's just a matter of semantics you
can think of s Malvinas always or null
hasn't as an outside thing and F is your
first so first like for once you should
okay I've seen so the fluid in fine is
with a total to the despite of the layer
recoiled okay
so okay so the two fundamental questions
in the failure are how to how to
estimate a choice model and then for
that model how to how to solve the
decision problem that is the assortment
assortment problem and and estimating a
choice model becomes particularly
difficult because you don't observe the
rankings of the users you only observe
their selections you offer a subset of
options you observe the selections not
their rankings so choosing what model to
estimate model selection becomes becomes
a difficult problem and as with most
problems there are these fundamental
trade-offs you can choose a simple model
that will be easy to estimate and and
solve the optimization problem but may
not be realistic in many settings or you
can go to a more richer model which
models more closely the reality but both
estimation and optimization become hug
it so in particular this slide exactly
shows this explicitly shows these
trade-offs multinomial logit model is is
the most widely used model in practice
which is essentially an extension of the
logistic regression models and this so a
multinomial logit is more is a n
parameter model one parameter for each
product and the choice probability is
dis proportional to that that parameter
corresponding to your father now you can
also go into the feature feature space
and then this parameter VI is a is a
function of the features of prototype it
and then you can even go to the feature
dimension then the parameters are d
instead of one okay and so the choice
probability it's just proportional to
this parameter via the estimation
problem and optimization problem are
both very simple in this model
in fact you can solve the decision
problem as an LP even when you have
cardinality constraints even with
metroid constrain this can be solved by
an L but this is a very simplistic model
in this in the sense that it satisfies
this III a property which is independent
of irrelevant alternatives meaning the
market share of product I and J is
independent of what subset of options
usually the ratio of the market shares
of ing that is independent of the rest
of the Barkers it that's very
restrictive it just think of a very
simple setting let's say the population
is divided half-and-half between red and
blue product in open on the politics and
so the V parameter for red and blue both
will be 1 now I introduced a red prime
that V also will come out to be 1 and
then this model would say 1/3 1/3 1/3
whereas you actually should be it should
be 1/4 1/4 and 1/2 that is what that
should happen so this is this is a very
simplistic doesn't model doesn't capture
real preferences so more general models
have been considered in particular
nested logit model mixture of
multinomial logit models in impact
mixture of multinomial logit model is is
very general and can almost can
approximate almost any distribution over
parameters but but then it both of these
generalization become harder to estimate
and optimize over in fact for mixture of
mnl models the assortment problem is in
the even the unconstrained version is
independent at heart Thanks so the
motivation for this this work actually
arose from from from trying to address
these trade-offs and even if I ignore
the computational complexity which model
should I should I select let's say I
ignore the computational complexity of
the
problem but which model should I pay and
the that was the basic motivation of
this risk this work towards designing a
towards to a designing algorithm for the
for the Mallos model so we started out
with looking at a very nonparametric
approach which is thinking about maximum
entropy distribution over permutations
and it turned out that values is a very
special case of Max and goofy
distribution and that had not been
addressed in the imitator and that
that's how this work really started so
I'm going to say maximum entropy minute
your to observe your dates in order to
pick the maximum entropy situations
explain the data exactly exactly so
let's say you have pairwise comparison
data
oh it's bare which Perez without some
terrible q IJ is the fraction of people
who prefer I do chip or the that's a you
have such data and you are for some
pairs from set of pairs not even
autographs saying which yellow what
structure people prefer and now find the
probability distribution over
permutations that is consistent with
these empirical observations so we have
you have a maximize example but so if
you consider triples this might be
inconsistent this right or is it uh so
what do you mean inconsistent so you're
looking at the probabilities over pairs
which of the two elements chosen if you
considered triples what is the
probability of each of these three
elements if they I guarantee that this
will necessarily be consistent with the
protection that you find as well or not
uh so arbitrarily no so if you give me
arbitrary data that will not be the case
but if you give me data which satisfies
the following but if you show me option
as a set of options s1 and set up option
x2 which is a superset of s1 then
probability of each of the option in s1
can only go down okay realtor Nick so
maybe I can use the room so if you have
you know Ted of option s and then
probability of G in S is only higher
than probability of changing so every
permutation preference from current
sinusitis and is this necessary
sufficient condition that that business
that that is necessary and you can find
a feasible permutation the distribution
over permutation that would satisfy if
you're giving a veterinary data than
then in suppose I said less than s the
visibility conditions for this guess
before Thank You Beth on addictiveness
you have a fair one pair wise data yes
for the power is data that clear
definitive conditions for pairwise data
any any any data would be feasible
I can I have like for example
ninety-nine percent prefer in and be 99
percent perform didn't see I cannot have
99 percent preferring season a here
let's do some sort of triangular quality
so what what is see yeah I don't think
we we have for characterization yeah so
we don't have a characterization of of
what what was it eight to physically
turn of the math entropy problem but
that this is of this is data and along
as data is coming away because this type
of
of preferences you're then okay it will
be researched it so so but so before I
go to describe our models let me just
mention this truly related work about a
nonparametric approach towards towards
modeling preferences which is but
instead of you above max entropy this
paper by Vivek for yes and quarters they
looked at sparse s distribution over
permutation that explains it
okay and they showed that in some
settings they can estimate such a model
but the assortment problem actually
becomes independence at heart for sparse
spots distribution impact for the
preferred model see in fact that is one
of the critiques that we had that if you
have if if you have support over these
spots distributions let's say you have
your support over a permutation 1 2 3 4
&amp;amp; 4 2 3 1 it's unlikely that you there
is no no probability of 2 1 3 4 so a
more smooth distribution is more natural
and in fact more robust as well so that
that was another motivation to consider
a smooth model which is a which is
palaces is an instance of that so in
fact we just to just to test the
conclusion what we did was we a complete
sushi data set which has ranking beta so
we only looked at the small data set
which for ranking 10 types of sushi and
there were this was the full data set
small five thousand full rankings of 10
types of sushi so we looked at the
empirical sparse model which is 1500
rankings for our training model and and
we fit a mixture of Mallos model on that
and we compare the out-of-sample
log-likelihood
on choices of between the empirical and
and a mixture of Mallos and this is what
we got that so in in mixture of 30
Mallos we were able to we were able to
match empirical with 1519 so we are
basically maintaining only 30 ranks as
opposed to 1500 empirical ranks it so
I've been talking about the Mallo so let
me define what the Mallos model is so
this is a distribution over permutation
model which is given by a mole
permutation Sigma naught and the scale
parameters theta a concentration
parameter theta where it says the
probability of any permutation Sigma
decays exponentially in the edit
distance from Sigma naught so so to
specify this model I just need to
specify you the mode permutation Sigma
naught and this concentration parameter
theta that completely specifies the
redistribution and now finding the
normalization coefficient is is not even
it now you can say you that even how how
do you even compute a probability of a
given permutation so that's not it
that's not a straightforward question
but and that's that's one of the
questions that we answer in this in this
world in particular what we want to
first of all do is even before we go to
assortment optimization we want to look
at the choice probability question so if
I give pure subsets what is the
probability that you will select an
option J a even simulation for instance
is not not fairly straightforward
it so so this worker let me let me give
you the punchline of our contribution so
we have an efficient algorithm which can
compute these twelve probabilities exact
in fact the algorithm is just solving
the system of linear equations a system
of smaller compact system of linear
equations now based on that that
algorithm we can formulate the
assortment optimization problem as a
compact mixed mixed integer program with
reasonable computation of performance
and also we can give a pitas for the
assortment optimization problem over the
mixture model under under an additional
assumption that I will get deleted so
the first goal is just given the model
competing in early yes so just the
normalization constant more than them so
I want to so given s this is the
probability P oops yes a second line so
it's going to be the sum over all
permutations where J was the first among
gets it so that could be exponential so
correctly for what class of models kept
you have efficient algorithms for
computing so most models that have been
considered in literature have closed
form expression multinomial logit is
that is a closed is a very simple small
miniature of multinomial logit is just a
estimate just a direct mixture lock a
light on the bow epsilon pointing Omiya
you also said it more than the opposite
distribution over perpetration whether
the number of segments can be very high
so that's an existential result by
McFadden and crane McFadden was was the
first to introduce the multinomial logit
in the again and whatever i wanted to
reconcile yes okay so the number of
segments could be our arbitrarily large
so that's an existential is a focus
yes okay so so let me first okay so let
me first tell you an interesting
property about the Mallos money so
Mallos model is actually a the
distribution is a stationary
distribution of the following Markov
chain it's a Markov chain over where
these each permutation is a state and
the tundish and you have a transition
between adjacent permutations and by
adjacent I mean there are one exists and
swap away and the probability of turns
are the transition properties if you are
moving away from the mode the
probability is e to power minus beta and
if you are moving towards for the it's
one it an appropriate normalization if
the normalization can be just 1 over N
alpha can be 1 over N that's it so also
doesn't correspond to anything in the
other model so actually I can put down
alpha equals 1 over N because there are
only n edges there are only n neighbors
right for every permutation you can only
have n edges and swaps so there are only
n neighbors if you are moving away the
probability you are if you're moving
away from Sigma naught in the distance
because probabilities be power minus
theta over N if you are moving towards
Sigma lot smaller number those who give
the same spatial distribution so I any
smaller alpha would also give the same
step as long as we they add up to 1 they
the condition property is that everyone
may come live it so that these are the 1
over N doesn't add up to 1 I like the
remaining 200 cell okay sorry is that
you need also Sigma is Sigma J to be
adjacent right yes it otherwise would
yes right now the formula doesn't
employment rate does I grow this plus or
minus one distance nobody could like
have like for example lightly okay
Angela yeah so I yeah sure so there they
need to be accessing if you would like
to treat it's to the right
crease left you looking at the video
yeah it's on I'm taking on this like
that I'm saving some work on of we're
doing situated and I believe they're on
opposite side together by hard evidence
but eclipse was very critical okay so so
once I have a month Markov chain then we
can use the well-known MCMC techniques
to adhere to approximate some cumin and
at least we have a way to compute choice
probabilities but I want to know that
this this was an exponential decay model
so for some products this probability
can be exponentially small but this will
may be important because they revenue
the price may be double exponential so
so this can lead to many many samples to
compute to get to that exponentially
small probability so it would be nice to
get an alternate way alternate algorithm
which is that it is that more efficient
than MCMC to to compute these choice
probabilities and fortunately this can
be done and we reuse an exact sampling
method for for getting an exact sample
of values distribution and this is work
by
flu and booty here in 2012 who gives the
following
proceed following algorithm to get an
exact sample of this permutation from
this model we algorithm in the following
so if let's say the mode is 1 to n ok so
you start with placing one now two can
be placed either to the right of one
to the length so I place to put a letter
preferences decrease and going right so
it can be due up can appear to the right
with probability 1 over 1 by 1 plus E
power minus theta and to the left the
probably power minus theta over 1 plus E
power minus theta it's because if I
split into the light there is no
disagreement with the mode if I place it
to the left there is one disagreement
with the with the mode so I would do
that now let's say a place to the right
now for 3
I have placing 3 I have 3 options if
there is a carrot here or head and I
just do it geometrically with geometry
clinical probability I place it to the
right to the most rightmost position
with this proportion to one's proportion
to e by minus theta and proportional to
V power minus 2 you seen here you can
sample the substring ex-player your legs
really doing the exactly exactly so this
is this this is not at work this was
already known in this prior work of
Lewin putting here that we can get an
exact sample and much more efficiently
than doing MC MC on on the exponential
scale one function is now but this has
further nice properties that I can
actually use this procedure in a dynamic
program setting to compute the joy
probabilities it and in particular what
we what we can see is well know the
starting point of this like that was an
algorithm that in Tampa you know the
success of Sigma 0 and I know Sigma 0
and theta yes
you know but then when you want to
complex learn you don't know yes
so then I learn
yes so in the learning so in that
smoothing the smooth mixture where I
compare the out-of-sample log likelihood
we had a heuristic EMP ristic to learn
so solving the log likelihood is not
confronting the problem that you're
trying to solve is assortment of
evaluation for a given model for another
where you know Sigma 0 and X so for
learning we need as we have we resort to
here with yes okay so so now we can
write we can emulate this computing
choice probabilities as the following
dynamic program so I will introduce the
following state Phi is K which is what
is the probability of selecting I add
position s when you only have inserted
one to K but in position position s in
your list and so there are K positions
so oh yes and as the different things
remove yeah yeah there's little s there
is a position is so what's the position
to position and step sorry also after
the KH step meaning after I have
inserted in my in my insertion procedure
I've inserted key items which is after I
will forget K items
what is so right now you you have a
random sample from 1 to k uh-huh
what is the probability that some item I
is chosen as the SS position in this
random our K and I is also the word is
mnemonic a yes yes ok our first thing is
everything is one left between running
yes ok ok so the formally so just to
just to illustrate it by example so let
us say my offer set
is 1 4 &amp;amp; 2 these are my options that
that are available if and I want to
compute this probability
what is the lovely that one appears at
position 2 in the random list 1 2 6 ok
so suppose I have the probability that
it appears at position 2 in the random
list from one to five now six can beans
so for one to keep out yelling at
position two six must either be inserted
after one if six of six inserts here I'm
fine and I know exactly what the
property of inserting fixes in it in
those locations it or one actually
appeared in position 1 and 6 goes before
these are the only two cases when that
one can keep appearing as position to in
the random list from 1 to 6 and so I
know I know the probability of these
blue dots and I know the probability of
this green square so I can just combine
I can just come back now product 6 is a
new product a chi which which I don't
know which I didn't have from before so
what is the probability of choosing
tottered 6 at position 2 in the random
list from 1 to 1 to 6 that's going to be
that all products are that are in my
offices are in position to all higher
because if something is that position 1
then I can't I cannot have successfully
symbol so as 6 should be inserted as
position ok so this is the only place so
so now this sets up my my system of
equations which is pi is k plus 1 is
probability that the k plus 1 volts at
the end inspire is K or if in for
in K plus-1 was before then I should
have appeared at X minus 1 and K plus 1
should not be in this one and similarly
you can write the equation for this so
this is a system of equations that I can
write and then the 12 probability of I
is just sum of all the positions of Pi
is M so that's that's a simple system of
the equation that will give you exact
choice probabilities and these are order
n cube per is an order thank you
available now if you have a mixture of
Mallos model with L mixtures this is
order n cube L n dispersed type of your
Protectorate and is the size of all the
items
what is firefighters Ohio Phi is PI or
PI F capital F toys probably a 1 given
the apartment
so here the assortment integers pi is i
+ 1 m in know so I can be chosen and any
position right but you really pick it if
it's the first one if it's the first one
when everything is alright but here only
that's a 1 for n 2 are offered so one
can it can be big there here here there
are three positions where you can
actually make a selections so the way
they visit you order or elements the
ones turned out besides known as an on
off or set and for the items we picked
up in position J it must be the case
that it must incorporate privileged as
all the elements before they are not
enough asset so they have no you can go
to a deeper positional so if there are n
elements and you only offer n by 2 so
you can go up to n by N by 2 positions
right your choice can be but the other
lists themselves matter right which
elements are in the set and which
elements are is a success how does that
figure in the familiar
okay so this is so XK plus one
so either keepers first it is inserted
to the right then it doesn't matter it's
awkward or not if it's inserted in the
in the front then it should not be
offered so PI of I s K is actually the
probability when only the sub s is
offered you have I being the s-1 within
the set s or overall no no so by I
escape is is probability that I is
chosen in position s okay from 1 to K so
the insertion procedure goes in soils so
after K steps of the insertion
procedures and want I to be the S
position I am unaware this success
figures in this may be I think other
confusion is of this little egg and gala
capital F is the set and little s is the
index of where in the grand
so is this pi is K does it depend on
capital S or not yes it depends so it
will be 0 for instance if I is not in it
so the key word I think is is chosen so
chosen means like that if they do
intersection of s and the if you look at
the ranking on one today
and when dukale's okay that'll be the
eyes for the first element appearing
both in s in escape the hiding element
appearing in both I take that I is the
head element is the element a big ass
appearing in both s and 0.92 cake so
then my hi-fi summation and not just PI
of I and 1 and because you're so when
you choose you may choose you may end up
choosing at any position in the list you
will choose the first item among the set
but that first item could appear at the
top of the list could be the second
could be the third that so there are 10
options and you only I wanting to give
you three options I only offer you three
then in your list your top choice among
the three options can appear at 1 2 up
to 7 foot or a poet position okay I
don't know so I think it may help if you
put an and after chosen I sigh the first
way I read this It was as if chose that
doesn't mean anything
oh it's Oh children meaning is you just
look at your preferences F intersection
1 to K and I might not want to use it
just saying it's just a suggestion for
your updating your size thank you okay
so okay so with this linear system you
can compute the choice probabilities
exactly and the running time for this
particular algorithm is if nql we can we
can do this more efficiently we can
shave off a pattern and get a M Square
log in using a different representation
of this linear system using Fourier
transform and and implementing a fast
Fourier transform
okay so now now to be assortment problem
it is we call the assortment problem is
let's say finding the subsets of options
that maximizes this expected revenue so
I want to just go back to this linear
system of equations that define much of
charge probabilities this this linear
system has this has been variables which
are it of same or we have these XK
little anything whether this k plus
first item is in the assortment or not
so that I have a math program already
there which is which is if I think of
these XK plus 1 as very
so my I can first of all of the bag
right out right down a mixed integral
formulation is a non linear formulation
because my variables are fives and X's
so both X and PI are my variables which
makes it lon not only for bi-linear but
I can linearize these products of X K
and Phi I by five you set up introducing
the new variable and I'm just adding
these constraints and so right away I
can get a mixed integer program based
integer linear program with order n cube
variables to solve the assortment
problem sorry you're saying
ribbity you have this reaction time is
dinner eyes thing sort of what's the
issue and it's how to represent the top
the maximum how do I represent reminder
the the objective function is not by
Lydia don't give the function of linear
spices are fixed and pie was was
submitted by five objective function is
linear but constraints were nonlinear
because one you have a product of one
minus XK times pi and you have a product
of XK time pipe so both X and PI are
variable okay but once you introduce is
wise yes then you need to replace the
PI's by a while the top so I would
replace XK times pi X K 10 spike will
this this product by this variable and I
would add in these constants so this is
a standard linear regression of my
linear term but I am still constraining
XK to be 0 for 1 are you sorry for this
okay so in that by creating a program so
so this makes cuckoo and so so just to
think of it we have a distribution
which which are the support of n
factorial and a nice way of formulating
the mix the program would have would
have exponentially many variables so
here we get a compact mixed integer
program it's not polyline but - that's a
start
so because they're more instead of NGO
we can get to n square also bit so the
first thing we did was we tested out
this formulation and we saw that I see
it skills skills reasonable for a size
40 problem that's that's a huge problem
in in the disk permutation space it
and for whether for instance if the
parameter is 0.85 it solvent assume
roughly two minutes in but you would
should notice that there are some some
outliers okay so there this doesn't this
is not not really scalable I can't claim
this is just given you you use it as a
black box it but then we take the bit
deeper and we saw what is happening in
the solver so I have these instances of
that hard instance of that hard
parameter setting N equals 14 and the
parameter mean point 9 so I have the
visuality gap that the solver of in so
within a very quickly the solvent was
able to find a good solution if the rest
of the time was spent in closing the
duality gap which just means that a
relaxation is very bad and that actually
this is the the pastor that I this is
the part that is actually point back
this relaxation we're relaxing this
product this binding a product using BC
I'm saying that is very bad and there we
have some some idea that apply
relaxation so I thought that's an exact
formula if you have X giving 0 or 1 but
the solver will be solving relaxation
and doing a project cut but the
relaxation is bad which is the case as
confirmed by this as confirmed by
by these is two already gaps the time
taken to close paternity and so we have
some some ideas where with to close this
to have a tighter formulation that we
are exploring but another question is
what about the poly time algorithm can
we say something can we get a near
optimal algorithm that runs in
polynomial time and we have some we have
some good news on that item but we need
an assumption
so no assumption is not possible because
I felt the the assortment optimization
over sparse is independent set time
therefore minister of Mallos will
capture the sparse also with
appropriately appropriate scale or
concentration factors okay so I kind of
missed it from your table it was he was
doing early at point nine at high
concentration left a low concentration
26 to engine so if you make this
parameter 0.99 then it's a uniform 0.999
then executed form then the formulation
should run fast so if the parameter is
very good then also it's it's okay
there's some some range will where it
actually becomes hard so secrecy was
Sebastian is the venison quiz but where
is it
this should be the easy setup right so
the guineas item will be uniform for
instance Oliveri want to do the it gets
ethical on the other one should be that
turn a little bit but then you should
have like a good approximate of
reservation should agree so it's not
monotone just using the daily front
solution should be good approximation so
that depends on with the prices but even
if the fees are way now if the fees are
arbitrarily high an arbitrary go then
then uniform may not be as well but yes
in a reasonable as all these are between
one
I could be a good person okay so we'll
do a near optimal algorithm in fact we
can give a give up meters for particles
for assortment optimization and that
mixture of Mallos model but under an
assumption if the assumption that we
need is let's think about the single
Mallos model and think about the
preference of users for products which
are which are less preferred to the
nobody's to the none option so they are
the assumption we need is you user not
indifferent between options that are
less preferred to the no purchase option
in the mode which means is different yes
so let me try and so let's say our mode
for Mallos distribution is the focus the
following one - well then you have none
and then you have L +1 to 1 okay that's
like this or that one then I'm saying
the real distribution is a uniform
mixture of these n - oh it should be n
minus L factorial modes where the first
LR 1 to n but n plus 1 to n appear in a
random order that could make users
indifferent between L plus 1 to on
happen if a little bit strange because
they could pick a product and make it
the no purchase it could pick product L
so in say that the prod the price of
product L is absolute so conceptual now
access the node from so they're not
purchases I don't see this in the
special products over yeah in the in the
Mallos model yes it was not a special
product it is really in the application
nobody is always going to stick in the
apartment I mean I don't know if I feel
I can wash questions get there is no
personal positions yes okay I only could
remove full assortment for putting
second up nobody and so under this
setting we can we we can give pitas in
fact
an algorithm which which has running
time polynomial in n to the 1 over
epsilon and K if K is the number of so
number of measures
what's to consider to the script is an
over absol you know they yeah so I'm
coming to coming to that impact the
algorithm is very simple
the algorithm depends on the following
the probabilistic property about the
model that if you look at any two
products I can J such that I was better
than J in the board I was more preferred
to J in the more then probability that I
remains preferable to J is at least half
this is an easy argument for Marlowe's
in fact you can make you can prove this
for more general class of models arising
out of approaching stationary
distributional or the Markov chain in
fact we can prove a more general
property which is let's take nem options
I 1 I 2 I am and this is the order this
is very restricted order in the mode
then probability that MX option becomes
the else among these is at most one over
m it so we can prove this by a coupling
argument on a sample path basis so look
at all sample paths where I M is is
whether we can cover them with other
sample paths where one of the other
option is better and therefore we can
partition the sample path into into
embarkation show that this sample paths
or these samples will will be will fill
up the D stop go fix it so so these
these properties allow us to allow us to
prove the following structure result
about onion of ml solution it is among
these options
users are indifferent so just pick the
top K prices some from most expensive
products from its among these products
there is a near optimal solution where
you only need to pick at most one over
epsilon right in fact the the idea is
the following that let's say s star is
the optimal solution you look at the
intersection with these these items and
pick the top one over epsilon priced
items from these guys probability that
the null becomes better then the top one
over epsilon is only epsilon gets an
average over this choice and then you
enumerate over the choice and since you
are enumerated and this this part was
simple you were only picking the top few
you can handle a wide variety of budget
functions it so this gives us the this
gives us the algorithm and you you can
get a 1 minus epsilon approximation
again this is probably not not practical
in the setting in in the sense that you
end to the 1 over epsilon so we didn't
even attempt to compare to our width but
it at least gives us a theoretical
footing that this model may be easy
under at least some assumptions and r4
we want to push up on is the structural
results about the problem probabilistic
of games and properties of the Mallos
models and and also the ideas that we
needed to develop the mixed integer
programming formulation to push towards
an exact algorithm for Manos Moses that
is something that we don't know doesn't
exist so we don't have any any hardness
result about about the mouse Palace
model and my conjecture rather we should
be able to get an exact algorithm
so I want to go back to something that
that that I started with the relation
and this is where we actually started
the journey of thinking about mixture of
mellows was a nonparametric approach and
and the max entropy distribution over
over permutations so suppose you're
given this data which is pairwise
comparisons of some of the some of the
curves a fraction of people who prefer I
teach it now you can write this convex
program to find the max entropy
distribution P Sigma is from probability
over permutation Sigma and you are
trying to maximize the entropies subject
to consistency with data it's well known
that the solution to this is an
exponential family of this form and so
basically this can be represented by a
month by a low stationary distribution
over the Markov chain with with
appropriate transition probabilities and
edges only with between edges in between
adjacent permutations meaning they have
180 since walk away okay
and this is exactly and then this is a
waste manual is a special case of this
max entropy distribution over favor it
and that was the point that I that I
wanted to bring out earlier so our hope
is with at this point I don't have any
further illusion about max entropy but
the hope is that under some assumptions
we can use these ideas to build upon and
develop a framework an algorithm for max
entropy so given data we can find the
distribution so we can compute these
lambda it is we can sample from them so
we can compute false positives
using MCMC again but MCMC doesn't give
any anything to doesn't give us any
framework to build towards a towards an
assortment optimization question so
that's something that it wants to go
further than P Sigma so this one is just
writing the Lagrangian and taking the
KKT and it is actually easy to compute
so these are not easy like these are not
straightforward to compute because you
will have exponentially many constraints
in this world so I can't compute P Sigma
but I would just want to compute lambda
I T so the number of variables is small
but the constraints are are
exponentially many so I need an
ellipsoid I need to develop an ellipsoid
that's specific for this application and
we can do that for this particular small
so that is so what's so Baylor if it's
there in the result by a machine
Krishna way and move it sing it appeared
I think in sports career two three years
ago where they show that SAP if you can
sample it can give me a sampler you can
optimize and they were using that to
compute max entropy distributions in the
same model not in this model they will
no no no they were looking at a max
entropy distribution over trees and with
some marginals in other settings but we
we need that framework and we were able
to design a sampler for our dual problem
to solve the separation problem overall
would make sugar is also and curiously
the version really can express a
conjecture is what does that but the
sampler should answer that
so ellipsoid will at the end say
infeasible no that's really true this
should be easier yeah my little bit more
rational answers when a instruction
search if you want to calculate the
polytope that's to come
Commissioner for the permutation issues
what's better is as well for a moment
that is just welcome and honest but
that's not what this is the then the key
right is that the book of Solomon also
there should be that fits anyone again
what is the protection of the book
employment it will be the projection of
the work of and projection computation
is not easy
sorry I can write the bulk of the
weinerman polytope that's fine but
projecting on to the few ideas it's not
difficult actually am NOT trading one
every permutation you get like doing it
I get a type of conversation to get an
in square vector of that type now so you
can get so there is a more compact
representation also with any login where
you permute a hetero this is the record
by michelle go woman's so i want to find
the convex hull of permutations of 1 to
n right right the description so it has
a compact representation in the extended
dimension with n log n variables and
order n log n constraints so what is
your question before you're curious
about what kind of some kind here is
about a given Q I J matrix if you can
check if the result set of permutations
the generated qrj matrix so much
criminal anointing I guess saying it's
not possible because that could mean
that you can I get something that we can
actually characteristic let me here if
you characterize the bounds of and you
gave the problem I say is say mark Osama
promptly camps right because this how to
receive both the binding here I mean
that's just mentioned especially which
it is advice whether I will to a
combination
just another example the feedback
hardship I'd say one of the older
devices of crafts and a problem is
basically finding information of
knowledge that maximizes on the object
here on the pairwise parity undetermined
so if you can calculate the power tools
we can just like in optimizers really
could be true to return me uh
so maybe the integral solution which is
a little only thing I think resolution I
think I said anything all solution but
if the palatal and your question is to
characterize the palatal that effect
convex combination of all details right
if you could do that if you could
characterize it as a great America
educators from optimize over their
answers and also but the tension will
get is I the this point this is that the
interests or the verses the widgets like
Israel like a party and maturity rows of
the data to commute o or whatever to
make your leading this is like this is
fine this is one medical this is one
boiling for data might want to say you
know you can it's going to get out of
infinity even a matrix if I'm gonna
shading expression of complex financial
again this big easy
we're isolating and if you get into that
then record such as a an expressive
those variables text hae here incident
so a small energy visitor and creation
posted it on yet I agree little editing
thankfully to do is already just as good
just to just to include that so we
started out with the weather with our
goal towards a nonparametric approach
which remains the goal but in the
process we were able to look at a smooth
distribution over permutations models
which i think is more natural and more
robust and a develop algorithms for
efficient choice for any computation and
using that app it does and also a
computationally practical algorithmic I
I still think that this is this is
possible that exact assortment
optimization overvalues mixture of Manos
would need some assumptions we cannot do
it it is independent circuit even
mixture of two values might be np-hard
but single values might be doable so
that's something that we're still trying
to push but one other thing that I want
to mention and connect to the talk that
I that I gave last year in some follow
you your your there is is this new class
of models where choice probability is a
linear system of equations and we don't
know the parameters of that linear
system so instead of going through the
other route of of recovering the utility
model that defines the Peris defines the
preferences which is what multinomial
logit and mixture of multinomial logit
stream of literature has been doing if
you think about just choice probability
as a linear system in some dimension
here the dimension was extended
dimension of thank you board so fix the
extended dimension it's a linear system
in that dimension try to learn the
parameters of that linear system so we
can borrow week we can map it to a lot
of work that is that is out there in
learning linear system out of
observations which are solutions of that
hideous system
and that also maps to a model another
model that I represented which was
Markov chain over-over product space
defining preferences so you're walking a
Markov chain over over the state space
of products that defined your presence
and that is also a linear system of
equations and so thank you this was
based on these two papers with my
students and co-authors both of which
are available Edmund thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
