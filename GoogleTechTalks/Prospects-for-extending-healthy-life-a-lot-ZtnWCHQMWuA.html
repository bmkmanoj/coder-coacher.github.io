is you're not Carson here and I'm am
hosting a bridge agree and we have a
very interesting talk ahead of us this
talk is being recorded for a google
video maybe put up here for public
consumption so please don't ask any
google confidential questions the name
of the talk is prospects for extending
healthy life and hopefully doing it a
lot so ordered three gays biomedical
jailer on 3 lists based in cambridge UK
and it's a chairman and science chief
science officer through Methuselah
foundation says non charity nonprofit
charity and their competiting the aging
process and i will let him himself
introduced to the wrestle fears thank
you very much your nurse and thank you
everyone for coming before i start i
should say two things first of all if
you want to ask questions interrupt
during the talk that's perfectly fine it
doesn't bother me at all i don't know
what the convention is here but from my
point of view that's okay and the second
thing is i have been asked that when
someone asks the question whether it
during the talk or at the end but I must
repeat the question so that it gets on
tight properly and I'm going to forget
so set everyone if I if I don't repeat
the question please remind me even if
you did hear it yourself all right well
here I'm going to try and get through an
awful lot of material in the next 45
minutes in fact it's going to be pretty
obvious pretty quickly that I'm only
going to be able to scratch the surface
of the stuff I work on and that's really
good news because I'm going to be
talking about technological advances
that I hope to see happen in the next
few decades and to have demonstrated in
feasibility within let's say one decade
in the laboratory and stuff that is a
decade away even from proof of concept
of course often doesn't happen so the
question is really what can one do to
you know to to decide whether something
is likely or is unlikely to happen in 10
years time
one big component of that is how much
detail do we already have with regard to
the way that we're going to go about it
and as you will see the amount of detail
that there is in the plan that I'm going
to be summarizing for you today is well
you would need to have me back every day
for a year to hear and it had me run out
of things to tell you so first of all I
thought I would just start with an
advisement I live in Cambridge in the UK
and every other year I ran a conference
which showcases all the-- well as many
as possible anyway of the various
strands of biology that i've brought
together into the big plan that i have
for defeating aging it happens this sep
tember and any of you can come I would
be delighted Cambridge is a beautiful
place to visit and that's a good time of
the attitudes and the ambience is very
is very conducive to learning a loss the
conference it all happens in one place
you live and eat and hear the lectures
in the same place the alcohol is free
every night all night and it said so so
yeah please please do come along with
the website for you to have a look at
all right so this is how I'm going to
break down the next 45 minutes first of
all I'm going to talk about something
that I've been calling longevity escape
velocity which well as you can see it
essentially it's a really it's a line of
reasoning that it's pretty obvious
actually especially to people with an IT
background but so I probably go through
it quite quickly but it gets me in an
awful lot of trouble essentially it's
the main reason why I think that a lot
of people alive today have a pretty damn
good shot at living four digit lifespans
then in the second part of the talk I'm
going to be describing how i think we're
going to do the first steps of that
giving people about 30 years of extra
life but in particular giving those 30
years to people who are already in
middle age before we do anything to them
and then finally I'm going to give a
brief summary of the work of the
foundation that I am the chairman and
chief science officer of and not just
what we're doing at the moment which to
be perfectly honest isn't actually very
much yet but also where we
expect and hope to be over the next few
years so I'm gonna start here and this
is the sort of statement that I tend to
make in public and an awful lot of my
colleagues in work on the biology of
aging which I wouldn't it's a pretty
straightforward and concrete numerical
statement that the first person to lift
1,000 is probably less than 20 years
younger than the first person to left
150 in case you didn't know the oldest
that anyone had ever lived so far is 122
a French lady named John come on who
died about 10 years ago and to get 250
it's going to be very difficult but I
shall try to persuade you over the next
probably only five or ten minutes in the
first part of the talk that by the time
we've done vas it'll all be starting to
get rather easier and also get going on
this I have to give you a brief
definition of what aging is because I
know that a number of people here are
probably got a little bit of biology
expertise but aging is something that
even a lot of biologists don't really
understand even in very fundamental ways
um the first thing to know about aging
is that we don't have James Forrest we
have James to defend against aging and
when different organisms different
species have different lifespans that's
because the long-lived organisms have
better anti-aging genes not because they
have less good pro aging genes this is
something that's been understood within
gerontology for over 50 years now
essentially we can't have jeans for
aging because aging doesn't happen
enough in the wild organisms just very
rarely die of Aging and therefore
there's no phenotype to have a genotype
for now mechanistically what aging is
it's a side effect of being alive in the
first place it's something you already
know obviously but i thought i would say
it out in this term in these terms
metabolism has side effects and these
side effects build up during life and
eventually they're bad for us they get
in the way of metabolism and stop
metabolism from being able to perform at
full function and that's what I'm
calling pathology eventually frailty and
eggs related diseases begin to emerge
and finally I want to point out the
pathology call is more pathology in
other words
things spiral out of control the more
the frailer you are they more rapidly
you get frailer still now the one thing
I want to highlight on here that seems a
little bit innocuous but it's very
important that you understand for the
rest of the talk is my use of this word
damage I'm going to be using this word
damage in this very precise way you
should consider these two middle lines
here as being the definition of the term
damage for the purpose of this talk so
damaged I'm using to mean the set of
intermediaries between metabolism and
pathology the set of molecular and
cellular phenomena that occur during
life ongoingly that are laid down as
changes in the body starting from before
we're born even and that eventually
start to cause decline in function in
other words pathology that's the way I'm
going to be using the word damage now if
we bear in mind what I've showed you on
the previous slide we can conceptualize
well really four different ways of
intervening in aging and postponing the
age at which we become frail and
pathology starts to emerge um one of
those ways is not depicted on this slide
and it's the way that you may have heard
a little bit about it includes things
like calorie restriction and drugs that
print that trick the body into thinking
that if not getting enough food when in
fact it is calorie restriction is a very
interesting phenomenon that essentially
causes organisms to hunker down and put
more effort into postponing their own
aging than into other things that
organisms normally have to do like
reproduction and exactly what's going on
there is no still controversial there's
a lot of work being done I'm not going
to talk about today but the real reason
why it's an exception is that there are
genes for that sort of modulation of
aging it's just that there's only so
much they can do and it looks as though
they can't do very much for long-lived
organisms like humans so the three other
alternatives for postponing aging are
depicted on this slide while I'm calling
the geriatrics approach is basically
pathology is beginning to emerge
the idea is to slow down the rate at
which damage causes this pathology and
pathology continues to accelerate these
arrows with the flatheads that's a
notation that comes from the genetic
literature and it means inhibits so this
is just saying that geriatricians are
about trying to slow down the rate at
which damage translates into pathology
and that's all very well but because of
what I told you a moment ago the
pathology is a downward spiral it causes
more pathology and because the damage is
continuing to accumulate um you're
basically stuffed you can only get this
keep this going for a short while before
the problem of holding pathology back
just overwhelms any technology that the
geriatrician might be able to apply so
it's a losing battle now the gerontology
approach said I'm calling it says well
okay prevention is better than cure
maybe let's dive in really at the
beginning of this chain of events let's
try and clean up metabolism and make it
lay down this damage I'm talking about
more slowly than it normally would and
that would of course have the beneficial
effect of delaying the age at which the
damage reaches a level that causes
pathology that's all very well but
there's one big big problem with that
because we don't have James for aging as
I told you earlier in order to clean up
metabolism we don't just have to switch
off one or two pro aging genes we
actually have to improve on evolutions
extraordinarily sophisticated and
elaborate mechanism for making us age as
slowly as we do already and that's a
very tall order evolution is much much
much cleverer than we are and we do not
understand metabolism very well at all
yes and it'll be a very long time before
we understand it anything like well
enough to be able to go in and tinker
with it in the manner that an engineer
might tinker with a car of course the
fact that it's very very complicated is
only part of the problem the other
problem is that we don't have the plans
but basically it's it's it's just an
idea that's well ahead of its time now
interestingly those two approaches are
really the only two that have been
considered historically and the major
innovation that I think I can claim to
have made in the field is to point out
that there is a third approach what I'm
calling here the engineering approach to
postponing age
which seems quite likely to be more
feasible by virtue of avoiding both of
the problems I just spoke about the
engineering approach says well okay that
this damage I'm talking about there are
these intermediate these gradually
accumulating intermediates between
metabolism and pathology that are laid
down as a side effect of being alive and
that eventually cause pathology now that
eventually part is very useful because
what it means is that that a threshold
level of damage that we can put up with
perfectly well and if we can just go in
and reasonably thoroughly repair that
damage and thereby get rid of some of it
or most of it then we're buying time
during which metabolism may lay down
some more but we can go in again and get
rid of some more damage and if we can do
this well enough then we end up
postponing perhaps indefinitely the age
at which pathology emerges by virtue of
damage being too abundant from
metabolism to cope with and this has the
advantage that it's sufficiently
pre-emptive that it's not in the
geriatricians downward spiral it doesn't
allow authority to emerge but it's also
sufficiently late in the chain of events
that it doesn't involve actually
understanding metabolism and therefore
cleaning it up it involves messing
around with the initially inert side
products of metabolism and that makes it
a lot easier um now that's actually only
one of the three reasons why I think the
engineering approach is the way to go
the second reason is going to be the
subject to the next few minutes and it's
the concept of longevity escape velocity
I mentioned earlier now here I am
depicting in an extremely formalized
schematic way the aging process and I'm
talking about this thing called reserve
now that's not a new concept that's
simply the same concept is damaged that
I mentioned earlier but it's the
reciprocal in other words of damage
accumulates so we have less and less
return you can think of reserve as the
amount of additional damage that we can
afford to accumulate before pathology
begins to begins to happen so we've got
here in a very scimitar sort of way what
happens during life we've got a lot of
reserve
and eventually we have very little and
we get down to one calling the frailty
threshold where pathology starts to
emerge and eventually we die supposing
we develop an intervention that slows
down the rate at which damage
accumulates by let's say a factor of 2
and we apply to someone who's already in
middle age so starting here then we
might double the the time before the
belted threshold is reached and that's
good that means we're giving this person
or a bit of extra healthy life after we
reach the frailty threshold things spin
out of control in the manner i said
earlier and it becomes very hard much
harder even to slow down the process so
for purposes of illustration and
presuming that this slope here is the
same as it was when we weren't doing
anything the question is can we do any
better than this and the big thing about
the engineering approach is that it's
not simply slowing down the rate at
which damage accumulates it's actually
getting rid of damage that's already
accumulated so we can imagine a
situation like this again here I'm
talking about an intervention that half
solves the problem so the blue line down
here slow down the rate of accumulation
of damage by a factor of two here I'm
saying we invent a repair strategy that
gets rid of half the damage and in order
to describe which half I'm just saying
there is I'm just saying by definition
there's an easy half and a hard half the
easily half is the half that the therapy
works on and the hard half is the half
that the therapy doesn't work on so that
we do this once and then we can wait for
a while and of course damage continues
to accumulate at the rate that it
normally accumulates because remember
we're not interfering with metabolism
itself here and both then we can apply
the therapy again and again and you know
it's pretty good it's not perfect
because the stuff that the therapy
doesn't work on is continuing to
accumulate unabated and so of course
eventually just the hard damage on its
own is going to be enough to take the
person over the frailty threshold the
whole concept here reaches diminishing
returns but it's still a lot better than
if we were only slowing down the
accumulation of subsequent damage now
that's pretty good but a guy is not good
enough if we were mice that would be the
end of my story
cause the x-axis here would be on the
scale of two or three years and not a
lot happened in technology in two or
three years but a great deal tends to
happen in technology including
biomedical technology in let's say 20
years and the interval that I'm showing
here between this first application of
these therapies in the second one might
be let's say 20 years so if we bear that
in mind then what we can actually
predict with reasonable confidence is
that by the time we apply these
therapies to these people the second
time they will not only be able to fix
the types of damage that they could
previously fix they will also be able to
fix for purposes of illustration half of
the damage that they could not
previously fix so we get the brown line
that we see here with a sort of more
thorough rejuvenation restoration of an
earlier younger biological age at the
second application of the therapies and
I think you can probably see where this
is going the long run is that the health
of the person goes and gets better as
time goes on the amount of reserve they
have increases rather than decreasing
and this is why I can talk about this
concept of longevity escape velocity of
being good enough to live forever in
that in this scenario we never develop
therapies that can actually repair all
of the damage that is accumulating as a
side effect of metabolism but we
approach that goal fast enough to keep
the overall level of damage within the
bounds that metabolism can cope with and
um I'm going to introduce these two
tongue these two phrases now these two
terms that I like to use they term
robust human rejuvenation is if you like
the first step of the graphs I've been
showing you the addition of something in
the region of 30 extra years of healthy
life and therefore also of total life or
perhaps more to people who are already
in middle age at the time that the
treatment begins that's my quantitative
definition of where we have to get to
for this sort of iterative buying time
to
to get going and what it results in is
longevity escape velocity so my
definition of that is here the rate at
which rejuvenation therapies need to
improve following the achievement of
robust human rejuvenation in order to
outpace the accumulation of damage that
those therapies cannot yet repair now
that's very very abstract and those of
you who know a bit of biology may be
thinking well yes maybe in principle but
I don't really believe it's going to
happen on a time soon anyway um the
first answer I have to vas again is not
yet biological per se but it's a little
bit more sophisticated in its abstract
sense I got together with an excellent
programmer in New York Chris Phoenix um
about a year ago and the paper that we
have just recently had accepted for
publication reports the results or
rather a reasonably sophisticated
simulation of the process I've been
talking about the accumulation of damage
the translation of that damage into
pathology and mortality and the
postponement of that process using
interventions coming along at a
particular schedule and I won't go
through the details of this because I've
got so much else to talk about but in
summary we had a lot of additional
features of the aging process built into
the simulation that are over and above
the summary that I've given you in the
graphs I showed for example we have the
concept of many different types of
damage any of which could independently
kill us which is certainly the way that
aging really is and therefore all of
which have to be borne down upon to a
certain rate we break those dads and
down into subtypes of damage that are
additive we have the concept of feedback
where the damage accelerates more damage
we have heterogeneity in the population
we have the concept of risk of external
influences and this is the simulation
which obviously I'm not going to try to
describe to you today and by way of
validating that it was a sensible
simulation we determined how well we
could predict we could fit existing
real-world mortality data this was from
the USA in 1999 the yellow line is the
standard
that such data are described which is
called the gun parts fit the orange line
is the actual data and the green line is
the simulation and you can see it fits
the orange line rather better than the
gompertz fit does this is the rate at
which damage accumulates which is also
intuitively realistic you can see that
there's more heterogeneity in the
population at knowl arrangement at a
younger age damage is accumulating maybe
twice as fast as old age as it is during
early adulthood so this is all the sort
of thing we would expect to see and the
result was that if we take a bunch of
cohorts of people of various ages at the
point where this therapy arrives we can
tour begins to arrive where the first
therapy arrives we can predict we can
simulate what sort of trajectory their
damage profile would actually show and
so the top line here is how much damage
someone has if they were already 80
years old before the first therapies
arrived and it's a bit jagged at first
because the therapies are arriving at an
irregular intervals and you've got to
have other fave got to have some
intervention in all of the various types
of damage in order to get progress but
eventually things start coming down of
course if you were younger 70 or 60 or
50 and so on at that time then you never
get to then your peak damage is
progressively lower now what this means
for how long you're going to live is is
described here if you're 80 this is the
bottom line if you're 80 when the first
therapist arrives it's basically not
good enough because you spend so long in
a very frail state where your risk of
death in each year is relatively high
but basically by the time things could
have recovered you're going to be all
dead anyway just statistically but if
you were only ten years younger 70 year
old when the therapies arrived then ten
percent of you may get through to the
point where you have a negligible chance
of dying of aging and you can see if you
look if you can see the numbers those
who the back but we can't the numbers on
the x-axis here are basically 50 years
old hundred years old hundred and fifty
two hundred two hundred and fifty
essentially however old you were when
the therapies arrived if you get through
at all to the age of two hundred and
fifty you basically
no times of dying of aging whatsoever
only of being hit by trucks and stuff
like that and of course depending on how
old you were your chance of actually
getting to that age is according to
these simulations these sort of numbers
so that's the whole concept and of
course if I want to argue whether this
is plausible we can look at the progress
of Technology in other areas of just use
powered flights here is an illustration
you know it took a very long time from
the point where we decided flying would
be fun to the point where we work out
how to do it but after that you know we
made pretty unimaginable amounts of
progress by a sequence of incremental
advances and refinements in Rosalie
short order you know I don't think the
Wright brothers really had in mind the
concept of flying across the Atlantic
any time during the 20th century and yet
Lindbergh did it only 24 years after the
Wright brothers you know passenger jet
liners in 1949 only 22 years after
Lindbergh Concorde only 20 years after
the comet so this is the sort of rate of
progress that we saw there and of course
as we all know a similar story can be
seen in more or less any technology
where public enthusiasm is present so
computers of course the combating that
combating of infectious diseases you
name it it's there another thing I want
to point out here some of you may be
thinking well that's all very well you
know maybe we have to increase the rate
that we have to double the efficacy of
these therapies every 40 years or so but
supposing we just have a really bad
century sometime in the future you know
and we just happened to make no advances
we hit some nasty problems then we're
all screwed yummy but no that's not true
because it turns out that the further we
go in this process the slower we can
continue to go in this illustration i'm
just showing that the first therapies
fix half the damage the second one only
fixes a third of the damage that the
previous one couldn't fix twenty years
later only a quarter of the remaining
damage and so on and it still stays well
above the frailty threshold that sort of
situation is probably quite well
illustrated by looking at vintage cars
classic cars this car obviously was
built only to last maybe 10 or 15 years
and it's actually more than 100 years
old and it's working every bit as well
as when it was built I mean obviously
it's oh but it's not really old it's
just an old-fashioned it's working just
as well as when it rolled off the
production line except they didn't have
production lines back then um but yeah I
mean so at this point I mean key point
is that the people who are maintaining
these cars they're doing an awful lot to
them but they're not doing any more to
them than they were let's say 50 years
ago when that when the car was only
three times as old and it was ever
supposed to be so this is the sort of
equivalent of essentially negligible
escape velocity that we will be
achieving in the fullness of time all
right that's enough of longevity escape
velocity because as I say most people
who have an IT background tend to get
that idea faster than I can even get the
words out now I'm going to talk about
how we're going to get those 30 years in
the first place because of course when I
talk about this phrase that you may have
seen in the press engineered negligible
senescence in other words giving middle
initially middle aged people unlimited
extra healthy life what I'm actually
talking about for the reasons I've
described in the past 10 minutes is
giving them about 30 years of extra
healthy life and this is all I'm going
to be able to tell you about the overall
plan I'm going to go into detail on just
one component of this but in very broad
strokes what I have been trying to argue
over the past probably six or seven
years now is that the damage that I
spoke about and have defined in this
abstract terms so far as the
intermediates between metabolism and
pathology this damage in concrete
biological terms can be classified into
just seven major categories that I have
here um you know things like cells dying
and not being naturally replaced by the
division of other selves indigestible
molecules accumulating in the space
between ourselves things like amyloid
plaques in Alzheimer's disease
cross-linking things like new molecular
bonds forming between long-lived
proteins in for example the artery wall
this is a major cause of high blood
pressure in the elderly and so on and
the key point is that we know in a fair
amount of detail how to go about
addressing all of these things and when
I say addressing of course I do not mean
simply slowing down the accumulation of
these types of damage I mean going in
powering these types of damage or in a
couple of cases actually in the case of
the mutations making them harmless
obviating the damage rather than getting
rid of it um so I'm going to just talk
about one of these things number six
down here the elimination of
indigestible molecules that accumulate
inside cells and I've chosen that one
because well firstly because it's
something that until I came along people
thought was pretty much impossible and I
proposed a new approach to this that is
gaining a great deal of attention and
work is being done on it so it's worth
talking about and also because it's
glamorous now first of all why do in
digestibility lols matter well the
answer is they are responsible for some
of the nastiest and most prevalent
diseases of old age things like
Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis in
Alzheimer's disease and indeed in
Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative
diseases you get this sort of thing
happening you get things that would
normally go up and down the axon the
long part of the neuron between the cell
body and the synapse they stop being
able to do this I sort of traffic jam
form that's like this with stuff that
hasn't been digested properly and gets
very much more elaborate and generally
messed up and things just stop traveling
and the neuron isn't very happy and you
can imagine in real life this is what it
looks like this is a district near ice
with lots of junk lying around things
that are in the process of being broken
down but they're not being broken down
this is immunoelectron microscopy for a
couple of enzymes that are supposed to
be involved in breaking these things
down and are simply failing to do so and
in atherosclerosis the situation is
rather the same the course of
atherosclerosis is absolutely lifelong
even in children you can see the early
stages of it when it called fatty
streaks in the artery wall essentially
the accumulation of indigestible lipid
molecules such as oxidized derivatives
of cholesterol and this is the sort of
thing that's supposed to happen in the
artery wall there are cells called
macrophages that go in that and are
supposed to metabolize cholesterol and
derivatives of it cholesterol esters in
a well-studied and well-understood
pathway and this pathway stops working
especially in this part of the cell
called the lysosomes
so you get this sort of thing going on
you get these lysosomes that are very
large and completely full of lipid and
they've forgotten how to process it and
these cells accumulate and eventually
they essentially die and you get an
accumulation of these cells that's the
fatty streak and atherosclerosis is on
its way so the question is what can we
do about this and the idea I brought
into the field was that we could use the
technology from a strand of
environmental decontamination astron
called bioremediation which owed itself
to an insight from about 50 years ago
that is called the microbial
infallibility hypothesis believe it or
not the idea is that microbes have to
have an ecological niche and most
microbes don't grow very fast &amp;amp; microbe
the can grow very fast can just get by
by not being very intelligent and just
by using the nutrients that any other
bacterium could use and it will
out-compete them but if you don't go
very fast then the alternative is only
to eat something that your competitors
can't eat so if in an environment that
there's a lot of competing bacteria that
happens to be an abundant source of
organic material that energy rich but is
for whatever reason difficult to break
down then that constitutes selective
pressure for those bacteria to evolve
the ability to break it down and the one
that can that gets that property first
or most effectively has its ecological
niche because it's the only bacterium
that can break down this particular
substance so it turns out that if you go
to let's say a disused airfield and you
um want to get rid of the TNT that's in
the soil so that you can build houses on
it the what you're doing is to actually
get the a sample of soil from the
airfield and identify bacteria in it and
some of them will be able to break down
TNT the only reason that they DNT there
anymore is because there are not enough
of those bacteria and so you just grow
them up in the lab stick them back in
the soil and the TNT goes away it really
works you can go to the side of the
highway and you will always find
bacteria that can eat rubber because
there's pulverized rubber coming off
tires all the time it's completely
extraordinary and I realize that we
might be able to use this technology in
biomedical context if we looked at an
environment that is enriched in human
remains and because of course the point
of human remains is that the only
consist of things that do not satisfy
the criteria i just gave bones and teeth
are not energy rich and the things that
i'm talking about oxidized cholesterol
amyloid things like that do not
accumulate in decompose into computing
remains so the chances are that they
don't accumulate because there are
indeed bacteria in the soil that are
capable of breaking these things down
and the biomedical approach of course
would not be to put these bacteria into
the body that would be a bad idea but
rather to identify the genetic and
enzymatic basis for that capacity and to
put one or two genes into ourselves
thereby enhancing our own ability to
break things down and two to thereby get
rid of things that we are naturally
unable to break down so in a sense what
I'm saying is that there is a natural
process in our bodies that turns young
people into old people and eventually
into dead people and then there is a
completely independent process that
turns dead people into decomposed people
which you think which is incurred in the
microbial ecology so the idea is to do
standard molecular biology to identify
the genetic basis for that capacity and
put that genetic basis let those dreams
or enzymes into our own cell this is my
extremely bad picture of a neuron and
and that will be able to slow down the
original process very straight forward
really and people actually like this
idea biologists are rather keen on it
it's a long and ambitious project
there's no question about that we've got
to find these bacteria of course which
turned out to be the easy part it would
identify the enzymes that's boring but
it's gotta be done you know if standard
molecular biology we've got to make
modifications of these enzymes so that
they're expressed in mammalian cells in
an appropriate way and the enzymes
actually go to the right part of the
solar lysosome we have to make sure they
actually work in the mammalian cells we
have to make sure they're not toxic we
have to then do the same thing in mice
and so on so it's a long long job but if
we could do it then atherosclerosis and
out famines and wanted to other rather
important diseases would know long
exists so it's quite an ambitious but
quite a high potential way to move
forward and the first step of that
process as I mentioned is not such not
so how does all that here we have a very
boring photograph of the bacteria this
is a phase-contrast micrograph of a
petri dish and agar plates with a few
bunch of the bacteria not very
interesting but on the next slide I will
show you the same field under the
fluorescence microscope this and you can
see has the same clumps of bacteria but
he also has a whole bunch of other
isolated bacteria that a fluorescing but
not growing and the experiment we did
here was very simple we just took some
soil from some from a graveyard indeed
and played out the bacteria from it a
very low density on this petri dish and
we gave them some what's called lipper
fucing to eat this is one of the major
things that accumulates and adjustably
in the body and we didn't give them
anything else to eat that was their only
carbon source so in other words you've
got a lot of these bacteria that is
taking the stuff off the stuff is
fluorescent which is why the bacteria
lights out but having taken it up the
bacteria can't do anything with it so
they're just sitting there like lemons
but a few bacteria do have the capacity
to break down at least some of this
substance and they're having a great
time they've got ATP so they can grab
this is how bioremediation experiments
are done and it works in this context to
and we are already funding in the
Methuselah foundation some work in
Arizona State University in Phoenix and
also Rice University in houston to
identify more of these things this is a
particularly nasty oxidation derivative
of cholesterol that accumulates in the
artery wall and we have already found
bacteria that can break it down you can
even see just by placing things out on a
dish how well they break it down and you
can see this is a pretty quick process
ten days and the stuffs more or less
gone so this is quite promising you may
those of you who know better biology
have thought of a few potential problems
with this and so are we but we're not
terribly worried about any of them one
is that the junk that accumulates in a
ver
out of ourselves if quite heterogeneous
so maybe we would need a rather a lot of
these enzymes to break it all down but
actually that may not be true because
the breakdown process for complicated
molecules is a bit like taking apart a
big complicated machine like a car you
need the right tool at the right time
and that's more or less all so if we add
one tool to the toolbox of the lysosome
the chances are that we will be able to
give access to the right to the
substrates to the enzymes that we
already have access that they didn't
previously have we know this really by
looking at the reverse situation what
happens if we take one enzyme way now
the lysosome has maybe 60 different
enzymes in it to break things down it
turns out that if you just take one of
them away doesn't really matter which
one then stuff accumulates in the
lysosome many many times faster than
normal that doesn't make sense unless
the process of breaking things down is a
synergistic process in which the enzymes
are cooperating in very much the way
I've just described LSD the lysosomal
storage disorders so they said their
single gene absences of particular
enzymes in the lysosome and they tend to
be fatal in childhood there are lots of
problems to do with getting genes from
bacteria to work in mammals in the first
place but some of them do some of them
don't you may want to change the pH up
to other of an enzyme and that there are
techniques to do that by essentially
evolving the enzyme in the laboratory
also actually fund Leo useful not
necessarily bacteria but fun G because
they have an acidic compartment already
like the lysis own so that may be the
way to go and another problem is that
people have said well okay maybe you
need a lot of this stuff in order to
have selected for the the enzymes in
question but we have to have a fair
amount of this stuff in these cells in
order for the cells to be suffering from
them in the first place so we're not too
worried about that how do we get these
enzymes to the lysosomes of the cells
that are affected well gene therapy
either in vivo with viruses or ex vivo I
take themselves and during
gene therapy in the laboratory followed
by selection for the cells that have had
the right modification there are lots of
ways to get enzymes to the right
compartment here's a schematic of a few
of them the something called chaperone
mediated autophagy which is a process of
active transport of proteins into the
acidic compartment there's a vesicular
approach actually there are two
particular approaches that involve
fusion of one lipid bounded um sack with
another that gets the stuff there these
are things that the body already does
with our natural enzymes and so it's
just a matter of hijacking the same
machinery and the ways to do that
hijacking are pretty well understood at
this point the other approach is to use
what's called ensign therapy in which
the jeans are not introduced into the
body at all whether by doing therapy or
by stem cell therapy but rather the
enzyme is manufactured in bacteria and
the enzyme is simply injected into the
bloodstream and that's it's pretty crude
but it works awfully well for lysosomal
storage diseases this is the sort of
thing you do you mess around with the
sugars that are attached to the proteins
for example this particular enzyme
glucocerebrosidase is deficient in one
of the major lysosomal storage diseases
and it normally has this rather
complicated set of sugars attached to it
if you knock a few of them off these
ones on the left using a sequence of
enzymes are described here until you
have something like this then it gets
targeted to the cell type from the
bloodstream to the cell type that needs
it and people who would normally have
died in early childhood are living in
that in their thousands when they say a
perfectly normal life as a result of
this approach so this is all together
practical safety is an interesting issue
some people say well hang on these
proteins are foreign they're going any
cell that that expresses them is going
to be destroyed immediately by the
immune system turns out not to be true
for lysosomal storage diseases so we're
not too worried but also there are
plenty of ways to address and to
minimize the immune reaction to things
these are things that are being explored
by lots of other routes so again this is
not a showstopper some people are
worried that these enzymes my
breakdown things that we didn't want
them to break down as well as things we
did but again just because an enzyme
breaks down something unusual doesn't
mean that it breaks down a wide range of
things plus there are lots of tricks you
can play like making the enzyme in an
inactive form which is only activated
after it goes into the lightest owned by
the cleavage of the first chunk of the
protein this is again something that
exists already in the body for some of
our own enzymes so the take-home message
is well no one had considered that we
could use the concept of bioremediation
for bio medical purposes I've got people
that were funding now and they're
submitting grants to the National
Institutes of Health who never dreamt
ever setting foot in the National
Institutes of Health and they're very
enthusiastic about it in the enthusiasm
is reciprocated by the biomedical people
who have access to a completely new
technology that they didn't know existed
it takes a few people working i guess
like me working not in the laboratory
but as synthesizers if you like bring
ideas together from disparate areas
because of course experimentalists don't
have much time to read widely
experiments are too time-consuming it's
a very radical approach but it might
work okay so in my last five minutes or
so I'm going to say a little bit about
the foundation what we do and what we'd
like to do and I told you that we've got
this seven-point plan in other words
there are seven major categories of of
intervention that we need to develop
each of which will address one major
category of accumulating damage in aging
um it may be that there is an
alternative a product to postponing
aging we just don't know we think we
know what to do I think I know what to
do but of course the main point about
being a scientist is that you have to
accept that you might be wrong so one
thing the foundation does is it run
something called the Methuselah Mouse
prize or M prize which is not promoting
any particular approach to life
extension it simply says we'll give you
some money if you can produce mice that
live longer than any masses live before
and the amount of money we give you
depends on how much money we have at the
time and it also depends on how much you
beat the previous record by so it's a
very simple concept it has been very
successful in raising the
a file of life extension research
without trivializing it we have four and
a half million dollars in the parts if
you want to add some you can just go to
and price that org and use a credit card
and you know it's definitely something
that people are interested in people are
actually competing for this prize so
that's one way of going about it I'd
also am the editor-in-chief of the heart
they the highest impacts by gerontology
journal rejuvenation research which C is
the only journal explicitly focused on
intervention rather than merely
comprehension of Aging and again what
I'm doing with that journal is bringing
together a range of biological and
biomedical disciplines that do not see
enough of each other it's rather the
same concept as these conferences that I
run that I mentioned earlier but finally
and perhaps most importantly we directly
fund extramural research in the various
strategies for engineered negligible
senescence in other words we are a
straightforward grant-giving body we're
still very small but not for long with a
bit of luck the way we'd like to be is
described here our eventual
organizational structure we want to
demonstrate the proof of concept that
the sense approach can really work in
mammals and the way we'd like to do it
is by taking a middle-aged mouse and
troubling its remaining lifespan middle
aged mice are probably two years old if
they come from a really healthy strain
and they have about a year to live we'd
like to change that one year into three
years in other words get the mice out to
their fifth birthday before they kill
over and we have in order to do that we
have to develop I think all of these
various sub goals the sense strands and
within each of those strands of course
to develop them for various tissues
which involve subtle differences in the
methodologies that breaks down into two
major tasks first of all it involves
implementing the sub-goals individually
and that's fine so far it's
scientifically interesting it's a sort
of thing that will get people papers in
science and nature and so on so it is
best done by academia and I reckon it's
probably going to take something in the
region of three or four hundred
full-time people for about ten years the
other part of the project is scientific
much less glamorous rather tedious and
certainly not very rewarded which is to
take things that work individually and
put them together in the same my sand
and eliminate the interactions that you
don't like that happen when you do so
that's best done in-house and so we want
a facility we want to build something
that I've been calling the Institute for
biomedical gerontology which will be
populated mainly by senior technicians
rather than by professors and we'll do
the other half of the job and I think
we're looking at one or two hundred
people there um this is where we are at
the moment as I say we have about four
and a half million dollars in the pot
for the M prize we don't have any money
in the research part to speak of because
we're spending it as fast as we can and
that's because it's the only rate
limiting step the academic interest in
these various projects is it is extreme
I have been very successful over the
past several years in not only getting
to know the top people in the world
working in these various disciplines but
also in discussing with them the
approaches that I feel are being
inadequately pursued and that could have
rather a good bang for the buck and
there are professors all over the world
who are extremely hot to trot to
actually work on these things as and
when they can get the funding to do so a
couple of the scent strands are now
being funded directly by the Methuselah
foundation there are only at a very
minimal rate so far a couple of graduate
students each lysosomal enhancement
which is the sort of thing that I
mentioned a moment ago with bacterial
genes to break down into gestel
molecules is happening as I mentioned at
ASU and also rice in Cambridge in
England we are funding an approach to
making mitochondrial mutations harmless
which essentially involves copying the
mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear
genome with suitable modifications on it
still works this is something that has
been a concept for about 20 years and we
have succeeded in getting people
sufficiently enthusiastic oh they're
actually working on it a last part of
the reason we're doing so it because we
can pay them and we can pay them because
Peter till the one of the founders of
PayPal gave us half a million dollars a
few months ago and that's what we've
decided to spend it on we feel it's the
aspect of sense that has the best bang
for the buck in terms of credibility
Peter did not only give us half a
million dollars unconditionally he also
made a pledge to give us another three
million dollars if it was matched by six
million dollars from other people and
our next goal is to achieve that's what
we'd like to do in terms of ramping up
the Methuselah foundations efforts is to
move from what I'm describing here at
level one a couple of cents strands
being supported very much entry-level
this sort of level because an average
full-time scientist costs something in
the region of 100 to 200 thousand
dollars a year if we include everything
salaries of course but also equipment
and consumables and university overheads
so that's a sort of amount that we can
do with that certain amount of money
well we'd like to be in other words if
the seal pledge is fully matched is
level 2 which is about an order of
magnitude higher we will be able to fund
absolutely everything in sense except
for the one area that really doesn't
need our help namely cell replacement
that's what stem cell therapy is for of
course and stem cell therapy is really
quite well funded even despite the
political difficulties that it has in
this country so we're talking about that
much now what I say see handout for
details what I actually mean is CEO Nass
who unfortunately didn't have immediate
access to access to a photocopier about
five minutes before I stood up so we're
not able to give the handout but it's
just a one page double sided description
of ten projects that we are in a
position to fund some or less
immediately as soon as we get the money
and this is the sort of money we would
need to be able to fund all of them
question that is what we do after that
level three is where we become what I
think what I think week I'll be actually
two minutes level three it's what I
think we can call when we become a real
funding agency and that means when we
start actually soliciting grant
applications from scientists that I
don't simply already know our ideal for
this job and we need another order of
magnitude higher money for that simply
because the process of processing grant
applications and choosing really good
ones
has a lot of overhead to it so we're
looking at this sort of amount of money
guaranteed for a bit longer so that the
so that the grant giving process can be
made sustainable and finally this is the
stage that I was talking about a couple
of slides ago where we need to move to
actually having a physical facility to
integrate the various individual
components of sounds in mice again we're
still only talking about mice in order
to make it or work the reason I focus so
much on mice bears a little bit of
consideration because of course there
are considerable differences in the
biology of mice versus humans but the
differences are small enough that it's
pretty clear that both scientists in
question and also for that matter the
general public and policymakers will
feel that if we can make the sort of
progress I described in mice troubling
the lifespan of mice that are already
middle-aged before you start then people
will accept that it's only a matter of
time before we can do it with humans and
of course that's not what people tend to
accept these days they tend to feel the
aging is inevitable and always will be
um so that's really why we want to do
all this we feel that funding will not
be an issue once this happens because
people will vote for it but until we get
these mice it's a long haul in terms of
public opinion and so I thought I would
just finish with these conclusions first
of all I've told you that a reasonable
amount of thorough repair and obvi a
shin of ongoing molecular and cellular
damage is foreseeable there are these
various types of damage that we need to
fix I think there are only seven major
types of damage I think we are maybe
only ten years away from demonstrating
the efficacy of the various techniques
in mice it will probably take at least
another 15 years could take a lot longer
if we get unlucky to translate that
technology to humans but even if we only
have a 50-50 chance of doing it within
15 years from the point that we get the
mice that's certainly worth fighting for
at the beginning of the talk I explained
that if we can buy a few decades of
extra life for people who are already in
middle age then that will be
functionally equivalent with high
probability to buying time to live
forever because we will be able to
continue to keep one step ahead of the
and it will get progressively easier to
do so and finally I wanted to point out
the numbers involved here in case some
of you thought well there are other
things that are also important to work
on I used to work in artificial
intelligence before I found out how
pathetically few people were working on
trying to do anything about aging but I
thought to myself well first things
first really there's not much point in
having law all these machines to do nice
boring things for you so that you can do
creative stuff if you're already dead so
I decided to work on this first and
since we're talking about something in
the region of two-thirds of all deaths
worldwide being due to aging and
certainly about ninety percent of deaths
in the industrialized world we're
talking about awful lot of people we are
a long way away from getting these
technologies to work but we are not so
far away that it's all serendipity in
other words the sooner we start the
sooner we'll finish and the more lives
we will save I just wanted to end by a
point with regard to optimism or
pessimism about time frames I've given
you my estimate of the time frames other
people may give you different estimates
it doesn't matter because it doesn't
matter whether it's your life maybe we
can do this in time for you maybe we can
do this in time for your mother or your
daughter and maybe not but well I say is
so what and i like to use an analogy
here as everyone in this room is
perfectly well aware the world an
airplane that came down in a field in
pennsylvania in 2001 on 911 and it came
down because the passengers overpowered
the hijackers who had control of the
plane now we know that the passengers
knew that they would save a lot of lives
on the ground we don't know much else
but we do know that they probably
thought they didn't have much chance of
saving their own lives they also of
course knew that they didn't know whose
life they were going to save on the
ground they just knew they were going to
be an awful lot of them and that's
really why I work in this field I don't
know whether it's going to be in time to
me or my wife or my mother but I do know
that if I can bring this forward even a
little bit I'll die happy and I hope you
think the same I'll stop that
well thank you very much we will learn
now have time for questions and I will
hand out with microphone to save some
time we have gotten heads up to actually
go over time a little bit and they would
continue to be recorded so I think we
have as much time as we need all right
if you just call it the question I'll
repeat it so you don't need to run cars
american life spans for him so the
question is pros and cons of infinite
life band or even indefinite life spans
because of course we can still get hit
by trucks I spend a lot of my time on
this and if you go to my website you
will find that the biggest page is a
page addressing exactly these questions
I got questions about this all the time
of course I think that well in the
interest of time I would just give two
big answers one is that we're talking
about saving lives here there is no
difference between saving lives and
extending lives and for that reason we
have to apply a sense of proportion to
this question there may indeed be a
whole bunch of problems in fact I think
we can go to further to say that the
will definitely be a whole bunch of
problems that will be caused by the
elimination of aging as a cause of death
but that should not stop us from saving
lives any more than its dr. our
forebears 100 years ago from
implementing hygiene and antibiotics and
vaccines and so on when they discovered
how many lives they could save you know
someone had got up and told pastor that
he shouldn't actually be washing his
hands when he was delivering babies and
so on because overpopulation would
happen then you know we might be in a
different world so I think that's one on
so we have to have a sense of proportion
we have to realize that aging kills
people and furthermore of course that it
kills people really horribly there's an
awful lot of suffering involved that we
could save if we were able to fix this
because it just wouldn't be any frail
people anymore the other point I'd like
to make here it's a matter of choice the
may indeed be in the fullness of time
the realization on the part of society
when they have these technologies that
there are downsides that are so bad that
they want to go back to not actually
curing aging at all they want to carry
on living and dying the way that we do
today but the question is whether
whether we should be making the choice
for them or whether they should be
waking it for themselves and it seems
pretty bleeding obvious to me that it's
their choice not
it's something that you know if we were
saying let's not go there there will be
too much overpopulation or dictators
will live forever or will all get bored
or whatever then we will be imposing our
values on our defendants and we have no
right to do that
doesn't seem that Valley doing
are the entire graphic designer
or publication
to the outside
Beauty messy website really
and after one vote
so the question is about the public
relations outreach aspects that may be
the foundation journalist I am too
focused moment on the idea that well we
could get these mice and then all the
thundering you got it made translate
technology to humans will just inward
spontaneously and getting the mice
doesn't actually involved in two minute
very matter to give us some money so
what I bother too much with beer and a
lot of sense lead with this with with
this some point view one thing the
question imagine was the fact that our
websites are particularly presentable
and we agree and we are actually good
ways through which is being done by
professionals liners so I hope that the
results which will be asked within a few
months I will be to the lack of
everybody here in other terms yeah again
I completely agree i think the more we
can do to the most plastic we can follow
simultaneously to enhance the average
the better the problem is you know you
have to do what you can
we have so much we can do certainly our
first individual user no back Oh with
the caveat that no you're not
prescribing drugs what do you think if
anything are the best supplement when
you take return for a while or gas and
epicatechin what do you think so the
question is what's available now people
can actually do to extend their own
lives and the answer is blogger all
there that's not rated for everybody
something some people have particular
conditions that can be treated and
restored to some some of somewhere near
normality by things are available now
regular Tamar is famous for taking your
life member of vitamins right now with
type 2 diabetes in his 30s which most
people don't and I don't know how many
of the 250 building takes a day are
actually important to maintaining his
friend from diabetes but the fact is he
is completely free of diabetes but most
people who are congenitally healthy and
are naturally going to go to AZ way to
slide at this point in love you there is
nothing back and extend that by more
than a year or two at most
even that of course they're very short
nearly new all that and you know don't
smile you know get as exercise all the
warranty so that's all the real answer
to the question how can you increase
your chances of being healthy enough at
the time that these therapies come along
then you will make the cut is simply
can't but increased your it deepens your
motor Beijing you've got to break the
therapy forward so don't would give me a
lot much money
I'm just wondering whether
for some chance that having a diversity
of Ages population so let's dig up an
onion I'm wondering whether having a
diversity of Ages might reduce our
chances of becoming extinct if something
was to come along it happened to be very
harmful okay important one the question
is would with our susceptibility to
pandemics a bit increased by the
elimination of aiding and the if one
looks at the detail of this the answer
seems pretty categorically to be no if
the death rate is being reduced to a
very low level than what that basically
means is that our genetic diversity is
staying static furthermore if a pandemic
does come along it could could come
along today and it kills half of us then
of course that means we've got more room
to to reproduce in the normal way and
restore more genetic diversity there is
also the very important point that what
we are doing with our current medical
technologies and also what we will be
doing with future genetic technologies
gene therapies is to alter our course of
evolution and indeed vastly accelerated
relative to historical rates by our own
bio on hand so it may be possible to
actually artificially improve our
genetic diversity and thus resistance
and species to pandemics by the same
sort of technologies that we will anyway
need in order to defeat aging in the
first place anymore
