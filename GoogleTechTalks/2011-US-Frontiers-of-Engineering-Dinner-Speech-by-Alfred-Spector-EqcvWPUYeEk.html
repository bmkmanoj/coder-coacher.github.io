Spector is the VP of research and
special initiatives here at Google he's
been here since november two thousand
seven and before that he was at IBM and
in several vp positions earlier in his
career he was a on the faculty at
Carnegie Mellon and was involved with a
start-up trans r corporation that did
some early work and distributed
transaction processing I was asked to
sort of keep this short but I'd like to
mention that it was a number of honors
he's a member of the National Academy of
Engineering fellow both the I Triple E
and of the ACM and as a recipient of the
I Triple E Computer Society 2001 satomi
can I award for his work in scalable
architectures and distributed systems
and it's a wonderful opportunity to have
dr. Spector address us can you hear me
I'm a little shorter i think so that's a
real benefit here so i will say just in
beginning what an honor it is to talk to
you all you may think everyone gets up
there and says that but it's really true
you represent the future I don't think
just the future of engineering but I'm
enough of an engineer to believe you
represent the future of humanity when I
compare what I hear here today to what I
hear in political circles what I hear
here is so far above in quality and
likely benefit to mankind that that I'm
really amazed I'm astounded and I'm
optimistic about the future listening to
the work that I heard today and just
talking to some of you about the grand
things that you're all pursuing so
please keep it up I have been in the
pier committee of the national academy
we need more members so do great work
and it's it's a lot of fun so that's the
first thing I wanted to say second thing
I wanted to say I just wanted to ignore
College a Janet and Elizabeth from the
National Academy and also Vivian font
illus Lissa McCracken janiece urban
Melanie sand Anna Saldana excuse me and
Rachel durfee who are the key staff
members from google who have put this
event on I think we should give them a
round of applause for really
well-organized about it so it's a lot of
work to get all the moving parts here
aligned and I think they've done a great
job so thank you again all of you for
doing this so what I wanted to talk to
you about is from my perspective how
computer science has been changing some
of the implications of those changes in
terms of its expanding influence on the
world most of which you know about at
least locally but seeing them globally I
think you'll find I hope from my
perspective interesting and then some of
the the grand challenges that we face
and some of the difficulties in
achieving those grand challenges so
starting out when I was a student a PhD
student at Stanford a computer science
was i would say about fifty percent a
mathematical discipline so we studied
algorithms we studied things from a
mathematical and analytical perspective
we took numerical analysis was a very
big part of the program trying to
understand exactly how errors propagated
through calculations and it was algebra
to go do that of one form or another um
the mathematics of Donald Knuth who is
the father of algorithms he was a
brilliant mathematician that looked at
the time bounds and a very analytical
technique I think of a man named Edgar
Dykstra who looked at trying to prove
properties of computer programs and
thought of the world that if you
couldn't understand things sufficiently
well to prove them you didn't understand
them so as an analytical world I don't
know but he would like the world of
computers today so much
I'm not sure the second aspect of the
field though wasn't entirely mathematics
which was good because I would never
made it through it for entirely
mathematics um the other aspect of the
field was was an engineering discipline
which was based upon engineering notions
of abstraction thinking of something
that would be broadly useful
encapsulation or repeatability of that
abstraction we call it encapsulation in
our field how do we make the part in a
way that will be useful over and over
and over again capsulation and then
reuse use that fastener use that queuing
algorithm use that sorting algorithm
again and again and again and how do we
assemble these things into bigger and
better systems that do more and more and
that was the other aspect of the field
and frankly the part that I gravitated
to and what I worked on mostly in my
field in the field I think was really
the mixture of those two things so I
don't know some of you that are computer
scientists or take courses that makes
sense that that's really really what we
dealt with something happened while I
was busy in my own areas while I was
starting a company while I was managing
products at IBM and other things in the
field became empirical as well and we
became more like a natural science and a
lot of ways so the biggest thing that's
changed in 30 years and you see that
today and the talks you've heard about
is the empiricism now that is part of
computer science and it's the empiricism
that's used internally in our field as
well as the empiricism that we enable in
other fields at a micro level that was
not feasible before let me explain what
I mean so when we heard talks about
semantic understanding and information
retrieval what did we see but massive
amounts of data that were priming the
system to enable us to make hypotheses
about the meaning of a document or the
meaning of a word or the relationship of
a word to another word we weren't
mathematically deriving it from first
principles we were inducing it from lots
of information that we found on the web
so in
fact the nature of Google in its
operation to a very large extent while
based in algorithms and based in
engineering the reason we're able to
deliver great results to people and so
many of the things we do is a very
strong empirical mindset in the firm and
that's been a big change so I wanted to
just give you an example some of you may
know it and it relates a little bit to
what you heard earlier one of the things
all of us are probably astounded by
because it's so incredibly useful is the
spelling correction that we do when you
type in a query and the question is how
do you do it so the algorithmic approach
would be to get a bunch of linguists
together have dictionaries in every
language on earth think through the
kinds of errors with cognitive
scientists and whatever that people make
and build dictionaries that translate
one spelling of Barack to another
spelling of Barack so that when we had a
new presidential candidate we could
actually spell his name the first time
when many of us probably didn't know how
to do it this was a new name for us
that's an approach it's very expensive
it's slow because it has to adapt to new
candidates that come on the scene or new
words and such things and it has to be
done in every language well the way it's
done is empiricism and this is related
very much to what you heard about
earlier is we look at the log of
information of every query that's given
we don't look at it don't worry we're
not violating your privacy computer
algorithms look at it I'm sorry is being
recorded so I have to be very careful
computer algorithms look at it and they
see a number of attempts by an
individual that are close to each other
a small edit difference between them so
they might see someone type Spector SP
EC ter they don't get the search result
they want they type Spector tre another
spelling of my name they don't get it
then they type spec tour and they get it
they click on something the click is an
indication that we got them something
the Edit difference between them is
small enough we can put them into an
equivalence class either correct the
spelling or we can at least recommend or
suggest an alternative spelling
if we're not so sure it's a machine
learning algorithm a very simple one
actually in many ways remarkably useful
it wouldn't work in a world of limited
computer use it wouldn't work in a world
without a lot of data it works magically
in the real world with you know order of
magnitude a billion users and lots of
people searching so it's a very
interesting world that this this
empirical world has become it depends
upon some things that have happened
today and that's part of the reason it
happened only later in the field now of
course this empiricism that we have of
course I think facilitates the use of
observational data at very fine grain
and every other field as well so of
course I think we could do things in
finite element analysis with models and
lots of data and engineering a long time
ago but it's growing more and more i had
heard examples in astronomy when you
take pictures that are really detailed
of the universe and you record them in
great depth and then you take the
picture again later and you subtract the
pictures and see what's changed that's a
heck of a lot easier than looking up
every night hey did you see that over
there last night so that's the kind of
thing and you see more and more of that
and there are many more possibilities I
think available so I think empiricism is
is one is probably the biggest change
facilitated by prodigious pneus of data
right and the processing that makes all
that feasible so there's just huge
amounts of information out there just to
give you a feel for 10 to the 18th bytes
of data was an unfathomably large amount
of information when I was a student it
isn't unfathomably large we don't
disclose how much information we have
but if you think in terms of that amount
of information that's sort of the right
amount and there's every reason to think
you could get to from an exabyte which
that is to a zettabyte another factor of
a thousand of information those are
things that are entirely feasible to
think about these are engineering issues
not breakthroughs and anything beyond
belief I remember thinking as a
distributed systems researcher we had to
build systems that would support people
mixing and matching 10 50 100 applique
on a network and allow them to
interoperate that was the state of the
art in the 1980s how many apps are there
on Android and iPhones today I don't
know the number is hundreds of thousands
maybe a million between them that's the
amount of mixing and matching the
prodigious pneus these are different
application domains of these little
fonts actually they're not all different
there's lots of duplication but it's
still a huge diversity in it in terms of
prodigious nasai think we're now at the
point or just about at the point on the
backbone of the internet that we can
provide 32 kilobytes of differentiated
data to a billion people simultaneously
that's not high definition video at 32
kilobytes but that's us that's a high
definition audio stereo audio stream to
everybody a billion users simultaneously
so this data this empiricism is really
huge and on the power of machines to
deal with it um I remember just ten
years ago we were all saying well gee
Moore's Law is approaching some limits
because of leakage current we can't keep
the machines cool I remember when Intel
went through sort of a huge crisis when
they couldn't keep increasing the
frequency of the machines we call it
embarrassing parallelism is what we
found is what we have found is that most
of the calculations we have wanted to do
can be broken up into parallel
computations that are fairly coarse and
they can be spread out across a lot of
machines connected by relatively mundane
communication bandwidth a gigabit per
second or 10 gigabits a second something
of that form and that's the principle of
the data centers that Orr's that you met
earlier today when he introduced the
session that's what he's focused on
building and what Google is focused on
building and you can provide essentially
unlimited computation that way subject
to issues of power power is clearly
going to become an ever more dominant
cost in this and we have some power
folks here I know and that's clearly a
key thing and the complexity of managing
these very large things so they are very
large you know millions and millions and
millions of elements they get to be
rather difficult to manage so up
I think the future o is clearly pushing
more and more in this empirical
dimension now you know every aspect of
Engineering I think will be impacted by
this so we have found it valuable to get
feedback from all of our users all the
time that help us train our systems or
help the systems train themselves in
many cases clearly valuable how is that
going to do is that going to affect
everything else every car calling home
every second millisecond what is it
going to take what are we going to do to
learn from all of the engineered systems
because we can do that the connectivity
is there we can learn from everything
virtually all the time in a collection
of different feedback loops that are
optimizing and teaching and perhaps
diagnosing issues etc it's it's really a
fascinating a fascinating thing it's
affected research in the field i would
say in a significant way this notion of
in vivo research in computer science
seems ever more important to me and i
think to google and many of our academic
colleagues and industrial colleagues as
well so if you're building systems which
are fundamentally based on being driven
by large amounts of data and usage it's
hard to do that in a laboratory
apparatus you want to do it in the real
world so in fact one of the things that
has been one of the more unusual aspects
of Google is that the company is in a
certain sense a research organization no
that's not entirely true we really Pro
kisan building products and but we
really want to use our existing systems
to go and understand better ways of
doing spelling correction or language
understanding or translation or speech
recognition or other things where all of
the usage is useful so in fact we have
organized Google research in a way
that's different than traditionally
computer science research was organized
we have organized it to be more part of
the broad company
so that we have access to production
systems and we build production systems
some of the people that are talking to
you tomorrow are people that have
invented our major and some of our most
advanced understanding and systems that
are involved in natural language
processing and understanding but they
operate production systems at Google at
the same time because that's the way to
make the most progress we feel so
they're they're they're challenges
associated with that relating to
publication and relating to
confidentiality and such things but
their ways around it and i think i think
we've tried to find them and i think it
will become more common over time so my
next comment and don't worry it won't be
too long a talk I have an airplane
believe it or not in 35 minutes I'm
heading to the airport so I promise you
this speech cannot go on too long
dinners features that go on fact they
insisted that i get an airplane in 35
minutes unless I drone on to on some of
my employees were definitely afraid that
I would be here at midnight and guys
would be nodding off etc but it's but
it's not true any case all this to me um
in the way I've been thinking about the
field for a very long time leads to my
thought of computer science as this sort
of rapidly expanding sphere of influence
over society and over other engineering
and scientific disciplines so up I'm not
really a historian of science but I
think we go back and we know about
tabulating machines for the census where
computers have a beginning counting we
know about code breaking in the early
days we know about trajectories we know
about accounting that happened I
remember when online inventory
management of the airlines happened just
recording a count of the number of
available seats on a plane that was the
1950s that was a very big deal and you
look at this field in the applications
as we say getting maybe to a million
apps on these devices it's truly amazing
and what happened I remember when Donald
Knuth going back to him got involved in
typesetting and it revolutionized one of
the major industries and had a profound
effect on the typesetters Union
which became a completely different
industry after there was computerized
typesetting that was as elegant and
beautiful as what we could do manually
if not perhaps more so um the the
influence of our field goes way beyond
just the engineering and science domains
we've been supporting work and cultural
mix recently and you there was a little
bit of a reference earlier today to it
you can go to the Google site and find
something called the Ngram viewer and
you can look at the occurrence of
engrams collections of n worth and words
in a row in the Google scammed books
corpus from the last few hundred years
so you can look throughout history at
how word usage has changed and you can
find really fascinating things from that
so for example you can find out that in
the 1800's words initiated in England
and with some lag came to the new world
and now you can find out that words
initiate in the New World and with some
lag go back to the old world there was a
reference made earlier that you can look
at the rate at which irregular verbs
become regularize din the language based
on that come up with models for that and
it relates to how frequently the words
are used if the words are used very
frequently the irregular word it stays
irregular if it's rarely used we forget
it and we regularize it and there's it
actually fits a nice set the nice
equation that fits through that we think
there's a lot to be done in digital
humanities so I don't see really any
limits to where the intersection of this
field of computer science and the rest
of the world I don't see any limits to
that we're discussing automotive systems
I don't know what we do without the
control systems and the modern engine I
mean it's been a tremendous enhancement
there as well but it goes on and on in
in this um there are clearly issues in
the core of our field in computer
science that we have to go solve up to
keep things working well I would say the
the key issues that i really feel in the
core of
field that are the hardest ones are
security and software engineering so how
do we come up with methods for building
these huge least big systems that will
result in quality systems that are
manageable over probably decades or
generations of Engineers and how do we
make them in a way that they're secure
enough so that the society can depend
upon them and this ever-growing sphere
of usage I think those are the really
big challenges but then they're the
huger number of challenges of how to
apply all this externally um they're not
all easy so some of them seem easy right
there they're great they just happen
quickly the culture omix thing is kind
of easy you get some very smart people
and you look at it in a couple of years
you can derive new things some of them
are really hard I just wanted to mention
a couple of them so one of them is
health care and I have some experience
with this having at one point led the
Google personal health care record
project for a few years so it's so easy
to give a speech on why healthcare data
for every individual managed by the
individual available to the individual
and their physicians is an incredibly
good idea that's one of the few easy low
hanging fruit ideas and the health care
system it's very easy to give that dog
you can talk about the epidemiological
opportunities of mining results and you
could find out what works and what
doesn't work even in small populations
I'm you can empower physicians with more
data you can reduce duplicate of testing
you can empower patients to know more
about themselves take better care see
the impact of their lives boy is it easy
to give the high-level talk on it and
boy is it hard to make it work in
practice we devoted a very significant
amount of effort over about four years
with almost with very little use some of
you might have used Google Health but
very little use in it it's extremely
difficult to get good data it's
extremely difficult to interpret that
data and something as important as
healthcare to the individual in a way
that is unambiguously correct because
healthcare is to a degree in art it's
extremely difficult to make
that information useful on a daily basis
so that people will bother to look at it
and learn to use the system so it was
it's hard to keep the data private with
all the regulations and with and these
are not bad with the real necessity of
keeping data private everything becomes
so much harder to do than it is with
other other information that we're much
less concerned about but still I'm very
optimistic we spend fifteen to twenty
percent of our gross domestic product
and the healthcare industry it's only
going to get more as we get older as a
society we have to do this so we have to
figure out how to do it I don't think
google is going to be the company to do
the PHR at least we don't know how to do
it now but it has to happen over time I
want to give you a challenge in it and
then explain to you something that was
profoundly impactful for my older
brother who's a physician and a
respectable guy from professor gave me
an article around the end of last year
and the article said that they had done
a study of a carefully done study where
patients with heart failure were given
electronic scales and the scales that
the weight of the patient would go back
to a physician or hospital you could
monitor the patient and if their weight
started to go up you knew they had more
profound heart failure they needed more
diuretic you could give them the
diuretic get it to them early and keep
them out of the hospital it was in fact
might one of my favorite applications
for self monitor guess what the results
showed no benefits this wasn't done by
Google just you know saying we can
connect to scale you know you can show
see the information a loved one can look
at it and tell you to go to ha get you
know to call your doctor that's informal
maybe that doesn't work this was a
formal trial that was done as carefully
as possible it was sort of like an arrow
through my heart when I read this didn't
work on the other hand the good news is
there was a study that just came out in
late and early September can't be late
September's early September on diabetes
management and it was done by case
western reserve in Cleveland and it
showed great results that with proper
healthcare records and careful
monitoring that was electronic they were
getting better results on diabetes
patients anyway I think this is one of
the places computer science has to
intersect with medical informatics and
has to make progress so I think this is
a really great opportunity to do it and
we've got a lot to learn I thought it
was going to be easy this is going to be
a hard one the other one that I think is
probably as important although not as
big a part of our gross domestic product
is education and I have an enormous
personal belief that the computer
science technologies that we at Google
have and others have can have a
phenomenal impact on the ability to
educate our young and in fact to educate
all of us throughout our lifetime um
there's some opportunities with
publishing of material publishing of
video are creating social connections
between people that want to learn
together using social network technology
while they're learning or asynchronously
having them do active course materials
that that that train using all manner of
techniques ranging from elementary
reading and phonics to advanced
mathematics and and and even other
things if we can actually I guess I
understand that um that the SATs are
partially scored by computer software
now right and writing tests did you know
that so you heard today that you can
look at the quality of paragraphs and
things we actually use that in our
educational system to determine whether
kids can get into college it's also done
by human as well but it's partially done
by a computer so all these things look
like they're truly interesting learning
management systems where a teacher can
understand the background of a student
and what the student has had going well
and not going well and adjust their
teaching to the student all these things
are perfectly great ideas I think and
we'll have tremendous opportunity and
yet it also isn't so easy I don't know
if some of you saw the new york times
article that was in The Times just two
or three some days ago apparently a
school district in
Arizona I think of some tens of
thousands of students decided to spend a
couple thousand dollars per student on
educational technology the results were
not measurably positive at this point so
it's a very tricky thing to do right now
I think maybe they're doing some things
wrong needless to say teaching a program
to help people make presentations well
whatever that is I don't think is the
key to education nor I think have we
found that uh you know many even even a
video by itself as the key to education
or the wonderful OpenCourseWare
initiatives that's not by itself the key
all these pieces are components however
and I think they need to come together
I'm excited I think they will and I
think this will prove over the very
short time I think it's much more
tractable than healthcare I think over
the shorter term it will have a very big
effect look at the possibility of
combining information and education so
imagine a student is having some
problems with something and doing some
tests online and in some online quizzes
or tests or worksheet the student gets
something wrong I bet some other student
has had exactly the same course over
time so same history of problems and we
can experiment and see what
interventions work better for that
student in the same kind of machine
learning approach that you heard about
earlier today can we learn that going
back and saying well that we have to
teach commutativity that's what we need
to teach or the associativity or we need
to go back to something fundamental
maybe even the same way that we learn to
do spelling at Google we can learn to do
individualized instruction with massive
amounts of information it will be very
interesting to see how that relates to
the role of the educational psychologist
is it needed or can we actually just
learn through a lot of intervention with
a lot of people well there's an awful
lot of opportunity associated with that
some things that are very positive there
just to counter the negative side Salman
Khan went to MIT it was a became a hedge
fund trader had a relative
in Texas who needed education in
mathematics I think a young woman and he
started using a online blackboard to
teach I think algebra or pre-algebra to
her realized he could bottle up these
lectures that he was giving and produced
them in five to ten minutes snippets
he's now produced sort of approximately
a couple thousand lectures on the web on
many subjects include Mad Max in the
sciences but in other fields um we have
given him money the Gates Foundation has
given him money and others have they are
phenomenally viewed no teachers are
learning how to incorporate them in
classes they're learning how to give
them as as opportunities for students
that don't understand the class to go
back and learn it's one person oh now
it's a team maybe of a dozen or
something I don't know the exact size
but it's phenomenal what one person was
able to do with a good undergraduate
education I guess Chuck uh he was
president of his class is that true okay
so he was outgoing as well maybe that
helps when you're a teacher so that's a
that's a very it's a very exciting a
very exciting a result and I think
there'll be more that can happen in that
so in summary and I'll take some
questions top just about at a time a
data computational horsepower I think
we're just beginning their run great
results like our company's results and
others are already here but there's
going to be a lot more I think the
expanding sphere is continuing it's not
easy to do everything some of these
problems are hard as engineers and as
the future engineers we have to be
willing to hit our head against some of
these walls pretty hard see if we can
get through them I think there are
tremendous opportunities in it we have
to be careful about security and be that
we don't hook society on things that we
can't then deliver so I think we have to
be careful about that but i think
there's absolutely tremendous
opportunities in them well thank you for
all of your attention I appreciate your
all being here and I look forward to
interacting with you at times in the
future thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
