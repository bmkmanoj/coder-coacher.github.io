introduction there a laser pointer up
here this must be it no I know a laser
pointer anyway so I am here to tell you
about fundamental particles and we're
searching for them and first I want to
tell you why you should be interested in
search for fundamental particles why I
think is important then I'm gonna spend
a lot of time describing the nature of
the problem why it's an interesting
machine learning problem and trying to
describe it to you in your vocabulary
and at the end I'm going to ask you to
help me solve some of the outstanding
problems in this field and what you're
seeing here is the Assembly of the
detector that we use at CERN I'll go
into that in more detail but the scale
is it's about 40 feet high so it's four
stories it's a cube about electronics
about four stories on the side and the
scale the assembly is about two years in
time-lapse photography condensed to
about 15 seconds for your enjoyment
alright so why are we interested in
fundamental particles why am i spending
my life looking for them right so the
answer is that some of these questions
here might seem philosophical or
esoteric to you such as what are the
smallest constituents of matter where
did matter come from how do things
interact could the universe have been
different right these are the kind of
things that college students talk about
a 2 a.m. right but the interesting
things about these questions among many
philosophical questions is that these
are scientific questions that have
answers answers that we can reach
because they're well phrased and we can
actually probe these questions and
answer them with particle physics so
some of these fundamental questions that
man has been asking about his
environment for thousands of years these
are questions that we can answer with
particle physics and I think they
deserve answer okay so what do we know
well if we try to think about the nature
of our environment if you just go to
google image search you type in stuff
you get a very wide variety of images
right so if you're a scientist in you're
trying to categorize the nature of your
environment what is everything made out
of you know you look at this wide
variety you you're amazed by the near
infinite variety of things in our
universe right so as a sign
you say well let me group this stuff
when I say this is plant stuff over here
and this is you know objects and food
and you might have some trouble
categorizing some things right some
things are sort of in the boundary
between Adam and you're not in inanimate
but you can look deeper and we know we
can do better than just botany alright
we can say we know that every object in
our universe every object that any human
being has ever seen touched tasted is
constructed of atoms and take a moment
to understand the impressive nature of
that simplification you've gone from a
near infinite variety of things we
experience the universe to a hundred
basic building blocks from which you can
construct the entire universe that's
amazing infinity to over 100 it's a lots
of orders of magnitude right all right
but we knew that about a hundred years
ago what have we done since well since
then we probed inside the atom we know
the atom is made up of course electrons
surrounded by nucleus and inside the
nucleus are protons and neutrons all
right the protons and neutrons
themselves are made up of quarks so the
proton is two up quarks and a down quark
the neutron is two down quarks and up
quark note I will not answer any
questions later about the names of these
particles because they make no sense all
right so if you have up quarks down
quarks and electrons you can build
protons neutrons and you can build atoms
and from that you can build arnold
schwarzenegger or iPhones or whatever
you like right so that means that we
have summarized the entire diversity of
matter in the universe in terms of three
building blocks really astounding right
so you have to ask is that it all right
everything we've seen we can make up
with the particles but are there things
we haven't seen and are there particles
that exist that are not necessary to
make up these building blocks why are
there three particles right if you were
to get the fundamental equation of the
universe you know the equation of
physics that could fit on a t-shirt the
goal of all of all physicists would it
have the number three in it what does it
mean about the number three all right so
it turns out there are more particles
and experiments in this century revealed
for example in beta decay experiments
including the details that there are
other particles like the neutrino which
is a go
sleep article that hardly ever interacts
and there's a particle just like the
electron that's identical in every
single way except that it has more mass
why does the electron seem to have this
cousin this muon it's identical in every
way but it's heavier all right so a few
decades more searching filled out this
table there are even more quarks this is
called the charm and the strange there's
two neutrinos so I repeat my comment
there right then the tau neutrinos
discovered and the towel left on you see
this table filling out the bottom quark
and then finally in 1995 there's a
20-year gap between the discovery the
bottom Cork in the top court this whole
table is filled out right now these are
all you only need these three particles
the up the down and the electron to
build matter as we know it so why do we
have all these other particles all right
why do they exist what do they tell us
about the fundamental nature of matter
well you see that we've organized our
particles in this way and it should be
reminiscent right a hundred years ago
when we thought elements were
fundamental we organize them by their
properties I said these guys are are
very active in these guys are not active
and these guys are metallic and you
order to order them by their atomic
weight and patterns emerged and you were
asked from these patterns why right and
the idea was that these patterns are
clues as to a simpler more fundamental
underlying theory and these patterns are
just emergent phenomena from that right
and we now know of course all about
electron orbitals and all of the
features of the periodic table come just
from the structure of electron orbitals
so here's the table of the fundamental
particles it has a lot of interesting
features in it like these particles here
this the quarks there are six of them
there are six leptons why exactly six of
one and six of the other our current
theory says it's pure coincidence the up
and the down quark you combine the form
of proton which is exactly the opposite
electric charge of the electron
necessary of course for making hydrogen
or any atom our current theory says
that's a pure coincidence I think it's
likely that there's a more fundamental
theory underlying this and all the
structure we see here is just emergent
phenomena of that deeper more
fundamental
so in a hundred years or maybe five
years we'll have a deeper understanding
and this will seem like a like old news
here for example you see this is already
out of date because the Higgs boson here
is dashed because it's yet to be
confirmed all right so what is going on
with the Higgs boson maybe you heard
something about it this week in fact it
has popped up in a lot of media outlets
you see the New York Times science
section and cartoons about collisions
that change the world and it was there
even been bombastic quotes from
scientists like somebody said this will
have revealed the deepest layer of
reality our species has ever probed wow
that sounds pretty impressive right and
I read another one by Lawrence Krauss
who said that this is the greatest
achievement in the history of human
intellect and I mean I don't know if it
really stands a comparison to the
development of language or math or the
wheel but you know people are pretty
excited so what are they excited about
well we might have discovered one more
particle right and one more particle is
interesting because it helps us
understand the relationship between all
these particles so what is it that we
actually saw its earn well we ran for a
whole year and we're going to talk about
this plot in a lot more detail but since
I mentioned now I'll show it to you now
and what we see are these these this
right here this is what everybody is so
excited about so this is what you'll
expect if you don't see the standard
model is the red line anything above
that is is a possibly due to the Higgs
boson all right so you're saying wow
that looks like a fluctuation and we
spent a lot of time we spent a lot of
time analyzing this data and doing
careful statistical analysis how likely
is it to be a statistical fluctuation
and the answer is it's about two to
three percent right so if the if there
is no Higgs boson you see this kind of
thing about two to three percent of the
time so that's interesting it's not
conclusive nobody's going to win the
Nobel Prize next year for the for the
Higgs boson we're keeping running the
machine and in the next year the
collider will have five or twenty times
as much data so we should have much more
conclusive statements but for people
who've been looking for this for 20
years it's excited at least have a
little blip right so these three data
points are the most impressive
achievement of human intellectual
history if you believe I was proud
okay so I hope I've motivated you that
it's an interesting thing to spend your
time thinking about what is the nature
of our environment and how does it
basically built up now I'm going to tell
you about how we look for new particles
and what are the issues the machine
learning and analyzing this data okay so
how do you understand what everything is
made out of right you're surrounded by
things in your environment you want to
understand what they're built out of so
what do you do will you take them apart
you can't take our little parts so you
turn to your toes during say what is my
toaster made out of well it's got screws
and bolts and nuts a little bits of
machinery and if you take other items in
your kitchen apart the blender or the
oven you discover it's made of similar
things you say I'll wait the blender and
the toaster or not fundamental objects
of my kitchen they're just
rearrangements of smaller pieces from
which I can build any machine right all
right so that's a realization right fun
more fundamental understanding of
machinery that's how you do it in the
macroscopic world turns out we do it in
a similar way in the microscopic world
we take two particles we smash them
together with accelerators and look to
see what comes out and hope to learn
what was inside them so take this to its
ridiculous extreme right say you had two
toaster Collider right you ask the
government for 11 billion dollars to
build a toaster Collider and you smash
them together and you got a big pile of
parts right how would you analyze it
when you'd say I got two handles and I
got four screws and I got six of these
and everything hopefully would be in
even numbers and you say okay so
everything that went in eventually came
out and so I can deduce it that you know
there are two of these in each one of
each toaster and three of these and
whatever but a basic assumption you make
is that everything that went into the
collision comes out of it right that
assumption is completely untrue when it
comes to particles when you have a
particle collision for example a proton
colliding with an antiproton these your
beams they annihilate and the matter
that created that existed in the initial
state is completely gone all right so
that matter disappears and turns into a
new form of matter it's not rearranged
it's not taken apart and reorganized its
annihilated disappears and reforms now
you might be thinking well this is a big
disadvantage because you can
and it is me
it's essential state right well not
actually that interested in the initial
state or we're interested in is making
weird new final states and this turns
out to be actually the greatest
advantage of particle physics because
you can take two very light very very
fast-moving objects and turn them into
two very heavy very slowly moving
objects so you don't have to know what
kind of particles are out there say you
didn't know that these things ever
existed all you have to do is smash
together light particles which are
abundant right protons are everywhere at
very high speeds and look to see if any
heavy particles are made now if no heavy
particles are made you can conclude that
they do not exist another amazing thing
about our field is negative results can
be published right and fortunately since
we have discovery every two decades
people like Mesa can still succeed and
saying this particle doesn't exist this
particle doesn't exist this particle
doesn't exist but this is very important
as long as you pour enough energy into
your collision you can make statements
about what particles do or do not exist
at that energy level so if you have
enough energy in your collisions you
will see those particles right this is
why we want to have as much energy as
possible all right so we don't actually
work on a toaster Collider right we work
at CERN concern is located at the tip of
Lake Geneva here and it was at an
accelerator in the 90s which is lower
energy and then those accelerators in
Chicago which took over and they spent a
long time building this one the
cancelled one in Texas which would have
been even more impressive but this one
is pretty good and it went online in
2008 but there was a big accident and it
blew up and we have to take two years
off to fix it but now it's back online
again and the collisions happen at the
center of a very very large piece of
equipment we call the detector basically
a concentric ring of detectors each of
which take a different kind of image of
the data you can see the scale here this
is the size of a graduate student right
and they're not actually allowed to walk
on the detector because it costs the
bajillion dollars right so what does the
detector do oh and so what kind of
things might we see what we don't know
all right this is exploration you turn
this thing on you'll have no idea what's
going to pop out pink elephants who
knows what right and that's the idea its
exploration nobody's ever looked at this
energy range before we've gone up an
energy x factor seven compared to
previous accelerator so the amount of
territory that's been opened is enormous
it's virgin territory it's like if you
were an astrobiologist and you got to
land simultaneously on seven new
earth-like planets and look for life
it's a pretty amazing opportunity right
pretty hopeful you might see something
new so we might see things that haven't
existed since the origin of the universe
because there hasn't been that much
energy density since right so really
unlocking secrets of the birth of the
universe what might happen well you know
some people are worried that this there
might a danger involved there was
concern that we would turn this thing on
and create a black hole which you eat
the earth and therefore the universe and
you know this cartoon suggests that 13
8.8 billion years ago the birth of our
universe was caused by the previous
universe building a large hadron
collider we now know that's not true and
if you're ever wondering about whether
you're in danger you can always check
this website which is constantly kept up
to date if you know you can if the
google dns server reveals this to you
then you know the world has not been
destroyed okay so that's how we look for
new physics right let me tell you a
little bit about how we analyze the data
so we do hypothesis testing this is our
statistical tool we say we're going to
compare to models one hypothesis is the
standard model the current thing we know
that's our current description of
physics right all these particles we've
discovered and played with for a long
time versus that model with another
particle added right that is my dream my
dream is to find a new particle and get
to name it after my wife or whatever but
this is the idea is to discover a new
particle what if there were 40 we call
this a generation right this set of
particles each of these are identical to
the previous except they're just heavier
right charm is heavier than up
this heavier than charm we don't know
why we don't know why there are three
may be there for maybe there are seven
we have no idea the goal is maybe we can
find more and get a sense for what's
going on with this pattern so how does
this work well you collide protons and
protons this is from the Tevatron at the
at the LHC we actually quite protons and
protons and the model predicts that if
you do this this new particle will be
created remember I told you if you have
enough energy you can create this new
particle so we turn it on we have enough
energy the model that includes this new
particle in the puttin the menu of
particles in the universe says you turn
your Collider on this will be produced
well how would you know if it were
produced well the particles collide in
the center of the beam and stuff comes
out right the particles don't live very
long things like 10 to the negative 23
seconds because they're very heavy
they're very unstable they decay to
other particles particles that are
stable and from the properties of those
stable particles we can deduce that that
particle existed momentarily now can we
see those stable particles we can't
really see them you can't take a picture
but we have our concentric rings of
detectors each of which gives us a
different piece of information about
what happened in the collision so it's
sort of like a digital image so take one
slice so this if you have a cylindrical
detector and the view your view is the
view of the proton heading into the
center of the detector here so the
collision happens here different
particles interact with the different
pieces of detectors in different ways so
for example one typical product of the
decay is the production of electron now
this whole piece and detector is
immersed in a magnetic field and this is
a charged particle so you don't need to
know the details but it leaves a little
track here so we can reconstruct its
direction from its curve because it's in
a magnetic field we can deduce its
momentum a photon for example travels
right through here without leaving a
track so we can tell the difference
between a photon and electron muons have
a different signature I don't have time
to go into the details but I've happy to
talk about two about it individually if
you're interested the thing you need to
know is this detector reads out a
million features for every single
collision alright because we need very
high resolution
understand exactly what happened we're
looking at the decay products coming out
we want to know where do they come from
which ones that came from a single
particle this kind of thing so the raw
data is a million collisions all right
so what does that add up to well we do a
lot of collisions we do 10 to the 8
collisions per second times a million
channels okay we can't store or analyze
that much data fortunately most of that
is not interesting at all most of the
huge majority of it is just stuff we've
seen before we understand very well okay
so we throw all that away we have a we
call a trigger system that filters that
out very effectively and you can worry
about whether there's something in that
detector is that a question well we
don't know because we throw this away
now okay so that's a flip answer we are
fairly confident that most of that it's
uninteresting and when we first turned
on the accelerator a much lower rate and
we kept everything and studied in gory
detail I didn't see anything crazy and
we keep a random fraction of this just
in case the universe turns on a new
particle after we started or something
goes crazy but it's difficult I mean
it's just too big to understand so we
look for things like production of heavy
particles that we know W boson Z bosons
the top quarks things we're hoping to
see like the Higgs boson a produced
point one Higgs bosons per second all
right so it's 10 to the 9 collisions
before we make a single Higgs boson okay
so it's a lot of data to sift through
and how do we analyze the data well we
boil down a million dimensional space oh
you have a million features using our
physics knowledge and our intuition
understanding of how things work into
approximately 10 to 50 features that
tell you about the direction of the
decay products so instead of just having
you know every single channels data you
say well there was an electron in this
direction there was a photon over here
there's a muon over here each of those
takes three or four pieces of
information maybe you have 10 to 15
things / an event so it's order 50
things / an event now what we do is we
look for some region and feature space
where hopefully our two hypotheses
remember
of them was the standard model the other
one with standard model plus particle I
will named after my wife right and we
hope to find a space where these to
diverge because we're making a
scientific prediction and it should be
testable we don't want to make a
prediction that is untestable we want to
say okay run this experiment and the
data will tell us whether this is the
truth or this is the truth that's the
goal so our goal is to construe is to
find a feature which discriminates well
which looks different in the two
theories right okay so there's a lot of
statistical issues here all right so say
you get the collider data he turned it
on in quadriceps know the black line is
much more accurate all right you can do
that intuitively you can see by high
that particle isn't there how do you
state that confidently how do you make
statistical claims well what we do is we
need to understand this probability
density the probability density with
respect to our features for both models
right and then we can just do a
likelihood ratio say the probability to
see this data given the new hypothesis
over the probability see this data given
the standard model hypothesis and then
you can do in confidence confidence
limits and interpretations of that
excellent question thank you so we
compare this hypothesis right let me
just make one more comment for I get to
that so our ability to understand
whether we've seen this theory depends
critically on how different the two
theories are right so we're looking to
maximize the difference in their
predictions okay and it's important to
understand our uncertainty on that
prediction right if for example the
prediction is this little blip but the
uncertainty on the black line is this
big well you're never going to see it
because the uncertainty on your
background is too big it's bigger than
your signal so how do we devised these
probabilities well here's what we do we
do not have functional analytic
descriptions of these probability
densities we just do not because some of
the physics we don't understand and some
of it is it because we just don't
understand the physics well enough okay
so we have numerical simulations of what
happens after a particle collision right
and these are driven by heuristic models
then we at the second step we have
heuristic models
for what happens when particles collide
with our detector okay and then we have
our raw feature readout and we
reconstruct we do our boiling down from
a million features to 50 features and
here this is boiled down to a single
feature and so this is another example
of what you might see for the Higgs
boson this is the falling background
spectrum and if the Higgs boson were
there you might see a little peek here
so you notice that this is kind of
jagged it's because it's a histogram of
individual simulated events we don't
know this function we deduce this
function posterior e after running an
enormous simulation does that answer
your question now this simulation is
very difficult to use oh one second
right so we generate I said this already
we use these histograms to define this
and we've tried things smarter than just
histograms we strive kernel-based
density estimates and smoothing and all
sorts of things but there's no different
idea there it's just you're defining a
posteriori right you're deducing it
after the fact you have some physics
model that you've used to construct this
data but you don't understand you can
construct a function in an arbitrary
feature so you have to deduce it after
running a bajillion events all right so
we want to harness all the differences
between the hypotheses right maybe
there's a difference between that the
hypothesis not just in this feature but
another one so from that perspective we
want to use as many features as we can
on the other hand our simulation is
painfully slow takes 10 minutes 10
minutes to simulate a single collision
so if you need to simulate a million
collisions it's a huge amount of time on
a large computing cluster and if you did
made one mistake in your settings oh you
got to go back and redo it it's a it's a
huge amount of time and of course we
have the curse of dimensionality to
characterize the shape in one dimension
you need maybe a hundred points you
start going to five dimensions well 105
is a very large number of events so we
want to use this few features as
possible so you see here we're torn
between both of these needs so we
quantify our ability to observe this
particle based on how big it would have
to be before we could distinguish that
theory from the standard model right so
we'd like to be able to see very small
signals
to be able to see small signals we need
to be able to separate them and have
accurate models for both of new theory
and the old theory okay so what are we
doing right we're not just sitting on
our hands we're trying things so say you
have your two theories in some high
dimensional space I've can only plot to
write and you what we do is we separate
the two pieces of it the standard model
and this new piece X we assume there's
no interference and typically what we do
is treat this as a classification
problem we say there are two classes and
supervised learning and we assume that
what we actually want to do which is
enhance our discovery sensitivity is one
hundred percent correlated to what
supervised learning can do which is
classification okay so you take your
neural network or booster decision tree
or whatever svm and you boil this then
it down to one dimension all right you
try to understand where your signal lies
and you put that close to one in the
background close to zero that's that's
what we try to do right and this can be
very helpful because it summarizes all
the differences in many features into
one dimension which is very useful
because we're limited in our
understanding and how many dimensions we
can use because we have to run this slow
simulation and then deduce the shape of
the background so we can't do large
dimensions right so having it collapsed
in one dimension is very helpful all
right because then we only have to build
a one-dimensional histogram also it's
difficult to publish data in a paper in
more than one eve or two dimensions
right how do you publish a
five-dimensional distribution
electronically right but the problem is
this technique doesn't account for
uncertainties in our predictions we have
significant uncertainties in our
backgrounds if you just feed in your
nominal background and models into your
classifier you're teaching it to reject
that model but there's uncertainties
right your model could be wrong and we
can describe those uncertainties but we
don't ever include those uncertainties
into the classification problem alright
so that's one weakness another weakness
is that the standard model hypothesis
has lots of different categories right
it's not just one thing that can give
you background is often five ten
different things it's not always clear
how to perform the training in order to
account for the varying classes of
things and their varying effects on the
result
right so what we learned is with our
experience is that it works well when we
start with a limited number of features
fewer than 10 if you just say neural
networks are God and you just throw 100
dimensions at it it's that of raw data
it's not going to be able to figure out
where your two hypotheses are different
very well typically we do a lot of
physics intuition to try to understand
what features might work well and feed
those in the neural network just to
collapse us to one dimension at the end
so the features have to be very
carefully chosen and pre-processed we
have attempted automatic feature
selection but never really had much luck
with it and it only really works with
fewer than 10 features so in summary I'd
say supervised learning for particle
physics works well when classification
accuracy and discovery potential are
very well correlated this doesn't oh
isn't always true when you have multiple
backgrounds and it's limited if there
are uncertainties in our predictions and
it only works if you done a good job to
choose your features and the cost of the
Miss classification are not always the
same so we've tried cost-sensitive
classifiers I mean we read the
literature we know that sounds like it's
applicable to our problem but these
these problems are not always directly
applicable because there's often some
technical problem like it requires you a
priori know the cost for the different
kinds with the different types we don't
know this so we can't use it or the
costs are not necessarily correlate with
the labels not like this one has some
cost when you discover sensitivity that
one definitely has another cost so again
these these algorithms while appealing
initially didn't turn out to be useful
at all in the end we're not interested
in classification we don't care for an
individual collision weather was the
Higgs boson or was a background the end
we want to make a statistical statement
about whether the Higgs boson exists in
the sample right we're interested in
this ratio probability of the data
coming from the standard model plus X
versus the probability of the data
coming from the standard model so in the
end we've had some success treating this
just as an optimization problem saying
toss out classification use some genetic
algorithm to evolve a neural network
which would do better when optimized on
your
juwel criteria that's had some success
but it's very complicated technically to
achieve all right so in summary
hypothesis testing is our core
statistical problem right now I've
explained to you how we devised these
hypotheses and the limitation of
developing the hypothesis in multiple
dimensions I say the open issues for us
are how do you handle high dimensional
problems 510 features that most can be
used and this is even using a neural
network to go from five to 10 features
down to one another one is how to
actually optimize for discovery
potential you know supervised learning
works well in some cases and other cases
reinforcement learning has been
effective but here's the problem all of
these are black boxes they take they do
not include at all our knowledge of
what's going on we have some physics
knowledge about how these things work we
know how the detector works we are the
ones who wrote the simulation of the
detector so surely we should be able to
use our physics knowledge somehow to
develop these models more hot priori
rather than simply running a simulation
blindly and having to interpret it later
after the fact to understand what the
two different models should look like in
the features were interested in so I
have more details as though so if you
were to go to Ikea and buy yourself a
hedge on Collider these would be the
instructions and take careful note of
the warnings always very useful so I
have more details about specific
examples of applications we've tried but
I thought I'd see if the time is better
spent on questions that people have them
that's right it's because it's very rare
and its signature it is there's nothing
else that decays like it but its
signature is not unique the plot i
showed you is production of two photons
there's a lot of ways to make there's a
lot of ways to make two photons to if
you make two photons very often and the
Higgs is very small rate on top of that
peak so that's why it's hard to see
because it just isn't made very often
it's unusual but rare it's like looking
for a unicorn in a forest right you can
look for a long time and I'd see once
you've seen it oh yeah that's the
unicorn you're pretty sure but you could
look for a decade not find it hey
unfortunately it's not as unique as
unicorn I mean it's say you have two
photons what can you do you can say well
I had up their energy what was the mass
of the particle which might have created
them well you know 120 gb that sounds
like they close on but I mean look at
this data it's back here look at the
number of events here in the background
right you expect I can't find a button
you expect you know this is the Higgs
boson you expect tannish events this /
Bane is 600 events from background so
lots of ways to make the same events and
you can't look at individual and say
that was it now 30 years ago you know
when you were discovering decays of
particles you could have a single event
discovery because you had a picture of
the whole event and you can see these
spirals in these decays and those days
are gone well this particle doesn't last
long enough it decays instantaneously
two photons
yeah it's not deterministic the same
initial conditions twice in a row lead
to do two different outcomes because God
plays dice with the universe right
because the it's quantum mechanical so
there are physical laws and not totally
random there are physical laws that say
this will be produced five percent of
time you'll see this twenty percent of
time you see this sixty percent of time
for an individual collision you know a
dice is rolled and you get what you get
you don't never know for an individual
collision it's not deterministic it's
quantum mechanically it's always protons
it's yeah proton proton at the old
platter because I proton versus
antiproton but turns out antiprotons are
a lot harder to make than protons for
obvious reasons and I hope mafia seasons
and so this time we just a proton proton
because you can do the same thing no
because we are colliding the protons but
we're not the protons themselves aren't
to watch they're interacting because
protons are just bags of particles bags
of quirks is an up down and up and down
cork in there so with actually interacts
of the up and down quarks inside there
and proton versus antiproton doesn't
make much of a difference you get
exactly the same kind of physics these
are data available our data is available
for collaboration with people in our
community but unfortunately we have a
very outdated and unfortunate pilot
policy towards the actual data which is
can only be handled by physicist in the
collaboration and we aren't pressed by
the larger community to pup to make the
data public I don't know why in
astronomy for example the public gives
you a hundred million dollars to launch
an experiment collect data and get a
year to analyze it and then you have to
publish it for other people to do we're
not required to do that we can analyze
it and then throw it in the trash
you and I can work together on it but
you can't do it by I can't send you the
data and have you do it yourself
officially talk to me afterwards thank
you
sure yeah
well you know there are people who are
skeptical of new techniques they're
white-haired physicist who will not
accept anything except a picture of an
event for discovery but the field move
along with or without those people and
if you can demonstrate that you can find
the Hayden's what other people can't I'm
pretty sure you'll be you'll be welcomed
so yes there are cultural barriers but
there are also people like me or open to
collaboration so it's not exclusive no I
I did an analysis for example were used
genetic algorithms to train a neural
network and I think I had to give 50
talks explaining why it works you know
so you know don't have to do training or
you don't have any labels why does that
work you know you have to educate the
community
yeah well I mean it's not really a
statistics problem we have a lot of
statistic problems and we have a lot of
statistics experts who help us solve
those problems but this isn't a
statistics problem this is how do you
boil down on others number features into
one dimension you know they help us do
the hypothesis testing how do you
interpret that are you bayesian any
frequentist what can you say about the
universe based on what you saw that's a
different question right this is this is
I think there's a machine learning side
of it they're definitely orange juice
tea oh great one year yet Nick so we ran
in 2010 and we got what's the factor 30
times less dated and got this year and
so next year we're going to run again
and get approximately 30 times as much
it is we got this year the performance
is increasing exponentially so next year
we will know whether the exposé on is
there or not and will probably tell you
also
if you give me a million dollars i will
run that competition i will now yes
thank you for the idea thanks for the
idea
yeah I mean it we hoped that when we
turned it on we would discover something
crazy instantly and that didn't happen
and so there's two reasons one is it
just could be produced very rarely so
for that you need to run a lot longer
and also the machine is only running at
half energy because we had that accident
2008 that the soldering wasn't quite
good
I'm ready
voltage
why using Staten walls figure out
windows in MO we know that that exists
but it is offered
changing
Marcus
I mean how much I you activate DJ
yes
