and Steve more than most people on the
planet has been in a unique place to
help drive innovation and to watch as
other people try to drive innovation and
be sort of up close for the successes
and the failures of those innovations
steve has gravitated to the harder
problems and has seen probably more of
the fat tales of innovation of the
positive negative side than anyone else
I know and Steve is going to talk to us
today a little bit about what you've
seen and some thoughts about how
innovation I can happen does and doesn't
happen and relate it to some things that
I'm personally interested in about
evolution I hope you guys will find it
as interesting please welcome Steve with
me thank you guys um what it may not
have mentioned is that we used to sleep
together which is we were in the same
undergraduate dorm back in undergrad and
and many stories that could be had in
Q&amp;amp;A if you really want to get to know
maestro but he's obviously a pretty
special individual and it's not honor
for me to be here today addressing both
few people here in the room and those
out in TV land as we used to call it
back in undergrad days went literally
was you know analog TV streams what I
hope to share with you today is part of
our doozy azzam for the future as
embodied in our views learn from many
entrepreneurs and visionary scientists
that we've met with over the decades on
what the future portends in terms of
technology trends the major shaped
forces shaping our lives and some of the
underlying dynamics at how we get to
those features as actually alluded to
what I hope to spend a fair bit of the
back end of this talk discussing is the
dichotomy of design and evolution
different processes of building complex
systems be that code synthetic biology
or or nanotech in various futuristic
visions of the big interesting artifacts
of the future how will we build them and
there's a grand engineering challenge I
think that remains there in that in that
sort of open question of how best we can
build things that transcend human
understanding um I will try to also
maybe make some passing references to
organizational design maybe there's one
slide on that as it applies to Google
for those who read my Abstract I sort of
give a nod to that and I and also when I
tonight were brainstorming over lunch a
few days back and led him to think he
maybe I should be writing for a Tech
Talk it was a wide range of topics we
were talking about and so I'll probably
be seem a bit scattered which is
appropriate for someone like me because
you know I think I found the perfect
career for someone with a DD which is
you get to meet with a bunch of
interesting entrepreneurs hear their
pitches and then move on to the next one
and so do take of course with a grain of
salt everything I say as a pattern
recognizing generalization across many
smart people who actually have original
ideas and what I'm sharing with you
today is perhaps the synthesis or
catch-all of some of the patterns we're
seeing across those ideas as opposed to
you know scientific work and we venture
capitalists don't directly contribute to
the economy if anything we help
lubricate those who do so with that
preamble let me just mention some of the
things I'm gonna talk about I'm going to
start with a generalization about
innovation and disruptive technologies
in general move on to how that is now
intersecting energy markets just because
the sheer trillion-dollar size this
thing is an important economic driver
for why many of these trends are
important to industries for which they
may not have been as important before
and in the end with that topic because I
think it'll naturally naturally segue
into it that many of the new powerful
capabilities we have today open really
important questions on how we build
these systems okay one quick overview um
on innovation in disruption from all the
business plans we're seeing we're seeing
more innovation than ever before
probably no surprise there but at least
I want to say it because in the state of
economic tumult that may not be obvious
but the nature and quality of that has
changed dramatically over the last
decade it is increasingly globalised
that Oberer trend is not reversing the
companies we invest in today sell to
international customers day one ten
years ago unbelievably we did not see
business plans from non-us companies you
can just ponder that for a moment just
ten years ago we not only did had not
invested in a single non-us company the
companies we invest in those startups
only serviced US customers the only time
they look to a European or Japanese
customer was about the time they're
going public this is where software
companies the internet companies if you
look remarkably different today the vast
majority of the wealth created in the
last ten years has been outside the US
for us and there's reasons why those
network effects over the Internet
reinforced the globalization trends
entrepreneurs can be anywhere they can
serve as customers globally with lower
transaction costs than ever before we
think these are mutually reinforcing so
it's just sort of philosophical preamble
the one and only slide I'll show about
dfj itself for those not from
what is this firm referring to I work
for venture capital firm we focus on
early-stage startup investments and
maybe the most unique aspect of our
structure is that we have a distributed
set of partnerships you can think of
them almost like franchises in a way or
more like a pre-war Japan zaibatsu where
every one of these entities has
cross-linked equity ownership in the
other so they want to see each other
succeed they want to in a sense what
we've tried to instantiate is a repeated
game dynamic where everyone knows
they're in business together for decades
and so therefore we help each other
that's it's quite as simple as that
and it allows us to scale horizontally
across the planet more easily than we
otherwise could in aggregate there's
about six and a half billion dollars
under management which for the venture
you know for an early-stage venture firm
is large but for any one of these funds
it's a small reasonable person no single
fund is a billion dollars in size okay
innovation let me start with a thought
experiment just in case you're sort of
digesting and then half half here in
terms of engaging with what I'm saying
I will not pose a question to everyone
in the room which is think of the most
important company 20 years from now and
actually try to pick a tangible example
in your mind so that when I am when I
sort of make the next statement you know
you can you can judge it based on what
you're thinking of so pick what you
think will be the most important company
20 years now it could be judged from
presumably the one that's on an
incredible growth trajectory that's
changing the world and that people
generally think is the most exciting
company on the planet like Google was or
maybe still is so 20 years now what is
it is goggle so you have something in
mind hopefully I'm willing to bet
against everyone in the room and
everyone out in TV land even money and
actually I mean unless anyone wants
taking up in this debt we can do a long
now bet and actually bet real math money
on this there Emily but every single one
of you is wrong not even knowing what
your guesses are and that may seem
cheeky and I don't know stunt and the
reason is that that company doesn't
exist yet I'm willing to bet on a new
entrant that doesn't yet have a name
over all existing companies someone
could think of today looking forward
that may seem like a claim some of you
may agree oh yeah of course others may
seem that seems a bit cheeky but in
retrospect that's always the case right
in retrospect we realized the new the
important the vector of change in the
world vector of disruptive change always
comes from new entrants never from
incumbents
it's a variation on Clayton
Christensen's innovators dilemma but
that bet looking forward people tend not
to apply it as often you could ask who's
the most Wharton business executive 20
years now if you don't want to think
about companies you get the same answer
there's a variation on the same thing
imagine you saw a parade of every
startup that we see got about 50,000
business plans here and let's say they
could somehow encapsulate in a short
pitch whatever they do and they present
to this audience they're a new idea of
how they're going to change the world
then imagine we the popular vote as a
policy on which one we think is the one
we'd want to invest all of our capital
in again that would be the wrong
selection process I'd be willing to bet
against whoever wins the popular vote
any investment domain of startup
ventures that are trying to change the
world instead what you should look to
when you'd want to invest in is the one
where maybe five ten percent of the room
thinks it's brilliant and the rest
linked it's completely idiotic that is
exactly the kind of company you want to
invest in because if it's obvious to the
majority right it's not revolutionary
enough to change the world and this is a
truism that in retrospect of course
makes sense despite what venture
capitalists will say today in the moment
they laughed at eBay hotmail Google and
just about every company that has in
fact changed the world at the time of
their founding a good idea is generally
not regarded as such by the average some
general points on the innovation now
I've qualified innovation as disruptive
innovation distinguishing it from the
sustaining innovations the big companies
do all the time and they're very good at
write disruptive innovations which
really matters and why do I focus on
that well you can ask yourself the
question if it weren't for disruption
why any startup ever exists and I would
contend that they wouldn't that if you
have market stasis predictability the
big get bigger the rich get richer and
the new entrants have no chance they
don't have brand they don't have capital
they don't have distribution
relationships and you can look to old
crusty industries like you know
aluminium powder you know it is very
difficult to compete with Alcoa not
because they make better powders because
the distribution channels have been
co-opted for so many years they're not
about to give you a chance to do lunch
and even if you have better pricing so
it's an interesting thing where does
disruption come from well there's
periodic unpredictable sources such as
privatization of industries deregulation
of industries right when they exist we
were all over it for short periods of
time but we don't build an investment
thesis that spans decades on
privatization or deregulation
it's hard to find the next one you might
be waiting a few years for the next
interesting opportunity certainly was
scanning the planet for the where the
frontier of that sort of market
deregulation takes place another reason
to channel distribution right when the
old for those maybe three or four of you
in the room that might remember Dell
versus Compaq in the old days competing
and how it seems almost written in stone
that Dell would take the business from
Compaq due to channel conflict the fact
that compact sold through a distribution
channel that couldn't be revoked kind of
like automotive companies in the US have
dealers they cannot dealership contracts
that cannot revoke it makes it easier
for new entrants who sell direct to
bypass that the internet was the
greatest new channel distribution we've
ever seen in terms of power and scope
that impact has barely been fully flat
down felt the next one seems to be
mobility as a way to reach customers
more directly I couldn't tell you what
the next one is in QA please tell me if
you think you know what the next great
channel distribution is to reach
customers because that would be a good
investment pieces first
but there is one they'll go build up is
there as one you can count on every year
every decade in every century so that 50
years from now even 100 years from now
they will be mentioned capitalists and
there will be startups and the reason is
because of technology being nonlinear
and its pace of change the accelerating
pace of theological change is the
fundamental perpetual driver of
disruptive innovation it's why new
entrants continue to exist in why they
continue to enter the market and why
venture capital by proxy exists that's
why we're dizziest forth ok well what's
the most canonical example of course
Moore's Law right and this is Gordon
Moore himself oh that doesn't come out
so well on the screen least from my
angle what he's a happy cÃ­mon fisherman
grew up here in the Halfmoon Bay Area
Pacifica and um you know he plotted a
pretty important curve off of just five
data points and as everyone knows is
held true remarkably to this day even
those been recast several times in two
ways he never actually stated but you
know the sort of consensus that we had
today is at least a gestalt that
everyone has they were doubling the
computer power roughly every 12 to 18
months if anyone you talk to know the
coolest thing about Moore's Law and and
I show this graph for two reasons one
because I think it's the most important
graph of all technology business and
second because every time I show it I
say that I show it in any presentation
of giving regardless of topic and I
always ask the question how many people
have seen rakers wells curve of Moore's
law which is the hundred-year
abstraction in Moore's law now one
hundred ten years some of you must have
seen it don't don't be shy but it's
actually maybe 22% of the room that is
on average every
to give it just the percentage doesn't
change it I'm not sure why um so let me
reinforce why I think it's so important
for the what's that
well not all them this one this one is
we got a whole book full of grass right
well I'm not sabonis that would be a
jump I mean it's an interesting point so
this graph has been vetted recently at
Santa Fe Institute in some degree of
depth to say in what is the instead of
just drawing what I don't like is this
sort of like white squiggly double
exponential of these kind of eyeballs I
could see a straight line just as easily
but they have at least gotten look at
the data points to say is it a power law
is it an exponential is it a double
exponential is it sublinear you know
it's a logarithmic scale of course so
where's Mel's argument is a double
exponential you know slightly up taking
curve ifs if I thinks it fits better to
power law in any case its massive
compounding curve over 110 years for
which is probably no parallel in
business certainly not technology
business where the pace of change seems
and its ever accelerating partly because
of this curve what we're planning here's
calculations per second a thousand
dollars can buy why we doing that
because no one buys transistors right
there's no customer circuit world that's
that has been discretes of course there
are people buy computation of the buy
storage that's why that's what matters
that's what Moore's law is all about and
by either metric you see a similar curve
over long periods of time so this
abstraction allows you across the color
bands to compare different technologies
right and what's astounding is people
didn't know they were form-fitting to a
curve there are dots below the curve
this is the frontier of human capacity
the best price performance computer of
the day and the takeaways are well first
we use our tools to build better tools
and so on so forth computer controlled
machines and then better lithography
equipment better simulation tools most
importantly a light to build better and
better systems
second major takeaways span five
paradigms of technology already what
might be the next one that's been
investment pieces for us from elec
electronics and quantum computing but I
think the most important points are no
one knew they were form-fitting to a
curve just kind of interesting it begs
that almost a cosmological question of
why and will it continue and will it
saturate it also is completely exogenous
to the economy right world will end
World War two Great Depression has had
no impact on the pace of innovation
scientists don't rest during recessions
now the company is behind these dots may
have gone out of business like flies on
the windscreen based on the economy but
they haven't changed the pace of
innovation which is
standing observation over a long period
of time and one I think really take some
time to sink in for people recently
Brian Arthur and others have written in
Kevin Kelley in this most recent book
what technology wants that not only is
this exhaustion to the economy it is
curves like this that create the economy
and they make the argument that every
idea every innovation is the product of
prior innovations usually a pair
sometimes more the really radical ones
are interdisciplinary and if you take
that premise is possibly true but all
good ideas happen not in isolation they
occur in remarkably time-synchronized
fashion across the planet and they are
that compounding of prior innovations
then an interesting outgrowth of that
observation this is a combinatorial
possibility space of idea combinations
is itself growing exponentially right so
we have understandings of
electromagnetism today and the circuitry
that has sued it allows us to build
things we otherwise couldn't there's a
sequence of innovations it allows more
innovation and so on and so forth so
there's at least one theory that this
isn't just a weird you know people form
fitting to a curve like people used to
say in the early days in Moore's law
it's like oh there's a whole industry
roadmap and therefore everyone's
purposely trying to just form fit to you
know a forecast that was put out by the
industry roadmap well you know these
guys didn't know there was an industry
roadmap and they weren't form-fitting
anything and also it's the concatenation
ideas it that I think is most powerful
okay now let me actually go back
personal site and then learners can take
away is that as I mean this is an
enormous scale change right as you reach
certain thresholds a formally lab
science becomes a simulation science
right the life sciences industry is
going through that revolution as we
speak over the last decade where things
that were done through trial and error
experimentation be done in silico and
therefore the pace of innovation
dramatically improves what's happening
of late is that there's some new
thresholds in energy clean tech markets
fuels and chemicals even rockets and
cars where the ability to simulate
something like do I need to actually
crash the car or can I just simulate how
it will crash before you know and send
your very first vehicle to the
government for crash testing confident
it will work based on simulation just
like Boeing designs their planes
entirely in silico without the wind
tunnels computational power it allows
you to do things much more quickly and
in revolutionizes industry after
industry so that's why Moore's law is so
important not just to first computers
than Communications and telecom and
datacom the obvious ones right but life
sciences vehicle design fuels and
chemicals now biology just one random
example again you
gratuitous opportunity to show both one
of my favorite activities I was watching
Rockets on Sunday but also a company we
invested in this use Moore's law in a
variety different ways to redesign how
Rockets are built that roughly you know
1/10 the cost of incumbants where they
use the same electronics chassis
throughout the same fpga module for all
control elements in just all kinds of
new ways the way you'd build a rocket
today not the way build it 23 years ago
our stuff when Atlas and Delta were
coming together and allowed them on
their Falcon 9 launch to succeed get
into orbit on the first attempt you know
a lot of simulation went into that
whereas the last attempt to build a new
rocket in the United Sates the Atlas
took 13 crashes in a row 13 explosions
and dramatic failures before they
finally put someone orbit thanks to
Moore's law no for a historic throwback
machine you know back to the 90s and
then into early 2000s you know if you
look at the internet and preaching to
the choir here about how portent that is
and how it accelerates technology's
proliferation itself right so you had
Moore's law as a phenomenon the rate at
which humans are networking is itself
increasing the pace of change if you
think about pockets of ideas how many
good entrepreneurs in the planet can see
that have their ideas see the light of
day that's dramatically changing here
we're compensating for you know if all
these companies had launched at the same
date which they didn't really
interesting how their pace of growth
earlier the buddy communication systems
ICQ out of Israel hotmail out of
actually does anyone know where hot
Mills based pretty close they purposely
chose to Fremont so they didn't move
later so there was a later location that
was closer they they would really put a
lot of marketing thought into this
wouldn't be in Fremont on Liberty Avenue
and launched on the 4th of July free
email and of course they've got no press
cuz they want no one's working on the
fly um but in Prior talks people usually
think India and of course these
companies could have been anywhere Skype
was built in Estonia by four programmers
in four months
hotmail by you know two programmers in
three months and those companies could
be and are increasingly anywhere today
wow it is based in Serbia you know you
can build and launch a product so
obvious point but also the pace at which
products can play is you know
unprecedented at the time these were
record setters for the rate at which a
new product had been subscribed to by
users over time and of course now is you
know Skype 400 million users they all
like the third largest telco in the
world and then growing on great guns
still today so the
globalization effect is important in it
fertile it accelerates proliferation of
ideas and if you think about ideas
mating well ideas having sex the way I'm
at really we describe it as the source
of innovation that's what makes Silicon
Valley so magical the rate at which
interdisciplinary ideas and inter
geographically sort of dispersed ideas
can cross pollinate is a powerful driver
of the pace of innovation it's all
there's no loose analogy one could draw
two differential immunity like well you
know the missionaries first came to the
new world and killed everyone through
the transmission of smallpox and related
diseases ideas are the same way if
disruption is good remember if change is
good like killing off all the incumbents
is a good thing in your mind then the
idea the extent to which ideas can cross
point across academic disciplines
disciplines that had been perhaps
segregated from each other like Islands
through their vernacular in Systems
Theory and then finally come back
together around some new locus of
conversation like nanotech or synthetic
biology where the folks who weren't
talking to each other now start to talk
to each other usually at universities
that's where you see a proliferation of
radical ideas an example recently how
that the spills into energy markets now
trillion dollar industries water
purification salt state lighting energy
and clean tech and fuels and chemicals
or all markets that are 10 to 100 times
bigger than anything the venture
community has ever aspired to attack if
you will an example just from our
portfolio enter NOC which went public on
a few years back it looks a lot like an
internet company under the covers what
they do is they stitch together
demand sort of shedding opportunities
and demand generation opportunities and
industrial accounts imagine a hospital a
Safeway store what have you if some
cases diesel gensets for backup power
and the ability to shed load like to
know tune down the lighting lower the
temperature on the fridge for you know
hour at a time let's say and by
stitching all those industrial accounts
together they can present virtual load
shedding to a utility and say look
instead of having a brownout or instead
of having to build this you know the
natural gas peaking power plant that you
only turn on a few hours each year for
those people owed moments instead let's
use our network information network to
turn on you know these will gensets
worst case or just shed load in your
region on demand an exchange for that
option value the option to do whenever
the utility wants they get a constant
steady source of money every month that
they then share with these industrial
partners so it's a network effect it's
an Internet company it's only made
possible by the ability of State and
networks that span across these
industrial accounts and so it grows like
an Internet company right they've got to
profitability
three million of invested capital which
is again contrary to what people might
think for energy content markets it's
places like that we're almost excited
what feels like information technology
than it is business applied to join
dollar markets it's come by the way
they've already prevented the
manufacture of 70 gas-fired plants on
the East Coast the United States alone
through their virtual network I'm not
going to spend any time on this and some
context people religion about energy
clean tech and come back to it in Q&amp;amp;A if
you want but we've been investing and
are probably the most active investor
globally in energy in cliff-like
products this is about a couple months
old but they're about seventy-five
companies across the network about forty
five from this office here alone we
started an energy generation
distribution and storage kinds of plays
were much more interested in the ones on
the right side of the page at this time
which is a more efficient use around
solid-state lighting building materials
what-have-you fuels and chemicals around
synthetic biology and resource
management or broad catch-all everything
from agriculture to water purification
things like that this for a sense that
there are real businesses here the
revenues have been doubling about every
year for this aggregate portfolio and
current this group alone I think will do
about 1.4 billion in revenue this year
up a hundred percent from last year now
what's one example that's kind of
interesting sexy I love Tesla you know
I'm biased of course but I put together
a couple of slides for a Castrol
management retreat it blew my mind this
is a company that has ten billion a year
in sales and the only product they make
is lubricants for internal combustion
engines that's people imagine having a
ten billion dollar and she's like the
buggy whip you know supplier of the last
century and there and there they're
gleefully that's all they do they have
no intent to go outside of that and I
had to tell him that that entire and
she's going away there will be no
internal combustion engine right in some
near-term future like fifty to
seventy-five years from now and they
were aghast and one of the reasons is
just for those who don't know these if
it was were a gas engine it's about one
of those least efficient things on the
planet it's it wastes eighty percent of
its energy the heat that is not used for
anything useful and only 0.3 percent of
the fuel you burn in your car if you're
driving a gas car moves you the
passenger 0.3% I believe all
transportation will be electric
airplanes is a much longer debate will
take the longest time but Planes Trains
automobiles they be the new ones are
already they use diesel gensets in line
to run the motors this is just a better
way to build every vehicle you could
imagine
even if you generate electricity by
burning oil which you wouldn't of course
eventually they be all fusion fission
but even if you use stupid waste like
one big centralized oil burning fossil
fuel burning machine it's still better
to transmit that power go through the
battery in efficiencies and run electric
motor in a car for sure in a train if
you have better storage Parma trains
today is in tanks and heavy equipment is
they use electric motors but they don't
have good storage density how can we
store enough energy on the vehicle to
make that make sense so along the way
when we talk about transportation is it
itself is an enormous industry ripe for
change and all kinds of information
economies are going to percolate through
the vehicle it's going to be the mobile
iPad if you will
oh let me go back one but that's the
high end when we talk about disruptive
change um it's pretty interesting
Clayton Christian talks about this pinch
remove in the auto industry is an easy
example everyone I think can understand
is that you got this high-end fancy
brand you know luxury kind of segment if
you will that mainstream I do ignore and
say well that's just gonna be as with
past luxury cars a high-end niche
Ferrari a Lamborghini kind of category
that doesn't matter to us right and and
Tesla would disagree but that's one way
to dismiss the new entrant the other
category that can be dismissed is the
low end the car the products that are
useless to your current customer base so
if you're selling you know Hummers or
f-150 pickup trucks there are certain
categories of vehicles yours not
watching with with a lot of detail in
the example I'd love to give us China
today has a hundred and twenty million
electric vehicles buzzing around its
roads about that per second 120 million
electric vehicles sold by 1,300
different Chinese manufacturers today
that's not the future I gave a sneak
peak unfortunately before so you didn't
have the time to think about what the
hell I'm talking about it's these two
wheelers right there the equivalent of
electric best buzz ebikes and scooters
what's astounding is the pace at which
they've taken off in China and just as
the things that OPM show you that graph
and I've updated it this was some work
initially done by Jonathan Leonard out
of Chevron and I've been gathering the
last few years today to just update as
this curve does ever since he joined
Chevron he isn't really supposed to be
focusing on this so much um the electric
two-wheelers is the green curve it's the
most popular powered vehicle category in
China today and has been for a while now
what's interesting is what what made
this change occur there's been a few
things first there was policy right it's
amazing when you have a government run
by engineers they actually set policy
you know in a slightly different way
then other democracies around the world
so they just say we're going to
these two cycle you know polluting bikes
from our samara city's eventually we've
got 250 cities banned petroleum two
wheelers then they start to get scrapped
50,000 53,000 of them are scrapped in
shanghai then they give a law granting
them the right to the bike lanes so kind
of like commuting policy here not it not
you can see what's house correlating
with growth and by the way technology
improved right they switch to
VRLA batteries they got 30% improvement
yield and inefficiency there they switch
the brushless motors in the early days I
got him also another about a 30%
efficiency gain so those technology
improvement as well in the background
and oh by the way purchasing power of
the average person in China needed
doubled roughly during this period so
that also helps then there's some other
changes now here's an issue question
what do you think was the biggest kicker
it's sort of what what Disney in the
curve what was the biggest driver at
least in Jonathan's mind of this
transition it's anyone want adventure I
guess nothing do with policy was nothing
intentional
it was czars people didn't want to ride
on the bus and then they bought these
electric two wheelers as a substitute
for bus transport and when they actually
paid for them they realized it cost less
than riding the bus if you do an all-in
cost analysis thingy ttw it's actually
cheaper to buy and operate one of these
for solo passenger use than to ride the
buses in China and that by the way it
was perceived to be even lower still
because that factors in battery
replacement over its life which most
people when they first buy it they don't
realize I have to replace those crappy
batteries that they used over there the
early batteries about every year and a
half to two years but even if you factor
all and actually do a real cost that
economics is cheaper which is kind of
much interesting those thousand three
hundred different vendors in the top
right corner are examples of their
latest products the four largest
manufacturers are now doing
four-wheelers these cars sell for
between two and four thousand dollars a
lot of them do the criticism the
government are not even regulated as
cars are just selling them with
absolutely no not to the crash safety
laws of the country but nevertheless
that's the bottom end right that's a
great example of Craig Christensen's
coming from the bottom you know by the
time they've shipped more units than
anyone else it'll be a bit too late for
auto other auto companies now by the way
looking back in time 100 years look at
cumulative energy electricity use and
you know in the u.s. right in 1900
transportation was the single largest
consumptive source of electricity in the
US and I believe it will become
something close to that again in the
future sort of just for the long view
okay that was just a brief digression on
something that I think is pretty
interesting but not the main point the
main point of that as an example was
disruptive change is occurring in
industries that have been sheltered from
the shut door change for a while right
when Tesla in public company go public
since Henry Ford so it's been sheltered
for a while just as I would argue fuels
and chemicals have been as well and in
other huge industries so now
accelerating change things like Moore's
Law here's where a Sebastian's good
point about a KERS Wells curves being
this just firehose of actually put it
bias firehose of biased perspectives
nevertheless if you look at some of the
examples where the curves hold really
well let's say other people did the
analysis if you just want to do it look
at it that way there's of course IT
related topics where you see similar
curves IBM's and analysis of the disk
drive industry or mass storage if you
will and it holds even more powerfully
than Moore's law over a slightly shorter
period of time but more dramatic slope
of change obviously networking of all
kinds of different metrics of the size
and scope of the internet but also
biological themes evolution itself from
one hundreds of millions of years
follows a very similar accelerating pace
to change which is fascinating and we
are now of course really I mean think
about how does that accelerate in our
lifetimes how do we feel accelerating
changing technologies of course the
vector of abstraction is moving to our
technologies not our biological systems
so you take that broader definition of
us and our technological substrates
meaning our societal means and norms the
technologies we build and in the world
that we live in our extended self that
is evolving at an accelerating pace of
change even the current day but also a
lot of sort of life science like things
like in that curve there that's
Dickerson's law not very famous guy but
it's even more predictive than Moore's
law itself it's held 2.5% accuracy to
the current day over 35 years when he
first said it of how many proteins are
gonna crystallize each year and in the
1965 he predicted a number that's helped
shoot two today I'm at least a formula
that is and the numbers of genes map I
think genes map does interesting proxy
for the information accrual and
accumulation in life sciences and so
I'll give you an example that on the
Left gave the Human Genome Project how
many genes have been checked into the
gene bank the public you know effort and
you know this exponential curve looks
familiar to some now at the time it was
deeply contentious especially Midway
when very little progress has been made
and
Thayer's were saying hey the shotgun
sequencing approach will never work and
you know craig venter in the team
realized hey you guys think it's gonna
take this long week and we can look
forward to the computers that will be
available four years from now and we
don't really need to work so hard in the
early days because we only want to use
the computers in early days let's just
collect samples and do all the shotgun
sequencing at the back end and do half
the project in the last six months and
that's exactly how it played out that
the pace of Moore's law drove the
shotgun sequencing technology basically
computers have to you know reassemble
the genetic code from the nebulized
random fragments that are overlapping
and sure enough they kicked in the gear
just there now what's this intriguing
didn't like rest on our laurels the sort
of thing stop and digest as one might
have assumed in fact there's some
criticism that human health hasn't
improved much from this research they
moved on to microbes what's astounding
is if you look on the right curve this
whole Human Genome Project is that
little part of the curve and since then
it is just mushroomed like crazy now
what's interesting is you might say what
was it you know it's really that's some
sort of local peak but what's even more
astounding because this doesn't take us
to the current day is it if you look in
the last 18 months one team again craig
Venter sailing around the world shotgun
sequencing whole ecosystems now at a
time again using Moore's law to say now
the computers are good enough that we
don't even care to segregate the tens of
millions of organisms that are in one
little milliliter of seawater that we
sample the bacteria and viruses we're
just not put the whole damn ecosystem
unsegregated through our methodology and
deduce all the interesting genes that
matter out there right well that team
alone has grown this dataset tenfold
alright so this now is 10% of known
genes on the planet today the number of
no genes for energy transduction how do
we harvest energy from the Sun have gone
100 fold things like chlorophyll the
rhodopsins the things that are have
evolved in the ocean water over longer
periods of time and are more efficient
than land-based plants and animals
fascinating stuff right problem is why
would you ever done this because in
biotech 1.0 if you don't have the host
organism for much to physically cut and
paste the genes what good is the data
right and so people may not have thought
to do this 10 years ago because it would
have just been an academic exercise at
best there's a bunch of genes but we
don't have to do with it it could have
been like me maybe a statistical study
but nothing actionable no business could
have come out of that well what's
changed and what craig Venter saw was
another exponential curve these these
ones by the way it done by Carlson don't
even worry about the access at this
point because what matters is the
relative slopes
read is Moore's law
blue is the advances that have been made
in gene sequencing which is reading the
code of life and green is the pace of
change in the synthesis of genes writing
the code of life and slight differences
in slope have a dramatic compounding
impact over time so if you put this on a
linear graph gene synthesis technology
advances would make Moore's law book
flatline in comparison for example now
what are we referring to here we're
literally talking about emailing files
diversion places around the planet give
me an A give me a T give me a GGC
whatever and then getting a FedEx back
about all of the nucleotide sometimes
several series of these and and they're
all over the place this is a local
company just down the street
DNA 2.0 they literally have beakers
affectionately labeled ATG and C and the
things are just printing them out there
doesn't no animals are involved right
this is just you know or chemistry in
the lab well the ability to predict that
following cost of gene synthesis a lot
of people to think about oh well I mean
when will we build the first virus 2002
sure enough it happened when we build
the first free living organism that can
propagate the first organism whose
parents are a computer in the sense that
it's just code pulled out of the air
with you know embedded URL is in this
code and all kinds of interesting poems
and quotes build base pair of a base
pair from the ground up with no animals
two balls or that one would that happen
in just a few months ago company on the
right hand side Synthetic Genomics again
delayed by cut down or did that it's an
astounding accomplishment first that you
can take 1% of the DNA out of an
organism put in an entirely foreign
bolus and have it change species change
phenotype from one to another and they
show that across the organisms that were
genetically different as nice and them
just for symbolic guy which actually
means pretty darn close it turns out but
these are single-cell organisms don't
get me wrong no one has taken on mammal
mammalian cells they're quite a bit
larger and more complex but it's a
profound
I think watershed achievement in a field
that won't have that field won't have
business applications this year because
directly it will indirectly but not
directly we're not going to build new
life-forms don't get me wrong but that's
where we're heading on the conversation
what we will do is high-throughput
experimentation at a pace that hasn't
been done before
it'll radically change the process of
innovation well you don't have to find
the host organism to test hypothesis
well what if we spliced in this version
of our adoption that has a different
frequency tuning ability to a different
spectra of light you can run as George
Church at Harvard is shown using a
different methodology four billion
experiments a day of genetically
different organisms it's just
mind-blowing ly different
biotech two point I was mind-blowingly
different than biotech 1.0 in both the
pace of innovation and the rate at which
we can run experiments it will as this
is all big lead up to say well it begs
the question what one would design but
the capacity of design is with us now
and by the way when teenagers are
playing with it then you know it's
somehow hit mainstream so the for those
familiar with the International
genetically engineered machines
competition I Jim started by Joe Andy
now at Stanford formerly MIT um
teenagers and people in the early
twenties or me no we engineering e.coli
like it was Lego bricks right you know
make it into it oscillating repeater
with logic gates have put a built in a
chemical sensor just you know to
drag-and-drop like the Mindstorms NXT um
kind of work space and make organisms
that do fascinating things right there
was a binary system where one organism
was a sensor the other was a therapeutic
for Crohn's disease it's not yet in
animal trials but at least on paper it
seems seems quite plausible that it
could work another team has done degree
engineered the e.coli smell better
because they smell like that much they
come and they just didn't want to work
with something smelled like that all day
some innocent life bananas and in a 13
created a biofilm and had to change it's
kind of like go the e-ink screens on on
a Kindle change the way which it
portrays the color based on light
exposure so it's literally like a film
that you can expose to light with higher
resolution the normal film and what I
would call a colloid and that I think
should should at least be played with
smart so it's a fun one so now what do
you know you just take these little
paper waters below in and they're just
playing around with this stuff we're
splicing it together they even have
their own comic book oh well if that
slide in well what is the business
application in the near term not the
immediate term but you know the next few
years maybe a decade out is you know 90%
of all organic chemicals in fact
everything you can see and touch in this
room not the underlying metals but but
surface coatings just let every in this
room probably came from petroleum or
natural gas which is pretty astounding
because we have organic coatings on
everything mean this is this entire
thing for example and inevitably it will
be known as the formerly petrochemical
industry because I think we'll look back
at some point in the distant future
maybe 50 years to the present day and
marvel that we had
incredibly rich recently all burned it
right it's the least creative thing you
could do with a resource like that I
think it is like the Amazon basin
there's a lot of to do at the Amazon
basin burning it is the least creative
of those things instead you could bio
convert it into all kinds of fuels and
chemicals that have more rich use that
aren't just burned I should say not feel
smells but chemicals and so these these
Morgan isms can assemble things with
stereo stereo come with a precision in
their stereo chemistry this is very
valuable
is it the left-handed right-handed
version of the molecule is it the sugar
that's on the adjustable or digestible
they can do that without a statistical
sample but as you know as a metabolic
pathway just creating one not the other
so there's some big companies that will
come up to this Exxon Mobil that's
probably spent more in marketing than
science but they have put six hundred
nine dollars towards the science with
Synthetic Genomics there's much other
companies working on in this case for
example re-engineering algae to
continuously secrete their oils across
the cell membrane so unlike a sort of
farming approach we have to grow kill
extract the oils to make biofuels or CEM
or fish foods or or any number of other
lipids you have continuous secretion a
very inexpensive separation process or
they just kind of continuously get
seperated often organism makes more and
more and more that could be
revolutionary to algae-based fuels and
chemicals and there's other really
interesting projects like um converting
coal to natural gas underground which is
already done biogenic ly 10% of our
natural gas comes from there there's
been some recent efforts they've shown
you a 100 maybe a thousand fold
improvement in that where you take the
dirtiest burning of the fossil fuels
coal with all its sulfur mercury
leave it in the ground converted to
natural gas which is the cleanest
burning right you burn in your kitchen
without a fume hood and without any in a
sense energy infusion you don't actually
have to crack or fraktur wells you just
let the microbes do the work and when
they did genetic sampling of those wells
it was kind of amazing they drilled down
pulled up a genetic time capsule of
sorts the organisms living in there had
a whole rich ecosystem completely
isolated from all sources of light or
contact with the outside world they were
stripping hydrogen excuse me stripping
electrons off the carbon bonds there
were spirochetes that were living on
these things the whole little time
capsule that had been segregated from
the rest the world for 70 million years
and fascinating you know everywhere you
look on the planet you find life doing
very interesting stuff what does all
that mean well there is an increasing
sense that this world we live in
at least of late is completely
financial crises and collapses we show
up by the way it's good for startups too
I forgot to mention sources of
disruption you know a good financial
collapse helps new entrance more than
then it hurts them and it hurts
incumbents and there you know debt Lydon
Laden balance sheets and the union
contracts and pension contracts more
than it hurts to start up so if you're
in the automotive industry what better
time to compete with GM and Toyota
just think about it from those startups
one of you anyway Black Swan events
could be considered good or bad
depending on your point of view but
there are things that make sense in
retrospect like Google being successful
of course we all understand why Google's
successful but when they launched I'm
not sure any investors at least to to
make fun of you know our brethren could
have told you here's how it's going to
play out you know here's the roadmap of
how Google will succeed it's what in
retrospect someone like Nicholas Taleb
would call a Black Swan event those
aren't going away right financial crises
near collapses of financial systems the
pace at which those events occur is
going to accelerate and it's going to
increasingly define our world you can do
retrospective analysis of the stock
market and say it's only those huge
internet' swings that are seen like
outliers that really drive change over
time if you took those out stock market
doesn't look anything like it really
does today and increasingly will be so
well you might ask yourself that's kind
of weird how do I plan around that and
you know as mnsure firms we think about
that too and we try to do portfolios and
we try to only be equity investors not
debt lenders because if you take
advantage up side and you have limited
downside you only lose 1% of your money
and any one company unlike some other
kinds of synthetic vehicles um but you
might also ask questions was there
something completely out of left field
that could change computing you know is
that kind of stable Kizza processor is
the way we kind of know him yeah
parallel processing not that radically
different but you know it is computing
more or less a stable thing well some of
you may have caught um the Google
announcement with Dartmouth Nevin
earlier in the year of the use of a
quantum computer from Vancouver to work
on some machine learning casts around
Google Goggles and their recognition of
cars in a particular demo study and they
found both through you know in the way
in which they did discrete machine
learning versus continuous variables and
the way in which is a quantum computer
versus a classical computer they got
improvements over the way machine
learning was done today and my guess is
almost everyone here at some interaction
with machine learning algorithms what's
fascinating about quantum computers is
for those familiar with them they're
just come
different ways interview the only
physics explanation for how they work is
the engagement of parallel universes
just to give a sense how different is
and and the in this sort of the
diffraction patterns would occur across
and nearly neighboring parallel
universes and I'm not joking that is
literally the only explanation that
actually matches with measured reality
and David Deutsch from Oxford another
few um you know professors have willing
them just go out on a limb and say that
I mean guys yeah a minute this is what
the two-slit experiment and everything
else in physics points to um but what's
even more interesting is the the certain
classes of problems things that you can
map to a graph this is a application
specific quantum processor in this
particular case problems like the
Traveling Salesman problem Monte Carlo
simulations turns out molecular modeling
optimization algorithms of almost every
type can be mapped onto this quite
efficiently but not all computation so
certain classes of really hairy problems
like FedEx route optimization um if you
look at that class of problems the ones
that people really care about that are
you know at the cutting edge of what we
can do computationally today in a
high-end data center and all machine
learning for example um if the pace of
progress in quantum computer computing
follows what I've come to call roses law
because Geordi Rose the founder of this
company has sort of plotted the points
who made a claim early on when I first
met him that every year we're going to
do twice as many qubits as the prior
year by the way every time you add a
qubit you almost double the power of the
computer it's not like the Moore's Law
thing about you know adding a bit
doesn't well like from a memory register
size it does but not from a
computational power here it really does
correlate with computational power
doubling of each qubit and we've been
doubling the number of qubits each year
right so if if that pace of progress
gets in it and that curves held for
seven years now if in memory of Gordon
Moore at five data points we have seven
data points versus five if that curve
continues for the next seven years and I
really have no reason to believe why
would or wouldn't because it's you know
semiconductor process it's pretty linear
tiling we're not talking about changing
the design as you scale it's just
putting more of these next to each other
so if this trend continues for the next
seven years as the prior seven one of
these computers that would fit roughly
in the space of this podium area could
outperform all computers on the planet
combined all computers ever made then
you give it a few more spins and soon
it's outperforming all computers that
ever could be made
with any traditional architecture even
if you used all the matter in the
universe to build them and gave the
entire length of the universe as I keep
it company time they still wouldn't
solve problems now obviously we get
around those we use heuristics print
Nina's more time at the brute-force
solving of problems versus using
heuristic where we've long since given
up on solving the problem they need
np-complete problems things that are in
P hard problems rather so that's pretty
good it begs some interesting questions
okay let me finish up soon here um good
I think I'm right on time so there's a
last topic now oh I think a lot of folks
here in some ways made you not lash I -
you shouldn't say that I don't know if
you dream of building complex systems I
sure do you know as I think about the
big unsolved problems in science
especially information science what are
the ones or at least some people say
that will never be done and I always
love that as a challenge either that's
impossible or we'll never do that like
artificial intelligence that exceeds
human intelligence or nano robots doing
amazing things that's actually the
hardest of all them or designing
microbes from scratch that do our
bidding right right in the synthetic
biology side we can we can build on that
but what's the code we don't have the
you know programming environment if you
will or understanding of the
interpreters and compilers of that world
well always have something in common
they are in many ways the attempt to
build a complex system and now we're
building I mean no single human
understands Windows right and we're
trying to build things in many areas of
many artifacts in our world that are
beyond human understanding meaning any
one human so we have teams of humans
that are sort of at that frontier of
human understanding in the paradigm I
design but we're hitting some limits in
certain areas so I first put this slide
together in the 2001 or 2002 around
nanotech so there was a lot of nanotech
specific vernacular I pulled it out
because I realized the big labels kind
of apply to all these areas so but
imagine we were first thinking about you
know dreams of nanotech futures these
little nano robots that do amazing stuff
how would we get there from here right
because as an investor we always have to
think about we can't invest in a dream
and she says let's just hunker down for
20 years and something pops up amazingly
at the other end of it that's a bad
investment thesis but is there a way to
engage with markets customers and
iteratively get to some vision some sort
of shining star that motivates the team
to work hard in the bin to poaches we
could think of a paradigm so how you get
there and
applies all kind of stuff this place the
architecture art there's a whole bunch
of domains of activity for which you
could talk about a top-down or bottom-up
but but specifically what I mean by this
is top-down and sort of the engineering
approach to things Germanic if you will
tradition of we will like the
semiconductor industry we will build
tools to scale down from above we will
inherit interfaces of scale from above
meaning things that are big and you know
discrete capacitors printed circuit
boards plugs the go and walls the big
stuff we couple down to small and
smaller things with technologies where
the frontier is sort of that that that
the about that red point coming down
working out that frontier we're not
reinventing the plug as much we're sort
of working on the cutting edge of you
know gate oxides or whatever might be
down to the nano scale today and the
pace of change is slow incremental and
generates revenue along the way right
the every Intel processor has a market
right they didn't hunker down for 20
years and then come out with some new
architecture at the other end of it
that's why HP IBM and everyone doing
research in nano tech said all of our
interesting products will be twenty
years out that made sense probably will
be but there was this other group kevin
kelly wrote about it and others it
really inspired me which we're doing
radical things in the near term like
Angela Belcher's early work we
engineering viruses to do you know
lithography fascinating work a little
bit different though grown iterated a
little bit out of control you know
movies have been written with that very
powerful but lacking a lot of system
theory how do you really dictate the
outcome of this and it's an area of
active research you know evolution
design and things of this sort but most
interestingly at least here whether the
existence proof of transcendence where
if you think mind evolutionary
algorithms they are capable of producing
products that are more complex than
their antecedents and what I mean by
their antecedents are people like us if
we're putting it together the components
of biological evolution looking back in
time now there is one asterisk to put on
that some deep in this theory argue that
in fact evolutionary algorithms don't
produce anything more complex than their
selection pressure and how you design
the selection pressure which which
organism survives which gets killed off
is actually the embodiment of the magic
in it in our real world where we
co-evolved with a lot artifacts is
remarkably complex it's the matrix if
you will that we live in in in a
rarefied laboratory environment news
simplified dramatically I'm just gonna
select for the fastest bubble sort
algorithm
bubble sort the fastest sorting
algorithm and just kind of genetically
mutate sort algorithms and eventually
pick the fastest one well that's a very
simple selection mechanism and you
generate a sorting algorithm and
whatwhat's subtle in that argument is
you know is there still as much power as
I'm about to describe that's sort of the
asterisk that I want to put there
because that's something I don't fully
understand myself but if I'm fascinated
so let me give an example let's imagine
we think about building AI because I
would hope everyone here would think
that's interesting if it could be done
in me at some point in their life had
debated with somebody whether it can be
done one of my favorite books on
intelligence budget Hawkins um I think I
agree with everything I read in the book
about how the coatrack cortex works and
how we're going to build intelligent
machines in the future except for his
comments in page 219 which you don't
actually have to read them I'll just
summarize them as he believes that once
we build iteratively then all right not
like you know rules based systems or
traditionally I and am back from the 60s
but when we you know grow an artificial
intelligence that will somehow be able
to magically cut and paste things like
English and French speaking capabilities
as if they were modules or down here
cell and swap memory configurations to
reprogram intelligent machines to do
entirely new things as if you're just
installing new software and some
lovelies right you know yes it could
just be software running on a computer
that's true and that's powerful and
we're thinking about but I think the
profound in my opinion error in that
analysis that conflates the power of
design and the power of evolution is
that we would know how to do this in any
way without expending perhaps more
effort than it took to build a system in
reverse engineering it so take for
example you you you grow a neural
network to do speech recognition to
actually decipher how is that speech
recognition algorithm the resulting out
of them working what are the mechanisms
of the work case a lot it's not does not
come out right the decomposition of
design is not free similarly talking
about how long it's taken to do
reverse-engineer the human brain which
is itself of course a product of
iterative algorithms of evolution and
organic growth and improving based on
usage based feedback understanding the
brain and its subcomponents is a
remarkably difficult right if we grew if
we could very quickly run experiments
billions of experiments per day per
second and could grow and artificial
intelligence if we could do that it
would not be would be just as difficult
to reverse engineer as the human brain
today if not more so because it would
have started with a foreign substrate
and this interface
this would be kind of alien to us so I
don't think there's any reason why us
poor little humans in terms of our
cognitive capacities and lack of theory
for this could in any way take a really
complex system and just say oh yes
here's the decomposition of design
because there's no design the
decomposition of subsystems starting to
do that think about how many human minds
are currently trying to try to
understand our own brains so what is it
about these evolved systems and makes
them so inscrutable well you get these
emergent layers of abstraction that
helps which is you know in in human
evolution right you don't tinker with
basic genetic code when we went from
primates to humans right we don't tinker
with amino acids or protein signaling we
don't really tinker with much of the
hierarchy of evolutionary historical
artifacts it's all in network it's all
in the number of nodes in our brain
right and in that's really fundamental
it wasn't even a new cell or a new
neuron someone argue the mirror neuron
but it's really how its wired not so
much you know that
Noblet concept is the neuron itself it
has a new vector of indirection I would
argue that evolution today is Farley a
far outpaced by anything in the
biological world and it's all
technological we'll get to that later
now the subsystem inscrutability if
anyone has worked in these areas it sort
of comes part and parcel mate it's
obvious but when Danny Hillis for
example the Genetic Programming
to build a better sort algorithm and to
compete with bubble sort it did a pretty
good job at sorting it wasn't it didn't
beat the best human design that's pretty
simple task designed us fairly well in
it but it did better than most
programmers can program so this is
completely artificial evolution process
beat most computer scientists in their
attempt to write from scratch the best
sort rather than they could write but it
made absolutely no sense the code was
full of all kinds of it was very large
code base it had all kinds of crazy
stuff in it that may have seen a sense
and he never actually got around to
figuring out how it works same stood
neural network scenario I did some
research in it's when I first
desensitize me the fact that it's the
process that you learn about not the
product right when you do on another
experiment or let's try that one again
you can tweak mutation rate tweak
selection pressure tweak whatever
parameters of communication if you will
in the growing system but you don't say
okay here's the output here's what makes
sense let's let's take what we've built
and build more on it you really can't do
that so the learning is that the process
not the system level and it's a black
box to find bytes interfaces what really
is understandable thing about the brain
is the interface is the sensory cortex
right we can hack in
the outside when there's something like
the retina there's an interface to what
we know so most of the brain studies
have come in through the auditory cortex
the sensory the visual system and that
makes a lot more sense than the core
cortex itself and maybe the wisest now
be curious maybe in Q&amp;amp;A if anyone has a
argument against this because I didn't
find it fascinating is that there's no
mathematical shortcut there's no way to
take a narrative algorithm like a
fractal or rule 31 in a solar automata
or evolution itself and say given the
output of that process run the tape
backwards you tell me how we got there
having only the output as your input
right no it's only with the artifact of
creation with evolved humans yeah show
me how evolution got it sir right
there's no word reverse evolved like
there is reverse engineering right and
our intuition does not lend itself well
to figuring out that processes
information is lost at each step along
the way from a wolfram sense of
computational equivalence you could
argue that this will never be found and
that there is no mathematical shortcut
in that sort of the logical depth if you
will of complexity in an emergent system
is really where all the actions so what
is this dichotomy a designer talking
about again and just to jump to the
chase so I don't mislead people
I think the richness is to explore where
this dichotomy doesn't hold to not
believe it has to be this breakpoint so
I'm first going to describe it as a you
know diverging path of the futures where
let's say two different research teams
working on AI or and I have very little
say with each other if one's going to
design route and the others going the
AFOL drove but I want to argue that
hopefully some of them figure out a way
to break that that gotta mean so when
you design something you have control
generally what you build is very brittle
just think of windows versus things that
are that are evolved and they can
transcend in terms of complexity what
their antecedents or these creators if
you will you can create a process to
create complexity more easily than you
create the complexity itself here I mean
not to denigrate all computer science
with generally simple problems compared
to really sauce complex problems and
just for a sense of the code density
difference if you take the healing
genome burn it on a CD even without any
sophisticated compression algorithm just
you know kind of brute force Huffman
coding um
it's much smaller than Microsoft Office
it just has a lot about the different
methodologies of code representation and
of course the value and power the
interpreter in the case of the human
genome
system clarity um not always but usually
you guys and designed something if
you're good about commenting your code
but even if you're not good at
commenting your code people gonna
usually figure out other humans can
figure out what you're up to most of the
time I mean less you're really trying to
escape
and that allows for portability modular
reuse object or any programming
everything comes out of this right we
the whole field the computer science
focuses on making that more efficient
right in a compartmentalized way for
much of computer science I should make
it such sweeping generalizations but it
is in a drastic contrast to the
hierarchical subsumption architecture of
let's say or rodney brooks the way he
builds robotic control systems and hmm I
often mention this now example there's
potentially a lot of sense of sort of a
path dependence some would argue you
can't build an AI unless you build a
physical robot that it's instantiated in
that sort of the brain in the box would
never work you'd have all kinds of weird
non-recognizable intelligence is
emerging and and that's a whole another
interesting side debate but Rodney I
believe would agree with that
and how you go is very interesting if
you do a series of iterative selection
pressures does inevitably when you talk
about intelligence do you build in a
survival instinct right if only those
organisms that survive some selection
pressure are selected for regardless of
your attempt to you know evolved for
friendliness or evolved for you know you
know sacrifice sacrificial and iRobot
like you know rule codes it may be
inevitable outcome that any evolutionary
algorithm creates a survival instinct
just kind of sting and also it's called
illusionary Islands back back to the
point of of you know not being able to
transcend the complexities of your
selection pressure if you evolve
anything in a restricted environment it
will only work and be robust resilient
adaptive in that environment them only
take it out of the environment it could
be just completely slaughter I'll give
you a great example there's this group
in the Midwest that was evolving FPGAs
to do some interesting tasks I forget
what some computational tasks these are
digital circuits with you know an SRAM
bank and some gates but they're just you
know you can put code in in the code we
programs the wiring in the function of
the circuit so think about is circuit
design reduce the code in FPGAs and they
had banks and banks of these in running
this set of genetic algorithms and then
selecting for the best ones and then
they found one that just blew the doors
off it in fact solved the problem at
hand that
then was any human design better than it
was theoretically possible for that chip
oh my god this is unbelievable the
breakthrough has occurred they took it
somewhere else and it stopped working
yeah it's not robust outside of its
environment temperature was off for
vibration in the floor who knows what
right okay so it didn't work when we
moved it let's take it back put it back
where it was okay starts working and
what is going on it had found a way to
RF couple to neighboring cells
computational resources in a completely
undocumented manner life will find a way
from Jurassic Park comes to mind so what
are some of the implications of this
well I don't think Jeff Hawkins thing
about cut and paste is easy I don't
think very kurz Wells idea that you
upload your consciousness to Silicon is
so easy to take phantom limb pain right
you know you a lot of amputees a large
percentage of them have this horrible
ringing effect given neuroplasticity
where they have this scruciating pain in
the missing limb area even though the
limb is not there and they just want to
scratch it something that's not there
those kinds of effects at the interfaces
right we said we've got the brain in the
box but that brain the box going to be
ringing horribly with its sensory system
again unless we really understand how
sensory cortex works yeah that's just an
AI kind of geeky point the most
important point in X the second one um
then in all this maybe it's obvious but
you don't learn about what you're
building you learn about the process of
building it which is important it'll
have some implications on management as
well this call evolutionary Islands
thing I'll get into that so much but the
differential immunity concept carries
across here too if you evolve something
in a lab it's just not gonna be ready
for the real world and does beg the
question do we need to have these
technologies robustly amongst us from
day one for them to ever become
intelligent in a way that we would
understand oh and then one maybe feel
that's funny anecdote on this slide
which is if you think like the uploading
folks you know there's only a small
handful I think there's a handful of
people who believe that we will do
better and better our brain scans and
non-destructive methods of reading the
neuronal states everything from every
ion channel state and its massive
complexity it's mind-boggling but yeah
they're like follow the curves well one
day we'll be able to do this why
couldn't you Rhian Stan she ate that on
a silicon simulator and the nisshin
thought experiment in terms of race
conditions to AI futures are given FDA
regulations if nothing else
what would you upload first a primate
right do a test and see if this works
before you you know especially if there
was a destructive upload has
experiment um right Templeton is pointed
out make sure you do bonobos not chimps
by the way but no that's for those I
don't know are these incredibly cool
animals that aren't really seen ins do
as much because they do it in the
missionary position and kids freak out
and then they're in there basically
bisexual Sisterhood's of eveness they
just do everything that you could
imagine you'd see on a porn flick um
with each other and and they have a
wonderful social structure they don't
fight as much as chimps which are like
the opposite and in male centric kind of
BattleBots so so imagine you upload a
primate but no the lesson the pace of
silicon progress would be so great that
by the time you wouldn't bother to
reverse engineer it you wouldn't bother
to say well you know what worked what
didn't you you just start throwing the
silicon faster and it would you know
could very well be the AI that takes
over wouldn't even be human base for
that reason because the you know the
sort of race condition by the time
someone gets around that blood and human
it hasn't had time to catch up by the
way this is an interesting little time
capsule of 2007 for those who just don't
realize we're the state of the art today
on temps to unify some of these things
would say evolved for purposeful outputs
but Koza has gotten more into politics
of late but he was breeding programs for
quite a while and found that you know
any application space where it's very
easy to validate if you have a good
solution but very difficult to think of
a solution like analog circuit design
and tena design
it lends itself great for these kinds of
algorithms right and so what he did is
he bred programs to build you know in
some of these have flown in space and
intent of the flew in space it was a
cockamamie thing no one understands why
it works but was the best antenna for a
given need or analytic circuit design
and he's already gotten patents on these
so you know back 2007 he was just
starting to get patents that he was
reproducing many US patent sort of human
patented inventions without any input
just you know here's what the filter
needs to do find a filter but then he
got new designs or actually winning
patents as being novel and he was
believed in this routine in this domain
there's routinely
delivering human kepada machine
intelligence another example that I like
it's one of our one of our companies is
the way in which you've been designed
for evolved ability and this would be
the last example that I use imagine
you're trying to again back to synthetic
biology build and run ISM that does
something useful and the most common
examples making chemical you want in
this case they would butanediol which
is the major precursor of spandex and
automotive plastics so the spandex of
the future may be built from sugar and
may be green through their work so the
goal is how do you make a microbe this
is their metabolic pathways shown here
do what you want
so they started off with simulation
tools they simulated all of 40,000
different pathways to get from A to B
and analyzed mathematically and
engineering sense what is the most
carbon efficient the most sort of issues
of energy and and then one design team
was working on that and got about a five
fold improvement in the yield making the
chemical they wanted from the start
anyways the chemical is not made in any
organism naturally it's a completely
synthetic pathway a different team in
the same company instead selectively
crippled the organism and they didn't
pick for this design they didn't pick
the most efficient path way through they
picked one that would allow them the
other pathways of survival where it
can't eat a variety of feedstocks and
you know camp because only them on
certain sugars it's an incredibly weak
poorly suited organism to live but it
happens to make the chemical that you
want as a by-product and instead they
just skimmed the fastest growers over
three months so take whatever organisms
growing fast let's put a new Baker give
it another day put that in a new beaker
and after a few months they had improved
the chemical yield twenty thousand fold
so human design fivefold improvement
random search twenty thousand fold
improvement they have no idea why or how
but what's interesting is they don't
need to and the process may keep
improving even as they scale so many one
of the problems with synthetic biology
is you have a lab scale demo where the
surface area to volume of a beaker is
different than the surface area to
volume let's have a huge tank and all of
a sudden the process falls out of bed
when you try to scale up some of this a
yeast fermentation process in scaling up
in bio about the bio chemicals and bio
field has always been a risk factor that
scares people well with this
evolutionary approach in a way
temperature varies if the environment
varies they get better and better over
time so it's not just like over three
months they got a twenty thousand fold
approved it got better a month later and
I'm month later and so and so forth so
it could be more robust resilient and
capable of deployment others name with
one one quote Danny Hillis on his last
page of his computer science summary
book believes that the greatest
challenge would be to create tools that
go beyond engineering to create more
than we can understand and also Kevin
Kelley I like that we are in fact
evolving evolved ability
I'll leave it at this I'll go to QA
obviously these four bullet points up
there to say that if you think about how
you manage people actually I'll just
make these four points them and then be
done if you want to exploit a wisdom of
crowds to be innovative as an
organization there's certain policies
you might want to consider like
diversity is more important than ability
of the individuals this all falls out of
the same analysis and genetic algorithms
such the disagreement in a team
about a topic is more important than
reaching the census if you want to find
a strap to change innovative change your
voting policies like what does it take
to commit resources to a project or not
is more important than having any
coherence or comprehensibility of what
you're actually doing and that the
function of management is to tune the
parameters of communication things like
when do we meet how do we communicate
what's the fan-out and what most
important what's maximum group size you
know teams of three to seven get stuff
done everything larger than that
productivity goes to the floor that's
more important in Direction setting it's
not leaders doing their symbolic
leadership stuff it's setting up the
parameters for a high of mind to emerge
in organization so I tried to share with
you today
I think accelerating technological
change continues forever it's leading to
an interdisciplinary Renaissance of
learning which is fascinating and
exciting to just be a student of and now
is reaching trillion-dollar markets
where it hadn't before and
revolutionising them energy fuels
chemicals and such and that it is the
perpetual driver destruction nothing you
can count on 50 years from now it's
create new entrence new entrants new
entrepreneurs and therefore a good time
to build new companies so for example if
this isn't obviously meet Angela on a
Google example I do not believe Google
will ever reinvent search Google would
ever be expected to disrupt search
marketing or search as it exists today
you would never expect Google do that to
reinvent the data center and how
computers are built absolutely ok in
terms of ratchet to punt on ever using
an Intel chip again the charge there
just like in music right Apple was a new
entrant with the iPod and iTunes right
it wasn't gonna be sony sony would never
revolutionize the Walkman it took a new
entrant the new entrants can be big
companies like Apple so I again if you
want to think about where these theories
apply its not to anything I mean you
with search and I think the Technium is
Kevin Kelly cause it is moving
increasingly from
the search so a positive note
concatenating code that exists isn't
gonna be the paradigm in the future or
not designing new code so let me leave
it that if we have time for questions
thank you Steve one minute
we have run over a little bit but we're
willing to take a couple questions
I was really interesting and with all
the talk of technological progress
increasing in speed and everything how
concerned are you about you know the
technological singularity where we
become unable to predict the future or
model our future because of things that
are smarter than us charge right that
that's a good question about the well
it's one subset of the risk of a
singularity other people are scared of
it this sort of photos not remember that
this imagined exponential does continue
forever and never becomes an s-curve
what is the sort of ultimate end point
of that completely life-changing event
Ray Kurzweil writes about this quite a
bit where perhaps you know all matter
you know gets recompiled in some new
computron IAM in the future you know
just really crazy out of bound thinking
when I say crazy crazy to our thinking
right so again all great ideas are
considered crazy so you don't think that
as a negative
um but specifically this idea of us not
being able to understand it may
necessitate the a is that I was
describing that we we may in fact need
to birth technologies that can assist us
in this in this and in fact we may not
even we do that right there's some argue
the Internet's already got it they all
the attributes of a living organism that
all you know attributes of life and
those who study the Internet in its
totality have to resort the kinds of
techniques that biologists we're using
not the techniques the computer
scientists are using to attitute or make
sense of the patterns so let me salute
phrase it in a different way if someone
were to ask you would you want your
great-grandchildren to be smarter
healthier and more capable than yourself
yeah that sounds good
if instead you say hey there's gonna be
machine intelligence next month that's
gonna be healthier happier and more
intelligent than yourself that feels
threatening
right and most sci-fi novels are based
on it but I think once we shift
sense from an entitlement that humans
are the endpoint of evolution to a sense
of parenthood that we're going to create
something greater than ourselves then we
could actualize our universal quest for
symbolic immortality I think every human
wants to be symbolically in more meaning
they create something that lasts a short
time on this planet a work of art but
children most tangibly accompany that
would live on past the founders
hewlett-packard being you know it's easy
to remember example something like that
it's not or belief in the afterlife if
all else fails and I think creating
those artifacts will be one of our most
powerful vectors of being transcendent
to say you know we didn't end evolution
through some clinging motion to say you
know it has to include us
hopefully it'll find some way to include
us it will it be augmented intelligence
or artificial intelligence that we
create
I think that's profound debate here's
one more maybe that'll be the last
question if okay so you mean you had one
side about managing disruptive
innovation and you kind of mentioned the
challenges of getting two or three you
know you the teams of two or three
people are very efficient larger teams
art right what do you think about the
challenges of innovation in like social
technology to allow us to get more
brains working on the same problem in
parallel I feel like there's a lot of
opportunity there that's kind of outside
this whole branch of physical technology
do you what are your thoughts on that I
think it's a great question um because
clearly historically in meatspace you
know it's physically getting together
for meetings that was the metaphor not
virtually and to do so on a lightweight
periodic basis so let me first say a
little bit more about the group size and
then see if I thought occurs to me is I
don't have a quick answer other than
yeah that sounds exciting and and I'd
love to hear what your thoughts are on
it because as a backup venture
capitalists almost never come up with an
innovation or an idea or the solution to
a problem but what they try to do is
recognize big problems and like when
some smart person does to glom onto it
say that does sound like it could work
you know it's a super mind goes I don't
know the answer to almost any useful
question other than the share enthusiasm
so the the actuality three groups of
three to seven so
boards of directors as my experience for
more than seven they're horrible I do
believe there's some attempt to try to
keep programming group size down low
here I two weeks ago had a whole weekend
with Bill Gates which is fascinating
these just sort of off the record on all
subjects unbelievable but when things he
did share which I knew no surprise is
that he thought Microsoft has never been
as productive or as fun as when was five
people and he thinks they're just
complete train wreck right now
um no surprise so at least he's honest
now he's not in the corporate you know
they only can he can speak openly um and
you get this dramatic you end up
inevitably putting in policies that you
know sort of migrate to the mean you
don't have outlying experiments running
on and in it gets difficult some
organizations by the way to keep doing
that so like gore a manufacturing
company actually physically moves
manufacturing plants when they get over
a hundred fifty people and think how
expensive that is for manufacturing
company but the logic is no one knows
the name of their co-workers beyond 100
that's where startups usually hit a
major growth curve I mean a growth um
hiccup is sort of owing that when you
don't know the members of your tribe in
the same way your management style has
to change and then it gets very
unpleasant it's a transition so so we're
back to how can social software help
with this you know I'm a big believer
that we have really barely scratched the
surface of how to exploit the hive like
mind in an organization right for for a
group of people to be more productive
than the sum of its members there has to
be something going on at that higher
level abstraction that allows that and
so the questions I would ask is what
should be the frequency of interactions
what it should be the fan-out
should it be bi-directional information
flows or not if you think about a
cortical analogy the fan-out has a
dramatic impact on learning phases and
you may want to prune you might want to
have like the brain does you know 100
synapses per neuron dropping you know
tenfold and the ages of two and a half
it's actually sorry sorry 10,000
synapses per neuron dropping to 10 to
1000 between the ages of 2 and 3 just
kind of interesting you know you lose
90% of your sentence um those kinds of
parameters could have a huge impact on
it and I generally think it's the best
answer could be to run experiments cuz
when you get forgetting whenever you get
into the Social Sciences I think you can
run experiments
in organizational form much more quickly
than you can formulate the theory for
you know for why they work yeah great

time for a talk here at Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
