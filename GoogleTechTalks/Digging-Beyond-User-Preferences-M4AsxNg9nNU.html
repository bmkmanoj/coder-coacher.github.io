and our special speaker today is Indy
young and I'll read her bio real quick
in these works spans a number of decades
from the mid 80s when the desktop
metaphor was replacing command line and
menu based systems to the mid 90s with
the web first toddled onto the scene to
now when designers are intent on
crafting good experiences after ten
years of consulting Indy helped found
adopted path the six other partners all
hoping to spread good design around the
world making things easier for people
everywhere in these mental models have
developed have helped both startups and
large corporations discover and support
customer behaviors they didn't think to
explore it first she has recently
written a book about the mental model of
method mental models aligning design
strategy with human behavior published
by rosenfield media so title for
presentation is Diggy be on user
preferences and afterwards she'll be
joining us for lunch to stick around if
you want to discussion or have lunch
yeah so thank you and welcome okay am I
on ah there I am yeah digging digging is
something I think totally might might
respect I like to garden a lot this dog
might want to help me out a little I
don't know anyway um thanks you guys for
having me here and I wanted to talk a
little bit about mental models but I'm
not really going to get into them until
about halfway through the presentation
I'm going to start with lots of
gratuitous pictures of garden since I
love them um pretty roses I just went to
London and this is from a garden called
sissinghurst does anybody know London
gardens nope anyway I want to talk about
two things today basically the first one
is expanding your perspective and the
second thing that I want to talk about
is kind of letting go of the typical
marketing research that you tend to get
now I don't know specifically what kind
of marketing research you get but I do
know what a lot of my clients end up
having to deal with and face it
statements like this eleven percent of
moviegoers go to movies alone
I'm really kind of hard to translate
into software decisions they're really
kind of hard to translate into anything
workable anything you can actually sink
your teeth into so what I bring to you
today is something a little bit more in
depth this is my friend katie kelly and
i asked her why do you go to movies
alone and she told me is because she
likes to give the director her attention
her complete attention because when she
was in college she actually wrote a play
and apparently half the people in the
audience weren't paying attention during
the execution of the play and they
didn't get the point she was really
disappointed this was something that
rankled her for a long time but if I had
just asked her you know do you like
going to movies alone and she said yeah
I like going to movies alone that's not
really going to get at the underlying
reasons why why she's got this behavior
so that's what I want to talk about to
kind of demonstrate the the truth of
talking to people I want to step outside
of the software domain for a little bit
and talk about Frank Gehry he's an
architect you guys have anybody been
down to the disney concert hall in la
yet when what do you think absolutely
stunning ask you why in a second well
actually tell me why did in like a word
little bang all the room
okay design rules well kerfeld hear it
Oh interesting place where you can see
things that you can hear it things like
that Oh in the pipe organ anyway um
Frank is obviously marked he is not a
conductor he's not a musician well I
don't know maybe he is a bit of a
musician I don't know him personally but
what he does at the start of this
particular project when he was asked to
do this was talked two conductors and
talk to them about music and talk them
about the sound that they want to hear
in the sound that they want to generate
they had this vision this creative
vision for how they're going to produce
a particular symphony and they say
sometimes it has to be like candlelight
really soft makes you you know sort of
takes your breath away and sometimes it
has to be boisterous and energetic and
get your heart beating and and all of
that and it just it needs to be able to
slide between these different ways of
experiencing music very easily and so he
says once he had all of that once he had
talked to everybody he could free
associate but he thought of himself as
being programmed like a computer he
couldn't go wrong because he knew the
language really well of music he got
into their role and he got to understand
what it's like to be a conductor and
that's exactly what i like to do with
software because i'm usually not the
person intended to use the software this
here is pat smith made up name right
she's an entrepreneur there's a lot of
these people out here really really
energetic and they have this great idea
this is borrowed from it sorry meant and
they want to sell it to everybody my
audiences everyone everyone is going to
use this thing that I call an online
money tracker but once they get it out
there they're really disappointed
because half these people get scared and
walk away and the other people get
confused and kind of
ada way and what happens is they're left
with a lot less of an audience or a
market than they expected they get
confused and they start doing this
little design spiral well when we do
wrong how do we fix it how do we make
sure that this is working for people and
they start trying to solve problems that
maybe weren't there are problems in the
very beginning maybe in the very
beginning what they should have done was
kind of studied these different segments
of people and understand them a little
more deeply for example maybe the green
folks they they're really interested
about figuring out how to save for a
house and making sacrifices and how do I
actually do that and still get to go see
the movies with my friends you know how
does this all work there the yellow
people there may be just so overwhelmed
they don't have time and also look at
finances and they're just like okay
whatever that will fix itself I don't
even want to look the red people maybe
they realize they don't have an
expertise oh they feel uneducated about
financial systems and they just want
somebody to help them it's completely
different mindset than those people in
green and then in blue this is really
what Pat Smith's audience is these the
people who figure that their kind on the
right path they kind of get it and they
kind of want to see how they're doing
compared to other people like them so
there's different philosophies running
around here and if you actually you know
focus in on one or two of these we could
look at representing their beliefs and
their philosophies in a model sort of a
way and look at the similarities you can
see between say green and blue a little
bit of blues model shows up in greens
model does that mean that we can
understand a little bit of green if we
just study blue first off the bat a
little bit of greens shows up in red and
does that mean we're going to understand
a little bit of that audience or does
this mean that we can get an
understanding of whether we need to make
a different application
say like a person doing financial
counseling or a completely different
product for these kinds of people as
opposed to the thing that I originally
had in mind as an entrepreneur when I
was starting out so this is just giving
you clarity of vision it's like yeah I'm
gonna study these kinds of people the
blues and the Greens they're the people
that I'm most after based on my original
idea and I'm going to acknowledge that
maybe it's a different product or even
not even a software product at all that
will address the needs of these other
people so designing software a lot of
the time out in the startup world is a
bit like playing pin the tail on the
donkey how many people did not ever play
pin the tail on the donkey as a kid okay
there was one thanks to you still know
what the game is though no okay we'll go
through the game you put a blindfold on
somebody and you spin them around so
they're all dizzy and then you kind of
shove them off in a direction sometimes
if you're really evil in the opposite
direction of where the donkey is pasted
up on the wall and in their hand they
have this little tail with a pin in it
and they have to figure their way to the
donkey and push the tail into where they
think the tail belongs on the donkey
while they're blindfolded and this is
what happens so the reason why I'm
saying the pin the tail on the donkey
example is that a lot of entrepreneurs
will just sort of start painting stuff
up there and and just hope that it works
and then enter our design in our test
loop our cycle and just cycle around
like say one of those tails well how do
we get it closer to the right place how
do we get it closer to what we want it
to do and gosh it's going to be a lot of
effort just to move a couple of inches
in the right direction a lot of wasted
resources doing that what if we could
pin that tail on the donkey a little bit
closer to the right end right from the
start this I borrowed from Jeff veen he
used to be here he's to be my partner
did opt a path actually and i love this
graph because it talks about a word talk
that isn't necessarily something that
you recognized as a part of the software
development methodology right talking is
this you know chatting we're talking
let's go through ideas let's talk
amongst ourselves let's talk with our
end users let's talk with our business
folks who need to get something out of
this specific and in the very beginning
let's say along the bottom of this
you've got the beginning of a product
all the way through the project to
launch and the beginning the cost of
talking is really cheap but as and the
cost of changing your mind is really
cheap but as you go towards launch if
you talk a little bit about something
you discover something halfway through
it's like oh I wanted to change that
women we had the wrong idea at first
it's going to cost you a lot more to go
back and change that code base is going
to cost you a lot more to go back and
you know maybe redesign what you're
doing so this is a good demonstration of
why it makes sense to talk to folks up
front before the design gets too far you
probably all know that this is a chart
that I like to show because it helps
people understand the differences in the
kinds of research we do and this is
probably stuff you already know but
there's basically three kinds of
research we've got preference research a
value to research and generative
research it sounds like there's a
thunderstorm approaching preference
research is really stuff you see a lot
in the media so they'll say you know
what do you like you'll get like votes
and things like that so many people
online poll voted for this kind of a
thing to happen or whatever and you'll
see it a lot in businesses the most
useful place for it is for focus group
testing is for you know branding and
figuring out based on an artifact is
this going in the right direction are we
getting
the right kind of idea here and so we're
asking people their opinion of this idea
do you like it do you not like it that's
basically all this evaluative again
works with an artifact it evaluates how
well that artifact is fulfilling its
promise how well is it supporting that
person trying to get something done and
generative research is all about helping
you think up new ideas it's about
understanding the kind of the bigger
picture and where are the places but you
know let's figure out how big the
sandbox is before we start playing in it
and what are the toys that we can play
within it and that is where you're going
to get more information when you do this
kind of research that will support
things for interaction design or
understanding where you want to take a
product or not take a product actually
just finished working with a company
down in San Diego where we decided based
on the generative research we did that
we didn't want to make the product it
was it wouldn't solve the bigger problem
that people were facing the bigger
problem that people are facing was a
completely different thing and we could
see that after we did the research but
before the research we were we were told
by upper management that we will make a
product to do X because all our
competitors have a product that does X
and anyway so we're in the process of
convincing them but we really don't want
to spend our money waste our money doing
that so I want to talk a little bit
about this idea of segmentation the
green people the red people blue people
yellow people how is it that I go about
doing this and how is it different than
personas do you guys use personas here
raise your hand if you use personas
we've got a few some people shaking yeah
yeah yeah there's there's all this gray
fog around personas right now personas
tend to be used for a value to research
I want to use them for generative
research but to use them for generative
research we've got to make them more
kind of take them back to a little more
I don't know pure might not be the right
word but a little bit more of their
roots yes question already
hey traditional user experience or at
least uh so I style is that you do
generative research to come up with
personas in the first place right which
you can then use to evaluate stuff on
the right yes that's the right way to do
it you can't build a persona unless you
actually go out and talk with people and
sit with them and stuff is on a bit when
you say it's like I want to use them for
Jenna research like don't you need to do
it in the first place to do it yeah
chicken and the egg yeah exactly you've
got it and um well let you hang on to
that ll Tina deal with that guy um
essentially yes you want to use
generative research create your personas
but you have to start somewhere by
recruiting some people to talk to to
find out and so you make a hypothesis
and so what I'm going to talk about our
hypotheses the whole people are using
personas for evaluative research is once
they've got them they tend not to they
tend not to you not to create them
correctly I'm going to show you some
examples of that and they tend not to
use them in his broadway's I want to see
them used simply so an audience segment
is the way I refer to a persona if you
added a name and a photo than you get a
persona and here's an example of one
from one of my clients Wanda wellness
and you can read a little bit about her
she's a she's like what three out of
five compute happy faces for computer
savvy web savvy she's four out of five
happy faces she her info seeker of
styles action-oriented with purposeful
strikes and on and on she's a female
she's married she went to college and
she's a teacher and what I want to talk
about is that does this information the
big question is does this information
affect her behavior her beliefs her
reactions within the scope of what
you're studying so if for example this
person we're studying choices people
make around health care
is her computer savviness or web
savviness really going to dictate her
behavior as to how she decides on a
doctor or how she decides to have a
procedure or not to have a procedure no
doesn't affect it likewise most of the
rest of the demographic stuff doesn't
affect it you need to layer that stuff
on just to make a persona interesting
the other thing that you'll see is long
descriptions of these people where only
the stuff highlighted is the stuff that
really affects the way that someone
makes their decisions it is the only
it's only the stuff that we that
reflects their reactions it reflects
kind of their underlying philosophies
and in this particular one we had this
little table here we're talking about
user characteristics and design
possibilities and all of these are
fabulous if you look at that right-hand
column with design possibilities every
one of those things sounds really
interesting and I don't think I wouldn't
do any of those things for anybody else
there's not a segment out there that I
wouldn't want to say make it easy to
find something specific I wouldn't want
to make it hard for a particular person
so anyway a lot of that stuff that's
wrapped up in poorly designed personas
can be unwrapped and can be taken back
to its behavioral kind of like the
underlying why you doing this and let's
just focus on what's going to affect how
you navigate the space that I'm
exploring so for example the health care
choices and one thing that I do when I
start off so I start off with a
hypothesis it was a perfect timing for
your question start off with a
hypothesis so that I can figure out who
to talk to then I go and talk to them
and then I change my hypotheses and you
will see that in a minute but when I
start off I want to make sure that I'm
not looking at it from a demographic
point of view most companies that I go
and consult for are looking at it from a
demographic point of view
they have tons of data on their people I
worked for one client that had 40
different variables that they tracked
about every single person that they were
interested in and they're like how do we
deal with 42 different variables how do
we how could we study all that I mean
the permutations there alone would take
us five years to go and talk to each of
these people so what I do is I try to
pull people back from the demographics
from the web savviness and talk to them
about well what are the behaviors so for
example i did a moviegoer mental model I
did this too so I'd have an example to
show that I could really talk about so
my clients wouldn't go no you can't talk
about my stuff and I wanted to explore
kind of who these audience segments were
and among talking to people who go to
movies a lot there was a personality
type or behavior type but once they saw
the movie that got really excited about
it and they wanted to tell their friends
and they need the right email or they'd
write a review or or they chat with
their friends during lunch or whatever
you've got to go see the movie really
it's because such and such did this and
don't forget to see the little reference
to that other movie that we saw together
in the middle and they'll talk about all
the scenes and they'll talk about the
craft of the movie and things when do
anybody in the audience do you guys do
this one person does yes good so we've
got we've got a little demographic here
right are you under 30 or over 30 it
refuses to say okay we'll say under 30
um and so you start thinking about it
okay yeah all these people are like
under 30 and they're kind of like me and
and they have these behaviors that you
know along with it come certain
philosophies and maybe certain genres
that I look at in terms of movies and
things like that I'm in my little
example I said 17 year old guy there's
also the 70 year old there are film
critics who work for large newspapers
females in their 70s who are writing
film reviews who belong to this
group same behavior they've got the same
philosophy I need to tell these people
to see this movie or to avoid this movie
and not waste your time on it um so when
i created my hypotheses this is what I
wanted what I came up with I came up
with something called a social
moviegoers someone who loves to go to
movies because of the company that
they're going with because of the
talking before or after or during the
movie I came up with another group that
is what i call them a movie buff they
like to they'll do anything to get to
the movie them like a sacrifice will
stand in line to get tickets they'll
make sure that they have really good
seats this they're just really excited
to get into the movie and make the
experience the best thing that they can
get and then he made up something called
a big fan and that's a person who gets
the models and the action figures
afterwards and maybe the DVD if they're
a little older I have a cousin who's my
age and he buys all the action figures
so I can't say demographic sir but
anyway this is sort of the person who
makes that movie going experience extend
into their own lives there's the film
purest kind of like my friend Katie who
just wants the pure experience of the
film I want to understand what the
director wanted me to feel and I want to
feel that and the make-believe artist
thinking about your niece who likes to
sort of suspend disbelief and pretend
she's a hanna-barbera character all day
long or dress up like a princess and a
facilitator this is someone who's maybe
going to the movies to take their niece
or to take their elderly mother or maybe
somebody taking somebody on a date it's
not like they're going to see the movie
they're going because of this other
person so does anybody sort of see where
they fit in this I see a few nodding
heads raise your hand if you don't see a
place that you fit I've got a few when I
see ya we belong to multiple categories
see when I shop this around I was
getting a lot of confusion before like
wait I I'm here and I'm here and I'm
kind of like you know sort of halfway
and maybe a little bit of something you
didn't even explain so I'm like ah my
little hypotheses that I came up with
based on talking to a bunch of
moviegoers are wrong I'm going to fix
them for my hypothesis and then I'm
going to go out and talk to people so
what I did was I started thinking about
all the things that i had heard they
fell into three categories story people
were interested in a story or not and
you know just passing interest to like
really really excited and wanted to make
that story a part of their life the
craft they were either not aware that
these are actors on the screen at all or
they were hyper aware and just like
critiqued everything and new one act
when finished and act 2 was beginning
and all of that sort of thing or
somewhere in between and companionship
that was the other thing people would
always talked about is like well I'm I'm
interacting with people around me about
this movie or I'm not interacting with
these people or I'm just facilitating I
change it to enabler here banging on the
pipes anyway so when I looked at all of
this I'm like well wait a minute now
I've got 60 permutations 60 different
ways of combining this so I talked to my
my faux client and they're all like well
we're only interested in people who go
to movies socially so I don't want to
look at or study the people who go alone
necessarily or other people who are in
the neighbors I was just their business
decision I asked them why and they said
it was because they get more money when
the people who are going socially in one
respect or another and then in terms of
the craft they wanted to explore people
who are both in appreciation or
officiant auto mode so appreciation is
kind of a low efficient auto mode
they're both aware of you know like
there's choreography going on and yes
okay beautiful choreography so that was
kind of
and they also wanted to talk to people
who enjoyed the story or we're totally
excited about the story so it's kind of
like these four groups came out of it we
have the enjoyment appreciation social
we have the excitement appreciation
social then we have the enjoyment
aficionado social and the excitement
aficionado social and those were the
four groups that I went out and talked
to and then did some modeling on so I
want to talk a little bit about talking
to people I tend to do non directed
interviews and one of the things that
I'm becoming more and more aware of is a
lot of the traditional marketing that
goes on Hannah's like do you want to
think he's got it pass it back on
talking and a lot of traditional
marketing that goes on tends to be
observational they tend to like stand
here and watch people do things and not
interfere or maybe film them and and
then you know ask there are other
experts well what's going on here what I
tend to do is really touch that person I
do interfere with that person I want to
get under the skin and understand why
they're doing these things and what's
motivating them and half the time like
I'll get somebody up at the front of the
room and start interviewing them about
movies and they'll go off in this you
know philosophical direction about why
they see certain movies and how they do
it but they hadn't ever enunciated to
anyone before so it's kind of like a
psychoanalytical exploration you had a
question I can also do later because
it's dealing with the previous lights oh
ok ok all right sure enough ok so
talking to people one of the things that
I get a question about a lot is well
isn't face-to-face being in their world
better than talking to somebody on the
telephone and the answer is yes of
course it's better to be in their world
but reality rears its ugly head you've
got to do this in one week and you need
to talk to people across the nation or
across the globe
how are you going to do that you can't
really certainly not not in a
cost-effective way a way that's going to
give you enough time to sleep at night
so what I do is I'll do face to face in
certain circumstances Oh certainly when
people are close to me proximity wise
but I'll also do it when they haven't
invented or created their own little
artifacts that they use to help them get
something done so when I'm talking to
them and recruiting them I'll try to
find out whether they have some sort of
a unique method or a unique tool that
they've created and I'll then want to go
and be in front of them if they haven't
and it's all stuff that is very
explainable about their head process
they're the way that the mental
processes they go through then I'll talk
to them on the phone so that's um that's
how I do that the interview itself after
years of doing these sort of things I
came up with some guidelines some rules
that help people conduct interviews and
it's not at all like listening to Terry
Gross on NPR it's not at all like
listening to somebody's doing talk show
hosting where they have an agenda their
agenda is to entertain their audience
and so the person that they're
interviewing they're going to guide that
conversation into areas that's going to
be entertaining and it's going to be you
know reveal something new that's never
been said before or something shocking
or controversial or something like that
in our case we want to do the opposite
we kind of want to let that person do
all of the talking and guide where the
conversation goes so that we can see
where the way that they think the
pattern in which they think I don't want
to apply any of my own mental structures
to what they are going to tell me and
this is a skill this is a listening
skill kevin Brooks is another author for
Rosenfeld media he's a storyteller at
Motorola you teaches people how to
listen and one of the things that he
says is most people when having a
conversation with somebody are thinking
about what they
want to say and when they can interject
it into the conversation more so than
they are actually listening to what the
other person is saying so what you want
to do is listen first one is you want to
talk about follow up on behaviors and
beliefs but don't necessarily follow up
on preferences oh I love this oh I hate
it when I have to blah blah blah well
it's you want to find out why why is it
you hate it and what's the next step
what are you doing next but don't
necessarily just go and collect
preferences I've worked with some people
who have done this for the first time
it's too much like in marketing they'll
apply all that and I'll just get a whole
bunch of preferences and then reviews
ruined you can't use that data because
there's nothing no meat underneath it
open questions only who what when where
and why those things that you learned in
your journalism class don't start it
with well did you blah blah blah blah
blah and there's there's a couple of
great ways of getting around that like
can you tell me more about that or could
you explain that rather than trying to
prompt them to say something the thing
is is the people will tend to agree and
adopt or whatever word that you're going
to say which is the next one no words of
your own the they'll be constantly
matching their model to your model and
saying oh well she understands it that
way i'm going to use her word and so
that she'll get what i'm trying to say a
little bit better try this next time
you're talking to somebody like you're
buying a sandwich somewhere or something
it's sometimes it's not something more
complex even and you'll see that you
you're constantly adapting to the other
person the other person is constantly
adapting to you so what I try to do is
not insert any new vocabulary words
until they've been said of course
there's an exception to this if you're
talking to rocket scientists you have to
insert some vocabulary so they know what
level to talk to you at follow the
conversation so we've all been to a
dinner party see to that somebody that
next to somebody we don't know like
maybe a wedding you went to a couple
months ago or something it's like well
you don't have a set of questions that
you ask of that person written on your
napkin on you
instead you just sort of have a
conversation with them find out what
they're interested in and you know
follow up on it may be that person
raises chickens and you love raising
chickens too and so you can talk all
about that you find the unique things in
the ways that you match and and you let
it go with that there is no set of
questions when I go into an interview
actually don't have any questions to ask
a so I don't try to insert words would
be so that I listen to the conversation
I am NOT and I'm not like enunciated a
survey out loud it's not about the tools
so a lot of us are used to doing
research that has to do with fixing a
tool that exists and so will focus on
the tools what we want to do with
generative research is kind of broaden
our horizon and find out being sort of
the shape of the whole world that that
person is working in and so we don't
focus in on tools we kind of go high
level they are we don't get into the
details of like when you're checking out
at the grocery store do you swipe your
card first and then smile at the checker
do you smile the checker and then swipe
your card it doesn't really matter that
level of granularity and then of course
immediate experience is always nice to
be able to talk to somebody who's done
this recently so they're not trying to
remember something drag it up out of
their memory um there's something that i
use i call the hallway test that helps
me understand or keep focused on the
level of granularity that i want and
that is what is the person thinking when
they're walking down the hallway to go
do something so for example a person
might be walking down the hallway
thinking oh gosh I've got to tell me
friend I can't go see the movies with
her tonight because I've got to finish
this report so she's thinking that right
I've got to communicate with my friend
that I can't go to the movies she's also
feeling a lot of emotion about this
deadline and maybe guilt or maybe being
upset that she has to stay late to
finish this report and not go play but
she's not thinking oh I need to you know
send an email and open up
and get her name out of the address book
or anything not that level higher level
the stuff that she was thinking about
when she was walking down the hallway
there are other ways of getting data
besides interviews that I want to talk
about it interviews just happen to be
the way that I get it most efficiently
and most cost effectively but you can
also go through like customer service
data or phone calls and emails that you
get in you can go through survey data
that marketing has done you can try to
pull things out of like Diaries people
have written you might be able to get
any sort of thing that has like an essay
quality to it is a better source than
just like a survey because people are
just checking boxes that are kind of
close to what they mean now when I
checked in to get this little badge the
very first thing that it asked me was
whether I was here for a meeting or as a
social visit or for a class or something
like that i'm like well none oh no you
have to click a box i'll click throw on
those closest this is like a meeting
right anyway so there's other sources of
data that you can mine this stuff from
it may not be as in depth and as rich as
somebody's words but you can use them so
let's talk about how we go through that
data this is a very full blown analysis
that I did this is from the movie goer
mental model and I actually recorded all
of these calls and then transcribed them
have them transcribed isn't necessary to
do this but it's a lot of fun because
when you get further down the line and
you have a model and you're presenting
it to somebody in there like well why is
that there you can actually trace it all
the way back to the actual words being
spoken see so that's really nice to be
able to answer those kinds of wool with
the questions when you're looking at the
model by going back to the conversation
don't have to do this though essentially
everything I've circled here are things
that I'm pulling out these are little
behaviors that I've noticed our little
philosophies or beliefs that people have
talked about or sort
you know emotional reactions they've had
to something I'm capturing all these
things and what I'm doing here's a is
looking the problem is is that in spoken
conversation we're not very direct we
imply a lot of things so especially like
when you're talking about an emotional
reaction to something nobody ever wants
to admit they're having an emotional
reaction especially when you're talking
around a sort of a business scope and so
it's implied or it said in different
words it's sort of couch you're reading
between the lines and you're
interpreting a lot this is very
interpretive and sometimes they talk
about third party people other people
doing this sort of thing you can capture
that data to if that's person as a
member of that same segment that you're
studying but that's what you're looking
for when you're pulling those little red
things out and what I do is I actually
grab some of the quotes here so that as
I trace back it's a little easier to go
and find these things this is just the
idea of the particular participant that
was talking and I label them I make all
sorts of labels for each one of these
little tidbits that I pull out you know
buy tickets in advance to ensure that I
get in choose later screening to get
good seats just sore little labels that
explain things all of my label starts
with verbs I think that verbs are really
powerful they're a great way of getting
you into that end-users mindset and her
first person verbs not verbs like with
eeing buying tickets that kind of puts a
barrier between you and the actual by
and then what I do is I I take those
labels well I take this table and I
label it and I take each one of the
labels of those tables and group them
together right right now I've just sort
of gotten them into a an empty parking
lot but what I'm doing is it building up
a little three layer hierarchy and I'll
show you what I'm doing in the end with
a picture but for example a little group
here might seem to have something in
common so I start putting them together
this group has
thing in common that I can actually
label watch a film alone I start
building things from the bottom from
those little tables of quotes and it can
be quotes from all of your participants
or all the participants in the blue
group and here's all the participants in
the green group so you can group them up
that way and just start labeling them
this is what it looks like in an Excel
spreadsheet I have the little quotes
here I've got the ID of the participant
the label and then the three levels of
hierarchy as I'm building it up and
again the verbs are very prevalent so I
think they're powerful you can do this
with sticky notes this is from a
workshop that I teach sometimes sticky
notes make things more because of its
it's tactile it's more immediate and
sometimes goes a little faster too if
you're trying to make this go you know
it all take place within the course of a
week this is a set of boards that my
friend Mary pinkowski put together so
that she could actually carry them in
and out of the conference room so that
her sticky notes could be preserved and
she's starting to group them into into
layers there so this is the visual of
what I come up with and it's got three
layers to it let's look at the top part
those little white boxes are those
tables that contain the beliefs that
contain the behaviors that contain the
emotions they're labeled with the little
you can't see it but they're labeled
with the little verbs that are organized
into affinity groups which some people
call towers because they look like
little towers and then those are
organized into bigger groups which are
called mental spaces they're like
different head spaces if you were
working on a project and you kind of
came to a brick wall you were tired of
it you go check your email that's a
different headspace than it was when you
were working on the project itself and
so that's all that is below the line is
the where it gets interesting what I
start doing is applying all the ways
that our current solutions support the
things that are going on in this tower
so in the area that's circled right now
you see a lot of support for that one
tower which is in the choose
time moviegoer mental space and the
purple things are really strong supports
these things really help somebody choose
a time but the white things are sort of
it might also help support something
here and so once you know that you can
look across the rest of the bottom of
the model and see where there's not very
much purple or no boxes at all does this
mean this is an opportunity for us to do
a better job or does this mean that like
my client in San Diego oh we don't
really want to get into that business at
all let's let's just not sort of those
bother to support that because it's
somebody else's job here's an example a
lot of these models come up with a
little mental space about managing my
time because a lot of us have a hard
time getting all the stuff we need to do
into one week and yet most businesses
who are studying this don't want to get
into the area of helping someone manage
their time that's for time tracking
companies to do so there are a lot of
definitions for the word mental model
out there one of them is it's a mental
representation of how something works
there's another definition the model a
person makes about the workflow of a
software solution and I think that that
could be extended to the model a person
makes to any sort of a thing not just
software based cognitive scientists have
this definition it's a conceptual
representation used to help a person
understand and interact with a certain
part of the world and so what our models
are is all of this they're not
interacting with just one particular
product or one particular software
application but the world the
environment in which they're trying to
accomplish something so I'm calling it
kind of the underlying reasons to drive
people's behavior and then the bottom
part of the model is showing you all the
ways that you as an organization can
support these people do
these things so let's get back to the
hypothesis we had hypothesized these
audience segments now that we've gone
through and talk to them and analyze
what they were saying we have a much
better idea how close we were when we
started out and how we need to maybe
adjust them I've got a couple of
examples this is for sybase I sell
enterprise solutions for keeping track
of few dreams of data and accessing it
from all over the place and in the
beginning we thought well hey we've got
one group that doesn't own our product
we've got one group that owns our
product but wants more we've got another
group that owns our product and needs
help with it and we've got another group
that we decided where the thought
leaders these are the people that sybase
was particularly interested in talking
to because they might be the new market
or they might be the canary in the
coalmine that helps the rest of the
organization buy into the sybase
products but after talking to all these
people none of this was true what we
found was that there were basically
three roles in the world of enterprise
data management one is the evaluator the
person who's figuring out what kind of
solution might work another one's the
implementer that's the person who's like
okay you made a decision I'm just going
to make it work and get it installed and
then there's the maintainer who's making
at work over the lifetime care and
feeding patches updates all of that sort
of thing and most often each person that
we talked to war two of these hats
either the evaluator implementer or the
implementer maintainer so it's
interesting that came out with these
kinds of models this is for a online
dating site called engage and we've
started out with some hypotheses about
people who are dating and people who
were helping their friends find dates so
our first one was the Social Connector
the next one was somebody who's kind of
a will participate if asked then we had
someone who was self-conscious
you can sort of imagine that we had the
Good Samaritan this one was new to me
but everybody at that company insisted
there these people existed and there was
somebody who is called expand the
possibilities this was just somebody
trying to make put more fish into the
pond any kind of fish I have better
chances and what we ended up with after
all of our analysis was something very
different the the first one and the Good
Samaritan sort of combined to be the get
on the load training people these are
the people who believe love is
everywhere everybody deserves love and
you know it's going to happen for you it
will participate a vast sort of what
remained the same but we renamed it to
the words that those people use which is
I'm gonna see what happens so it was
kind of like I'm not really reaching out
but I'll play along and see what happens
I'm the self-conscious they they divided
it out into two different groups there
were the people who were trying too hard
and there were the people who really
thought it through there were people who
were very careful about every single
step and every single decision that they
made dating process so that was what we
ended up with is a big change from what
we started with I want to talk a little
bit about the models so here's a little
mental model models can represent
multiple segments if there's enough
overlap in here we've got a lot of
overlap between Wanda and the blue guy
or if there's not much overlap you might
want to separate them into separate
models so that you can keep your ideas
around those models separate you may
also end up with completely separate
applications for them remember the
yellow group in the very beginning and
we're thinking well maybe they needed
some financial counselors some like
human in the loop to sort of help them
through this so that might mean a
completely different solution other than
what you're offering right now so the
last thing I want to talk about there's
no clock in this room how sad
oh yeah like I can see that good um last
thing I want to talk about is figuring
out how to read like the comparison
between the top and the bottom of these
models so there's pretty easy you can
look for blank spaces to fill you can
look for scarce or weak support a lot of
white boxes or like maybe one or two
boxes but it's just not supporting
everything that's in the tower above it
the thing of note about the towers too
is that they may not contain everything
all of the boxes those towers above the
line you might two years later decide to
add a couple of boxes or sort of
mentally extend it because you just
didn't talk to 64 people you only talked
to 24 people you didn't get absolutely
everything being there but you've got
all of those towers you could redefine
an augment something that already exists
you could look for surprises every
mental model has some sort of a surprise
usually it's kind of a I knew that but
now my face is being pushed into it kind
of a surprise it's kind of a low-grade
surprise but I'm going to show you a
bigger surprise later the combined
related behaviors and features talks
about looking at different parts
different mental spaces different parts
of the model and seeing if there's
synergies between the two is there any
way that we can marry these things
together or support people doing two or
three of these things at once this next
one look for emotions is really
important oftentimes when we're in a
business organization we think emotions
have been left behind yet they're a big
indicator of when something isn't
working super well usually because you
usually get negative emotions and then
look at mental spaces that you might
have crossed out in your mind for
example with the movie goers we kind of
crossed out the whole mental space of
going into the theater and watching the
movie because we thought well they're
not going to be able to interact with
our website during the movie right but
there were a couple of things in that
mental space that we thought wait a
minute there was one that was compared
the book to the movie to see how well
the traffic to movie translation went
and the other one was looked for like
little easter eggs look for references
to other movie
Little Joe in jokes and things and some
thought of ways of telling people these
things ahead of time so that when they
got into the theater they knew what they
were looking for and we kind of enhanced
their experience in that mental space
and this last one rethink features that
don't match something above the line
this could be the next killer app this
could be something that you've got an
idea for that nobody is thinking of
right now it's just not in their way of
accomplishing something but most usually
it's when somebody wants the stock
ticker on the homepage and nobody's
going to the homepage to look for stock
numbers of stock information so let's
talk a little bit about surprises this
is the online dating site engage and
during their model during the research
we found pretty much the reasons why
online dating doesn't work really well
and one of the first indicators was in
an early mental space it's called find
out how to handle an attraction this is
the very beginning where you're either
suddenly aware that somebody's may be
interested in you or you're feeling
interested in somebody and you have to
decide whether you're going to act on it
or react to it or what and what we were
finding were a lot of words in here that
meant that people were physically
present with one another they were
co-located which is impossible to
represent online so this body language
subtle body language appear
disinterested how do you appear
disinterested online kind of hard to do
there's another mentals place called get
a better sense of a person which
included all the yak yak yak e now
you're on the phone with this person
finding out where they went to college
and all this sort of stuff but it also
included a couple of towers that were a
little different than that this is
representing somebody's sort of standing
on the sidelines for a little bit like I
want to find out more about you without
letting you know that I'm interested so
I'm going to see how you interact
socially with your friends I'm going to
see what your friends have to say about
you and your past interactions and
things like that I kind of want to get
an idea the we interviewed sixty percent
female and so we got a lot of emphasis
on maturity is this person mature in our
data so i think these towers were
representing that and that's really hard
to do online and then this last one was
a mental space called go out with the
person for the first time this
particular tower was from people who
were online dating we talked to both
online and I'm non online and this was
all of that emotion that you feel when
you see the person for the first time
you've already gotten to know them
through email or talking on the phone
and all of a sudden you're in the room
with them and they're shocked this one
is all a looked all nice and in your
photo and you've got like you know an
afro and tattoos this is not what I
expected so that's a problem so these
were the three problems that we found
with online dating and we were going we
set off to try to solve them the first
one was the idea of getting people
co-located for that figure out how to
handle an attraction thing so you could
maybe post aware about so I'm going to
be at borders tonight in the
architecture I'll between eight and ten
swing on by and so you can see anything
that you like maybe you see somebody you
like who wasn't online and you know
strike up a conversation that's that's
fine you know that's the get on the Love
Train kind of approach anyway so that
was that was the idea is to get people
physically co-located another one was
this observer on the sidelines thing
let's enable them when you actually when
you main account on engage you had to
have your friends join as well at least
one friend so that the friends could
write about you and write about social
interactions that you've done and more
so you could actually contact those
friends without letting the person who
owns the account know so you can
actually talk to these people kind of
behind her back and say well you know
she says she's a social drinker but is
that really true
that kind of thing so those were some of
the ideas that we had around that and
that was all just looking at these gaps
in here and the ways that we were and
were not supporting people trying to get
stuff done in those towers and stand on
the observer on the sidelines observer
towers and stuff as we were going
through what we did was we kind of
labeled these ideas because we couldn't
do all of them at once you probably have
a way of doing this yourselves here and
we assign priorities in terms of
feasibility and importance to the
business importance to the user all that
sort of stuff and graft it so that we
could see well where are we going to
focus first what do we do next kind of
get our hands around the whole enormity
of all these things that we've suggested
the reason that I put this up here is
because a lot of my clients um feel very
overwhelmed there are way too many
things to get done and if you come in
here with a model that's just going to
give you more things to get done so I
don't want a model at all which means
you're going to lose out on being able
to talk to all these people and hear
their stories so I really want people to
listen to stories and so the question
the stuff is intuitive isn't it I want
to show you stamen design you got how
many people are familiar with stamen
designs are up in the city San Francisco
a couple people they take mashups google
maps with big databases this one in
particular is a database of
transportation times in london i think
on the tube and on bus and real estate
costs so for example imagine you got a
job at the department for transport and
you had to move to london and you only
wanted your commute to be like 30 to 60
minutes and you had 500,000 pounds to
spend on a flat that's like a million
dollars and so you enter these things
into the thresholds at the top and you'd
get these little bright spots left which
are the places that you should look for
housing brilliant isn't it
it really is they do some really great
job great things but what I would argue
is that there's more to it sure there's
that the two towers first are about
public transit and about housing costs
but there might be other things like
schools like am I going to feel
comfortable in a neighborhood where's
the database that tells you whether
you're going to feel comfortable isn't
going to have the amenities that I want
does it have the kind of coffee shop
that I would feel comfortable hanging
out in all morning or does it have art
galleries that open the first Tuesday of
every month like I like that kind of
thing so there's more to it of course
that means that you can have like 42
sliders at the top which doesn't make
sense all there's another way around
that but anyway all I'm arguing is is to
expand the threshold so um the whole
idea of intuition is everybody has a
different approach things work
completely smoothly here and you all
agree all the time yeah mm-hmm very nice
I don't work here anyway so the mental
model is it's an interpretive device but
it embodies neutral data so it embodies
a bunch of quotes from a bunch of people
that you've interpreted to represent
certain things based on the context of a
conversation you guys can agree on those
interpretations then it's a lot easier
to agree about what to put underneath
and where to focus how to support people
and the other thing that I encounter a
lot is that as employees we are problem
solvers and we walk in the door every
morning wanting to solve problem saying
this is what's driven us throughout our
career throughout us you know it made us
choose what we chose to study in school
we want to solve some problems yet that
aspect of it that whole approach makes
us unable to see what real people are
trying to get done so i'll ask people at
the beginning of the
project you know what what is the
customer going to get out of this and
they'll tell me things like oh the
customer is going to have higher
customer satisfaction as I know that's
not the customers objective their
objective is to maybe find the cheapest
flight to Maui your objective is higher
customer satisfaction that's there's a
difference there so I want people to be
able to like sort of drop the baggage of
being a problem solver for a couple of
hours and take on the role of that end
user of that potential user be able to
play their role if you had like a body
swap know enough about what they're
doing and this leads me to the idea of
stories stories have been with us for
years millennia we start reading stories
at a really young age and we know the
power the educational power of it you
read a story or you hear a story and you
can empathize with a person you
understand what their circumstances are
when you understand their life you can
support them better and there's no
reason why we should drop this really
important proven concept the minute we
walk into a business let's hear stories
so I wanted to show you the google one
how many people have seen the mental
model that Jeff een made for analytics
here at Google couple okay excellent
well there's to you here it is I'm gonna
because it's too long to actually fit on
the screen and be readable the first
mental space is understand my visitors
then we've got analyze incoming traffic
sources evaluate site content and
performance and then the last one is
communicate findings and I really liked
that last one so I'm going to dive into
that that last one about communicating
findings is consist of some certain
towers format reports outside of tool
okay yeah share numbers across the
organization that's important so
everybody knows you know where where are
we standing it's kind of like that
vision it'll help that vision explain
what the number
mean that's a key one I think that might
have been something that wasn't on
everybody's mind when they were creating
analytics and then justify spending on
web efforts which goes without saying
and so the dotted line things were ideas
that the team came up with the solid
line thing was the only thing that
existed in the version of analytics that
they had when they were doing this and
that was for explaining what the numbers
meant you could like oh here you can
have the password and let go look at the
numbers for yourself like that's going
to help anyway um and this is the
probably all seen this is some of the
vision that's come out of this by being
able to look at the stories that people
are telling you about what they have to
do within their own organization with
regard to how well things are tracking
on the website they need to be able to
see things in a much better clear
fashion so last thing I want to mention
is this doesn't have to be really formal
there's a rough sketch way of doing it
this is me in 1998 with my cup of tea
and my laptop and I went i was at
organic we were studying time tracking
and i went and talked to all these guys
and he yakked at me and after I think
about 23 days I just pulled together a
little model of what they did another
example I do a lot of running and
friends of mine rel training for
marathons and so I asked them what are
you doing in your training so just
talking while we're out there running
and then I came home and scribbled it
down and in an hour I built this after
you know about six months worth of
listening to people get the right work
out for this training run monitor how
I'm feeling keep myself fueled record my
run make my shoes and clothes
comfortable enjoy the trails and
entertain my brain and what I did with
this because I have an ulterior motive
is I actually plotted underneath those
towers the functions on my heart rate
monitor it has like a stopwatch and a
countdown and heart rate min
axes and alarms and stuff and then I
went through and I found some emotion
there were this is what people were
saying was that they were frustrated
because they turn off their stopwatch
when they were trying to get like I'm
going to run in minutes for my workout
and make sure I do the right work out
and stopping my stopwatch to like get a
drink of water or go to the restroom or
something now you forget to turn it back
on again when I start and then i'm down
the trail or whatever and I'm looking at
him like oh god how long have I been
running since I stopped have I done my
workout already should I turn around and
go home or should I keep going I was
really frustrating when they're trying
to get exactly the right work out so I
came out with a couple of ideas what if
you had an ascending tone just turn on
the stopwatch in a descending tone to
turn it off what if you had a little LED
that was lit up when you were actually
had it on so it would be easier to see
that it was on as opposed to looking at
the seconds go by so that was that was
just a rough sketch I want to conclude
with just sort of a page full of mental
models gives you the stories gives you
the ability to empathize the ability to
kind of drop out of your problem-solving
mode for a little bit and understand
people and then enter it again with all
the things that are matched at the
bottom and then hopefully this will get
more tales in the right place on the
donkey so I've written a book about this
that goes and more munchy details about
how to get a model together and I have a
couple of those books here actually I
was going to give one away where to put
that box I was going to give one away to
the first person who really wanted one
so raise your hand there we go excellent
and i also have a mental model here that
all n roll if you want to come up and
take a look at it and it's from an
actual client dow corning so I can't
you're welcome thank you as I can't
leave it but you guys can come out and
take a look and I've got a blog up there
