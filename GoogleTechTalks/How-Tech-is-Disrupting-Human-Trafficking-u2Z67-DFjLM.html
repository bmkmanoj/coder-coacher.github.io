years and I guess a year and a half and
I had the opportunity to travel with
Casey and his nonprofit sector work to
Nepal a month two months after the
earthquake and I you know what's under
their pressure we're gonna go see what I
was like learn about like the disaster
that had happened how can we help them
rebuild and also maybe how can we
implement potential high and low tech
solutions for that but a lot of what I
learned was about how human trafficking
in that part of the world was a huge
problem right it's not one that's often
sort of talked about especially in the
US and the media here and after the
earthquake human trafficking went up 200
percent and Nepal and that for me was a
statistic that I have night not let go
because it's really upsetting you're
seeing all this damage very physically
but you know kind of behind the scenes
what is happening to you know like
people's bodies and their lives is
changing so drastically so to introduce
KC he found it affect org in 2010 yes to
with it with the aim of building rural
schools in India after he traveled
abroad internationally in college he
sort of came across the concept that
education can change everything through
his own education right as he was abroad
he was learning that but through
education of anyone anywhere in the
world so he found it affect to sort of
build schools to help teach people in
rural India and not long after they had
built their first school they started
realizing with their female students
weren't coming to school anymore and
they started asking questions and no one
was really answering the questions and
as I started to dig a little deeper they
started to realize that a lot of it was
because those female students were kind
of disappearing or being trafficked so
then that sort of changed the direction
of what he was doing at the time and let
him to make a documentary and here is PC
it's it's great to come back to Google
we seem to find ourselves here a few
times a year and it's great to present
the talk a little bit more about what
we're doing and to you guys know some of
the opportunities you can get involved
with with human trafficking and some of
the issues that are happening to our
neighboring countries so thank you Chloe
for the introduction so let's just jump
right into the topic that we're doing
today so I'll text her technology is
disrupting human trafficking so really
that's gonna be our topic today and I
want to give some insight of essentially
what's happening with human trafficking
why it's happening why it's growing what
are the solutions behind it and what you
guys can do to help essentially stop it
so as to make this all work I just want
talk a bit more about where we got our
start and how we got involved and how we
found out about it and hopefully this
will help you build some context on the
issue yourselves and so start with so
started effect org back in college
actually one of the co-founders is with
us here today
milene Johnson pays your ham so we both
went to the same university Utah State
go Aggies it's a small University but
that's where we started working on
effect and we opened it for school back
in 2010 so we were both sophomores in
college quite young quite had the whole
world in front of us and we're really
excited about the opportunities to to
see if we could disrupt education in
India so we started working with our our
Indian colleagues or friends that will
go into the university there and we
start working in the state called Bihar
so Bihar is close to 100 million people
80% is rural quite an eye-opening trip
to go there for the first time when I
was a 23 and just overwhelmed with all
these new smells and sounds and busyness
and that's where we actually opened our
school we opened up for school in Bihar
in this small little village
and as we would make trips in between
during like spring break or during
Christmas break we'd go in to the school
and we start seeing some discrepancies
between our male and female students and
as we started investigating more and
more we would see that the girls
essentially why they were missing so we
go talk to the parents there was all
different answers for why some of the
girls were missing but some of them we
never did get any answers for and one
day I was speaking to one of the local
lawyers and he was telling me how girls
are trafficked from this area every day
and I had never heard that and
understanding that was actually
happening so as we started to talk to
him more found out that this was very
very common that they were usually taken
to Delhi or to Kolkata but usually they
going to Delhi and they were being told
they were gonna go Dee dishwashers or
they were gonna go be nannies or do
housework and make make some extra money
and the parents because they're living
day to day in poverty are excited for
these opportunities and let their
daughters go usually reluctantly with
tears they let the daughters go and then
a lot of times I never seen them again
they try to follow up with the person
who traffic man who took them and they
disappear and being 23 and being a
sophomore in college I was I was shocked
I was pissed and then all shocked
maybe both because it was happening in
front of us and as we started to
investigate and and and look at what was
happening all throughout India that it
was literally happening in every village
was happening all over the place that
essentially families were being tricked
into letting their daughters go to work
and then they were being trapped into
this really really really bad situation
so we had talked about how we can
respond to this and we had been using
video as a medium to share our work with
a lot of our supporters and we knew that
a documentary would be retire Falls for
is showing what's actually happening and
the reason why we came that conclusion
is because as we would tell people both
in India and back at home what was
happening with human trafficking while
then was shake their head and say no
that's not happening
that's impossible this is not happening
and even some of the folks who've been
on our expeditions have found when they
travel to India they'll be sitting next
to someone they said no that I don't
know you're talking about this that
has not happened in my country and and
they get really frustrated no absolutely
happens and so these are good
conversations for us to have right now
the good conversations to talk about why
it's happening and what we can do to
solve it and how these open
conversations because a lot of people
want to hide from it they for some
reason they think this is scary that
this isn't you know this is a problem
that's happening in a far far land and
we shouldn't talk about it but actually
it's happening here in Mountain View
it's happening it's happening in San
Francisco that's happening in Oakland so
these are conversations that we do need
to have so we believe that a documentary
could be really eye-opening and Sharons
light about what was happening in India
itself so in 2014 I started with a good
friend a film director named Chris Davis
and he had just got divorced he was
tired of he was making really good money
in the work that he was doing and he
broke away from all of it and pretty
much came on board me to make nothing
and started filming the documentary so
we would worked for out four or five
months we came back to the States
and we had no money we started going to
investors start going to foundation
started going to all the different
places trying to raise money then
everyone said no you're crazy this this
isn't gonna work
so then we said well we'll turn to
Kickstarter because we've heard of great
things happening on Kickstarter so we
spent months doing research about how to
have a successful campaign we only
looked at successful campaigns we never
once looked at a failed campaign because
we were not going to be a failure we
were going to be successful and we only
looked at campaigns that raised over
$100,000 I look back at this and I think
we're absolutely crazy but that's what
we did because we were convinced and the
team that helped with us on this is all
here today and so we launched a campaign
we had two launch parties one in Salt
Lake City where Chris Davis lives the
director and then one here in San
Francisco were rest of my team myself
lives and the big goal is $100,000 and
we pretty much got the $30,000 installed
and with Kickstarter as you know you
have to raise the full amount that you
decide in the beginning or you get
nothing and so when my parents heard
that they were like what are you crazy
why would you do something where you
can't get what the people have given you
already and I had to explain to them
that it's the urgency that to get more
people involved and and so that's what
we we're pretty much begging anyone
you write a story about what we're doing
so we got to about three days left on
the campaign and we still had a gap of
about $45,000 to raise and I mean I
couldn't sleep it was a quite miserable
time but our team worked relentlessly
bugging journalists to write a story on
us and this great thing happened with
Huffington Post where they wrote an
article about our organization and then
four days later upworthy
on Saturday night at 10:30 put it on
their Facebook page and we went viral
within upworthy
so every second we were getting a
donation and we blew past our goal I
went to bed like we were close to our
goal and we ended up you see in the box
we end up raising $115,000 $16,000 woke
up that morning pretty much interior the
whole team was just ecstatic we can play
we just turned a corner that we didn't
know what was possible we believed in it
but you don't know if it can actually
happen until it happens
so quite special moment for all of us in
a team to know the biggest thing was
that everyone told us that a lot of
people saw that it wasn't possible a lot
of people told us that this film wasn't
didn't matter I guess and we knew it
mattered and we knew that other people
knew that it mattered and so when we had
all these people messaging from
Australia from Europe from from South
America even there saying I donate to
you because I care about this issue and
I want to see a stop I can't wait to see
your film those message did that meant
so much to us and so when we had this
new funding we were able to move forward
we were able to formulate a bigger team
and to start filming the documentary one
thing that was new to us is that
documentaries are they're stupidly
expensive it's really hard to get people
to come on you on just a merit based
that this is going to be worthwhile but
luckily we were able to find that with a
team we actually formulated two other
filmmakers who were just so passionate
about this issue that they dropped
everything we paid them essentially
their expenses and that was it and we
went out we filmed so we filmed from
pretty much for the moment from 2014 we
film took a break to do the Kickstarter
and then we fill in almost all up to
2015 and you know the the experience of
it has his miss Brice where we're at
today where we got to learn all these
different issues about humans
fifteen so when that happening is as a
producer I would usually conduct most of
interviews and we'd sit down with these
girls and they would just dump their
souls out on top to film and and to you
and the whole film crew is crying and
we're having this terrible experience
you know hearing the story and we're
trying to figure out how can we share
this with with everyone else how can we
actually share and give this merit of
what's going on here
and I'll talk a little bit more about
how we believe that we're doing that not
only with the film but also with with
our expeditions that we do we have some
folks here who been on our trips and but
how you can touch feel see and actually
get involved to make a difference so the
film we started filming mainly in in
Kathmandu in Nepal we filmed all over
Nepal and then we went to Kolkata in
India found a little cricketer and the
regions around Kolkata and then we went
to down to Mumbai and shot Mumbai for a
long time in Mumbai we actually lived in
the brothels we were there for three
weeks living in on parkland Lane if
those who went to Mumbai most people
remember I had never been to these
places I believe so it was but by the
end of our stay there we were no longer
welcome so we had to leave but and then
and then we went to Delhi so these are
really the hot spots and and some of you
might ask why why India you know I mean
the easy answer would be that this is
where we were working but what we
learned though is that India is actually
has one of the largest forced
prostitution rings in the world and
we're talking almost 350,000 girls who
are being trafficked every year these
are numbers that the UN are not
reporting this is a criminal activity so
the numbers are really like out there
that and the UN is really having a hard
time actually align themselves with any
numbers but if you talk to all these
different nonprofits like we had the
opportunity to it's easy to see how big
the problem is and we believe that
350,000 is they is a low number of
what's actually happening so as we film
this we actually sorry to see all these
different ways that not promise of work
to try and end it and we also saw all
the ways the traffickers were doing to
win it to get more girls and
all these different things I just want
to show you a little piece of the work
that we did with one organization called
Shakti Vahini and they're based in New
Delhi and this is a piece that they that
we worked with them on that essentially
shows what it's like to go rescue girls
so this is just a two-minute piece
it is trafficking is the world's second
biggest economy and this has to be
broken huge it especially if I am
talking about India our young girls
termed turning into the brothels after
all in India as per the National Human
Rights report fifty thousand girls goes
missing every year fifty thousand girls
goes missing it every year where are
those girls landing into some may be may
be found but there are the others and it
is our responsibility it is our
responsibility to search each and every
girl in India brothels are illegal in
India brothels are illegal but why this
exists I don't know
so that was taken in New Delhi I'm one
of the larger red-light districts called
GB Road and as you can see they are very
sophisticated at hiding these girls when
the police come
so when Shakti Vahini they do the most
rates probably out of any organization
in India and they do it with a budget
about 150,000 dollars if you want to
look at what the other big organizations
that are doing anti-human trafficking
budgets they have are insane and these
guys are literally kicking down doors
and doing amazing work and but one thing
that that was the founder and what he
will he'll tell you not on camera but so
so much in personal conversations is
that they used to rescue a girl or two a
week now they're getting three or four
requests a day he can't even keep up and
he's like they're so passionate about it
but they're so passionate about because
of the problems growing so so largely
and as you can see they're very
sophisticated about hiding the girls so
in this case they were able to they
actually have blueprints from the other
trafficking arrays that they've done so
they know where they can actually see
maybe where they've hidden them before
so they can go in and get the girls out
if you notice the girls they're speaking
Hindi back and forth but they in the
translation is they speak Bengali
because most of these girls are not from
they're not from the region's most we
don't speak Hindi Muslim speak Bengali
Muslim speak Nepali so not from these
areas and they they'd love that as
traffickers they love to keep them where
they can't actually understand the
languages so that they can keep them
around a lot of times they take their
passports to take any identification
they have so they can't leave and you
can see this woman the left corner she's
got acid that's been sprayed all over
her face for a moment for a time that
she tried to leave girls in the bottom
right corner those that they're trying
to seek ones who live in rural villages
once who parents are seeking to put them
into work to get them opportunities but
they're not aware of the wolves that are
dressed in sheepskin so one of the
stories I'm not sure next with you is a
girl that we affectionately call Renu
that's not her real name but we don't
share her real name but she was
trafficked when she was quite young for
Nepal she was taken to
to India to New Delhi and as a young
girl at 13 she was raped 20 to 25 times
a day and she shares her story and I
can't really give a justice I'm just
gonna show her interview and there is
hope people but it's important that we
show what's happening
and many of them I'm running to so young
at 13 what do you understand what do you
know and from one day from being a free
being a young girl full of hope full of
aspirations to become somebody who's was
going to be a slave for her for most
part of her life if not slave only of
one person or one system is a slave of
that experience that is never going to
leave it and it does not no matter how
much rehabilitative support we give no
matter how much counseling we do that
trauma is impossible to hear anything
Rene was one of these girls trafficked
to young age she has undergone
situations that by the sun'll sons are
level four seven and two and if I
haven't recorded on your constituency I
will see my
all right hospitable Organa and this is
in the body tape activity records do you
think that the majority was in 3d and
muta all they come
can we garden I mean we
Rene was one of the lucky ones after
eight months of being abused by Indian
men she and one of the girl escaped
she returned back to Nepal through the
assistance of a local nonprofit she
prosecuted her captors for trafficking
her many young women are trafficked into
the sex trade
so renewed story is is this common
actually the girls are trafficked when
they young and when I when I say calm
and usually they never get out she's one
of the few that she gets the that was
escaped she pretty much all we see
usually what happens is the girls who
escape they escape within the first year
because they are just absolutely
terrified what's going on they want to
get out if they can't get out in that
year then its we see that the chance
they came out is very slim they said
they begin to accept their destiny which
is unfortunate but Sheikh saved within
eight months what ended up happening is
her her trafficker her same trafficker
came back with another girl from her
same village and she said if you tell
anything to her I'll kill you both so as
soon as she got a moment she told her
everything she told her everything that
was going on here and she saw her face
you saw her innocence and she didn't
want the same thing to happen to her
that happened her to happen to this girl
that she was from the same village so
that night they escaped they got away
there was an opportunity where they had
a quick chance and they just went they
took it and they made their way all the
way to Kathmandu from daily on bus and
got back and when they gotten back she
was taken in hands to a larger
organization in Kathmandu and then she
was passed on to a smaller organization
she is an amazing success story she's
one of the few that it just takes oh I
mean rescuing them is the easy part
that's what we often say it's the
rehabilitation afterwards it takes
potential years she's had seven years
now she did a training in Japan where
they make a special type of scarf and
she took the training there for two
three months and she teaches other girls
how to do his training she makes a lot
of the jewelry that's coming from this
organization that well actually talked
about one of conversations that's
helping so that I heard the beautiful
jewelry that they're doing and she got
married she got married for five months
ago to a wonderful guy their family
doesn't know her full story because
she's I mean I'll see you be embarrassed
but she she's doing well she came I mean
she's she's amazing success story and
but she's been through a lot and and we
hope to see more success stories but
honestly this is where we get into more
much more what we talk about is
prevention how can we prevent this
actually from happening to girls like
Renu so we film this documentary we
thought we were pretty much finished in
last September and we pretty much had to
call the whole crew back and we went
back to India to do a lot more
undercover work so a lot of what we do
had been undercover filming and we were
looking for our main story which was
actually filming the parents and I grew
up being trafficked and being rescued
the whole process which was proved to be
very difficult it took us almost three
years
to get this and we got it last November
we got the full story which is our key
story so the films being edited in
Bangkok right now so as a very budget
organization we do everything pretty
much overseas because we can save a lot
more money but we found some really
really talented amazing editors in
Bangkok who are taking it and it'll be
released in in January we're shooting
for Sundance so so one thing that we
noticed is the problem is way way bigger
than anything that we're seeing the 81
that was reporting from the UN to the
World Bank anything that was this
problem was massive and that we had
heard this word modern-day slavery
maybe you've seen 12 years of slave when
you were in high school if you
to high school in the US and you were
taught about the African trade slave how
terrible was it is worse right now what
is going on right now is I can't compare
it but it is it's bigger it's bigger
than was ever happening before and yet
all we see is you know Trump head
crashes or hit headlines and we see you
know all these crazy things in the media
decides of what we should know but one
statistic that really bothers all of us
is that I'll talk about that a little
more okay right here is that essentially
if you combine all the world tragedies
are happening right now trafficking is
killing more girls than any other of
them all of them combined they're all
dying from HIV so if you look I think
the problem is and that does not
correlate with what we're seeing on TV
and that's a bit sad so hopefully if
this film can change a lot of that
second largest criminal tippity versus
drugs
not too much variance 31 billion for
human trafficking 32 billion for
trafficking drugs it's gonna pass
trafficking trafficking will pass drugs
soon and will be the largest and the
reason being is it's easier and there's
it's low risk and chances of getting
caught
or much much less and the repercussions
are much much less the UN actually
reported of criminals abandoning drugs
over other comon activities and
switching to human trafficking because
it's low risk and profitability so not
much as we've seen though so why is it
growing traffickers huge demand
customers want it customers want cheap
sex and there's weak weak laws that
don't protect women and then being
caught is is very very minimal and the
other side of it is it because of
poverty the number one reason why we
have trafficking is because of poverty
parents are living you know day to day
from very low amount of work and money
and this is something that we've had a
hard time be able to express is you know
a lot of you if you have children you
how could you ever let them go work in a
foreign city at the age of 13 and 14 but
if you have five children if you lived
in a mud hut if you're barely feeding
them your situation would be different
and that's what we try to show on these
trips that we do
is that you would take a different
course I believe but even though those
are always the right decisions
these poor or desperate for better
opportunities and those goes on so those
are the reasons when the victims are
happening the problems who are the
customers this is a big question that we
always got we always get if you if you
look in most of markets if you if you go
to Thailand if you go to Cambodia it's a
little bit more skewed you do have maybe
twenty thirty percent coming from
foreigners a lot of times it come from
other Asian countries that are looking
for cheap sex there's a sex tourism
essentially but all in all majority of
it is locals with local girls in in
India we're seeing like high like 98
percent our Indians visiting Indian
brothels in Nepal same way the the
brothels that are in Nepal you're seeing
that majority of the men are in or
nipply themselves so people have been
trying to figure out why why it's
growing so much wise why is it becoming
a norm and some had point towards
urbanization children for the first time
we're leaving their generations of
families who've lived in the village and
they're actually leaving and going to
live in Delhi or Bombay and being
influenced by a whole bunch of new
things that they'd ever been influenced
before and don't really know how to
handle and get into these bad routines
or ideas that it's okay to to go to
brothels and actually what we see is the
most of girls who've who we've
interviewed who've been who've escaped
they bit usually xscape because of a
client the client has no idea I don't
know if the client are the are the
customers are the bad guys but most of
them have no idea they think that
they've chosen this path that these
girls have chosen to be prostitutes and
once they find out that they were
brutally beaten that they were dragged
into this place they were broken
mycourses then they start to think twice
about what to do and actually help break
them out which is a huge risk of them
being caught
these girls are oftentimes threatened
for their lives all the time they see
other girls then they examples of the
who they kill and so they get scared so
the constant living in the fear of the
repercussions of running away so so why
is this happening it like says happen
here in Mountain View Oakland Sacramento
huge huge hotspots the numbers are scary
or what happening here in the US about
how many girls are being trafficked into
the u.s. how underground it is if you
follow any big event superbowl
especially someone commented from our
groups you know how they put out a memo
to Googlers about how you should be
careful about the trafficking the the
actual trafficking during the Superbowl
and someone commented how interesting
why don't we talk about the actual
trafficking that's happening the human
trafficking didn't happen during the
Superbowl
so more these conversations do matter
but again India is the large country
force prostitution the largest country
of actual prostitution is China
okay so sturm two solutions the most
successful solution that we've seen is
that is is what happened in Sweden in
1999 they introduced a which a lot of
people are affectionately calling the
Sweden model be careful when you google
that we've had Beauford folks do that
and they end up getting Swedish models
but Sweden the Swedish model is is quite
fascinating so Sweden borders next to
other countries that have huge huge
problems with with human trafficking
with prostitution and in 1999 they came
out with a law that they would only
prosecute customers and not the victims
themselves so not the prostitutes and
what they did is they came across all
boards with the the police with the
judicial system with everything that
came across it said these are the laws
and they came down hard and what they
ended up seeing is that it became so
difficult to run brothels or
prostitution houses that they pretty
much up and left they just left and they
all went to the Netherlands
unfortunately but they all left went to
other European countries and so end up
becoming this model of you know this is
a really interesting way it works and if
you see that I put functioning
government so and functioning
governments that seems to work so maybe
you saw the headlines there's a lot of
news coming out the last few weeks but
in the headlines at France actually just
passes they passed the same similar law
other countries have passed it
throughout Europe Cambodia is a good
example of a country that has passed
this law that is I would say then also
much non-functioning government but they
have passed this law the reason why I
have split the two is because it seems
to work
when I don't even know if that's if this
is worked very good in the US I really
don't we're just I mean we're pretty
corrupt so I don't know but if you if
you take non-functioning governments
where governments seem to have a lot of
corruption I'm not so convinced that the
Soudan model would work very well in a
place like India but it would be a good
step forward of least saying that these
are repercussions that can happen if you
if you traffic a girl if you're caught
with a prostitute and not actually
persecuting or putting women who are
prostitutes in jail because most of them
are forced to be there then I even
assign their choice so these are some of
the some of the good solutions that
we've seen in non functioning
governments our prevention and that even
means going village to village
door-to-door and letting people know
that you know there are wolves and sheep
kits sheep check coming in and that and
these are the reasons these are things
that you should look out for and we've
seen huge success of these programs
we've seen very good success with
educating girls if you put a girl in a
school the chance of the main trafficked
are so minimal and the reason being is
that you have so many different eyes
watching this person you know if this
girl is saying she's going to school but
she's being taken by another guy and
being you know talked to then the parent
ends up talking to the teacher in the
talk to the parent and there's just more
eyes on the girls to watch for these
sensitive situations we've seen
intercept they're valuable honorable
girls these are really good programs
that we've seen that are in brothels
brothel areas are actually just
neighborhoods and so ends up happening
is the girls who grow up in these
neighborhoods actually end up becoming
victims and the young men end up
becoming pimps and so these really
amazing programs in Bombay and also in
Calcutta that have essentially
intervened and given these people better
education giving them better
opportunities giving them an insight of
what's happening and has actually broken
that cycle
shaming the government is always good
once they see that as a problem that's
being highlighted I think the Delhi rape
can be a very good example 2012 most of
you had to have seen that absolutely
terrible but if you have it a young
doctor was brutally raped and as and she
died from this rape by some drunk boys
who were uneducated
and essentially the whole country
erupted especially daily it went crazy
because this could have been their
daughter this could have been
I think that was their the realization
that this could have been my daughter
and so the whole country erupted and
what we saw from that is the government
moving very quickly to in to interject
some new laws that have been actually
very very successful and that are sort
of working which is an accomplishment a
huge accomplishment that was very
organic but we do see times when large
media campaigns or things that that
happened in the government's breaking
the trafficking cycle or something I
don't want to talk about real quick if
you look at the cycle of you know supply
and demand look this is a business where
the traffickers customers the brothels
and the girls essentially if we're able
to break a whole or anyway
we seem to see a huge decrease in in the
problem and this is where we're seeing a
lot of different nonprofits working in
each of these sector don't know how time
to go over all they're each working in
these sectors but it's pretty amazing to
see how you know I said you know a lot
of times they can shame the customers or
they can at least educate the customers
or you know green on stronger laws for
the traffickers if they're caught
shutting down brothels brothels are not
legal in India yet they seem to run just
fine those are things that we are still
trying to figure out there in some ways
very protected by the government or the
police that tried to stop them
themselves alright just two I'm gonna
finish up here in about ten minutes so
that we can have Q&amp;amp;A afterwards before
we finish but I didn't want to get into
really the crux of our conversations how
is tech is actually changing human
trafficking how is attending and what we
saw during filming the organization is
that sorry filming this documentary
because that very few organizations were
actually using technology we were
shocked by this as we would go from
Bombay to Calcutta to Katmandu to Delhi
and work with all these different
rotations games many stories we actually
started like digging deeper into these
organisations we'd actually look at
their finances which are looking at like
what they were doing cuz we were
interested as a nonprofit ourselves and
as myself of being an entrepreneur
trying to figure out well what are you
doing to you know the to make this more
efficient or who are you collaborating
with and we saw all these things that
they weren't collaborating they weren't
work using technology if they were it
was like Excel
Sheetz so we're trying to figure out why
aren't using all these different tools
that are out there we found one
organization that was using Google
Spreadsheets and we all freaked out we
were like really excited because I mean
because they saw the power of being able
to put something in one sheet and you
know the person in the other site could
actually see it and so this is really
where the idea came from with starting
what we call expeditions so as being a
non-profit we wanted to give people
opportunities to actually understand the
issues of human trafficking or all these
different things are happening and one
of them was what if we brought them to
the actual places what if we brought you
to Nepal what if we brought you to India
and let moon shooters like yourselves
actually understand the issue on the
ground and build technology around that
to solve the solution so that was the
idea we tried it last year it went
really really well we have folks that
are in this room that came on that trip
so we ended up today we've had 66
volunteers that have mobilized with us
who've gone expeditions with us we work
with companies like Google and
Salesforce and some other ones we've
designed 23 types of of tech or
potential nonprofits or or startups and
we've raised just under $400,000 through
this program I already kind of talked
about what what we're working on but
essentially it's a lot of companies that
you work for like Google itself have you
know you have 30 40 hours or 30 hours or
20 hours of volunteer time off so this
is a volunteer time off opportunity that
you can travel to another country
understand the issue at a deep level
about four or five days and then at the
end of the time is really where the
magic happens where we do a big
hackathon so we bring in locals we bring
in experts and we have a big hackathon
so hackathon is essentially where ideas
people form around ideas and then you
try and create those in just a short
amount of time so ours is 54 hours and
these the outcomes have been absolutely
amazing
we've been so excited to see the
different outcomes coming from them so
some of them I want to highlight also
worth the now we have Elise who was
actually on the first expedition and
she's been a great ambassador to effect
and they started banal which was what
they saw from some of the organizations
they made really amazing jewelry but
they didn't really have a platform to
sell it didn't have a way to get it in
front of people so they could actually
make an income and actually increase the
work that they were doing or make more
money as a non-profit so they built a
beautiful website gave a platform then
for them to sell it sometimes when I go
to Nepal I pick up their shipping
supplies and bring it back with me but
they essentially you're creating an
environment that they can sell more
jewelry from this and they're actually
very much helping them on their the
whole cycle I'm sure at least can tell
you more about what they're doing but
it's really amazing to see the work that
they've pulled together we've seen
another one which is a table which was
essentially taking all the data from one
of the organizations that they had four
girls who've been trafficked and putting
them on a heat map very simple but
actually understanding you know you know
some of these hotspots of areas that are
happening and how they can essentially
mitigate that to make decisions on where
they should put their focus a very
simple one was a plastering of brothel
so they went to brothels throughout
Kathmandu and posted all these signs
that said you know essentially the the
buying sex is punishable to law blah
blah if you've seen this Texas number
they got a quite a few text is just a
few few nights they did that and pass
that off to another organization to run
so now we've seen some of these really
amazing progress that come from these
organizations and really affect
exhibitions is there to essentially
support and help really the glue to
bring you there show you the
organization's see how you can get
involved but we're also the push to let
you go on your own like at lease and to
to see how you can work on creating
solutions yourself how can you put your
twenty percent or ten percent into
making net solutions so really what we
say is you know we put these back on you
guys and we put the burden back on you
to see how you can help to make a
difference some other really great
organizations that are fighting human
trafficking that we've seen new light is
one that you saw the film Destiny
Foundation at a cookout the Seawind is
the one with all the amazing they use
the Google sheets truck do some more
attractive bohemian these are some great
relation that we've seen that do really
really amazing work
throughout India Nepal we are running
short on time I want to do a Q&amp;amp;A if you
guys unless you want to see this video
it's two minutes it's really inspiring
so maybe this will help with let's do it
what it real quick life of a woman in
prostitution or a survivor is the is
that of constants memory of that abuse
they just deal with their everyday lives
like as if they're going through the
motions of it there is never any moment
for anything where they can stop and
actually connect with what is happening
inside or even address that the project
we are working on right now is named
Kalpataru which means the
wish-fulfilling tree and it is a
holistic restorative retreat for women
who have been victims and survivors of
trafficking and who continue to be in
prostitution it's a program where women
are exposed to dance music movement
working with clay doing yoga pranayama
and the Ayurvedic way of living it's
very very different from their everyday
lives
this is a project that we hope would
touch their inner potential of
fulfilling all there is all the things
that they wish for the current Augustus

like related battling each other yes you
are Allah gets it
they've never been in a place like this
they have never experienced loving touch
the way they do that all of them are
kind of reclaiming or reconnecting with
parts of their childhood which they were
locked up when we see a group of young
women dancing in love rushing across the
big hole there's this incredible energy
of joy total abandon which is something
they must be expressing anywhere else
every other transaction that happens in
their lives is in calculated transaction
this some kind of scheme there something

not nice against is outwash not even a
nice closure at the hazard is who she
thought was she died
this is where the true being a true
selves
and that is forgotten all about it is to
release the attention it is to make them
feel I loved we loved filming that piece
and we loved working with the
organization to see Ellen who you guys
caught that but those are prostitutes
those were women who work on the streets
every day and we worked with them a lot
on the streets as filming and then to
come to this program and to see them
laughing and excited and putting clay on
each other's face and doing all these
things that it was so amazing to see it
to be a part of that and and to give
them a chance to see that lie and that's
really what a big part of our film is is
humanizing these women they've never
ever ever chose this this profession it
was forced upon them and they've
accepted it they've accepted it because
of they find it's their fate and there's
no other work for them and so they
continue to do it but they're still
human beings they still have aspirations
they still have dreams they still have
wants and needs and like the woman says
she's always want to set up and get
pretty and and you know do what she
needs to do but coming to programs like
this are very important for those
programs cost money so we hope through
this film also that we can help since
she aid with that and then give them
more opportunities to grow and expand
these these programs so that they can do
more good you can make a difference so
these are some of the programs we've
done I talked about before we have
expeditions coming up a lot of them are
full but we have a few spots coming up
in July we have spots coming up on the
rest of the year I do have a sign-up
sheet here it's not a sign up she's more
like name and email and will just email
you more information if you want to come
on these trips and my team's here I got
my team members stand up so that we have
Nicole and Sandy and then we have a
board member
milene and then we have a lease who's
been one of our trips we have Matt who's
been one of our trips we have Chloe who
presents about our trip so if you have
questions we're all here to answer those
and we do have looks like seven more
minutes I can answer some questions that
you might have
based on the crew station so thank you
Yeah right so the question was what is
trafficking look like here in the Bay
Area
um I'm not expert in this but I will say
from what I've understood that it is not
so much about foreigners coming in which
from what I understand is like 30 40 %
are coming from other countries but mass
for majority of them are coming from our
neighbors neighboring countries more
from Mexico how do we say safe with the
crew as filming yeah I would be scared
to make this film in the u.s. to be
honest I think that it's a different
environment in India itself is and the
Park white safe environments to be
honest there are only a few times that
we felt as if we needed to leave some of
our strategies were actually coming in
filming very quickly and then leaving
very quickly we would never stay in a
city too long we'd always come back and
film out for a month or two now those
are some our techniques but we usually
had really good we mainly worked with
Indians like Indian producers and
chasers and runners that would help us
understand drivers understand the
situation a little better I had a good
ear on what was going on so if we caught
a word of too much threats then we
we had move some reason stay so yeah
yeah so we did have we had journalist
visas for the filming part and that was
about it we were just the scene as
journalists as filming with that we had
no former permission from the US
government or of course not from the
Indian government but with the Indian
government was much more understanding
that we were coming to to make a film so
the question is from parents who have
girls who've been traffic yeah
surprisingly often times they're very
very embarrassed embarrassed that they
let their daughter go they got traffic
and all times they won't talk about too
much if they do talk about it we found
that they do talk about their freaking
pissed really pissed and they and they
see anyone that can help them they will
just they will tell you everything and
that was the case I'm probably I'll say
60% of our interviews of women of
daughters from their parents have been
trafficked um like one of them we found
his shoes walking home we found her like
on on the street and we just pulled over
and she was just like mic me up and
she's pissed we got a great interview
her daughter was found
we just find her I'm at
yeah yeah thanks so how can we help in
the general sense all of the above I
know that's not the answer the yo want
but you know again like if you notice a
lot of the orientation that we highlight
would talk about our local organizations
that are doing really good work and we
don't talk about the big organizations
that we've seen the reason being is that
they're pretty much taken care a lot of
them may raise really really good money
and but we see that the impact with
local organizations are so much higher
so much higher and they work on such
small budgets and so we really push we
yeah we donate that little to all these
organizations actually so a lot of the a
lot of the ways that you give these
local organizations a little bit they
seem shady on our end but it's actually
the legal way it's like bank transfers
and stuff like that which is a bit odd
for them so we actually transfer a lot
of funds to them as far as getting
involved there needs to be tech
solutions that needs to be collaboration
with these organizations and they need
tech and so coming on these expeditions
is a time for you to to get a deep dive
of the issues but also like see how you
can help and also like we need to be
having these conversations it seems that
people don't want to talk about human
trafficking but take this home share it
with your kids share it with your
colleagues and and let's talk about it
and effect is always there to help is
the glue to help is any way that we can
we're small organization pretty much our
whole team is here today so we are a
small nimble but yeah in the front
to Dharma topic but it's a whole ideas
raising awareness and I was raised
awareness or how to approach this topic
so it doesn't scare oftentimes when we
get questions like the answer might be
that we have to build it ourselves I
don't know if that's the right answer
boo I don't know if we've seen the right
platform where a safe environment where
these can be talked about there seems to
be a very evangelical Christian
grassroots effort to help end this which
isn't for everyone on the other end I
don't know how to answer that a lot of
what I'd say is when we get those
questions we realize it's not there and
so we let's build it let's do it
ourselves we saw that with a trip that
we did to Kolkata groups at the exact
same thing there isn't what we're
looking for on the same platform that
you said and they built it start working
on it they're all Googlers too so I can
connect you with them in the back
no no it's super fragmented and there
was a start-up actually just got into Y
Combinator that I think it was two
seasons ago or something that that
analogy for the FBI to use to understand
better about the cases that they were
working on which is which is really
great I mean amazing to see a start-up
working only on human trafficking issues
but they sold it as a for-profit but so
what but yeah I mean we haven't really
seen anything and to be honest like
effect is looking i've already was
looking for something to to champion
with the right support from the right
companies and all that so again we're
open to the champion one two
