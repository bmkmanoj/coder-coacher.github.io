to this fabulous tech talk by mr. john o
bacon who you may know from his
contributions to ke e or to genome or 2g
kosher or possibly from his illustrious
career in a metal band or as a solo
artist but he's most widely known for
his role as the bunt to community
manager working for canonical and today
he will be discussing with us standing
on the shoulders of giants the coming of
the Linux desktop John right hello
everyone all right oh yeah hello I
thought you people were supposed to be
exciting Google people doesn't sound
like it maybe try French would that be
better how about by jaw oh come on hi
I'll maybe Klingon Newton egg all right
i can see you looking at me in your
thinking okay this English guy is over
in our glorious sunny climate and he
feels uncomfortable and possibly unwell
from the plane food in the sushi so
let's try how about well hello you try
that come on everyone well hello hey
whoo you know what I said that the thing
on the side wasn't going to cause any
problems thinking through every slide
now hmm the great thing is that you're
going to sound you sound English so if
you come to England you know you'll fit
in like the rest of us because you sound
like these people okay so you can live
in a very large house and contribute
nothing to the country as well um not
bitter did you say this is being videoed
so um my name is John I work for
canonical as the Ubuntu community
manager and my job is to basically help
the bunch of community do interesting
things that benefits ubuntu and in turn
makes a great free desktop and server
and mobile solution for people and it's
a fun job and i work from home and one
of the nice things is coming out to do
talks so this talk is going to be about
the desktop which is illustrious lee
reflected in this image the desktop is
something that a lot of people get very
very excited about because if you look
at the IT world it basically you can
split it into three proxim areas you got
the desktop you got the server then you
got mobile and the desktop there's a bit
of an emotional connection there you
know because you live in it you you can
change the wallpaper you can change the
fonts you spend most of you time in it
you you you know you work in it you
source entertainment in it you look at
kind of lolcatz and youtube videos and
all these kinds of things in the desktop
most people don't get that emotionally
connected to a server the kind of people
get emotionally connected to servers get
emotionally connected to vegetables you
know this unusual types of people does
anyone here get emotionally connected to
vegetables good don't want to alienate
people so the desk to be something that
a lot of people find interesting and and
we care about now through this
presentation if you go to the
presentation theory people say you know
there's two or three different things
that you should put in your presentation
three facts that you should your
audience should take away from you and
in a now it can be very very difficult
to figure out what are the three things
you've got to take away so I was
thinking how to make this easier for my
audience right
and there's really only one man who can
solve this problem for us there's only
one man some people say he doesn't sleep
he just waits okay that man is of course
Chuck Norris Chuck Norris is the
solution to all of our problems so
throughout this presentation I will be
referring to the chuck norris scorecard
okay so you can kind of each these
important key things as I go through it
you can kind of pick out and apply so
before I start what what areas do people
work in they obviously work at Google
and there's some of you walked in for
the free food I mean I I don't maybe
that guy over there but um what would
you work and you work in the desktop do
you work in the server Chuck Norris is
on my side and Huckabee site one in the
same from what I can tell so what yeah i
mean what server stuff do you work in
programmers most of you do service
though so most of you are emotionally
connected to vegetables okay uh oh sorry
GUI test automation okay anything else
servers and GUI testing search engine
sorry they're too busy okay okay so if
we look at the death I mean how many of
you have been how many of you use linux
okay yeah so a lot of people using the
next and that I don't even leave you
been using linux for the last sort of
ten years so we've got some old-timers
who have been using it for a while
you'll probably know that the the the
desktop has been through something of an
evolution this is the idiots
representation of evolution and yeah i
first got involved in linux about 10
years ago as well and back then to
install linux on your computer needed a
soldering iron in a very steady hand it
was impossibly difficult to install on a
computer and my brother who has even
less hair than I do spent two weeks
installing on like on my machine
slackware 96 did anyone ever used that
yeah
wolf so back then you know add that was
kind of when I started seeing the
evolution of the desktop and I'm going
to go through some of the elements of
this evolution and I like some of you
who have used some of these desktops to
put one hand up and if you're still
using it for two hands up okay so let's
start with m WM how many have used it
you very nearly put two hands off okay
that's reasonable so anyone still used
in MW m no so MW m had two purposes in
life one was to put windows on the
screen and the other one was to make
them look ugly as can be seen in this
image and people use it to just run lots
of terminals that's pretty much the way
it worked so you can think of this in if
we compare this to a human evolution you
can kind of think of this as sort of the
1400s and you know this was around the
time when when things were pretty basic
and then if we kind of flip forward we
kind of flipped towards you know sort of
modernization beginning to happen okay
maybe the mid 1800s maybe early 1900s
things started get interesting we had
good known 1.0 anyone use that yeah
anyone using Katie around that time
instead okay so things were getting
we're starting to see the kind of the
core bits and pieces of the of the
desktop starting to shape that was I was
all pretty good now you know life went
on and we got to the 50s and then kind
of the 60s 70s the bong was invented
people started having promiscuous sex
free love drugs hippies Woodstock it was
the year of enlightenment okay this is
what happened when this is what happens
when technical people think they can
draw and enlightenment sexin because it
really showed what creativity was
possible in the desktop and even though
some of it was garish and ugly it was it
showed what people could do without
being constrained by you know different
commercial entities you know people were
just free to do what they wanted to do
and that was excellent
and then of course we flipped through
you know towards sort of today and we've
got things like Katy boys anyone used
Katy for at the moment no anyone using
genome 2.0 yeah so most people have good
knowing people apart from the window
maker guy so KD 4 is an excellent
achievement for the KDE team and they're
they're kind of defining the next
generation of the desktop and where and
where that's moving forward so the KD
team have really pushed something
impressive out there i think that
release event was held over here wasn't
it sort of is that right okay so
throughout all of this all of this
evolution right back to the early days
we've seen this sentence oh no we
haven't who's using those of terminals
on their desktop why coding especially
if your server people you just need to
pretty much write code not look at
pretty pictures a whole lot of state
only you're even funnier
ok I can do multitasking with terminals
this is dre so this is a lovely
screenshot yeah anyone so we've seen
this sentence throughout the years we've
all got an opinion on this you know and
everyone's I remember I remember someone
saying 1998 was the year the links
desktop I mean it really really wasn't
the earth or Linux desktop and each year
we look back it looks even more
ludicrous than the year before you know
when we look back to nineteen
ninety-eight ninety-seven not even more
ridiculous so everybody's got their own
theory about what what we're going to
fill in those four letters my view is
that you should put the word fail in
there because that sentence means
nothing but when you actually sit down
and people people rat on the year the
linux desktop and say you know the area
the next desktop you know it's never
going to happen we never know when it's
going to happen when people sit down and
think about anything there's actually
some premise in the concept of your
villainous sister because it's kind of
when we start seeing success kind of
beginning to happen you know we start
seeing lots and lots of people beginning
to use linux and taking an interest in
using using linux you know i get on a
train now and i see people using linux
on their desk on their laptops and to me
that's something of an achievement um of
course your laptop doesn't last very
long in an English train it will be
stolen and put an ebay but as a whole
extra story so when we look at the
Olympics desktop and we look at where
it's kind of going I think you can
identify success by breaking it down
into two areas okay the first one is
opportunity what opportunities do we
associate with it with the desktop what
opportunities are available where are
people the riding some kind of
opportunity what why are we interested
in this okay and when we think of the
success of the Linux desktop we
invariably think well you know what its
kind of businesses who who are
interested in success of the desktop but
it's not necessarily just businesses
because there's a few different areas so
businesses are obvious right they're
interested in limits on the tester
because it's better technology
it's a lower total cost of ownership you
know they basically want to get good
technology and it costs them nothing
that's their primary aim in life and
Linux is interesting because just that
the technology level a lot of people are
thinking well you know it can do this it
can do this can replace these parts of
our infrastructure its reliability has
been proven in many different areas and
other people have jumped before us so
we're starting to see more and more
interest from the business community in
terms of this and obviously we Linux has
got a very very close relationship to
the word free so people think well it's
obviously not going to be free but the
lower the total cost of ownership has
got to be lower just the theory behind
it seems that it's going to be lower so
businesses like the idea of it then we
look at developers now this room is full
of developers and of course one of the
main reasons why developers like it and
I've done some development I wouldn't
call myself a developer if you read my
code you wouldn't call me developer
either when you look at obviously from a
development perspective open source is
interesting cuz there's an intrinsic
development culture that everything is
about development it's all done out in
the open it's kind of like it's kind of
like the computer equivalent of nudism
you know everything's out there swinging
in the breeze you can see what's going
on it's all been openly developed on the
internet on mailing lists and all the
rest of it so from a development
perspective is pretty interesting and
developers I'm going to complain at lots
lots of code read on the internet and
lots of development tools out there to
maintain it and obviously from a
community perspective now how many
people here would say that they consider
themselves part of the open source
community so some of you are probably
Windows and Mac of people from a
community perspective we like the idea
of the Linux desktop because it just
feels right you know when we look at all
of the technical reasons and all the
cost reasons and all the all of these
are the bits and pieces when we look at
all of that and we can prove it and
we're happy that we've proven that we
sit back we think well in addition to
that it's just ethically right it's just
the right thing to do it's like
switching your lights off before you
leave your house for a week it's like
riding a bike to work instead of riding
a car to work it just feels like the
right thing to do so these are
there's a huge amount of opportunity out
there and that's the reason why people
are interested in the desktop with that
emotional connection that they've got
attached to it now of course we have
concerns as well so when we're talking
about the success of the lens desktop we
also have a bunch of concerns now if you
look at this in reverse order right you
can look at the community the community
generally doesn't really have concerns
that we buy into the idea of it nothing
new there so from a community
perspective it's pretty cool it feels
ethically right the technology's there
it's all good from a developer's
perspective invariably there's not that
much of an issue with it if you
invariably a lot of developers who don't
choose to use open-source development
tool so let's say you don't code in
Python or pearl or something like that
and you prefer dotnet and Microsoft's
incarnation of not not mono or you
prefer visual basic god forbid if that's
your perspective in very you don't think
the concept of an open-source desktop is
a bad thing but you just don't choose to
use that technology you know there's not
many technologies out there that people
fundamentally rat on with the possible
exception of haskell people just seem to
have it in for Haskell and fortune any
other anyone have any things that they
hate know this company really isn't evil
is it we don't have bad thoughts so
there are some consent that but the
concerns where the concerns generally
like our were these people this is the
Internet's representation of business
people in all of its politically correct
goodness okay business people do have
concerns about the bat about their
limits desktop because it's just a bit
weird I mean if you're a business you
understand software because what you do
is you go out you buy the software or
you buy a computer with a software on it
and it generally comes from a company
and that company makes that product and
they give it to you that's the way you
know economics works but of course with
the open-source thing there's all of
these you know there's the great and
washed out there who are writing all up
the software and so businesses don't
quite understand
how about work so there's there's a
concern there it's unproven you know
we're starting to see more and more take
up but it's it's not it feels different
for a lot of businesses I used to work
as a consultant and a lot of businesses
you could take it even though they could
justify all of the reasons why they
should be considering linux on the
desktop a lot of them was just like well
we understand it all makes sense but it
just feels a bit weird you know and so
these concerns happen and I suspect a
significant reason for this is because
of the community because businesses
think that you know is run by people
like this and these people Chen you know
they're trying to put communism in the
water you know that's a bad thing you
know this incident is my best friend so
uh he doesn't know it's in here it will
do and this is on the internet so f he
really is everything that is wrong with
the open source community so so
businesses had this if we if we look
where we are at the moment you know
businesses we suspect play a significant
role in the success of the desktop and
the businesses are then in turn a little
confused about the community side of
things but what it all boils down to is
this technology because when they get
back on the track they think will hang a
second let's look at the technology so
business things you know I've hearing
all about linux I'm hearing about a lot
of our open source why don't we perform
a bit of an investigation into the
technology identify whether it would be
worth as investing in this okay and it
doesn't take long before a business will
realize pretty much how things work I'm
sure this will be none of this will be
new to you guys but using the bunters as
an example because I'm unbelievably
biased disk obviously applies to any
Linux distribution what we do is we take
lots of open source software out there
which we refer to as up streams we take
those up streams and we package it
together into system that's easy to use
and easy to install I mean you can
literally take you can take an a bunch
of CD you can put it upside down in a
floppy disk drive and it will still
install it's that easy okay so this is
how it works we take upstream software
we package it together we make some
modifications we make it
we configure it and then we put it we
issue a CD or issue and I so much people
can burn in install so when their
business is looking into this and they
realize how this model works they then
look that's the solution but they then
look back some of the other things this
is what we need to ensure in whatever
swing stall on our computers we need to
make sure it's managed now this is the
most corporate slide in this slide deck
so I just ignore this for a second okay
I don't want your eyes to glaze over but
people look for managed soft it needs to
be managed needs you know a business is
looking for their system their software
solution to make they want it to be
managed by an organization I want to
make sure that product has a good
feature direction a good road map
regular regular releases security plate
all that kind of stuff they want it to
be reliable I want to make sure that
it's going to work it's not going to be
crashing all the time it's not going to
be susceptible to viruses all that kind
of stuff and of course that it's
sustained you don't want to buy a
product and then have it discontinued a
week later now typically businesses will
look to you know the people who make the
software for this so invariably with
Windows they look to Microsoft you know
so Microsoft are there to make sure that
the software is managed they're there to
make sure it's reliable Microsoft and
reliable don't go very well together in
a sentence I admit and then they look
for it to be sustained as well but the
thing is of course you know when they
look at the open source thing they're
like ah it's the community again keeps
coming back to this see words you know
and then they think well hang in a
second we know about the community
because that's the people who put the
communism in the water yeah and it all
boils back down to this so they can look
at the most incredible software solution
but invariably if they don't understand
this community aspect then it's going to
cause some concern and this is the
future than its desktop that we're
talking about the problem of course is
that businesses basically don't
understand community I mean I
I work full time with it with with an
open source community and I'm not going
to profess that I know everything about
it by any stretch because it's an
incredibly complicated set of variables
but if there's one thing I have
discovered is that it's amazing how much
people don't understand how people work
together in every step because on one
side you've got like theoretical types
who will talk about you know all of
these psychological and anthropological
theories behind how people talk to each
other you know using hand gestures and
weird noises right and then on the other
side you just got people who have no
idea don't really care how people work
together it just kind of works out and
socially annette people trying to figure
out how people are social with each
other is very difficult you know so
businesses are just as inept when it
comes to understand how people work
together so it's a big uns unknown and
it's not something a business can really
say okay I want you to I want I want to
budget this anthropological study into
how people work together so we can
figure out whether this software is
worth working it's worth installing and
using and one of the reasons for this is
that we in the open source world think
about cells has been the fine example of
community action you know thousands of
people around the world connected by the
network talking to each other working
together making software happen all this
kind of stuff but we're actually quite
dick that we're actually quite weird and
different because if you look at most
communities around games and do you know
DVDs and yet movies books music all of
these kinds of things that people flock
around they're typically consumers right
Trekkies are a great example of this
does anyone here like Star Trek keep
your hands up put your hand down if you
don't dress up
ah you dress up I just gave I gave this
talk the socal Linux expo and there was
about 500 people in the room whatever
the loads of people in this room and I
said the same thing I said how many
people here of Trekkies and I said does
anyone here actually dress up and this
one woman put her hand off and she said
to me I spoke to her afterwards and she
said that she thought loads of other
people were gonna put their hands up and
then she kind of looked round and she
was the Brit freaked out but she you
know she she was proud she's not
embarrassed and that's a good thing um
so yep so most communities that we
talked to are actually the user
communities that people who were
essentially fanboys and fangirls they
flock around something because they
enjoy it and they want to find other
people who also enjoy meeting of minds
was we're a little different we're
actually contributors we make software
we make stuff happen and this is the
fine example of it's happening with the
groupies which I have to say I've not
seen so this is from guate but we're a
contra beauty we make the software we
actually make it happen you know we we
produce things we don't just flock
around it and obviously there are lots a
big using a large cute user community
that uses open source but fundamentally
we actually make it so that makes it
even more fundamental because the
software the software that's been
delivered on in desktops and enterprise
systems around the world each one of us
is having an impact on um so when you
boil it down of course businesses they
depend on us we're important and they
should realize it businesses do depend
on us okay now if we check in with Chuck
Norris for a second because he is the
man who knows everything community is
important to desktop success this is
clear it's not just important to people
who buy into the community want to join
the community it's not just a case of if
you're a community person community is
important community is important to
everybody because it all boils down to
the fundamental level that upstream
software is packaged and delivered to
people and the people who make that
extreme software our community
so if we move on a little bit about half
of this room seemed to think that they
were it seems to say that there in the
open source world and use open source
software and the rest of it I'd like
that number of people for a second to
feel pretty smug okay feel nice and smug
and happy with yourselves right not only
cuz you work at Google that's a good
thing and everyone loves Google right
but feel smug because just think about
the success of open source in the last
10 years just think about how far it's
gone Yin is just normal people having a
huge impact on millions of people around
the world it's pretty cool when you
think about it it's pretty nice it's
pretty cool when you sit back and you
think wow you know this disconnected
group of people who would then get
connected can produce this worldwide
phenomenon it's pretty stunning but then
people then throw these kinds of figures
are you of how many people are actually
using it and you think I was feeling
pretty smug for a second there you know
I thought that we were starting to
really kick ass around the world and
then people say well you know less than
a percent or less than two percent of
the the IT world are actually using
linux on desktops and servers and
whatnot and at that point we we
generally fall into a pit of depression
and drink a lot of tequila you know
because that solves all of your problems
it does but when we look at this figure
it doesn't really matter because a it's
wrong and be it doesn't really matter
because the reason why it's wrong is
with openly distributed software you
cannot figure out how many people are
using it it's just impossible and you
the best job that you've got is
employing people too who think they know
what they're talking about to advise and
how many people are using the desktop
these people have caused called analysts
you know so they basically develop these
research studies and they just ate
advise and how many people using the
software but there's no way of
determining that I mean people come up
to me all the time and say how many
people using Ubuntu and I say to them I
don't really know I I couldn't give you
any firm
I've got a guess but I couldn't tell you
and they're convinced that canonical we
have some kind of secret system that we
can use to count people as if everyone
who downloads a copy of ubuntu is micro
chipped or something you know we have no
idea because i could give this chap a CD
and he could of course give it to all of
you guys and you could never connect to
a network and so you know that banishes
the idea of it syncing with a with a
server or something to register a user
there's just no waivers determinate and
that's where it so that figure if I
think you have to take with a pinch of
salt but the other thing is that that
figure is not important how many people
are actually using the software the most
important thing that we have right now
is mine share everybody is raving about
open source everybody is raving about
Linux ok mindshare is critical because
when people are always hearing about
something they'll invariably say well I
keep hearing about this thing so
therefore I should really check it out I
mean look at facebook you know nobody
really use Facebook that much apart from
kids and then everybody started getting
facebook accounts and all of your
friends and had a facebook account and
then your mum had a facebook account and
then your grandma had a facebook account
and that's when it freaked you out a
little bit so you thought well if my
Gran's got a facebook account I really
need to get one and then you then your
gran friends you your grand should never
friend you that's wrong on so many
levels right so mine share is is it
defines success it doesn't necessarily
define usable success but it defines a
reasonable amount of success so people
get the mindshare and then they cling on
to and that's when they start the start
checking into stuff a lot of businesses
out there a lot of universities will
have said I've heard about this Linux
thing I you know a lot of people seem to
be talking about it I read a lot about
in the press or on the Internet
therefore I should really check into it
because that any responsible
professional would do that and check
check up and come in technology not as
interesting is when you look at
mindshare because we have google trends
right Google
does anyone here work on google trends
because i want to buy people who work in
google trends a pint it's just nice
google trends is awesome I'm sure you're
all familiar with it but basically you
can type in a couple of different terms
and then it will show you the number of
searches essentially that have happened
on Google because of course Google is
the is the way of defining what
humankind is thinking right now and
what's interesting about this is that it
seems like fewer and fewer people are
searching for linux and more and more
people are searching for brands of
distributions like a bun too so we're
seeing life heading towards more of a
brand kind of way of doing things and
you know what the reason why I like
Google Trends is that finally once and
for all Google of solve what I consider
one of the most important challenges
that mang and womankind has ever faced
ever right Google Trends to solve this
problem elegantly and efficiently
because Google Trends finally once and
for all categorically states dogs are
better than cats I cannot stand cats
right arrogant annoying animals that
they are that demand a door to be built
in your hair some really they're just
crazy so Google Trends we can believe
everything so because Google Trends has
proven this therefore we can see that
the trend you know the trend towards
brands is is it's pretty accurate and so
therefore there's more of Reliance some
people like this on these these these
these particular brands you can broadly
divide the popular Linux distribution
model into these three that are that
have a commercial counterparts so I'm
excluding debian and slackware and Jen
to hear the bun to obviously has
canonical as a counterpart Red Hat is
red hat and they have Fedora as they're
destroyed and opensuse has nouvelle and
Microsoft as their counterpart
so you know we can see we can see these
these different distros have these these
companies attached as well so what this
in turn means is that these companies
have a responsibility towards this
community they have a responsibility to
foster in and grow in the community and
unfortunately tradition if you look back
at the open-source timeline the the way
companies have interacted with community
has sometimes been less than stellar
such shall we say some companies have
not really encouraged community they've
merely tolerated it they've just kind of
dealt with it and so said you know those
kind of weird people over there who are
in the community we'll just keep them at
arm's length and make sure that they're
happy because it'd be a PR disaster if
they weren't happy but we don't really
want to engage with them that much when
I keep them at arm's length and then
some of these companies realized that
that's just a disastrous thing to do in
the open source world so they started
engaging more and more and more and I'm
pleased to see that certainly all of the
major distros are engaging with the open
source community intrinsically so mr.
Norris makes it very abundantly clear to
us that distributors are important to
desktop success it's not just the
community but distributors play a key
role in that as well and it's it's
therefore integral that these
distributors have their own
responsibility and on whether they're
moving forward so the community can make
the error the desktop happen we we joke
about the desktop being pointless and
useless but the community really is
intrinsic you making that happen it's
not just these businesses buying the
desktop that is going to make it happen
it's not just oam deals and all that
kind of so they play a part but it's not
just them and I think what's always
useful how many people put your hand up
if you are part of an open source
project so you contribute to I'm all
right thinking you contribute to open
source projects right you contribute
open source code and that code lives
outside Google yeah
so you're not just writing this code
because you're a Google employee you're
interested in it Europe as well as a
hobby right it's always useful to sit
down and think well how does that
community that I'm a part of how does it
work and how can I make sure it works
efficiently and it's interesting to
sometimes sit down and think well how
can I improve my own interaction and the
interactions of my peers to make the
most of that of that community and when
you do this it's it's always important
to separate out domain knowledge it's
interesting when you talk to people who
aren't in the open source community
about how they solve certain problems
because a lot of the assumptions that we
make don't exist so for example if
something goes wrong in an open-source
application the perceived wisdom is that
what you do is you file a bug pretty
much most people say the best thing to
do to be a good citizen as you file a
bug and that assumes a lot of things
that first of all assumes you know what
bug is that also assumes that you know
that we have open bug trackers I mean if
something breaks in Microsoft in a
Microsoft product or something breaks in
Apple in an apple product generally you
think to sell well that's someone else's
problem I'll just wait until it gets
fixed and then someone else will have
discovered that problem and sorted out
because I'm certainly unaware of any
public bug tracker that you can reliably
go to report the bug and get an update
on the progress of that bug being fixed
whereas of course in the open source
world all of this stuff lives on the
internet so we kind of assume that this
kind of thing happens we've seen when we
talk to other people other other
developers who might not necessarily be
in the open source world that they know
that public bug trackers exist so
separate out the domain knowledge and
one person is really really good at this
is linh a store valves I'm sure pretty
much all of you know he's the guy who
started that linux kernel lynus is
incredible on so many levels I'm a huge
fan of him because not only is he
incredibly smart as an excellent
developer
I'm also a big fan of him because he's
very very very funny and has got an
incredibly cynical wit about him which
in itself is a good thing being English
because we're pretty cynical people as
well but the thing as well is that he
really he really is a balanced down to
earth human being which i think is
important as well he he really takes a
pretty a pretty moderate stance on on
various aspects I love that you can see
this in this photo if you look at the
top right corner you can see this guy
sticking some fingers behind some of the
guy's head I mean linis approved this
photo with him stood there looking all
Tom Cruise like and there's our soul in
the background kind of sticking the
fingers up you know I mean huge amount
respectful in us now he wrote this book
anyone read this no this is an excellent
book so you wrote this book with David
diamond to i'm reliably assured from
extensive research is not related to
Neil Diamond and this book basically
talks about his life where he came from
and you know how he got into limit how
he got into software development and how
he made linux on the rest of it and in
this book he talks about his theory of
the meaning of life and it's very funny
and he basically says it well you know
you need to kind of satisfy some core
aspects of your life and then you can
then move on to other things so you
might start out by making sure you've
got basic sort of needs covered like
food and all that kind of stuff and then
you want to make sure that you have a
social element to your life and then you
can really start achieving bits and
pieces and what he actually did with
this is he ripped off this anyone know
what this is Maslow you probably studied
this at school we studied at school in
England this is Maslow's hierarchy of
needs now I'm not going to get to
theoretical because it would bore all of
us Maslow's hierarchy of needs basically
state shows you call most basic needs at
the bottom and then as you build and
satisfy each of these needs it shows you
the other typical things that people
want and Maslow sat down and tried to
think about and distill human needs into
this triangle
and so I'm going to have a quick look
through this because this can offer some
interesting insight into how we can work
with communities so right at the bottom
you've got the most basic stuff this is
you know this is the rubber on a car
kind of stuff you know you've got food
and water and shelter clothing you don't
see many successful open source
developers out in the world naked cold
you know hungry thirsty these people
generally don't exist I mean you need
these basic things to function and then
of course once you've got this once
you've got these basic elements you're
basically someone who can live actually
physically survive in the world so the
next thing you can start building on is
security you need to have you need to
feel secure in your surroundings and
it's disturbing how many people in the
world don't have this you know there's a
lot of people millions of people around
the world who don't have this most basic
of needs tutor invariably political
fighting and war and famine and stuff
like that okay so see once you once
you've got the basics for life and you
fill in a safe area and we can then
start looking at some of the real things
that we can harness in the open source
will love and belonging I can see people
can scared already at me using the word
love because we're all fear fearful of
commitment I don't want to send this
into a Barry White kind of music video
but nice people have people have you
know people in any community you have
people care about each other I've been
in the open source community like say
for about 10 years and there's a number
of people are consider very very close
friends in that community who I don't
just you know not just because I like to
work with them and I can talk with them
about technology but they're my friends
and as my friends I care about them and
I want to make sure that they're all
right and it's reciprocal and this
happens all over the world no people do
genuinely care about each other and when
you join a community and people you feel
like someone's got you back you know you
feel like someone's looking out for you
that's an incredibly worthwhile feeling
to have
and that's something that we invariably
lack in our local communities more and
more when people don't know their
neighbors and things like that whereas
we're all connected to the Internet and
we can share a sense of that so once
you've got that people start start
beginning to feel fuzzy and that's what
we want the success in community is
feeling fuzzy ok so then we'll go to the
next level now this is really where I
think when you've got really good
community people and I'm excluding of
course any technical ability here right
if you this assumes someone who's good
at what they do real community success
is when people feel itself as a sense of
self-esteem and when people feel well
respected by other people okay if you
feel pretty damn cool pretty damn good
at what you're doing and you feel that
other people think you're pretty damn
good and pretty damn cool then that is
an incredible feeling okay and that's
what people who are you get involved in
communities that's what will drive a lot
of them now Maslow kind of I think he
took some drugs or something because we
then get to this next couple of levels
and at this point it kind of it gets
pretty hand wavy because if you get
above that then you talk about
experiencing purpose and meaning and
realizing all in their potentials and
all this kind of stuff you know and also
you know the need for self-actualization
and there's basically two people who X
or two types of people who experience
this one is Buddhists who seem really
good at this kind of stuff and the other
is assholes people who disappear of
their own ass this is a problem if you
want a a detailed definition of an hour
I suggest you look at bono on Wikipedia
lots of content there so Maslow talks
about things that are relevant
fundamentally to individuals but that
doesn't really talk about groups because
of course you take a bunch of groups you
put them to give individuals you put
them together into a group and that
makes a community and there's all kinds
of other stuff associated with that
expectations an opportune
at ease responsibilities growth risks
all this kind of stuff and I'm not going
to talk about that because I did use the
last presentation I took around the
place is called how to herd cats and
influence people and that basically
talks about some of these elements so
check that out on youtube but
fundamentally when you put people
together in a community and they start
working together there's a whole group
dynamic that's built on top of those
individual dynamics and anyone who
claims they know how that works is a
liar because nobody knows how it works
we've all got theories but nobody
fundamentally knows how people work
together it's just impossible to gauge
um so earlier on I was talking about
these two things community is important
and distributors are important you know
we've got if you look at where we stand
we think okay we want success in the
desktop and we typically think well a
significant proportion of that success
is going to be businesses and
organizations making use of it they then
see that it has this upstream model
where upstream software is then packaged
and released but then they look at the
upstream soft when they realized that
that's all community that's generally
driving a lot of that so we can see how
community and distributors then play a
pretty critical role in them and when
you think about how to improve how we
work at a community level I'm going to
look at both of these at a community
level it's all basically boils down to
working together now each of you people
who works in an open source project if
you stand back and think to yourself how
can I improve how I work with other
people and this can be really really
basic things like just thinking just
being nicer to people you know not you
know when somebody say something you
disagree with not feeling an
unbelievable urge to troll them you know
little things like this can really help
a community because we all know what
it's like somebody say something that is
idiotic 2.0 and you think to yourself I
need I need to pick them up on this you
know it's for their own welfare I need
to help them and
well that can actually causes discontent
in that community and sometimes people
feel like that they're doing something
in the best interest of the community
but then it causes a flame war and flame
wars have no benefit to anybody because
that the original pit participants they
never agree they just find themselves
even more defined it divided and the
rest of the community who sits by and
watches and doesn't participate because
they don't want to get their fingers eat
enough they just feel more insecure
because remember the fundamental thing
and arm as low is feeling security that
doesn't just apply to your physical
surroundings but that applies to your
community as well so I recommend as if
something we can all do just sit down
for five minutes doesn't matter where
you are in the shower or wherever you
tend to think and there's no
distractions sit down and think about
how you interact with people just sit
down and think you know how was I today
think they could take a day and think on
this particular day how did I interact
with these people could I have maybe
been a bit and reasonable with someone
or could I have maybe help someone more
or am i doing a really good job and
should i therefore help other people to
understand how to do that really good
job think pretty objectively think about
how other people would assess you like
if imagine having a performance review
you know those kinds of things can
really help because really subtle
changes can can significantly affect how
a local how a community project can run
and that of course propagates up to the
wider picture but i also want to talk a
little bit about something which i
believe is a significant threat um a
significant threat to the open source
community and that's the vocal minority
now I'm not saying I'm not accusing any
specific molarity of this what I'm
talking about pit here is people who
have a particular perspective on
something and do everything in their
power to ram it down your throat this
can apply to lots of different areas and
there's the reason why I think this is
the threat is that people get very very
emotionally connected to open source
software because we all feel we're on an
ethical crusade and we're marching
forward
army united by a consistent vision to
spread free software around the world
and consequently people get very very
passionate about that they live and they
breathe it literally live and they
breathe it so consequently when they
find people who they may deem as
unbelievers it's time to chop them off
at the knees and the thing that concerns
me about this is that I know a number of
people in the open source world who have
left the open source community because
of these people doing this it's one
thing to have very very strong views and
to debate them effectively it's one
thing to stand in a room and really take
a different perspective than somebody
else and to debate it but it's when this
when it's an unrelenting force that
never leaves that personal loan that's
when it's disruptive and it basically
boils down to bullying and unfortunately
there's some people in the scheme in our
community who I am taking a very strong
ethical stance when it comes to freedom
who believe that everything on a machine
everything on a computer should be a
hundred percent free and if you have a
kernel and there are some binary blobs
in that Colonel then you're evil you
know everything about you is wrong and
all of your children will be wrong as
well and it's like the problem with this
perspective in my mind is that it's fine
to go up and say you know in the
interest of software freedom i recommend
you know you don't use this binary blob
they backed the binary botanist kernel
or you know have you tried this free
operating system let's say a new sense
or something like that that's great but
it's when it's an unrelenting force it
can actually be very very disruptive and
it's it's it's always difficult because
the people who are typically very very
passionate about this they're doing it
in the interest of software freedom but
it doesn't benefit anybody's interested
software freedom when when developers
are driven away so when thinking about
how we approach debates as well think
about how this it can impact other
people because people who get very very
strongly invested in the debate we're
not all we don't all have the same
thickness of skin
you know in every single one of us
myself included will have bad days and
sometimes you'll feel like the world is
tramping on your shoulders and that can
make people lose the faith a little bit
and that can drive good people away so
it would be wrong of me to continue
without talking about Ubuntu anyone use
a pontiff a lots of Monte people a Bundy
has been an interesting ride and it's
been fun to be part of that right and in
the bunch of community were all really
proud of the success but we're also
really really really keen to move
forward and really try and achieve in
other areas as well and and really push
it forward and when i joined canonical
about a year and a half ago to be the
Ubuntu community manager and the basic
aim of the job is to is to is to enable
the community to do stuff effectively
and efficiently it's not about me
telling people what to do and it's not
about me taking credit for the success
of the community it's about trying to
enable other people to do things you
might have three or four different teams
who work together helping those teams to
work together figuring out things woke
and avoid bottlenecks and disagreements
and things like that luckily I work with
a pretty smart group of people and from
talking to them and evaluating well can
move forward I thought it's important to
sit down and define a mission about what
to do and this is my approximate mission
I want to produce the reference
implementation of free software
community done right I want people to
look at the Ubuntu community and say you
know what those guys they really do it
right they you know they get the picture
they understand how to do it they can
keep people motivated and interested and
excited and produce really cool stuff so
when other people are building new
communities and other distributions and
other companies and whatever they can
say you know if we're going to do it we
should do the weather you Bunty people
did it that's that's the broad goal and
we're a twix you know I think we're
doing reasonably well there but there's
still a long road to travel luckily on
Road I have a couple of cohorts who work
for me at canonical first one is this
guy this my friends is the future of the
open source Ubuntu development community
he does actually like walking around
with the flower in his ear as well and
wearing ridiculous sunglasses this is
daniel holdback he lives in in berlin
and he runs the he basically encourages
more and more developers to join up with
a bunt too so does anybody here do any
packaging yeah is it debian packaging so
packaging is a really really great way a
really great way to contribute to a
distribution and we're spending an awful
lot of time and effort on encouraging
more and more people to come and join up
with a bun to do and do packaging so one
thing we've announced recently is we're
doing and a bunt to develop a week
pretty soon and it's a bunch of IRC
tuition sessions where people can go and
learn about different aspects of
packaging how to patch packages how to
package libraries packaging Python
getting involved in the community
security updates all this kind of stuff
so if you're interested in packaging
he's the man to talk to I'll talk about
that in a second as well then the other
guy is this man this is jorge castro and
George works with upstream relations so
he works with he works with upstream
projects so we can try and make sure
that Ubuntu are not between projects are
working well together working
efficiently together in both sides of
the at the bridge again a mutual benefit
from that and George is doing an
excellent job and then I run the team
and as part of my work with the team I
try to define some strategy about where
we move forward and the kind of
community that we want to build and
understanding the different elements the
community and how they fit together
coming up with some schemes of how we
can achieve growth and make sure people
are reporting stuff effectively on that
kind of stuff and when building an open
source museum when you've got a lot of
people in that community it's always a
good idea to kind of figure out the core
things that you want to maintain because
when confronted with a huge jigsaw
puzzle can be very very difficult to see
the big pic
because you can really get engulfed in
the detail and the most important thing
is that it's inclusive we every open
source community has to feel like anyone
can join if they're good because we're a
meritocracy and everybody should feel
everybody should feel that if they join
that community and they're good though
they will move forward that they will be
appreciated and there's way too much
division in in some communities where
and this is something that I know a lot
of women have suffered from where women
have joined an open source community and
not felt inclusive because of prejudice
against women in technical positions and
this kind of stuff and it's just insane
so this isn't just a case of ensuring
that we encourage all people into a
community this is this is at a social
level as well but the other thing is
making sure everyone can have an impact
if somebody joins a community and they
do something they need to feel like
they're something had an impact on the
bigger picture if someone joins the
Bundy community to make packages they
need to feel that the work that they've
done will benefit the wider community
and if they don't feel that because
they've got to jumped through too many
hoops or what now they'll get bored and
they'll leave and we've all seen people
join projects and say yeah yeah I really
want to help this would be brilliant I'm
really psyched up and motivated and then
they they make they do a couple of
things and you know they might write
Apache then gets attached to a bug in
bugzilla or launch pad and then they
think well you know it took a while for
that patch to be reviewed and then yeah
it was applied but by the time was
applied you know my interest was waning
and you know I adil I was working late
nights I didn't really have much time
and my wife went to bingo one night and
you know I thought I had time there but
I had to clean the dishes or whatever
you know people find excuses or as if
you if someone joins up community they
do something and they do something
interesting and then it gets it gets
published it gets utilized in
immediately the light wow I joined up
and within next to no time I was doing
stuff that helps everybody so it's
important that we have a turnaround to
make sure everyone can feel like they're
having a naps
impact and stuff and the only way you
can you can make an impact and make
people haven't it feel like they can
have an impact is if they feel the
community is their own if you feel like
the community is run by someone else
particularly a company you can kind of
feel like it doesn't really feel like a
community you know there's a lot there's
some companies out there who will
profess to have a community but it's
actually just cheap labor you know it's
people joined up and helping out but
it's very much on the terms of a
commercial organization and these
companies have generally failed at this
approach and consequently we see more
and more companies doing it the right
way but to make sure that people feel it
is their own you need to make sure it's
properly governed and governance is a
really really difficult balance to get
because when you've got you know a
hundred thousand people who each one
have an impact you've got a hundred
thousand different perspectives and how
it should be run so the first thing we
have in the ubuntu world is a code of
conduct and this code of conduct
basically says be excellent to each
other make sure that when you do stuff
it pretty it pretty much works out we
have membership processes you know we
make sure that people can join up they
can people can join up they can join
that community so long as they they can
demonstrate sustained and reliable
contributions they can be a member of
the Ubuntu community and then we have
like these other governing councils we
have the community council which is
right at the top there's the majority of
that council has people who don't work
at canonical so it feels properly open
we have the technical board that decides
what goes in there and anybody who's
good can apply to be on the technical
board and then we have team councils
that the governing in these other
different areas such as IRC and forums
and things like that and the thing is we
loads of teams I did this presentation
what a presentation once and i got a
list of all of the above teams in the
world and put them next to each other
and the text was really really small
because there's hundreds of teams and
lots and lots of people can join the
project in different ways and par the
reason for this is
versity I mean you want diversity so we
have different derivative distributions
does anyone here use like kubuntu or add
you go to something like that which one
to use ubuntu yeah because people want
to be able to a lot of people want to
take the ethos behind a bun to and much
of the technology and then just roll
their own and we've got I mean this is
just a small smattering of some of the
derivatives but we've there's loads of
these derivatives out there and it's
great and in the Bundy community we love
the idea of that because much of the
core aspects of the system is actually
the same it's just people layer on
different chunks so it's a very very
diverse community so I just want to talk
about two things before I wrap up two
areas which I think of a particular
interest in committee right now first
one is packaging you mentioned you do
taan some packaging this is a really
really great way to get involved and
this is something that we're we're
actively keen to recruit as new packages
and basically it's taking up streaming
software and making it easy to install
on an a bunch of system so we have main
which is our main repository which has
the stuff that's on the disk generally
lives in May and then we also have
another repository called universe which
is basically debian that's been built
against the bunt too so we have universe
and the people who look after universe
are the masters of the universe we call
them mo two masters of the universe and
we're old big he-man fans you know the
council looks at Erick we call it
council graceful you know it goes to a
very very deep level but universe is not
only a means of looking after universe
but it's also means it's the sandbox in
which people get started so people join
if you join mo to that you can read the
packaging guide it tells you how to make
a package how to attach that package to
a bug in the sponsorship q so someone
can review it and assess how good the
packages people can give you feedback
there's resources there there's regular
tutorials there's regular Q&amp;amp;A is there's
events there's things like the bunt to
develop a week there's local events that
lugs like packaging jams that we're
running there's lots and lots of
resources out there for people to get
involved so people think people
invariably if you're interested in
packaging join moto and there's lots of
resources there to get involved so this
is the address for it if you
if you can't remember that you can't
write it down then feel free to email me
at John levon to calm and I can point in
the right direction I'll come and talk
to mean the end of this presentation but
motu if you're if you're interested in
helping ubuntu and contributing to a
buncha this is an excellent excellent
means of getting of moving on the other
thing is locos these are local user
groups we have over six hundred and
sixty of them all around the world
there's a californian team that just
represented the bun to its scale and
these people are just going out there
and spreading the love and this huge
community all over the world are doing
some excellent work with this and a good
example of this was in the US the US was
a bit like Where's Waldo you couldn't
find any teams everywhere in the world
apart from Africa had teams coming out
their ears but for some reason in the
u.s. there was no teams and we just
could not figure out why so we spent
some some some efforts and talking to
some prominent us people and they set
the audacious goal of having a team in
every state in the US by the end of 2007
and this is the map at the moment so
they've all it all the states that a
yellow have got teams in them the ones
that are green are particularly good
teams that we call a proof teams so the
that just shows the progress that
they're made in about eight months it's
it's absolutely stunning the the the the
user groups are run around the world and
these people get out and they advocate
the use of ubuntu and things like that
so wrapping up the moral of this story
is when you're sat in front of your
computer and it's one o'clock in the
morning and you've watched all the
youtube videos there are two watch
you've added all of your friends on
facebook and you're thinking yourself i
don't want to go to bed yet because i'm
a nerd and I can't go to bed before the
Sun starts rising you think I want to
contribute in some way when you think
the success you know the math success of
death of the Linux desktop is something
that other people have an impact on
don't remember how it all percolates
together upstream software gets packaged
businesses by that software businesses
invest in that software that software is
made by us therefore we have an absolute
impact on how
and I think if we if we all take
ourselves a little bit more seriously in
this regard then we can make the desktop
happen a lot quicker thanks very much
