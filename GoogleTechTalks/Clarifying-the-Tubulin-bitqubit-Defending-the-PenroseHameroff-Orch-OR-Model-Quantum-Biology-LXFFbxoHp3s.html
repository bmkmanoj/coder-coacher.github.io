University of Arizona he is going to
talk about clarifying the tubulin bit
qubit and then five minutes on defending
the Penrose Hameroff or our model thank
you very much thank you all for being
here Thank You Hartmut and Google for
hosting us and y'all for coming the
title of my talk is clarifying the
tubulin bit qubit defending the Penrose
hammer of orko our model of quantum
computation and microtubules Travis
Craddock and jak2 since Kerr my
co-authors and and Jack is here Penrose
M Roth or Co are orchestrated objective
reduction is a theory of consciousness
based on quantum micro quantum
computations in microtubules Oh are as
pen rose's mechanism for self collapse
of the wavefunction orcas orcas
orchestration which is my biological
contribution how this could happen and
both be isolated and interacting
environment but I'm not going to talk
about that specifically first I'm going
to give you a little bit of an overview
about microtubules we've heard quite a
bit about some of the technical aspects
but I want to kind of back up and give
you the big picture a little bit
consider a single-cell Paramecium which
can swim around avoid obstacles avoid
predators find food learn if you suck it
into a capillary tube it escapes if you
do it again escapes more quickly it can
find a mate and you can have sex this is
actually a picture of two Paramecium
having sex it's probably the only
x-rated picture we'll see you today and
it doesn't have any synapses it doesn't
have any nervous system per se how does
it do it it uses structures called
microtubules and I often kid my AI
friends they should worry about
simulating a Paramecium before worrying
about a brain so microtubules seem to be
the nervous system of the cell and
here's a beautiful immunofluorescence
micrograph of a double nucleated cell
the yellow as the microtubules the red
is the actin and the microtubules form
the kind of cytoskeletal architecture
and bone like support but we also think
they're the cells on board computer in
cell division micro microtubules are in
the red the chromosomes are in the blue
and yellow our centrioles which anchor
the mitotic spindles of microtubules and
organized mitosis and if this goes wrong
you can get cancer because you get an
abnormal genotype and the mechanism of
this is still poorly understood the
centrioles are made up of nine Triplets
of microtubules so each of these would
be a microtubule or part of a
microtubule and you get nine of these
and forms a mega cylinder and this is
the same structure also found in cilia
the appendages that come out the end of
the Paramecium and we also have them in
our body and they're found in the retina
of the eye and they're found all over
the place and in cell division
centrioles have two of these barrells in
this odd perpendicular arrangement they
each replicate and separate and the
mitotic spindles anchored to them and
pull apart the chromosomes it's
interesting there are also optical
optically sensitive Albrecht Durer who
was mentioned earlier shown that these
centrioles detect photons and orient the
cell in a particular direction towards
towards the light and it's interesting
that they're there their shape and their
geometry their dimensions are could
accommodate photons and they could be
some kind of quantum optical devices or
at least optical resonators of some sort
I just want to mention that I'm not
going to talk about a per se so inside
neurons microtubules and dendrites are
found in this interrupted type of
networked inner corrected interconnected
by microtubule associated proteins so
they form a sort of network and we think
a computational network inside cells
inside neurons of a neural network so
it's kind of a fractal sub dimension
inside neurons now if your microtubules
go bad you get Alzheimer's disease
there's actually two lesions and
Alzheimer's amyloid plaques which get
for some reason get most of the money
and research but the real damage is done
by neurofibrillary tangles inside the
neurons which are due to tau proteins
which normally here it says stabilize
microtubules with you other things as
well when they get all screwed up the
microtubule just disintegrates that the
talget is hyper phosphorylated in the
microtubule disintegrates literally you
get the kind of crinkly neuron and you
lose cognitive memory and eventually
consciousness so Alzheimer's is a
disease of microtubules here's a
close-up of disintegrating microchip now
the tau protein will just thoughts
previously just kind of hold the
microtubules together turns out that it
does something more it acts as a kind of
a traffic signal for motor proteins
which transports synaptic materials so
if a synapse down downstream in a
dendrite say needs a particular enzyme
or precursor or receptor it's often
synthesized more approximately and
transported by these motor proteins
which carry it along as cargo and they
often have to jump tracks and switch
microtubules and in the branching
dendrite and it's been a mystery how
they seem to know where to go it turns
out the Tau at specific locations on the
microtubule the kind of traffic signals
and tell particular proteins like like
this guy right here where to jump off
and so their placement is critical now
how do they know where to where to be is
there some are they that's martyrs or
some kind of encoding in the microtubule
itself so I'm going to briefly talk
about a little bit about memory some
recent evidence about memory that
travels kradic jekt ocinski and i have
done what in long-term potentiation
calcium comes in through the cell and
activates cam k to calcium calmodulin
kinase 2 which then rapidly in learning
rapidly distributes throughout dendrites
and actually throughout many parts of
the neuron or groups of neurons quite
rapidly and they're associated with
microtubules and somehow and they
phosphorylate something in the cell
which stores memory now synapses are
credited with with memory but synapse
the proteins of synapses are very
transient last hours two days but
memories can last a lifetime
so the question is where memories may be
stored and the camp k2 is a very
interesting molecule it's a snowflake
shape holoenzyme which when activated
and phosphorylated by calcium coming in
transforms into this sort of insect like
nano poodle we like to call it with with
six legs extending up and
six legs extending down each of which
can phosphorylate a substrate so the
question is what's the target for
phosphorylation which memory can be
stored well being microtubule fanatics
we thought it might have something to do
with microtubules and so here's a
microtubule with two different scales
the microtubules in the close-up of the
tubulin subunits showing the
phosphorylation sites on tubulin with
the c-terminal tails and and so the
question is how did the camp k2 relate
to this microtubule and it turns out it
matches perfectly here's the camp k2
here with the top set of legs taken off
and you over line the a lattice and B
lettuce and Anna bond talked about the
different different lattices you can see
here that they match up perfectly so
each of these legs can either
phosphorylate a substrate or not
therefore it conveys a bit of
information and six bits on a an ordered
array of bits is a byte so basically the
idea is that each of these is can convey
a byte of information on to the on to
the tubulin lattice and sure enough with
a little flexibility in these extenders
the nano poodle can deposit information
on the microtubule and perhaps move
march along it by hydrophobic
interactions and can convey synaptic
information to the microtubule and hear
mechanisms that at the level of
individual amino acids where the
phosphorylation can occur either through
the c-terminal tails or by a different
mechanism so basically we show the
possibility for memory storage in
microtubules via a calcium induced
phosphorylation of km k2 which then
deposits the information for long-term
storage storage on microtubules and
depending on a couple of factors a
ladder's versus B lattice and whether
alpha and beta can be can be
phosphorylated the number of bits per
byte for cam k2 in this case is 2 to the
6 of 64 in this case it's about 429 in
this case it's 5000 281 just from one
cam k2 so the amount of information
capacity in
in conveyed through synaptic
interactions camp get you on
microtubules is enormous and the the
number of the amount of information
storage capacity in a microtubule even
in one neuron is enormous
so that suggests that microtubules of
good information processors and many of
us have thought this for a very long
time and on the left you see a picture
of a microtubule with its subunit
proteins tubulin which can switch
between two states and possibly also a
superposition of both states a quantum
bit or qubit I got interested in
microtubules in 1972 when I was in in
medical school and worked for about
twenty years on the idea that they
process information strictly classically
and develop did a molecular automaton
models well the number of physicists met
jack along the way Steen Rasmussen in
Los Alamos and others modeling them as
sort of the game of life this cellular
automata shown here based on dipole
interactions between the tubulin and
show that with some basic assumption
using Froelich oscillations as a
clocking mechanism that microtubules
could process information and in
principle based on a few assumptions
were very efficient computational
devices for both storage and processing
of the information and here just shows a
sequence initially we thought the the
clocking sequence was Froelich gigahertz
but the recent information were
perfectly happy with eight megahertz
clocking that that jury Pokorny has
discovered an honor bond has been
talking about so each of these steps
could be could be occurring at eight
megahertz and by us sort of a cellular
or molecular automata type of mechanism
but so far this is strictly classical
now in the late 80s somebody said to me
ok let's say you're right how would that
explain consciousness and I had to admit
they were right I didn't really know
fortunately I read Roger Penrose his
book the emperor's new mind where he had
a mechanism for consciousness based on
quantum computation but he didn't have a
good qubit in the brain so I suggested
microtubules were his quantum computers
and tubulin with the quantum bits and he
agreed he liked the geometry the
microtubules and we developed this the
model in the in the early mid 90s and it
was almost immediately attacked by a
number of people for various reasons it
was it's threatening to many people for
different reasons so the basic idea is
that in a
microtubule each tubulin can be a
quantum be a qubit so it can be in two
states in a superposition of both states
and consciousness occurs because there's
a superposition it reaches threshold for
Penrose objective reduction and
consciousness occurs here involving you
know built hundreds of billions of these
so I'm not going to really talk about
consciousness per se but just about
fundamentals of how individual tubulins
can switch and we also suggested that
quantum states can can tunnel between
neurons through gap junctions which it
turns out that gap junctions mediate
gamma synchrony which is a neural
correlate of consciousness so we were
attacked as I said almost immediately
and by philosophers and physicists and
so forth that nothing too serious and
then in 2010 mark max tegmark came try
to prove the obvious the brain is too
warm and wet for delicate quantum
effects and had this equation for the
decoherence time and published it in
phys ravi and then a year later jack and
and scott Hagen and I published used his
own decoherence formula corrupted for
some of his errors in terms of how he
characterized our our model in other for
one example he had superposition of a
soliton separated from itself by 24
nanometers where our superposition
separation was the fermi length the the
diameter of an atomic nucleus so that
alone whereas so he calculated
decoherence time of 10 to minus 13
seconds that alone saved us seven orders
of magnitude then with a couple other
Corrections we got down and a reasonable
reasonable for the Oracle our model of
of hundreds of milliseconds again this
is all theory but it but we use his
encountered his theory and more recent
findings of quantum coherence in biology
is supporting this at least in a general
way okay so more recently a group of
Australian biophysicist physicists
chemists actually a very impressive
group if you look at their credentials
published a series at least two so
maybe more attacking us and the in two
papers one in phys Rev II and the other
in PNAS pretty good journals and the
first one the one addressed first
machemer should all at the title was
Penrose Hameroff orchestrate objective
reduction proposal for human
consciousness is not biologically
feasible well that's pretty pretty harsh
and they also said in the abstract that
not only is it is it not feasible it
couldn't be fixed by any conceivable
modification so I don't know if they're
psychic or just you know dancing in our
grave or what the other paper which
actually came first weak strong and
coherent regimes of fröhlich
condensation and their applications to
terahertz medicine and quantum
consciousness challenges also on the
basis of the fröhlich condensation that
that jury Pokorny was talking about so
objection number one I'm going to take
the McCamish a tall paper first they
started out by saying which is true the
orco are asserts that tubulin states are
regulated by London force dipoles van
der waals London force dipoles in
hydrophobic pockets within each tubulin
so I want to take a minute and explain
how about hydrophobic pockets luca was
talking about non polar regions in in
the in the gaba receptor and Elizabeth
was talking about London forces or van
der Waals forces so when a protein folds
here's a simple protein and the nonpolar
groups like oiled oral escaping water
coalesce and they don't have to be all
these aromatic groups it can be any
nonpolar group forming a hydrophobic
pocket shielded from from water so when
you when they say the brain is too warm
wet and noisy it's not really wet in the
in the hydrophobic pockets because water
is excluded so hydrophobic pockets are
water excluding regions inside proteins
consisting of nonpolar groups such as
aromatic amino acids phenylalanine
tryptophan and so forth and if if you
look if you think about this this
nonpolar solubility region it's a very
small portion of the body
actually this you can think of this
triangle as a body ground up and then
distributed in terms of solubility
spaces and different solubility spaces
and you can see where different solvents
will dissolve and as an anesthesiologist
I can tell you that anis anesthetics
binds in this little region here that
were aromatics right down very nonpolar
so this is where consciousness is okay
you can the rest of it doesn't really
matter in terms of consciousness and
well it's supportive of course but this
small region of this diagram is the non
nonpolar region where anesthetics act
and where consciousness resides but I'm
not going to talk about consciousness so
I guess I did
okay so getting back to the mechanics at
all attack they said we assert which we
do that Toula States regulated by London
force dipoles and hydrophobic pockets
within each tubulin and then attempting
to invalidate our assertion they said
that the electron cloud of a single
benzene is suggesting it to be analogous
to an indicative of hydrophobic pockets
cannot be a switch because it's
completely delocalized so there's two
basic two ways to look at a benzene
which is basically a phenyl ring on a
phenylalanine valence theory that
there's a resonance between two
different states for the whether double
bonds flip back and forth between two
possible locations or you can just say
it's completely delocalized in molecular
orbital theory they said well benzene is
molecular orbital Theory there's no
switching because it's completely
delocalized therefore the hydrophobic
pockets can't be switches well we agree
that a single benzene could not be a
switch because it takes two to tango and
in our in our case we London forces if
you have two benzene's together they're
going to induce induced dipoles these
are inducible induced induced dipoles so
two clouds come together the electrons
and one repel the electrons on the other
and then they oscillate back and forth
so these are the double bonds flipping
back and forth and this is kind of a new
schematic for it and if you have four of
them it would look something like this
and Hartmut
are this for the Google for the logo for
this workshop but put the Google colors
in which I'm quite proud of actually so
this is what van der waals London forces
are this is shown for a neon atom but it
works for any neutral electrically
neutral non polar to electrically
neutral non polar groups were the blue
dots of the electrons and and the
electrons in one repel the electrons on
the other and this draws them together
the the van der waals London attractive
force so they get closer they actually
repel a hundred times stronger so this a
very weak but important force mediates
for example and how anesthesia works to
erase consciousness and that little
piece of the phase diagram 100 over 100
years ago Myron Overton show that the
potency of any anesthetic gas correlates
with its van der waals well later was
appreciated that was van der waals
London force binding in a non-polar
medium akin to olive oil over wide
ranges of molecular structure and
concentration so getting getting back to
the tubulin bit so our one of our early
models show the tubulin switching
between two states due to a hydrophobic
pocket where there's two aromatic rings
where we only show a piece of each with
the electrons kind of flipping back and
forth and here's kind of a more recent
model and here's the the more current
model but maybe machemer shell didn't
realize we were talking about two
different rings because they said we
only had one one phenyl or benzene ring
in there actually there's many phenyl
and indoor rings in a tubulin this is
some recent work from Travis Craddock
mapping the fennel phenylalanine with
the aromatic rings and indoor rings and
many of these are within 3 3 angstroms
of each other or less than four hours
from 3.7 is where the van der waals
raven der Waals forces balance out so
many of these are close enough to form
coalescence --is of these aromatic
groups to get hydrophobic pockets with a
lot of electron resonance and mobility
electron mobility which Luke was talking
about and with a little imagination you
can actually see pathways for
topological qubits that that
honorbound was talking about I'll get to
that later and these phenyl these
aromatic groups can have a particular
orientation for their London forces and
I think maybe jack is going to talk
about this I'm going to skip over it for
now so conclusion - objection number one
McKenna said I'll miss the boat entirely
the hydrophobic pockets include
minimally - nonpolar groups which
utilize van der waals London forces it
takes two or more to tango so they said
well one benzene ring wouldn't do the
trick for you we agree completely that's
we never said that we're talking about
at least two and actually coalescence
coalescence --is of multiple non-polar
group with electron resonance
capabilities ok another aspect of the
decoherence as relevant to this we've
heard about quantum coherence in
photosynthesis and some in microtubules
a paper in 2003 by yang and al-salam
colette connected quantum dots by
benzene rings okay so these are single
benzene rings but they're just looking
at quantum spin transfer and they found
a very efficient quantum spin transfer
connecting the quantum dots through
these these bent phenyl rings basically
benzene rings the same exact same rings
found in in inside to Glenn and other
proteins and as far as temperature
they've starting at Absolute Zero when I
got to about minus 70 there was a huge
jump up in efficiency which persisted
out to brain temperature by connecting
it through this phenol or benzene ring
this is quantum spin transfer not
exactly the same as we're talking about
but it shows that a quantum effect can
be enhanced by temperature and that this
phenol or benzene ring can be utilized
in this way the same sort of structure
and I think Hartman and Luca alluded to
this found in psychoactive drugs
including powerful psychedelics in fact
any psychoactive drug including
chocolate LSD DMT all had these nonpolar
indole like rings here and in the 1970s
it was shown that the looking in a
series of psychoactive psychedelic drugs
actually hallucinogenic drugs that their
potency was related to their ability
to donate electron resonance energy from
the drug to the receptor
so the potency of the psychedelic is
related to its ability to donate
electron resonance energy quantum
quantum electron energy to the receptor
to the system and that seems to push the
person into an altered state okay so
that was the first the first objection
the second objection was this with
concerned GTP hydrolysis and tubulin
switching machemer should all say
experimentally the only identified
aspect of the confirmation of the
tubulin heterodimer
inside a microtubule depends on whether
GTP or gdp is bound to the beta subunit
and is the only process to be ascribed
to the conformational change depicted in
the or kawar proposal well Jerry talked
about how the the fröhlich condensation
the folic vibrations are fuel or pumped
in a Cell by being near mitochondria
taking advantage of mitochondrial energy
but not gtp or ATP directly just being
in the field is enough to drive drive
the coherence now the other point is is
this conformational change and it's true
that in our in our cartoons and these
are cartoons admittedly that there's a
significant formational change that the
tubulin is switching states by at least
10% of its volume now we did that to
indicate a change of state but actually
in a reflection we don't really need a
conformational change to register
information it can be strictly a dipole
state and although we showed these
cartoons as having conformational
switching we never really utilized the
conformational change in our model
except that for the quantum state the
superposition separation is is of the
diameter of a carbon nucleus the Fermi
length 10 to the minus eighth
centimeters is it it's very very small
so that gives you the superposition
separation which gets into the quantum
gravity stuff but as far as changing the
state for a computer we don't need a
conformational state we're perfectly
happy with an electronic state that can
be read out by its neighbor that's all
we need now the gtp business is also a
mistake on their part because when gtp
hydrolyzes
on the bit from gtp to GDP it does cause
a conformational change so that could be
how they got that idea it releases
phosphate bond but it's irreversible
once this happened the microtubule
starts to depolymerize it may de
polymerize at one end and then replumb
rise to the other which gives rise to
tread milling or may fall apart at both
ends which gives a catastrophe or
dynamic instability which is why they
rapidly shrink and grow shrink and grow
but we we point we look primarily for or
Co are in dendrites in my dendritic
microtubules where the microtubules are
capped and don't undergo GT GTP
hydrolysis don't undergo tread milling
nor d polymerization polymerization
cycles the quite stable which is why
they would be good for storing
information in dendrites so they're
wrong on this point also so the
conformational switching greater than
one Fermi length the diameter one carbon
nucleus is not required electron dipole
state switching is sufficient so this is
kind of a new model of for the tubulin
bit or qubit oscillating at eight
megahertz as Juli was talking about an
honor bond between two states notice
there's no conformational change here if
you didn't see the electron there
couldn't measure the dipoles it would
look exactly the same just like if you
looked at a computer motherboard you
might not be able to see all the
information going around because you
can't see the electrons but we actually
have now have multiple hydrophobic
pockets each consists each containing a
number of nonpolar groups and aromatic
rings and this is perfectly fine for or
Co are the only conformational state
change we knew we need is down at the
level of for the for the qubit function
is done at the level of the atomic
nuclei so objection to conformational
switching is not required dipole state
switching sufficient or Core applies to
dendritic microtubules which are capped
with vinci TP hydrolysis tred milling
and dynamic instability or kawar does
not require GTP hydrolysis so they're
wrong on that point also now i want to
talk a little bit about topological
qubits
on Urbana gave some very elegant results
and I'm not sure my understanding is up
to you know from the quantum computing
point of view so I just tell you my
interpretation of topological qubits
which may not match which may not be
right or match what he said but but
historically how this got started for
microtubules was that Roger Penrose
invited me and Jack Jasinski to the 1998
meeting at the Royal Society in London
of quantum information to talk about
microtubules and actually Jack was the
was the skeptic and I was the proponent
and since he's kind of come over to our
side
thank you but but afterwards there was a
John Prescott gave a talk on topological
quantum error correction and topological
qubits and relating to cations idea and
so forth and as I understand it the idea
is that if you have some kind of lattice
and the information can flow through one
pathway or another pathway then the
pathway itself can be the bit so in the
case of microtubules they have this
Fibonacci geometry so you can follow
this pathway or you can follow this
pathway or this pathway or this pathway
or a number of other pathways and if
each tubulin was a bit if each one of
these guys was a superposition and
represented a quantum bit or qubit then
it would be susceptible to 2d coherence
beach 1d currents of any one subunit
would mess up the whole quantum
computation however if you make the
pathway the the bit or the qubit then if
one of these guys gets knocked out of
whack that's going to get pulled back in
by by its neighbors and so it becomes
resistant to decoherence that's the
whole point about topological qubits and
and also topological quantum error
correction which is very similar idea
and these spiral pathways follow the
Fibonacci geometry
3 5 8 13 21 and this was one of the
things that got Raja very interested in
microtubules because he's a geometry at
heart and and and that's one of things
that captivated I'm and and honor bonds
now shown something like this in
microtubules actually occur so it's also
might be something like the Hirono
where you have opposite opposite
pathways or alternative pathways each of
which can be a bit or qubit and if you
look at at the multiple hundred nonpolar
hydrophobic pockets and line them up
with a little imagination you could see
how their states of each one of them
could influence conductivity of
ballistic conductance or quantum
coherence moving through the lattice all
around or on particular helical pathways
in the microtubule okay objection number
three this was from the earlier paper
for the same group same offer group
rhymers at all about three types of
fröhlich condensation weak strong and
coherent and Jerry talked about this a
little bit based on sin and they based
their conclusion on a simulation of a
linear chain of turbulence to represent
three-dimensional microtubules they
conclude that only weak weak fröhlich
condensation at eight megahertz and they
cited Pokorny so they essentially
validated jury's jury's work and since
they were so negative and skeptical
about everything else I think was kind
of remarkable of a that they you know
they agreed to that and and they liked
it but they said it was only weak
fröhlich condensation and that orko R
requires strong or coherent condensation
for example bosons something like
bose-einstein condensation well it seems
to me that we don't want bose-einstein
condensation because in that case all of
the all of the sub units would be in the
exact same state and you couldn't really
do any computing that way you need you
need the you need some the possibility
for each of the sub units to be in a
different different possible state and
so we think that weak weak is perfectly
fine for us or Korg does not require a
strong or coherent bose-einstein
condensate requiring only synchrony and
entanglement so we just wanted the the
fröhlich condensation the Froelich
excitations to synchronize the
operations like in a cellular automaton
or cellular automata you need you need a
clocking frequency and weak condensation
is fine as long as you can have
entanglement to mediate the the quantum
computation
and also in 1992 alexey samsonov ik
Alwyn scott who's a mathematical
physicist myself club is actually alexei
did this as his thesis simulated a
microtubule with with Froelich resonance
now what what rhymers at all did was
they simulated a linear chain and
somehow from a linear chain decided that
you can't have you can't have
significant Froelich effects in a
three-dimensional microtubule maybe
doing a doing three dimension was too
difficult for them but what alexei did
was he took a two-dimensional sheet of
tubulin and wrapped treated as a torus
made boundary conditions so that this
would match up with this and this would
match up with this so you get a torus i
was able to run these simulations and he
and he found a maxima and minima for
Froelich resonance energy at these at
these spots here the black ones which
which match experimentally observed
attachment patterns for microtubule
associated proteins so microtubule
associated proteins binding microtubules
at specific tubulin locations and their
location locations then determine the
function of the microtubules in terms of
the architecture and and and regulating
the synapses and and doing what
microtubules need to do so this is a way
of representing and processing
information so in 1992 alexei had shown
this that and they were unaware of this
paper which I think refutes refutes
their their contention also it was much
more elegant than what they did looking
at a single single tubulin chain so this
is now what we're thinking the tool
Anubha it might look like oscillating at
eight megahertz as as as as Jerry said
or maybe his honor bound that Froelich
originally said gigahertz but
microtubules are big so it makes sense
to me empirically in some sense that
they that they're slower and
megahertz is fine and the number of
operations per second is reduced but but
that's fine we got plenty of that to
play with so but the eight megahertz is
interesting for another reason so I'm
going to digress a minute and here's
here's honor bonds picture which I like
very much and and so the eight megahertz
would be and another at megahertz would
be in the in the microtubule wall itself
not not in the water not in the the C
terminal but the microtubule itself and
interestingly that's in the that's in
the RF for electromagnetic but but it's
also in the ultrasound if you took just
think of a mechanical vibration
mechanical oscillations and recently
there's been a movement looking at
effects on the brain on cognition and
consciousness of transcranial therapies
transcranial magnetic stimulation for
depression for all kinds of things
transcranial electrical stimulation to
enhance memory and transcranial
ultrasound using vibrational energy into
the head through the skull showing
effects in the brain now this was shown
behavioral effects were shown but but
nobody was sure with the weather it was
actually getting into the brain and
having non thermal effects in this guy
William J Tyler at ASU Arizona State
University did a very good study with
rats or mice I guess where they put
electrodes in the mice let them recover
they're walking around they can record
from the electrodes they then did
transcranial ultrasound and in addition
to behavioral or behavioral effects saw
interesting electrophysiological effects
so proving that the the ultrasound is
having physiological effects in the
brain and they've got a grant from the
government for for some kind of mind
control in I'm not sure what they're
trying to do actually but it's I think
they have good intentions but in there
I hope and also they've spun off a
company if you look at their their
perspectives they're promising
beneficial effects of transparent
transcranial ultrasound on about any
psychiatric diagnosis you can think of
including from depression to memory
problems to what-have-you so anyway we
at the University of Arizona including
my colleague Krista field who's here
have started her own study so I'm an
anesthesiologist we skip the rap
business and we're going right to humans
and we've tried it on ourselves actually
it's a very interesting effect on your
consciousness let's just put it that way
and so we think we think people will
like it and we've got a a proposal in
for for we've got a proposal in for
effects on chronic pain and after that
we're going to put a that's almost
through it looks looks pretty good for
chronic pain patients and after that
we're going to tried memory effects on
on memory because as our bond showed
stimulating at eight megahertz causes
microtubules to bloom rise and grow so
you could enhance synaptic plasticity
you could enhance turnover and enhance
learning and it could be a treatment for
Alzheimer's disease so I think this is a
very very promising new technology and
we're going to have a session on this as
hartman mentioned i co organized a
conference every year every other year
it's in tucson and the odd number of
years it's elsewhere in the world
so next May it will be in Stockholm
Sweden toward a science of consciousness
brain mind and reality and one of the
sessions will be on transcranial
therapies we have Alan Snyder talking
about well he's done a lot of
transcranial magnetic but he's going to
talk about transcranial electrical
Tyler's going to talk about transcranial
ultrasound and Wasserman from NIH will
talk about transcranial magnetic
stimulation we're also going to have a
session on quantum biology and several
other interesting sessions and I've left
some fliers over there for you to take
if you're interested so conclusions
the objections to orko are bimah
chemists at all and rhymes that are all
are invalid as far as I can tell I they
didn't lay a glove on us as far as I can
tell
maybe I miss something but but they will
there's nothing in there that that's
threatening in any way of course I'm
biased but you know so Orko our remains
viable and finally it is far better to
be criticized and ignored thank you very
much some questions could use the
microphone please
only a comment the mistake of dr.
rhymers and doc dr. kamesh was following
two mistakes first was that they
neglected non-linearity and if you
neglect nor linearity you must strong
non-linearity system cannot be described
linearly you Muslim mistake and the
second mistake they neglected the fact
that oscillators may be normal
with them being small and pink
oscillators critically damped and
oscillators over them and they if you
have over them oscillators than the
coherent time which I spoke here about
one microsecond decreases to ten to the
minus twelve for instance or something
like this this is two mistakes in their
work the second point I would like to to
say something that concerning
schizophrenia which somehow is connected
with with your work a physician in our
country measured immuno reaction by some
special antigen and found that in
illnesses that have disturbed somehow
mitochondrial function there is special
reaction and the reaction is the same in
cancer for instance in heart failures in
schizophrenia and in preterm and bears
on the delivery and so on predetermined
and in all these cases very likely also
in schizophrenia is disturbed function
of mitochondria therefore somehow the
system that supply energy to oscillating
system in the in the cells which belong
to biological activity thank you okay
thank you negation let me just say that
that jury's work is a huge help to us
number one showing the eight megahertz
coherence and also showing where the
energy comes for the for the excitations
from Madoka
without requiring GTP because that's
that was a critical issue is what's try
I mean frou looks at the heat bath but
that's a little bit vague but showing
that it's coming from mitochondria is
very very helpful I think a great
discovery
thanks it's always nice to hear a true
divorce and that was really well done
and I had a question if you think it I
like to think of a cell as a four bit
micro process or a rate bit cause it's
hard to do much more inland see quantum
and and if you're a cell and and somehow
something signals you that you have to
now be differentiated to a certain task
there's a complex set of subroutines you
have to know somehow how to extract if
you're going to deliver work for example
so for a long time I wondered well if
I'm going to discover I have to do a
subroutine I need a bit to store to know
that I'm now I need something that works
with the rest of the complex informatics
which what you've shown with the camp a
to sounds like the perfect kind of a
cellular memory yeah so asthma if I
remember in nineteen ninety nine you
inject and Porter published a paper that
also suggested with some fascinating
diagrams that the microtubules of a cell
can form electrical circuits also and I
just been thinking in addition to all
the quantum discovery if you're not
showing us how there is a almost a
perfect microprocessor memory state in
cells yeah well thank you yeah as I said
I work twenty four twenty years on the
idea of microtubules as classical
computers I don't even think about
quantum and I only went to the quantum
business when somebody stymied me with a
question okay wise guy how's that gonna
explain you know how we have feelings
and feel joy and redness and you know
the heart what's now known as the heart
problem in consciousness research and at
that time I read
his book the emperor's new mind which
was beautiful for many reasons and he
had a mechanism but another structure I
the structure and didn't have a
mechanism so you know I wrote to him and
and he immediately got it he immediately
saw the microtubules could be you know
what he needed and you know we teamed up
and we're kind of an odd couple were
really different in almost every way but
he's a wonderful guy and he's still very
interested he's gone off to worry about
you know the origin of the universe and
stuff like that but he's still very keen
on this stuff and we stay in touch and
and he'll be dabbling back into this but
but microtubules is classical
information processing mediating
differentiation and memory and I don't
know maybe jack knows weather cam k2 is
found widely in other cells other than
neurons I think it is and can it can
mediate all kinds of things in terms of
memory there's got to be a memory sight
within and it's not just a bit each
tubulin can be more than just two states
you can it could be it can be post
translationally modified it can be tai
rasul aidid there's the potential for
information processing in microtubules
is vast even in one cell any idea how
fast how fast what a memory can be
stored and retrieved well that within
seconds the cam KQ is distributed widely
throughout the the dendrites of one
neuron and then neighboring neurons and
if you stimulate simultaneously can go
widely throughout the brain so within
within seconds now whether that's you
know i think it was probably a
short-term memory not not immediate
consciousness because i think that
that's a little bit different but the
storage is seconds to minutes at the
most
so and then the retrieval can be can be
pretty fast so one more question just
guessing is it possible the short-term
memory can be stored one way and then we
go to sleep and it goes to long-term and
yeah well there's not there's a lot
about that in terms of when you go to
sleep you consolidate memory and
involves you know hippocampal gamma
oscillations and stuff like that so that
may involve some kind of hardwiring
maybe it's transferred from the
microtubules to the neuro filaments
which are way more stable than even
microtubules or maybe there's there's
post translational modification
and enzymatic or non enzymatic changes
in the tubulin so it becomes more
hardwired and that could be what what
memory consolidation is well for what
it's worth keep it up thank you okay
well thank you I'd like to thank Stewart
and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
