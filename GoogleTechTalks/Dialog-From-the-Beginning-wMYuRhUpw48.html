and he talked about how when he first
started at Lockheed he was amazed that
people would often say it was easier to
redo research than to find it and he set
out to solve that problem and he solved
that problem by building a company to
attack the problem of getting it the
world's information which is a noble
mission which all of us are busy helping
to fulfill so Rogers here to talk about
his experience with dialogue and I give
you Roger well thank you very much
Jonathan and thanks for inviting me to
talk to this group I of course as many
admired google for some time in fact the
first time I heard of google was from a
fellow named Jeff Pemberton who used to
be in charge the New York Times
information bank and he came up to me
and he said he said Roger did now this
must have been you know like 64 I mean
94 was it was google going in 94 no 1996
then maybe huh but it's in the
literature in 96 well anyway it was it
was around that time and he came up and
he said he said I found this this search
engine that is just fantastic and I said
yeah yeah Jeff I've I've heard that for
many many years you know and and he said
well it's google I damn near reads your
mind when you want to do a search and
and you'll see that I wasn't totally
sympathetic with that notion at that
time but I've come to be a believer so
so I am pleased to be here I feel a
little overdressed a little more
formally dressed than than usual and I
have to the reason for that is that I'm
retired and I don't get a chance to
dress up very often and and I find that
if I don't if i leave my clothes in the
closet and don't wear them next time I
try to put them on there too tight
they've shrunk in the closet you know so
so anyway I thought I'd stretch it out a
little bit here
ok I'd like I you will get acquainted
with me a couple of slides down but I'd
like to get a little acquainted with you
in terms of a couple of things first I'd
like to know how many people have heard
of dialogue about a little less than
half I'd say okay of those how many have
used dialogue good for ah well that
shows there well I won't say what that
shows okay and how many here are in the
engineering group programming and
engineering oh my golly are just about
everybody and how many are do other
things than engineering oh so it's about
about three-quarters one quarter and I
don't know what those other things are
in won't ask okay here's what we're
going to talk about this morning and I
have a lot of stuff to present and so I
hope it doesn't well I hope I can get
through it that's all and of course
these are things that I think are
fascinating and all of you some of you
may agree with me but perhaps all of you
won't so what we're going to do is look
at information retrieval in the relative
to knowledge transfer throughout history
throughout well the history of human
race and and that's to give us
perspective to put information retrieval
and dialogue design and development then
into that perspective and talk a little
bit about that now I talk about
information retrieval you know and you
people call it search you know and we
call it search we call it search
generically but we thought we describe
the process its information retrieval
and it's interesting on one of the
websites that's a gardening website you
know instead of having a button that
says search they have a button that says
dig
so we can call a lot of different things
but we're talking about information
retrieval as a technology or I am which
is what you would probably term search
well dialogue started out as a
laboratory project that I was in charge
of and then we moved into a commercial a
commercialization phase and formed it
into a company and then that meant that
it was worth money and so Lockheed which
is where i was i was in the lockheed
palo alto research lab so Lockheed
figured out that they could probably get
more money out of selling it than
operating it and i'll tell you a little
bit about that and then i'd like to
spend some time in what I call analysis
and reflection in over well 30 years
actually from the time we started
dialogue until I retired I took an early
retirement 1991 there you know one draws
some observations and conclusions and I
call them aphorisms and that will
conclude the talk with that okay if you
want to learn more about dialogue after
we're through you can go to their
website just a dialogue calm and it's a
very elaborate web site it goes into a
lot of depth of the company of the
products they offer today in and how
they offer them so I hope I'll stimulate
some of you too to do that okay now I
learned a little bit about you and
here's a chance for you to learn a
little bit about me well yeah I can tell
you that story I had a meeting to go to
yesterday at one o'clock in oakland in
all the rain and everything and i had to
get my slides transmitted over here
before i left and so some of what i have
doesn't absolutely agree with some of
what you will see so on my slide here i
have something called personal interests
and i guess in the announcement of the
tech talk Jonathan enumerated those but
I'll I'd like to bring them out because
they relate some what what we'll be
talking about music is just a real
strong interest with me I'm a performer
and a listener and I do some writing and
I discovered a great program called
audacity which is a free download which
is one of the best music editing
programs that I've ever run across so
we're that's just a little freebie so
music tennis is my sport I liked the
sale and used to do a fair amount of
sailing until my wife and I got into a
60 knot Gail and once we got docked she
climbed off the boat and she said I'll
never get on this boat again so my
sailing days are limited now at Stanford
I had a girlfriend in why wouldn't
Stanford my undergraduate was 48 to 52
and I had a girlfriend in 1950 that one
time told me you know there's this thing
that's been invented called a digital
computer and we had long conversations
about oh the ENIAC and the you know the
first UNIVAC and the fact that this this
machine stored a program a control
program much as it's toward its data and
even beyond that that the program could
be modified or modify itself as it
progressed based upon conditions that it
sensed or got from got from the external
sources well I had taken some psychology
and to me that was just sort of the
essence of what the human being does in
terms of adaptive behavior and so I was
fascinated and I decided through those
conversations that the computer was
going to be a major part of my my future
in my career as it turned out to be so I
had in in those days we we didn't have
computers to use but when I came back to
graduate school there was a course on
the IBM 650 fmu one is heard of that
which was one of the first IBM computers
and the week with the instructor felony
Bob oakford learned to program it
together it was all in uh well
I don't know what you call fundamental
assembly language I mean it was just
numbers you know numbers meant do
something to this register at or
whatever and then something called soap
came along symbolic optimized
programming so AP assembly program
symbolic optimized assembly program this
allowed you them to assign symbols like
ad you could sign for ad instead of
remembered 64 AD and and I just thought
this was the end of the world now that
we didn't have to remember all those
damn numbers so we did that and then I
took some courses in operations research
and learned some things that will come
into the talk later on that were quite
useful in in terms of influential
readings individual differences is a
psychology book and I think it's
probably still get it on Amazon in a
secondhand form but I learned from that
the great variety of differences that
exist among individuals you know in our
own experience we tend to have a kind of
a narrow spectrum of people that we know
but in in this book they go into just
the great variety of what's normal you
know I mean you know beyond you're a
conclave of acquaintances you say oh
that's pretty abnormal down there pretty
dab normal over here but I mean in terms
of normality that gave me an
appreciation for the wide spectrum of
people and interests and objectives that
exists a habits was an important book to
me because I've never realized how
important habits were in directing one's
life and habits are what drive us you
know and so if we can make those habits
effective will you be more effective if
we get rid of habits that aren't so
effective which is extremely difficult
you know then that's a good thing to
naval communications history of World
War two it turns out that just about
every disaster that both our side and
the other side experienced and and and
during that war was a communications
failure
and this book gave me an appreciation
that communications are so critically
important in in doing things and a final
book here was finite mathematics that I
read one summer between school years and
that went into well the important thing
that went into was boolean algebra I
gave very nice examples of how boolean
concepts could be used in real life and
in terms of sets you know adding and
roaring and nodding sets and so on and
that of course came into influencing the
design of dialogue as you'll see later
on a pre dialogue experience at lms see
that's Lockheed missiles and space
company is what it's called it's
Lockheed and I went there as a in
between my dissertation and between my
orals and my dissertation got a summer
job and then stayed on there because I
reported to the head of information
processing at this large company with 70
90 computers and he gave me assignments
in simulation and information retrieval
with regard to simulation I built a
model of the aerospace industry which
was used as in training executives to
manage companies in aerospace and and it
turned into my dissertation after i
added a an algorithmic decision maker
that competed with the human beings
making decision make making decisions in
operating the model and that was a lot
of fun we did Oh a design of experiments
to see what was significant so anyway
the dissertation was titled the it
doesn't have a short title simulation of
a management decision process utilizing
the computer model now if that doesn't
sound impressing oh wait a minute wait a
minute simulation of a management
decision process utilizing the computer
model of the aerospace industry and that
sounds pretty impressive to me even now
and it consisted of a massive Fortran
program many many subroutines one master
calling routine and that's a story in
itself
but in information retrieval I on
another programmer sat down and had
thought we'd figure out how to do
information retrieval or searching one
problem was we didn't have any databases
you know so we had a key in some little
databases to play with and we sat on we
thought well what we do is we take the
words from the query you know parse the
query into its terms and then we match
those terms on a quorum basis against
the database and the items that have the
greatest number of those terms will rank
at the top and sort them and have kind
of a relevancy ranking of and then we
thought well we didn't what what I
didn't like about that was that if the
customer or the user didn't get what
they wanted they were dealing with a
black box they were dealing with an
algorithm and they didn't know then how
to modify their query in order to get
more relevant results out of the search
so having read finite mathematics the
summer before we started fooling around
with a boolean which of course is very
explicit and the matchup is precise in
terms of the search and results so
anyway we did a little experimenting
with relevancy ranking but I turn to
switch somewhere along the line went to
boolean and we didn't do much more with
that okay now i think i'm getting more
verbose than i want to be so i'm going
to kind of skim through this there's a
great book which I just I couldn't find
my copy so I went on Amazon and it's out
of print now but there Secondhand copies
for six dollars and fifty cents and I
thought well just get another copy
anyway it's called the new renaissance
in fact the full title is the new
renaissance computers in the next level
of civilization and by this fellow
Douglas Robertson and it's just a
fascinating book to read in terms of
Ewing both the context that we're
dealing in and some of the places that
everything's going but he outlined
several different thresholds
the history of civilization each of
which resulted in a massive information
explosion relative to what there had
been before and so he goes back to the
invention of language the invention of
writing the invention of printing and as
you imagine this you know you can see
the information just bubbling out of
each of these thresholds and then the
invention of the computer now he didn't
he did a little bit on the invention of
information retrieval but didn't go into
that particularly but I'll go I'll go
I'll delve I'll spend a little more on
time on the invention of the computer
and the invention of information
retrieval so with a computer there well
when I when I was a Lockheed and impact
with a 70 90 series in 1790 fours you
did not do text processing with those
computers I mean they were all numeric
and they were used for accounting or for
scientific computation and if you tried
to do text processing and Fortran if any
of you have used that you know it's just
just horrendous you don't there were
programs like Lisp around that were
designed for text processing but we
didn't get into those so so anyway with
with the computer what happened was that
computer typesetting replaced the hot
lead typesetting of the well of the post
Gutenberg era in fact one of our
databases we went back and tried to
negotiate with Wilson's if anybody knows
the Wilsons collection to get their
database online and they gave us a tour
and they were still setting hot lead
this is you know 65 no no this is in the
70s in the early 70s they now have
switched and at Lockheed in the lab the
guys would say yeah it's cheaper to redo
research than it is to try to find out
if it's ever been done before even
though we had reference librarians so
what what made
everything what what really opened the
door was third generation computer
technology embodied in the IBM 360 and
and that that allowed us really to a
couple the power of the computer with
the intellect of the human being and we
could go through examples of this but I
was reminded of it just as I was putting
this presentation together being you
know using PowerPoint and being over
take my other computer and being able to
branch off on the internet with google
to do research on point as i was still
kinyoun lines on here I mean the
efficiency and proto wealth the
efficiency that that allows is just
incredible because when i was doing
presentations back when we were putting
the system together i mean i'd first
type it out and drafted to go to a
technical editor who would kind of go
through and cleaned it up a little bit
then it would go to a layout guy that
would type it on a formatter and they
dedit it you'd cut that document into
strips and cut and paste it on strips
and then you'd take it to a photo
machine that would do view foils for you
you know and heaven forbid if you if you
had a mistake in there you couldn't
correct it and i was able well i made
the final touches to this as i was
waiting for you to gather here today so
anyway i think you know i think you
don't appreciate you don't appreciate
this because you take it for granted and
that's perfectly fine and there's no
point in in sort of retracing all those
steps but you might be interesting to
know that we've come a long long way
okay so in terms of dialogue this well
someone said it's a tool to relieve
mankind of the burden of over
specialization and to allow the pursuit
of ideas in the acquisition of new
knowledge and that's that's what we were
after our objective of has been one of
empowering the customer and developing a
technology more than in building a
business in selling the business
okay so let's go into dialogue
development a little bit we got okay
there was something called the red book
that was published that talked about
automating the library of congress and
Herschel Brown who is a vice president
of Lockheed at the time thought this was
an endeavor that was worthy of a
Lockheed resource also the Air Force had
a list of objectives of research
objectives that it would fund research
on one of which was information
retrieval so we were fine we got some we
got some independent research and set up
the information sciences laboratory and
started to work on information retrieval
and luckily luckily for me I guess I was
appointed in charge of that process and
we had some very exciting times well let
me tell you what our computer was it was
a it was at IBM 360 30 it's one of the
first ones that was delivered it had 64
K of core and that's that's what we call
Ram these days 64k not 64 megabytes 64
kilobytes and we had to 2311 disks each
of which had seven megabytes and we had
one 2320 one day to sell which had 400
megabytes of storage and I'll show you
I'll go into that 21 day to sell a 23-21
day to sell a little later because that
was the clunky as part of the whole
operation but also it was the cheapest
storage that you could buy at that time
and it really got us into business third
generation technology second generation
technology was called batch searching
technology had tapes that read in yet a
single job that could process at a time
and then he had a tape or massive
printout coming out the other side and
there was searching that was done on
second generation technology but it took
forever and you couldn't modify your
search if you if you defined your search
a little bit too narrowly then you've
got nothing and it took you a week or so
to resubmit your search if you define it
a little too loosely you got a whole box
of paper to wade through
no and so you couldn't conform it and
that all guided us in the design of
dialogue as we went along but they were
exciting times i met a fellow named HP
der leun of IBM peter loon invented SDI
does anybody know what SDI stands for
now maybe sembly anyway it stands for
selective dissemination of information
and we now call that alerts and alert
because that's what it did so you guys
have them dialogue has them and they're
they're extremely useful well when we
when we got going we anticipate a lot of
information retrieval applications such
as automating the the files of the state
of California the automotive files in
the state of California so that you
could search on the whole key there was
searching by content rather than by
label you know in a phone book you're
going to search by label largely but but
the whole trick with information
retrieval is being able to search by
content of course that's what you guys
do on the Internet we were also going to
are going to automate the modus operandi
files of the state of California or
elsewhere and this came about because my
wife-to-be was living in Boston at the
time of the Boston Strangler okay if any
of you have run into that anyway he was
kind of a serial killer and she was a
naive young woman that kind of wandered
around the back streets and every time I
picked up the paper I expected she be
the next victim well anyway an analysis
there was a book written on it in
analysis that one reason they didn't
pick the guy up earlier was that he
operated in several different
jurisdictions each of which had a you
know a shoebox file of modus operandi
and also they only had a single
classification system so that you know
was robbery it was rape it was this and
so on so he did a little bit of
everything when you know when he went in
he did a little robbery rape did a
little murder so they had him scattered
all throughout a number
files and of course with a little bit of
imagination you can imagine on a
computer you know that you can put that
together in a way that you can you're
going to be able to identify the guy and
the fact that there are multiple
attributes helps in narrowing the thing
down anyway so we were very excited
about the whole thing and let me tell
you a little bit about the date that I
IBM 2321 data cell is anybody aware of
this machine we're familiar with okay
it's fun it's a mug it's a mechanical
electrical pneumatic hydraulic device
okay in any of those systems could fail
it required it required 23 leaders of
motor oil to operate for the hydraulic
system and and and the hydraulic system
was like a British motorcycle know they
say the only thing that doesn't leak oil
on a British motorcycles the handlebars
well listening leaked oil and we had a
kitty litter pan in in the bottom of
this thing to catch the oil that leaked
it had an average of one second access
time to get to a record okay and we had
24 or so before we sold them off and
switch to disk 24 of them amounted to
about one gigabyte of storage and that's
what we were in business with making
good profits as you'll see later on but
it was cheap it was cheap and they got
cheaper because the reliability was so
poor so he just kept buying them and
loading them in and you know I'd walk
around I was at the palo alto research
facility and and I'd walk around people
say get out of here because what we did
we took over half the cafeteria for our
data cells then we started taking over
people's offices for the data cells
because we just didn't have story true
so they finally booted us out gave us
another facility which I'll mention a
little bit later okay here you can see
the mechanism and I won't spend time on
this but you'd remove one of these one
of these cells that it had forty
megabytes but it had mylar strips in it
and so to read a record it would
mechanically pick the strip wrap it
around a drum
on an air bearing and then it had heads
of course that would seek the record on
the strip and then and it would read it
okay then go through the reverse process
it had unwrapped the strip find the
right cylinder for it and then slot it
back down into this cylinder that you
see here and i should say cram because
we all had accordion strips nailed to
our wall that didn't work well we had
one IBM maintenance guy on on site at
all times for the purpose of repairing
that thing ok so in designing the
language these are maybe more important
points but I saw searching as a process
not as a probe a little bit and that has
a process it had to be interactive so
that you could guide your search into
what you wanted a little like a guided
missile as opposed to a ballistic
missile with feedback and so we said
okay the process needs to be cumulative
and recursive by recursive admit the
results of a particular search could be
used as arguments in a subsequent search
statement so it kept going without
having to rekey stuff that you did
before that also if you had like a four
concept search and each concept had a
multitude of terms to describe it you
could develop the concepts one at a time
hone them down to what you wanted then
intersect them to get your final result
it's a little bit like pounding a nail
with one blow of a hammer versus being
able to pound it with several blows of a
hammer so we felt that would be more
powerful okay here our first prototype
commands begin while you can read it but
begin you used to to define the subset
of the total data based on the system
that you're going to search expand then
one time when I was over in the library
Stanford library I was going through the
catalog looking for something another
and I'd look and look and didn't
I didn't didn't find it so I went to the
library I said well do you have a
listing of all of your subject headings
oh no we don't have that you know well I
said well and I don't know how to
formulate the same looking for so from
that I decided that we were going to
have a an expander manned which provides
a display alphabetically of near terms
to an input term of all the searchable
terms in in the database and then select
is the is the boolean command and it
enables the recursion because the
results of one select are numbered in
and that number then can be used as an
argument in the subsequent search okay
so for a but with the generality of
those commands you could do a lot more
than well than simply searching and you
could do this because the records that
we had our fielded and tagged that means
that you know you can limit our sorter
do things on any field or any tag in the
database so here's a little simple
example of a search for MRI you want to
find an expert MRI for multiple
sclerosis so you go through the search
here of the parentheses indicate that
you want word adjacency because it put a
number in there and it says you want
these things with in so many words of
each other for a better specification
and you can see a number of things that
go on there and so we go down in the
fourth line and limit it to human and
then we rank the results according to
the author according to the frequency
that the author occurs in those articles
and then that gives you the top writers
from that database in in MRI use for
multiple sclerosis so that's when one
example and this one this is really neat
but I've never found any use for it read
any real use for it but what we did here
what I did here is I went through a I
constructed a database of 52 million
journal articles gain that then was my
my myspace my article space and went in
and in
selected it down by year from 1981 2
2004 and then I input search terms
dialogue Google internet and and the
word online just to see how when when
when these words started appearing in
the literature and these are technical
journal articles and then you know put
him in an Excel spreadsheet into the
plot but like for dialogue I couldn't
just put in the word dialogue so I
limited that or I intersected that with
Lockheed or knight-ridder or made or
information retrieval you know so that I
would just get the context that I wanted
I had a few problems with google at
first can anybody guess what those were
how I had to limit Google well I took
I'd out I said Google not I'd okay ey ed
as google ID is a favorite expression
and then I took out the word Barney also
you know if that were coupled with
google so that's why i got google and so
what can you see with this thing well
it's kind of interesting to see the
yellow line is is the word internet and
the number of articles containing the
word internet and you can see that about
19 1 1988-89 the frequency currents of
internet exceeded or past the frequency
of use of dialogue and then you see you
see we've got more popular I mean and
the word online was pretty well up there
and after 1995 it follows pretty much
the curvature of of internet because
internet online or you slut so I'm
Chesley but now with google we see
Google coming into the literature in
1997 you know at a very at a very low
level but then going up at a rather
rapid rate and then
well it looks like it's tailing off but
I had a plot this I had to convert the
raw numbers by log base 10 in order to
get everything to plot on the same on
the same scale so that Google line is is
very impressive I did it separately also
um I did it separately because i would
like to feel that a curve like this kind
of indicates at least the popularity of
the recognition of an institution or a
process or a company and I thought maybe
I could make a lot of money on stock
market by watching these curves and
seeing when they tail off and you know
never have but could okay how are we
doing yeah that's not bad okay so anyway
so here we were in the Lockheed research
lab we had our little tool and it was
working pretty good on these little toy
databases that we put together but I
needed a real database to offer proof of
concept NASA had the only real database
at the time they had a database of 200
citations these are grief citations you
know title author so on descriptors of
research reports of NASA sponsored
research reports so i went to meld a who
is in charge of that and i said we have
this you know this great technique
that's going to save you a lot of time
and help their researchers he said yeah
i got about three or four people a week
coming in telling me that they have
things like that so when you have
something to show me come back and I
said well I need your database in order
to show you and he said fine and he gave
me some tapes that I took back and I had
my database so we worked on that and
that worked pretty good and I went back
and showed it to melt and then gave them
an unsolicited proposal for an Ames for
a prototype to be worked over here at
Ames Research Lab anyway we installed
that and and it was very well accepted
what that did for me and Lockheed was to
get me moving away from independent
research dependency which is an awful
thing to be dependent upon because
there's
so much competition in we we had
projects going in all the technical
Sciences that were funded by independent
research as well as wholesome speech
recognition I remember that one some
character recognition stuff I mean most
of the things that we've seen make some
progress over the past many years we
didn't at the time but then NASA was
pleased with that and so they came out
with an RFP request for proposal for the
NASA wide recon system and we did that
with about 20 other companies at the
time and were awarded the contract and
that's really what got us going I mean
was the funding to develop that software
which we then could use elsewhere anyway
recon is still going within NASA not
what we wrote because it's been changed
and developed over time but a key thing
here was in the contract we wrote what's
called a rights in data clause rights
and data clause says that whatever we
develop is their proper but we have the
right to use that property and that gave
us the right than to develop successive
generations of dialogue so we had two or
three other contracts s ro is the
European Space Research Organisation we
install the system in Darmstadt Germany
for them we got another contract from
the Atomic Energy Commission at that
time for their database and install the
system there and there is another
database around called Eric which is
educational resource something another
anyway it's educational it ABS indexes
and abstracts educational material I
said this is a database that should be
on dialogue so I went back to Washington
met with a fellow named Lieber channel
and talked with him and said you know
we'd like to install our software on
your computer and then you can have a
lot of people search this stuff and he
said we should we don't have a computer
what you can do if you want to take our
database and install it on your computer
and then we'll pay you to do the
searching ok now this the you know this
it finally sunk in but this was in
elegant realization we had moved from
the contract business systems
development and contracting where you
die at the end of every
contract to a services business which is
addictive as you get people using your
services you all know and they don't
stop they keep going so that's what got
us into into the services business and
moved us into a commercial launch in
1972 we had about four databases online
at the time and one of our early
objectives and one of the things we saw
with third generation technology was
mass ramdev mass random access storage
which give us the database capability
interactive programming which meant that
you know we could have interactive
searching but also telecommunications
which then gave us the potential of a
global market so we went after the
global market at that time well we were
fortunate the Japanese had heard about
dialogue somewhere in one of the
meetings and so I had two visits from
two different companies that wanted to
be a representative in Japan and I was
apprehensive about Japan because you
know I knew nothing about it I didn't
know how they'd market I didn't know how
they'd priced the thing I thought they
might just price it on a lot of business
so what I did was I I made distributor
contracts with each of the two Japanese
organizations and they were competitive
than in Japan and that gave us the
competitive advantage on pricing on
marketing on appearance at conferences
and so on and so that was a very good
move in in terms of dealing with the
unknown there and I have a couple of
pictures in a moment on that well in
fact that we went first to Canada then
Great Britain Europe Japan South America
and Australia and this is all during the
70's and we were the first that we
established distributor relationships in
each of those countries and we were the
first retrieval service in those
countries and as time went on we simply
dominated the market place and and
that's really the way to do it if you
can okay but i just want to show you a
couple of japan things the the
distributors each one would invite me
over and gather a different audience
together
to be lectured to and we would my talk
would be translated let's see not
simultaneously sequentially I mean I'd
say something to be translated it's just
a great way to give a talk because you
have all this time and to think about
the next thing that you're going to say
so I had a good time there I mentioned
one of my interest was in music and I
got my first synthesizer bought it off
the street in Japan and and carried it
back on the airplane but then the let's
see so that was internationally
expansion in terms of business strategy
okay I I've always said that profit is a
constraint not an objective you know in
other g really have to be profitable to
stay in business but if you make profit
the objective than you're thinking wrong
I mean your objective should be service
the service which bro I'd to customers
and if you do that and they need your
service you know how to run the business
then profit is likely to result it's
going to result so we operated that way
we we tried to offer the service at the
lowest price possible and this is
contrary to a lot of what other people
do because they want they if they have a
new product they want to put it on the
market at a high price to get the first
adapters you know kicking in those high
bucks but what that does also is it
allows other people to do business plans
that make sense against your pricing so
I priced it low and the reason was so
that competition would find it difficult
to do a feasible business plan against
dialogue the third thing was that we we
provide a comprehensive coverage I mean
across many many different disciplines
many many that you can name and and
people would ask me why don't you you
know you don't know what you're doing
why don't you focus your service into
one of these areas instead of all of
them well the realization is that
information problems don't slot
themselves into discipline organized
information
and I used to think that disciplines
were created for the convenience of
librarians and school teachers know
rather than for problem solving so we
wanted a system that people could sit
down once go through the whole thing
solve their entire problem get up and go
on to something else and that was a that
was one of our objectives okay what we
did that we did that okay then in terms
of just the chronology of this thing we
respond out as a separate corporation in
1982 and we move to a separate facility
and this this is our facility at the
corner of arastradero and hillview up in
stanford dustrial park and it was really
a neat place wouldn't when they started
talking about this the facilities the
phils facilities people at dialogue said
oh no it's much too expensive up there
you know we want to move you that we
have this really low cost area down in
south san jose that we'd like to move
you to you know and I argued and argued
argued because as I think your
philosophy here is you know you want to
provide people a place to work that they
want to come to and and that argument
didn't didn't sell for much within
Lockheed but what finally did sell was
Palo Alto's utility costs because Palo
Alto buys their electricity from the
record nation district I believe they
have the lowest costs in the area so I
could do a nice little analysis showing
that because we were chewing up a lot of
air conditioning and in computer heat
costs at the time that it was cheaper
really to locate in the Stanford
industrial park which we did and we
stayed there as long as I was active we
just loved it anyway then well the
separate incorporation was really
setting us up to be sold we've realized
later on and knight-ridder well we went
on the market with what's called a
Goldman Sachs auction anybody ever heard
of a Goldman Sachs auction well this is
a very formal process that they go
through in terms of getting
indications of interest then they asked
well how much would you be willing to
pay and each sign they're narrowing down
the candidates until they get a final
small list a short list of candidates
and then we do presentations and take
him out to dinner and you know get
acquainted with them and then they asked
for the final sealed bid and
knight-ridder won the bid in 1988 with
the 353 million dollar bid and that that
turned out to be about three and a half
times our sales at the time which were
about a hundred million dollars and 14
times profit so it was a very very
lucrative thing for dialogue one reason
that it worked so well was that the
Lockheed management cooperated with the
dialogue management putting this thing
together we wound up we in dialogue I
mean our attorney wound up writing the
sales contract and it was a
non-negotiable sales contract that these
people were bidding on in the sales
contract we said all benefits will be
continued I had set up profit-sharing
for the first time within Lockheed and
so we had a profit sharing plan and you
know other provision was profit sharing
would be continued and all these kinds
of things so knight-ridder came through
the other bidders were well company
called maxwell lexis nexis was another
bidder let's see American Express was
one and there were a couple of others
but that's a whole story in itself I
mean that process was totally
fascinating to go through and to see how
they how they operated we had a fellow
named Sykes that was in charge of
Goldman Sachs his nick nick name was
Tiger Sykes you know and he was a tiger
he had about five or six of these
projects going at the same time and when
we'd seemed we were absolutely certain
that we were the only project he had any
interest in I mean he was that that
clever okay so when we moved to our new
facility this is a picture of a handsome
young man and and what we called our
disc acres and these are all our
databases and there are no mirrors
I mean they just went back the whole
list the room the whole length of the
room and and and we increased space for
a long time until about nineteen
eighty-five and then even though we were
increasing our storage we were reducing
the floor space that was required we
doubled our storage every three years
every three years we doubled our storage
which meant we doubled our information
okay competition I don't know that
you're that interested in this but there
was systems development corporation with
a system called orbit vrs was price
leader there's a story there too that I
don't think I know I don't have time to
tell you national library of medicine
had medline operating and that was heavy
competition because they offered it
basically for free and they could do
that because of the fixed cost of
capital equipment in the government they
had no right offer depreciation and then
LexisNexis and then chemical abstracts
service who endeavoured to monopolize
the chemical industry and did that by
withholding and withdrawing databases
from organizations like ourselves we
brought an antitrust suit against the
american chemical society on this basis
and probably would have wanted except it
hadn't completed by the time i retired
and knight-ridder was tired of paying
all these lawyer fees so they settled it
for with no benefit to dialogue okay
here's anyway here's what our sales and
profits look like this is an interesting
curve in that if you look down I should
have brought my little pointer but if
you look at the yellow and the purple
lines the yellow line is the profit
percentage and the purple line is the
profit dollars and so where the where
the profit dollars in the profit
percentage cross happens to be 1988
which is right the time the dialog set
to sell and did sell dialogue oh gee
that's well that's great okay see it
right there
it's kind of slick that turns out to be
the year also that the word Internet in
that previous slide the frequency of
occurrence of Internet in articles
crossed the frequency of occurrence of
dialogue so they picked in and you can
see there's a point of inflection in our
sales curve at about that same time so
Lockheed picked a good time to sell
dialogue okay so why were we successful
well the comprehensive database
collection allowed one stop searching
across multiple disciplines and one
thing I learned in operations research
was the strategy that always came on top
was a dominant strategy so instead of
compromising one attribute and other
attribute we tried to dominate in every
attribute and we've gone through some of
the rest of these all dialogue employees
had a free password and that helped in
selling I had a budget we we hired
people as we could afford to hire people
and am I affording to hire people was
based upon a metric of three hundred
thousand dollars a year in revenue per
employee that was back in the days when
dollars were more and dollar sort of
valued more and people were paid less
okay and then in terms of philosophy
this is kind of an IBM philosophy but we
had many many classes and courses to
develop our customers our customers were
mainly the technical library community
the research librarian as opposed to end
users or even research scientists and
their that's another story ok now I'll
just pass on whoop
i mentioned i transmitted these slides
in quite a hurry okay uh oh there we go
it is I did know this for a while will
do him here well no I just I want to all
dwell on I won't dwell on this but I'll
let people take a look at it because
this was my philosophy and we know we're
nowhere approached what Google has been
able to do in terms of hiring good and
capable people all load two of our best
are not working for google of course one
is sitting here in the chair jonathan
and the other is kathy kathy gordon and
maybe there are others here from
dialogue i don't know okay make a profit
a constraint not an objective i
mentioned that and okay maximize market
share not profit margin in a new
business endeavor and you see this going
both ways but price too high you don't
get market cherry you just attract
competition so you know price it low and
bring folks in okay and analyzing oh
that didn't yeah it did no yes it did
okay well analyze quantity as well as
dollars most a lot of companies because
they're run by accountants just look at
dollars but look at quantity of whatever
it is you're selling or serving and in
doing a customer analysis you know don't
just look at net customers that you have
look at the increment that you've gained
over a period of time look at the
increment that you've lost because each
of those phenomena require different
decision making AOL I think learned that
somewhere along the line okay and you
know Wall Street isn't the only one that
should share in the rewards of business
success let's bring the employees and
the customers into this metric into this
equation as well and of course your
google epitomizes this and okay this is
this is one that they don't teach in
business school but that management has
an institutional responsibility which
extent
beyond fisty fiduciary to custodial that
is to say that management has a
responsibility to maintain a business in
business as opposed to just dumping it
when it you know loses a little profit
or 11 of the ups and downs and the
reason for that is because Society has
come to depend upon the services that
that company provides so I feel that
that's a real responsibility that should
be ha this one this one didn't bullet
okay and then these are just some little
aphorisms that I found useful i guess it
used to bother me when I went to school
there were a lot of really wealthy kids
I mean whose parents were wealthy that
seemed very insecure and I tried to
figure that out over a long time and
finally came to this conclusion that if
there is a social need for your personal
resource then you will get more security
from knowing that society depends upon
you and that you can contribute to
society then you get from just having a
bundle of wealth which is kind of empty
and the system does work at diligent and
disciplined pay off win your battles
allocate time to the process of random
opportunity generation you have to
generate opportunities at this in but
you have to prepare yourself at the back
end so that you can meet and fulfill and
realize those opportunities as they come
in and then recognize the vast
individual differences between people
and that came from that individual
differences book it it gives you a
little more tolerance you know and and
then exclude misunderstanding before
placing blame I mean I know people that
if something goes wrong the first thing
they do is look for somebody to blame
there was somebody or some event to
blame and much of the many of the issues
come from misunderstanding and the final
thing is coupling confidence with
patience to realize success in your
endeavors and I think this was the most
important characteristic that I was able
to eat that I either had or was able to
develop because it took I was confident
that what we were doing that there was a
need in society for what
doing but it took a long time to develop
it and to get it recognized to a point
that that we could realize success from
it okay just a couple of more quickies
and then we're done Jonathan and Kathy
have given me tours of Google and made
me better aware of Google in addition to
my own research and so these are things
that just fascinated me first of all the
retrieval speed is just beyond my
imagination terrific the number of
simultaneous search is handled you know
we were running on mainframes and as our
business grew and became more popular
guess what guess what happened response
times suffered so it was always a
push-pull thing you know adding more
capacity improving our programming to to
keep response time up and your response
time is fantastic great facilities you
have core values that Jonathan shared
with me on a piece of paper and they're
they're great core values they're
exactly the way business should be run
in my view democratization of the
information of information access by
making the service free you know you've
drawn in a community that's unbelievable
that's unbelievable by any other terms
there's a company called view Tron that
Knight Ridder put together Oh years ago
to test a sort of popular information
retrieval on theaters and restaurants
and so on and they got about 30 people
that they signed up in Florida for that
maybe is 50 you know gave them free
terminals free service try it out tell
us what you like they then a little bit
later they put a price of i think it was
ten dollars a month you know to
subscribe to the service and their
number of customers went from 60 let's
say 20 the next month so free is great
hiring policies are insisting on
specified term contracts I mean going
out to suppliers and saying okay here's
the contract folks and we try
make it as balance and equal as we can
but it has to be a take-it-or-leave-it
you can take it and join or not join as
you choose in doing our supplier
contracts we negotiated those contracts
and so we wound up with 0 probably as
many different terms and conditions in
the contracts as we had contracts and
it's been a headache throughout you know
throughout trying to manage dialogue
trying to put together a service and
then the product development and
innovation of course the last thing is
your webcast the webcast of the analysts
meeting that happened a month or so ago
and doing that as a webcast was just
great i watched it as a shareholder and
it's the first time i've ever attended
an analyst meeting for a company that i
had held stock in so that was a terrific
idea and of course it's posted so we can
go back and look at it a time we want
okay final thoughts from Mark Twain and
I'll just let you read that and I have
to say you know as I reflect on my 30
years or so on this business I totally
agree with it so throw off your bow
lines and sail away from the safe harbor
hits the trade winds in your sails
explore dream and discover thank
you
