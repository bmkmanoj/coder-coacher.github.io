for the flavor of the blog brother
support nerdfighters but this is the
other one too that's one of their more
popular posts and I just like this part
of the club
so we're
it's all exits to seven different very
fighters please forgive me Jacob what's
the key to becoming a popular video
blogger on YouTube YouTube just released
this really interesting feature that
allows you to see the demographics of
your channel and one of the things that
we learnt in the books demographics the
nerdfighters are extremely loyal I think
the reason for this is that dirt
fighting isn't something that you watch
out to do it's something that we all do
together the other thing that we learn
it's out of our 296 videos 294 who have
been watched by more women than men the
two exceptions both featured giraffe sex
is the center screen shot really men of
YouTube you are freaking me out please
explain your comments what it is that
fascinates you about giraffes who love
giraffes so yeah if you want to come
March me Buffy on youtube and help
create a community that you feel really
strongly about that's composed entirely
of Awesome in building a truly
collaborative community is the way to go
if you want boys to watch you I suppose
what would you like your last words to
be there like
it's all good
I'm gonna give her face Vickers that's
perfect i love it the other on
communicator me okay so i want to
welcome John Hank green who are the
founders and creators of what actually
confuses me with three different names
so there's screen name on youtube is
blocked brothers they started the
Brotherhood two point oh they founded
what is actually a now and I should say
a new term but something that's becoming
popular culture called nerdfighters and
basically I think some of the stats I
share with you guys is at this point
their number 49 and most subscribed
all-time directors on YouTube seven
behind Oprah two behind the google
channel itself and so these guys are
really rich away from taking okay so we
keep watching the numbers to see ya yeah
when that might happen so I'll just I
don't know if one of you could just kind
of talk a little bit about the inception
and how you started with YouTube and we
can go over there ya go I'll just say it
to start
okay go then that how many subscribers
you get there's always something you're
right in front of me what you want to
surpass and you guys have been hasn't
been that person for like three three or
four months now and right next to Google
yeah good boys my job and you would John
the wheat it's a little bit like when
you're at the dog races and they have
that fake bunny go over down the track
and the dog never dipped to catch that
they funny but it's it's working on
earth Hank and I grew up in Amanda board
and when I was 14 and he was 11 I moved
to Alabama to the boarding school and
after that we never been to the same
place ever again and we stayed very
close through his rear boat like the
internet so we stayed closer instant
message and stuff but we had not seen a
lot of each other in the last 10 years
when we decided to do this and I think
we both we were both make friends of say
Frank I don't know if you guys know say
the day prank is this a very influential
video bloggers made a video every single
day between March seventeenth 2617 2007
every single weekend and he got very
popular and he built a lot of he built a
lot of things that made sort of
contemporary non youtube video blogging
possible all of which were interesting
but we didn't really want to do and so
again I were talking one day on insta
messenger and we were talking about how
we didn't see each other on and this
seemed like a way to do it would be to
make sort of based on say and I was also
really obsessed with women girl
the first sort of major thing that
happened on YouTube there was a small
cabal of people who helped prove that
only grow the team was a production and
not a real girl sitting in an interview
alone bedroom and I always bears the
same part that cabal remember took 20 or
22 hours a day back no down IP addresses
and stuff and making sort of I I at the
time was represented in hollywood by CAA
i write books and Hank guys and
environment of like mahadji blogger and
so I would call my agents and asked them
the names of the people i believe to be
the actors and same with a girl
continuance in any way so we're really
into this stuff and we were interested
in that world that's really you finish
my iphone your soul yeah yeah like two
weeks but it's still kind of this
renovation oh yeah okay so we decided to
start doing this on january first 2007
be committed to making a video while
back and forth I hang played the first
one I think the second one Hank would
make the third one back and forth for an
entire year and what was most
interesting thing about it from my
perspective is that for the first seven
months people who liked my books read it
I watch it I mean like there were 500
people the first day there were 500
people who watched it's like librarians
teenage girls mostly but mostly
librarians yeah that's really my coral
and so so we have this group of really
loyal librarians and teenage girls who
watched our video blogs and they were
great they did these amazing things you
they were only 500 of them like we we
pitched keep a dog work to them which is
a microfinance website that allows us
all that microfinance years we we talked
about that website after heck and I went
to the spent a few days in the Dominican
Republic touring with a microfinance
organization that works in Cuba we we
talked about this to each other through
the video blog and they get thousands of
dollars the Northmen within a couple
days and so it was amazing what they
could do but we always felt limited by
their songs and they started calling
themselves their advisor is very early
on all the sort of in jokes of our
community we call ourselves nerdfighters
because fight for nerds be there's a
there's a very popular phrase in the
narrative dftba which stands for don't
forget to be awesome and there's a queue
up is all those sort of originated
pretty early on and the but it was a
small group and then in July Hank
recorded a song negative song every
Wednesday that he has where the
Wednesday ain't recorded a song axio
deathly hallows that was about how
pissed off he was that hadn't played two
more days for the last harry potter book
and that day they've got a million views
and was featured on the front page of
YouTube thank you for that and because
it was featured on the front page of
YouTube this speaks to the power of of
what YouTube can do because it was
featured on from video music we have 36
thousand subscribers and that's the only
reason because we had to get out to an
audience that that didn't know who we
were independent
my books largely unknown there's this
huge community of people who interact
and they make videos with each other and
they talk to each other
right now right
and we weren't part of that we had our
own site and people went to our site to
view our videos and so we got we had
none of this life community effect
watching sort of following to you so we
weren't getting any of that exactly
often off off when our videos would have
0 comments on cereals age you know have
a thousand views in zero rating 0
comments and then after after deathly
hallows we realized both the power of
YouTube as a community builder which
I've ever thought about before I mean
that's one of the things I'm I wanted to
talk about was in fact if you look at
this page if I can scroll down I'm
really obsessed with the way that I'm
convinced that because I write books i'm
convinced in youtube is much more like
like a novel than it is like these kind
of channels are much more like novels
than they are like TV shows and I
actually think that sort of trying to
build it on a TV model is a really
profoundly flawed idea since Hank took
all comments the point of Maya my joke
is actually not relevant to that
actually the outlet I know a picture lon
okay so so this is this is Jim on TV
it's like we're brothers this is
genuinely collaboratively creating
content in a way that television can
never be because I make the video but
then the page changes based on new
uploads video responses what they say
and then the page also changes based on
on the comments so that it's
collaborative in a way that that
television can't be and in a way that I
think is somewhat analogous to the way
the novel is collaborative because when
when when one reads a book there's this
sort of active co-creation between the
author and the reader that is much more
like the co-creation of a
youtube page or page if you get excited
well so I I'm really interested in
building on that because i think that's
that's the most interesting part of the
most different and exciting part of of
what YouTube has has brought into the
world is this idea that our community is
not us telling a bunch of people what to
do or what school it's not it's not like
the hills yeah it's analogous to the
hills and it in one way which is that
people follow us around and watch the
things that we do we listen to the
things that we say obviously suck less
it has one of the big differences but
then also they it's not if not something
that they watch and consume it's
something that they become a part of
them that they participated they're
active creators
actually share some examples of the way
that you interacted with the community
and be constantly are talking about the
world around you I see things where
you're like sign up here or down here
and color on the bottom like everyone
read comics and help you the valley sort
of very strange that when you're on
YouTube I've known as its meeting people
and realize who have only seen on
YouTube you see them in a very sort of
particular way and I'm always surprised
by how tall or short they are all right
cuz on YouTube no easy to say I 10 and
they're all of that be this big so you
you're living this new environment and
that's where mostly are and so like you
have like stuff going on around here so
yeah so we can talk about the physical
physical you know we can point you can
point to a place where they can get more
information and now with the annotations
that's become yeah quite be easier you
just like to do this a little I love
that yeah but one of the things that
here's an example of one of the things
that we've done.we there was this
nerdfighter who moved to who read this
book by jeffrey sachs about how to end
world poverty and then he like the next
day decided moved to bangladesh to end
world poverty and he's a great kid and
his name is Sean up med and he lives in
Bangladesh and he works with a with kids
there because a school in Bangladesh
costs like five bucks Ella primary
school costs five bucks or semester and
that five bucks is often a sort of
bridge too far for these kids so that's
one of the main things that he does he
also helps by school textbooks and and
Hank is that actually
bhushan sponsoring okay nice to you guys
that this is our this is like our symbol
laverne fighter symbol and is when this
little kid in Bangladesh did the
nerdfighter simple but it does i mean
it's important to remember that that
there's a there's sort of a small small
segment of us to whom broadband internet
is available and and i think that can
create this this gulf between us and
them when we remember that there are
part of boston that they can throw their
fighter gang signs just the same way
that's important but when we we we met
this kid and got to talking to him and
and we talked about his work on our
videos and a lot of other people in the
nerdfighter community talked about his
work in their videos and then we ended
up raising money for him he's not an NGO
but we just sent him some money so that
you could help more kids and and the
idea was to do it in kind of a non
terrible way or in a way that you would
help a friend not in the way that you
would help that you would get me Terry
protect deductible donations
pepper and we've done a lot of things
like that if we find interesting yeah
really amazing about Shauna's I think
that goes out and is what I completely
to the people that just felt yeah so he
makes so that he follows it okay now so
he balls it up with a youtube video that
we all get to watch where we see our
actual dollars minus the seven percent
pay paltrow being spent in actual
Bangladesh and that sort of that is one
of the miracles youtube that that's
possible i mean this you know this kid
was able to thank Hank sort of live you
know words closer live it's not just
such to others since you photograph with
the child you've helped you get to like
like a 56 down have the conversation
with the family and they you know
correct jokes and their people and you
don't really see it as like property
being a person if you use
run but as soon as you see there's a
people issue and that's something that
goes really well
that we have really benefited from
because you know most videos that are
really popular and the ones of ours that
are really popular are you know
standalone you can do really well it's
funny and then but what YouTube lets us
do is be ourselves and then really kind
of feels like after a while that there
are friends and so there's might hang
out and every day they can hang out I
don't they would enjoy the and they'll
be doing where their friends as well
because they're common there that's
15 year old boys could I like yeah can
you talk a little bit about some of the
other life events that you've done
because I think that's one of the things
that you follow to use once you guys
started actually showing up in person
places I think there is some sort of
other people follow yeah yeah you have
to understand it like when you're a
working writer of novels for teenagers
you do a lot of book signings where two
people come and if you want to employ
your brains on the back your head again
ah that is what I come to feel that
events were I didn't know there was
another way too big other than just hard
and uh oh I mean do I that button which
is not a complaint about my audience my
books just that when I was a teenager I
didn't go see authors are liked so we
did this event a few months ago Hank and
I were in Grand Rapids Michigan talking
to a group of librarians and we at the
last second decided that we would just
go to a librarian and if people wanted
to come baby come and I think it would
be cool to and I would talk to them and
then I I would feel better because at
least you were doing we were there to be
something else we weren't there that and
100 kids me and not all kids yeah 80
kids in 28 28 notes and it was
absolutely surreal and it was so
enjoyable
on the ride back to the library
association I was like we've got a tunas
over and over and over and over in it
for the rest of our lives we got digits
we have to quit quit everything else I
can't we know abandon her abandon our
work and become professional nerd
fighting tour I just wanted to go to
sleep yeah I regarding out but now a
shower would support we're doing more
than an infectious after the reason
we're in chicago is because this
afternoon we're doing an event at
Carroll Washington public library which
is like three 300 kids are going to me
and i was in new york city yesterday and
we flash mob day Martin opal stone got
kicked out and then we had to go attack
apart the Union Square Park and got
another use for parking then we had to
go
coming out for the rest of the night
it looks awesome let's go a little more
background because I think you post that
up Tuesday's I've been like excited like
they're from Chicago you know this is
great meant finding out that Hank is
coming too and then I see the blog post
for you like I'm in New York I'm in the
middle of Times Square come medium you
know 24 hours less than I was like 16
yeah so on wednesday night you told
people show up at six pm let's just see
who comes to the lines of noble yeah and
and then by the time that it happened
but like barnes and noble had been
informed by someone and the corporate
was angry at him particularly because he
has to he has to maintain really it's
gonna be on you and the fact remains
exactly the thing I so we can talk about
the fact remains that Carnival is our
absolute favorite store thank you hi
thank God for them I mean really really
in the whole video yeah that's our
future yeah just my voice a number an ad
can we make more money what's the CPM on
an avid tickets the whole screen is
dynamic actually we will just make
videos at our ass oh no now you're
opening up the gamut so good anything to
get the CPM oh yeah well so what are
your thoughts on me some of that I
didn't actually want to do oh yeah could
we like who here I don't know what you
do i do you more and more people work in
answer and or is your kind of
and then other of you are like so so
those of you who are in ads what do you
think about YouTube how's it yeah
housing is that life is shining on your
radar screen well I mean it's gotta be
that's funny but it's got to be a tiny
percentage of the revenue of the side I
mean maybe maybe it would turn this into
a small sales pitch but I don't you
definitely a big part of what we're
trying to do in figure her own and it's
not like I mean that's why like have you
come in and talk about this even the
odds what this wasn't what we grew up on
and so now in the last year I think
we're all really trying to figure out
like what is it what is it about you
what's engaging for people and I do
think I think advertising is a little
bit different than it is on on TV and in
a similar way that there's a way to if
you can really mean it fits YouTube
Google model really well because if you
can really target advertisements to the
right people in the way to do with
Google
I think that you have an opportunity you
can never have on something on
television because our community is very
interested in very specific things and
they're not interested in 10,000 BC
coming out on DVD excellent you know
like they don't care valen they're not
interested in in red red stripe beer
well we only get those outs because
we're over hi I'm the majority of our
audience are under 18 so they don't fit
along well they literally don't get
there there was a intel and a reckoning
yeah yeah your audience care about that
yes yeah they're nerds so they care
about all nerdy stuff they care about
like iPhones and HP yeah any nerdity
they actually largely don't care about
spending money is the problem that we
have yeah we're trying to work on that
was right now we have the same problem
and we can like morally we can't really
say that we're favors been so we're
trying to find we're trying to try the
way around that like is there something
you can advertise its free at the goal
pill hey lot of money to advertise baby
hope maybe my dog brock obama duck all
good maybe that maybe that's the only
method obama's not yet contacted us I
have a boy oh god we only got a platform
your have the right to say yes
no no we can say yes or no the
advertisers though we can say yes or no
to the idea of advertising but we can't
say you guys are no two particular
advertisers which doesn't as it bothered
me i have to say because I I feel like
you know Hank Hank Hank runs an
environmental technology website and
when someone tries to sell for instance
a clean coal add to him he won't take it
because that's greenwashing blog for
this one of a few items so but but that
kind of thing hasn't happened with
youtube yet you know exactly John McCain
regularly advertises on our on our
YouTube page and I am more than happy to
make this money get said it all over me
may the larger problem I mean it in
terms of the way content providers deal
I think is that the CPM has not gotten
to the place where they'd like it to be
you know and and it it's not and it's
tough because in this is biscuit into
something that peg and I talk a lot
about which is the you emphasize viral
videos which get more short-term traffic
or view emphasize community-based groups
sort of the channel versus video model
which do you emphasize in terms of how
you try to build your community I think
if you if you emphasize viral videos
then the CPM doesn't have to be very hot
because no one's getting
do it for a living because you either
get bit by an alligator or you don't
can't control what their conscience in
my house you know if you that would be a
great idea you should just go out and do
the long hot sex yes yes yes that's
that's why your videos get more but i
think if you emphasize the channel model
which is something that we feel really
strongly about in terms of the long-term
growth of a site like YouTube I mean
what's best about YouTube in our minds
is is the community aspect of it the
fact that the fact that you can change
the content of the page no matter who
you are and no matter how popular the
video is you can still affect the way
the page books and the way the page
sounds and feels in the vibe of the
little experience that that to me is
ultimately a much better way to build a
long-term audience and I think most of
YouTube's Grove is probably there
there's plenty of there's plenty of
people that can that can host viral
bidding this you know break.com can host
viral videos but they can never have the
kind of community based at you so it's a
tremendous advantage so that's it
yeah actually since you guys are such
big YouTube power users
probably longer do you have any requests
or what would you love to see the
channel be able to do the product is
there anything that you're like just
frustrated with our John I've started
talking about you put about increasing
the quality and you just step that up a
little bit it looks much better but
there are several several other sites
and the big differences that I can see
and you know I don't know why that is
working for those legacy problems there
but
that that's something that I'd like the
first I was like what do I care like so
they can see more of my pimples and
there that I didn't shave that morning
yeah I mean mostly what we deal with
like what we do is just talk so it
Jonathan start well I think if you look
at depends on if you look at it slanted
channel like jamesnintendonerd who has
sort of half left youtube which is
really unfortunate because he has a
pretty good show if you like old
nintendo games which i do and i do so
it's perfect and his because because he
uses a lot of screen captures or moving
uses a lot of like video very like like
you watch tetris happen that quality
matters there i mean if you're looking
at my face I don't think qualities and
discipline like I think that if you for
content like that which is more and more
of what's really popular or what's
growing in popularity on youtube in
terms of channels it's those kind of
high production quality videos that a
lot of time goes into instead of just
you know what was initially popular was
what the hot girl stares into a camera
for six minutes and rambles and then and
then that was sort of replaced by people
rambling into a camera but with quick
cuts so it's not boring and then now
we're starting to see higher production
qualities channels like I don't know if
you guys are familiar with cute with
Chris the cupid chris is a really good
example of
that's become quite popular in the last
six months or so it's a pizza dude who
shows up pictures and cute kittens but
he clearly hates cute kittens which
which makes for a really pleasant
tension and ambiguity in his videos and
he's also a really funny guy sites like
that that do have production value are
growing on the side right now yeah but I
don't believe we like I I like our
audience like I would love I would love
to be on the front page again and and to
be able to get to a different audience
but what I really like is there a buzz
about that one yeah yeah because
sometimes you see something you think
someone broke into google it brings lots
of walls language yeah so I don't have
anyone has questions but they're
different lights please feel free to ask
or even without was one of the things
went to ask is is the one thing that we
talked about pointing to is just what
can you were can you video blog from
here within the office and he does a lot
for many different
very where is the oddest place and or
the weirdest reaction that you had the
camera I belong I travel a lot so I'd
login airport all the time and you have
to Kenan you have screen and camera and
you have to time yourself between the
stupid security announcements about how
you're not allowed to have anything over
3 ounces which they played every six
minutes it's ridiculous because no one
is in the airport for only six minutes
big but anyway that's I'm hearing of the
home and raised in Orange oh god he's
been orders for five years yeah he's
coming um but so I a lot of people come
up to you and ask what you're doing I
just have one in Times Square and this
girl was like how can I be in your video
Kirsten but I don't usually have
reactions you know one time I went I was
in the Denver International Airport I
literally set up my tripod and i did a
stop motion animation of myself laying
down in a Chairs like this except
there's no there's a little arm rests so
that you can actually relax of course so
laying down on the armrest and then i
moved like six inches like 24 times and
i did this this this stop-motion
animation would be rolling like sliding
across the sheraton dinner
nobody did anything now my favorite
thing in that video is that there's a
dude right behind you the row behind
you're reading a book never work zone
which I think simultaneously speaks to
certain peoples of witness yeah also to
their general embarrassment like I don't
know what that guys doing but this year
in final damages there was a couple of
like is that terrorism I know what what
he's doing isn't right I don't usually
see that well you did there with the top
of yo yeah but we do I thing that you
have to be most conscious chef is the
stupid dead howto hitted idea called
copyright it's right as it as a public
yeah I mean as it as an author I feel
like it's in a position to say that with
some measure of authority it's just such
a stupid idea and so when you're in an
airport or when you're in any kind of
public space we have to be conscious of
what's going in the background because
or anything which is how much of a how
much of how much of Catcher in the Rye
enjoyed quote for quote from when I'm
getting a team
to be catcher there I maybe talk a
little bit more about the background of
what it was a nerdfighter or how do you
sum up the audience and your topics
because I think some people for some
people web advantage to the show what is
it I think far too seriously about the
concept of a nerdfighter like I spent
time thinking about like the actual
definition contradict itself and its
that's not fun to talk about necessarily
appetite to me it's what basically all
of these people who have unhealthy
obsessions with something and we all
kind you know it might be baseball
statistics it might be
but we all have these weird I think
collectible card games was mine
nerdfighter song like magic the
gathering and originally all
nerdfighters were asked to write their
own better song to the tune of John bro
to me and knocked me
that tradition has passed though we have
hundreds of them yeah we have a huge
collection of what mostly weirdly most
about Harry Potter mostly about Gary
bothering him play but some of them are
about cats yeah that was the original
idea it's basically like you know John
put there was once a comment and i think
it just said you are a nerd three
letters when their interest building in
you are d and and John said I think
saying I notice your nerd is like saying
hey I noticed that you care about
important things and aren't obsessed
with the fact that
that you
Barry Allen
yeah but that's basically the idea is
that sometimes kids need need to know
that the way that they are is actually
quite good and I mean if we win and if I
have kids and they turn out to be a nerd
or yeah it's much better that's that my
son is going to Rhode Island be like
like unlike the star pitcher of a high
school baseball to you and I'm just got
like I much better than all the other
entities you know how all of everything
in high school is difficult but it
doesn't seem that way it seems no it
doesn't it you old ally basically over
like it feels like it feels it always
felt to me like you were sort of on the
outside of the awesome there was
something there was something awesome
happening that didn't that you work
there wasn't available to you and an
hour idea with this community is to put
people on the inside of the awesome and
to put people on me in time in a way
that the popular kids won't get you know
because like they won't they won't get
our jokes they won't get roading your
tab jokes like they won't get obscure
harry potter references you know that
and there's that's a huge opportunity
for us to to for you to feel like like
your kind of inside the beltline
develop organic something I really like
about the project and in fact I had a
friend recently one of my good friends
runs a video site called video gum and
she was watching a couple of our videos
and she said I would love to post these
but for something that got 50,000
viewers it's really inside the beltway
like it doesn't make any sense but I
don't understand any of the jokes I'm
sure they're funny but I don't get and
instead take that as kind of a bad job
on Yoshi enemies updates the first time
yeah miss Foley and in general the
awesomest thing about the Internet is
that no matter what group of people you
create content for their there are tens
of thousands of them yeah you can create
content for homosexual
midgets who like goth and you will get
10,000 news
there hey which is a surprising amount
of running yeah so so basically we
create content for John's audience young
nerdy girls and now we have 50,000 young
nerdy girls following us everywhere we
have boys at well and adult I mean
there's a prize anything from my
perspective side shows us that Stephanie
for seventy percent of our audiences
female and seventy percent of our
audience is under 18 yeah the other the
other thirty percent of our audience is
really what makes its survival possible
because you need adults in that in a
community like this you need adults to
kind of raise the level of discourse
because otherwise I don't know if you
guys are familiar this a series of
vampire novel sculpted by light but
otherwise all anyone ever talks about is
Twilight for for for the hills in fact
there was I mean here we have these
discussion boards where there are tons
of really interesting discussions really
really fascinating stuff that you can't
believe that teenagers would ever think
and then we also have you know in depth
discussion of bills so you know
teenagers don't have that high culture
local culture barrier that we have as
much about which work to their advantage
of some
questions otherwise I
oh so I know you guys were you guys
we're talking about like possibly being
able to kind of choose your everything
have you ever considered like becoming a
publisher for work for us right but
becoming a publisher and being able to
choose like which brands you like to put
on your site and then getting like a
percentage of their sale I know that
that existed yes it's like in New
Romantics that we have so why does your
work doesn't work as good answer does it
only work with us I thought that's like
your whole head is covered in tents to
see the metaphor to basically what
happens is you know you get to like
apply to different advertisers and say
no I want to put answer actually HD
small business or climb down for a
little banner for HP on my site and when
people click on it if it will cook in
the machine and if they make a purchase
then you'll get a research yeah so you
don't have to worry about do you get a
quick quick money he's only made a
purchase yeah right online publisher I
parts yeah
but advertise to I mean it make sense if
you just have a ton of these foods that
not many people that would actually buy
things like your model has a lot of
brother ascetic doesn't have their own
right no I'm you can have you can add
one of our friend is still sexy Phil you
did that for a while basically was like
these people help me get out of debt
which is sort of creepy thing but
actually they did so you can
yeah I do you think I do think that's a
good that's a good model I don't know I
don't know how well it worked for us can
you do it can you do it on your YouTube
page or would can only do it on yer so
we do it on on our site yeah I mean that
if we've actually because a CPM problems
so where's the bad kids my quest 10
because yeah you know young people don't
see ads yeah they're like it some
critics have no no vision yeah it's
faster tank dance right yeah we have so
guess I'm just going on see their bad I
mean they can't figure out what our
audience is they're like ah ringtone
yeah okay actually I thought I Bob free
codes through that side so well we
probably there to go we're doing it that
way so just throw on that question I
guess the answer to you guys like that
could you ever make a living doing this
or are there people in this community or
do you see that happening in the near
future if the CPM double which is it
which would still be pretty low in terms
of there were more more than fifty
percent of our advertising was in video
and
tising and we work we work really hard
than we could we would it be me be
honest Hank Hank and I both have jobs
that we that we really like and make
sort of like working at Google really
good jumps and I wouldn't want to I I
wouldn't want to stop right in any way I
don't think anyone is gone your site so
so in that sense we it's not something
that we would want and then we would
come fight and claw for the way that
other people have there are people who
make a living I think it's a round pot
yeah that's that not an exaggeration i
think i could name them and i think it's
about mama yeah Michael luckily because
of what the show which is a very
personal person of all variants or
community oriented
we talk about celebrity gossip
I don't know we would like no but he
it's like a million views on every one
of his videos and he's not making I'm
sure he does all right but he hasn't his
job yeah I want to yeah and I think I
think there are the fact is most of the
really successful content creators on
YouTube are also putting something else
that they were doing before so there are
a couple exceptions to that but i think
that was sort of their sort of secondary
and i started doing this apartment
because writing is really lonely if
you're stuck inside of a you're here in
your basement of your lazy boy all day
alone never talk to anyone
I was like this could be a way to do
some collaborative work
test
is the center of your community the
area or if you have something off-site
dense
let's get grudging it's a good question
with it does it difficult that's why I
say that the center of our community is
off-site most people don't you are
content that way because most people
aren't active they're active watching
videos
the Commons go so crazy
discussion
yeah I mean one of the disadvantages of
YouTube when you're popular is that it's
difficult to have just meaning full
discussion in the comments because of
the way the comments section is it only
displays 10 comments at a time and they
just scrolling scrolling scrolling as
there's a problem where it can post a
reply comment
if you view all of the comments it looks
like a reply comment but if you just do
the front page it comes up as a monotone
and it's just like sitting there by
itself and you don't know what it's a
required that's a that's a very that's a
very difficult problem to address I
think in fact I like the way I like the
new way better than the old way because
it just it's just hard I mean we have
the same struggle on our on our forum
which is designed for this you know it
has a much wider screen or you can wear
you can you text it's still really hard
and so the center of these conversations
that we have we have a social networking
site using ning com is that they're
fighters com but I would I don't know
that i decree actually because I think
you and I said a lot that's true but
it's not our community that's everything
yeah but I think for a lot of I think
for a lot of people the center of it as
any to most of the best my way you can
watch it I that's the community that I
am more part to be honest yeah because
the that includes a lot of other
channels right right that's true I think
I I honestly I don't when I'm thinking
about the way the nerdfighter community
functions I don't think of youtube intro
fighters com separately they have been
that sort of eating back and forth into
each other because we link
decide on our videos and then it
wouldn't work with when you're watching
them at their being you we often send
people back to you so it goes the work
flow like this yeah and for the future
of YouTube that would be very cool to
have some kind of more
baby I week
actually integrate
would be really awesome for us yeah that
would be cool yeah that seems hollered
the community at the thing though is
really good substitution they're like
kind of numbers and yeah and they're
great they're like they're really they
know how time to take care of themselves
they call it total each time in
neglected drink and there's also an
external bulletin board that was he
looking for like bring it back my
profile there has like 10,000 posts oh I
need to preserve the head for my
personal identity so that I can tell but
I am that much of the door which fair
enough I'm you'd end up in post basic if
you're working hard actually you guys
kind of Angie
the hump right before I have to ask down
another floor let's ask it again off to
the uncultured project resources yeah
and you know it lets out things like
Twitter and Facebook and all this stuff
I mean you guys try and direct that
just something that
i'm going to start tweeting about
nerdfighters then all of a sudden you
just kind of integrated adopted Debbie
doesn't grow organically or you guys
trying to direct that grease
architecture around
Liam both winning for us when we try to
create a few architecture but when it
grows organically and then we sort of
create the architecture afterwards that
fence that worked better for us the only
there are a few things that we did
thoughtfully we created this site at the
end of two thousand seven at the end of
our year-long project where we were
talking every day we created at the site
that decision that would be something
that was about at work but everything
else I think that we're trying to do
thoughtfully in advance
we yeah it tends to go much better when
we let them tell us what they need
rather than trying to put them inside of
the box
that basically like
is there
like first they'll tell you secondly
concrete
right don't be like you know I I tried
very hard to try and convert all the
nerdfighters from the old
attention to treat them and I'm like
yeah you know they're also like we do
yeah we don't we all run them okay
that's run by fans yeah there's a bunch
of there's a bunch of group I mean I i
find i find facebook so I'm just told
many friends for it yeah yeah I'm tility
and a utility hocus based on like having
can I was like I took a highly honest
update page nothing like I thought I I
really i find it helpful almost
exclusively for finding former
girlfriends which is massively unhealthy
and like very good always ever
accomplished you never walk away that
experience getting better about yourself
than one and then secondarily for just
accepting friend requests which is
fulfilling its way yes I know it but no
it doesn't sort of it doesn't feel me
Tori there's actually a hankering
myspace page that I'd that you don't run
my mouth yeah yeah yeah there's
something there's something there's some
take me among faces which is hilarious
like one I'm so funny okay actually so
I got a couple of you guys one of the
things that you have done pretty
regularly question Tuesday's I don't
have eight questions for you but I would
question to both of you I figure
thinking about before well it's branded
by but we'll go ahead and in this way so
the first one is for Hank if you are a
type of fuel / source of energy what
kind of vicious that there is like some
sort of life's manibusan you may still
be his life there's a lifespan of those
things yeah what are we talking about
that's good understand that one twice
lifespan
okay I meet John if you designed a nerd
fighters flag what would it have or
actually a more state flag at first
that's a fine i don't know nerdfighters
have states maybe maybe I like the
Alaska State for a great lunch with
those six starts maybe I guess it would
be there's the skull and crossbones it
was a concept yeah but then someone
actually implemented it it's like a
skull and by the Pirates go across the
bony fingers probably mute flight after
you mind someone actually made a
nerdfighter flag really yeah it's got
the hands in the middle and it's got
Latin around the logo and it says
everything sounds yeah sounds important
in mind okay in the last question is the
book
one is your favorite game yeah I
wonderful thing about having a job in
every every other days of the week was
their meeting brother to point out
Wednesday before never do so because
either i wouldn't happening video we
didn't every other weekday so you it's
like Monday Tuesday
whether I would not make the video I
don't think a song Tuesday's would suck
because I be writing this song but
Wednesday's would be great because I'll
just like by the song done yeah when we
were doing it every day to Tuesday was
Tuesday was Monday I could handle men i
went to do two videos that we Thea and
you hope you've already helped me get
before right right there's the free
apron oh hey you guys so much for coming
