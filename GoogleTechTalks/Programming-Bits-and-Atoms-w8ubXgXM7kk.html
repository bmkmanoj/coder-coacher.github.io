to welcome to Google Neil Gershenfeld
Neil's a physicist and you know you
often hear about the idea of physics
envy from the softer sciences that
biology and even sometimes a computer
science and economics and so on and I
think it's people like Neil that that
phrase comes from and not so much the
way you usually hear about it of OG
they've got these nice equations that
sort of define the whole world because
that's not where where Neil is rather
he's embracing this messy world and not
trying to solve it with one simple
equation but trying to embrace that
messiness and even more so because he's
got all the cool toys and he gets to
play with quantum computing and nano
fabrication and nanotechnology and all
that fun stuff so Neil tell us about
your toys ok thanks F Peter so there's
two ways to view this talk one is
there's three themes that keep coming up
in discussions with people from google
on internet zero conformal computing and
field fab for internet access and so I
thought passing through this is a good
afternoon to bring them together and
take stock of those three topics and the
way I want to do that is I'm here also
for an event Ray Kurzweil is doing
tomorrow in San Jose and David
Dalrymple's an amazing eight-year-old
hooray and I've been mentoring since he
was eight he's now 14 and a grad student
with me and David wrote this very
interesting question where as far as he
can tell i believe computers as we know
them will collapse and become part of
reality and as far as you can tell ray
believes reality as we know it will
collapse and become part of computers
and this question is how to relate those
two and i think that's an accurate
portrayal so what I want to do in the
next 45 minutes is talk about how I
think computers as we know will collapse
and become part of reality and along the
way hit the area
that have come up in discussions with
Google so I'm going to do this in steps
in the first step which is a very short
term step is this is a paper I wrote a
few years ago with enough you know danny
cohen he's very interesting person
Danny's now a distinguished engineer at
Sun but roughly he was the person who
said I'm separated what we now know is
TCP and UDP from IP tcp and IP were the
same thing essentially and he wanted to
early VoIP and said routing a package
should be different than controlling the
flow of it and so he said this very
interesting he also started Moses he's
very interesting history of kind of
teasing out nuggets and Danny had looked
at what to me was just an engineering
hack we number of years ago we're
looking at kind of device physics of
people and computers interacting and had
done a bunch of test beds this was for
the White House for the Millennium a
series of installations like a bathroom
shelf to manage medication this was
furniture in the Museum of Modern Art to
navigate information without what look
like computers a stage for the flying
Karamazov brothers to juggle sounds this
was a building as theater in Barcelona
where the building itself was the
performance each night and in each of
these we're doing something else but had
to connect stuff to a network and it
cost too much in dollars pins power wat
lot of resources and we ended up doing a
very simple trick which was bits have a
duration and a speed and that
corresponds to a size if the bit is
smaller than the network it sees it if
it's bigger than the network it doesn't
if it's bigger than the network you can
then ignore the network and so it's sort
of like Morse code we would just hit hit
whatever the medium was make a transient
this is a few hundred 90 seconds of
ringing and then just simply time the
transients and so just like Morse code
and what was nice about that is you
could do it over any topology and you
could do it over any link you would just
kind of hit it and time these transients
and the only good parameter you believe
is the onset of this transients so for a
dollar you can make a web browser but
more than that a web server but more
than that it can communicate over any
physics you give it of wired or wireless
so that wasn't research that was
an engineering hack in support of those
projects and the name so the name
internet zero emerged from an Internet
to architect kept saying how fast can
this go and we were explaining that it's
bad to send broadband video to light
bulbs so it's not internet too and I
just said its internet zero to try to
shut them up but the name stuck and it's
pretty accurate as a layer below which
you can think of as Internet one and so
this is what an eysie row packet looks
like it's it's it's self clock so
there's no performance numbers this is
something Danny Ed's dressed one of the
reasons I p scaled is unlike almost any
standard you know it's not tied to
performance numbers and so in the same
way it's it's self-consistently self
clocked and is just transients so this
is an icy road packet and it looks like
a barcode and that's the point you could
read it optically and put it in a wire
and it would be a valid packet you could
blink lights and you can play it
acoustically and so Danny then pulled
together bob kahn and len klein rock and
a bunch of his internet architecture
buddies and what came out of that
meeting was this very interesting
parallel i still considered this a one
dollar engineering hack not a subject of
serious study but there was this very
interesting parallel that back when the
internet emerged what's now motherhood
and apple pie is there were packet
switched networks and they were
dissimilar so sat net and PR net and
ARPANET and either they didn't talk at
all or you had to configure state at the
boundary and in fact you in this slide I
had read blocks there in Bob Kahn asked
me to take one out because the big one
of the bigger problems wasn't just you
had to configure state there was no
state that you couldn't get from one to
the other and so the solution back then
was to agree on a representation of a
packet that's independent of the medium
that transports it and so we now have IP
but today think about the stuff around
us if you want to do say 80 to 15 for to
a wireless device and to an IR device
and home plug to an AC power line device
and I used to 18,000 epc to an RFID tag
they have nothing to do with each other
and so if you want to go from like RFID
to I are they have nothing to do with
each other you have to configure state
at the boundary or they don't talk at
all and it's really exactly the
situation the internet was in a few
decades ago
and so in retrospect is that this didn't
start as a project to solve this problem
but in retrospect what was going on is
by agreeing on a representation of a
packet that's independent the medium
it's recursing on the original
architecture of the internet down to the
physics and so it means you do inner
device internet working instead of
internet working at layer three you
effectively internet work at layer one
so to go oh I don't have the rest of the
picture here but to go from ultrasound
optical de ir it's all just timing
transients and you just simply change
the transients from one medium to
another and that's familiar from Morse
code when you flash it on it light or
click a telegraph you don't change Morse
code but today just about all the
standards we use like 80 to 15 for
specify the medium and the data rate and
the framing and the encoding and
absolutely everything so Internet 0
emerged as really a layer below the
internet it's sub-optimal and that's the
point if you want to saturate channel
capacity don't do this but if the
biggest problem isn't throughput but the
cost of complexity then it makes sense
to internet work just like IP is
suboptimal for everything but just good
enough for almost anything so that's
where Internet 0 emerged from and I have
a bunch of these with me this is a one
dollar device and it it it's ipv6 stack
it runs web server it's which is a
couple amp load read sensor inputs does
peer-to-peer associations for control
systems if we have time at the end I'll
set it up and do a demo of web pages
from it and building distributed control
structures the reason it exists then is
again this was just this engineering
hack for projects the internet
architects got interested then a couple
things happen Greg papadopoulos on CTO
volunteered a standards person to help
develop a standards process around this
and then there's a very strong reaction
from the building industry and so that's
what's really driving it and in turn
energy is what really what's driving it
so there have been countless attempts at
smart homes smart buildings that
unbalanced haven't been all that
exciting or that significant
commercially on the other hand in the
u.s. building
is a trillion dollars a year it's so big
you don't notice it the cost of labor in
the building industry is 300 billion
dollars a year the whole it equals the
Hawaii tea industry jut just labor for
building buildings so there's this huge
overhang of an industry much bigger than
just about any industry you can think of
and Cisco doesn't make anything relevant
to them essentially to first order
because when the cost of labor is 300
billion you're doomed if the light bulb
needs first a network installer to
install the light bulb and then an IT
department to run the light bulb so the
interesting in internet 0 wasn't the
throughput to the late light bulb it was
getting rid of network topology by just
using these transients so that the
skills you have to service the light
bulb with energy and information but
there is no architecture beyond that
turning it back into what electricians
do the initial interest from the
building industry was the cost of
configuration that in this room somebody
has to make a wiring diagram of what
switches go to what lights and what
thermostats go to what VIII IV units so
the initial interest was just soft state
that occupants can can make the
associations as a distributed data
structure but then as energy exploded
what really has taken off is this energy
is the killer app buildings in the US
use forty percent of the energy they use
seventy percent of the electricity not
industrial processes just buildings
being buildings so seventy percent of
the electricity and of that a number of
different studies come to the same
conclusion that about a third of it is
wasted now the third that's wasted some
of that is for inefficiency like those
light bulbs over there don't know the
windows open and it's a sunny day and in
between deciding are the lights on and
off the light bulbs can adjust to what's
the natural light and the air handlers
to what the window is doing the bigger
one though and this was really
eye-opening is it's hard to quantify and
we're trying to quantify but it looks
like a larger fraction of that isn't
inefficiency it's it's over deficiency
its warring subsystems and buildings
it's like heaters and coolers running at
the same times and fans blowing against
each other and just valves that aren't
opening and just just this sort of sea
of broken stuff and misconfigured
stuff and it's familiar if you think
about running a network all the things
that go wrong and and you would fix but
buildings don't have the intelligence to
find that so there's all of this over
deficiency and how buildings are running
so numerically it's the biggest energy
win available it's a number of tens of
percent of three-quarters of the energy
so why isn't it happened there a whole
bunch of reasons but the starting point
is to add a control point to a building
today is maybe fifty dollars because
first for the device and then for the
installer and then it goes into a
central control system and somebody has
to modify the central control system for
the control point you added and so this
is exactly the bitnet era where you had
to add a mainframe and configure the
mainframe and what you need is an
Internet in buildings you need to
incremental e extend the building when
you have one new sensor actuator to
bring it down to the incremental cost
that's a dollar and so the interest in
retrospect and internet zero is by
getting rid of topology you can make
internets in buildings they're very
their sub optimal for performance it's a
microsecond over a building so it's
about a megabit is the data rate so kind
of DSL speeds on down but in return you
can get rid of topology so what that's
growing into now is a project I to a
intelligent infrastructure for energy
efficiency this started from a core team
working on internet zero of companies
like Cisco and Schneider Electric if you
don't know them they're squared the
industrial controls to wear and over
building controls juno lighting much of
the electrical industry commercializing
this but then we started working with
the National Labs Argonne National Lab
National Renewable lab that had building
efficiency programs but not really a
technology platform to implement
essentially a building internet that
wasn't their skills and so this has
grown into a larger program with
Department of Energy and then a number
of utilities and energy labs in other
countries starting with this bottom
layer of IP over anything to anything at
the cost and complexity what
electricians do adding the fine grain
sensing and actuation online measurement
modeling and prediction distributed
control systems then interfaces with
people
full and active and passive building
systems and utilities to really scale up
to do these tens of percent recovery so
that's turning into the forcing function
to bring IP to leaf nodes and I think in
turn that's going to drag many other
things behind it but energy is what's
really going to bring this into the
infrastructure so we're just at the
point now of this was a test bed of
hundreds of nodes and we have some early
field trials in buildings seeing really
appalling things like oh just I was
looking at the data from one building
just at MIT where instrumenting it with
this the cooling time constant was 20
minutes and the air conditioner turns on
at four in the morning to get the
building ready for everybody and
everywhere you look there are these
horrible and efficiencies just because
you can't see what's going on oh and
yeah this was a fun recent test bed in
the Venice Biennale a group of
Architects we work with coming out of
that Barcelona testbed did essentially
hyperlinks for reality they made cartoon
versions of all kinds of furniture and
then this is all a big internet zero
network and then it's interfaced into a
virtual shared environment with these
hundreds of objects so like when you
make paella your paella pan tells your
friends you're making paella and when
you go to the fridge it talks to you the
different spaces you're in or have
shared spaces but in the object so it's
playing with kind of hyperlinks for
reality building on these devices so
that's bullet one and this isn't very
far out this is it's getting
commercialized now by the kinds of
companies i mentioned IP over anything
to anything for a dollar not competing
with all the stuff you know but really a
layer below it now i'm going to go one
step further out bill Butera was a grad
student who came to me with a vision and
then he carried on with this to intel he
didn't want a web server for a dollar
you can put in a switch or a light bulb
he wanted to just paint the computer on
the wall and if he didn't have enough
computer you'd put on another coat of
computer and so he was a former chip
designer and so he was asking how would
you program a paintable computer and so
this was peace push pins with ARM
processors emulating a few millimeters
of silicon
and it's a postscript interpreter this
is PostScript conventionally interpreted
here these are doing short-range
probabilistic local memory sharing with
mobile code and then they're just
statistically by looking at the
propagation of messages in the network
inferring geometry and then they're
doing a pigeon subset of PostScript but
real postscript in stroking letters so
to make a postscript interpreter but
unlike this projector if you need more
PostScript you make it twice as big and
if you shoot a gun through the middle
nothing happens and the medium is the
PostScript there is an an i/o processor
and a rip processor and so that was an
existence proof you could do something
like this it had a lot of constraints
though these were fairly heavy weight
there's lots of code and one of the
biggest constraints was we had a
compiler to go from problems like this
distributed data storage or sensors or
graphics to mobile code and the compiler
was bill you would say bill I want to do
a distributed data storage and he would
think about it and write some
probabilistic shared memory mobile code
and it would work but couldn't really
tell you exactly sort of quite why or
how and it was hard to automate bill and
also to really physically make paint
needed breakthroughs in many different
area and powers come packaging and so
paintable computing is expanded into a
broader program to do conformal
computing so in conformal computing what
we're trying to do is make computers
that unlike a box can cover surfaces and
fill volumes they can be incrementally
extended so if you need two percent more
server for two percent more hits you
just open the top and add two percent
resource you can change form factors
it's physically distributed for
distributed problems and operates
reliably with unreliable parts so I'm
going to come back to the physical
embodiments but we're doing this from
high performance computing limits two
arrays of commodity microcontrollers to
a six we're developing that do this down
to scaling to nano structures but the
question is if you have resources like
this how do you program it now the
endpoint we can see these are a number
of different projects Peter alluded to
at the beginning this was one of the
world's first quantum computers this is
a cryptosystem in optical propagation
in each of these each logical degree of
freedom in the computer is a physical
degree of freedom these are computing
and exactly you understand computing
there's bits and they do logic but
there's one physical degree of freedom a
photon nuclear spin and each physical
degree of freedom is a logical degree of
freedom these aren't yet very large
computers but their computers at that
limit where the physical degrees of
freedom are the same as the
computational ones at that point you
really can't maintain the fiction that
computer science is distinct from
physical science so the reason Center
for bits and atoms exist is I never
understood that boundary and a number of
colleagues if you think about the
projection on physics and chemistry and
math there's information the bits and
there's a physical property of the atoms
and I never understood the boundary
between it and from the 50s forward
computer science has essentially sought
and succeeded to hide the physics from
the programs in the programmer so you
operate an abstraction and then there's
many levels of description before you
get to the physics but that abstraction
is beginning to break in lots of
different areas it's breaking in if you
look in high-performance computing and
interconnect bottlenecks and in total
power budget and power density and just
cost of taping out and shipping software
maintaining this fiction that the
software lives in this area abstract
universe unanchored by the physics
requires more and more heroic
engineering to maintain the physics
instead when you get to this point you
just can't do it it's the same variables
and so I want to argue that the only
scalable model of computation is physics
the model of computation has to have the
same variables and same resources as
physics and scale the same way as
physics does otherwise it's a fiction
that you're trying to hide and so I want
to show you emerging insights into what
does a low-level language a high-level
language and operating system look like
that has the same resources as physics
and scales with the physics so an
inspiration for this was this is a
beautiful thesis in the seventies Roger
banks did with a thesis of Marvin Minsky
and
redken and it was just a theoretical
question our cellular automata
computationally Universal so it's a very
simple CA there's a 1-bit state and
there's only three rules and with those
three rules that's a why or that's a
corner and that's a boolean gate and so
he showed you could do boolean logic
it's excruciating to do it this way you
wouldn't want to do it but it was a a
constructive proof of the universality
of CAS but we were inspired by that and
have cleaned it up to map it on to both
the needs of computing in the needs of
physics and so the modern version we're
doing of that is asynchronous logic
automata so there are cells each cell
implements a logical operation so we're
not using lots of cells to construct a
logical operation that's the primitive
and then there are tokens that can be 0
1 or empty and each logic cell waits for
valid input tokens in an empty output
token and pushes the state so here our
logic gates those are interconnect cells
it's a cross over these are ones to
create and destroy these asynchronous
tokens and then there's a stem cell talk
about at the end so you should think of
this as cartoon physics in that in this
world essentially space equals time
equals state equals logic what I mean by
that is there are no wires there's only
interactions of cells the time the
distance you travel equals the time it
takes to travel it equals the number of
states you can store and it equals the
number of logical operations you can do
usually those are completely different
resources but because each is
represented locally they all scale the
same way it means we propagate by
propagation delay but that's a few
orders of magnitude slower than light
state-of-the-art propagation is
picoseconds over microns for a fast
transistor and so it still is nano
seconds per millimeter which is on the
order of speeds you run chipset today
limited by other things so it's not a
severe cost so in this asynchronous
logic automata world for example here's
a linear time sort it's it's for people
care about sorting it it's the structure
of an odd even sort but it's kind of
unroll
does a picture these are comparators
here and then these are switchers and so
the data goes through the comparators
and then it gets either switched up and
down and runs back and forth and it
takes linear time for data to go from
one end of this to the other so it's a
linear time sort and there's nothing
special going on it's just when you do n
log n sorting you're not counting the
order n storage of the data that you're
sorting but here storage caught cost the
same as computation so the storage gives
you takes an N squared algorithm and
makes it order n here's a router this
came up in incremental extensibility of
routing so here's here our routes here's
how you check the route but this is a
router that's just sort of an extensible
medium and so I'll show implementations
if you need more router you just make
the picture bigger the router isn't
defined by the granularity of a content
addressable memory this is a
cryptosystem it's a feistel cipher
reduce down to the logical essence so
here's the letter C ba going in and then
in a second you'll see coming across
this is the S box these are the bit
rotations and here's the XOR so that was
an encryption round with this is like
the structure of debts if I stealth
cipher here's the decryption round so
this is a stream cipher but again if you
want more stream cipher you just make
the picture bigger multiplying bit
strings is linear so you don't need
floating point because you can do large
fixed point because multiplication is
linear time because it takes linear for
the information to get one end to
another and in turn multiplying matrices
is linear time if you think about the
distance it takes a vector to go through
a matrix the distance is linear in the
matrix and that's the execution time so
you don't need fast Fourier transforms
you can just do any matrix math in
linear time in this world so what's the
cost this is a
a la asynchronous logic automata cell in
CMOS its order a thousand transistors
this is an on reconfigurable version
i'll show you reconfiguration its order
a thousand transistors that means if you
virtualize with a thousand virtual cells
per one of these it's roughly a one
transistor overhead so at somewhere
between two to one or a thousand to one
the density of DRAM based on how much
you want to virtualize you turn storage
into computation and interconnect so the
overhead really isn't that large to do
this but even more than the overhead
what I find so encouraging about this is
a direction where you should again think
of this ala world is kind of a cartoon
physics world that we compute in is one
version we're doing is low level code
for multi-core processors for looking at
limits of high-performance computing
programming the biggest machines is a
serious obstacle for like getting
towards exascale computing and so the
ala abstracts out which particular
processes are in here and how they're
connected and all they're doing is event
updates in the asynchronous rule table
these are arrays of commodity
microcontrollers you can get 20 mitts
for twenty cents and two millimeters in
a little AVR core today and so this is
sheets of commodity microcontrollers and
in this has a raise of LEDs on the
backside to make a display but it's a
display where you can cut off as much as
you want and do I owe anywhere and
crypto or graphics is implemented
extensively in the display not in
something controlling the display these
are a six based on what I showed you
this is prototyping nanostructure logic
but the key thing is unlike say Intel
hex code for an x86 versus an arm this a
la reprÃ©sentation scales across all of
these it's kind of cartoon physics that
as long as you're making a computer that
runs in our universe it sort of has the
same rules so it's a representation that
runs unchanged on each of these it's
kind of the lower level microcode that
has this portability a second
implication
is the local yield only needs to be a
thousand not a million or a billion
transistors so you can be much more
effective aggressiveness because you're
not yielding a big chip your you'll
yield link lots of tiny parts another is
power because power is only consumed
where things are happening the hard
thing in asynchronous computing has been
how do you make a design asynchronous in
what I showed you I didn't design for
asynchrony I just designed logical
relationships but because every single
bit is a processor each bit processor
can enforce the asynchrony and it only
does something when there's something to
do speed you don't have to clock it it
runs a gate propagation delay the
scalability comes from we've abstracted
these objects to justice medium so you
add more medium and the hope and this is
still very much a hope not a proof is
because we've gotten rid of a lot of the
architecture it simplifies a lot of the
programmability so I want to talk to
that point now once you have this
computing medium how do we program it
what I showed you the examples were done
in something that looks like Verilog
when you design a chip you use typically
VHDL or Verilog instead of drawing it
it's a programming language for the
circuits where you express the
relationships and so this is a Verilog
like language but the only difference is
when you do Verilog it's followed by a
netlist and place and route here each of
these statements these words is an
object and so to say them is effectively
to place them and so the Verilog
directly maps on to the structure it's
describing and so the example as I
showed you we're all done that way as a
bottom-up a mid-level one we're doing is
visual data flow but the visual data
flow is directly executable it's Turtles
all the way down the picture of the
visual data flow itself is executable
you don't need in a scheduler to execute
the visual data flow but the most
interesting one and this is the most
speculative one is in physics there's an
equivalence when I throw this up you can
do this as Newtonian mechanics or you
can just say this object is minimizing
the action so it's going to choose the
path of minimum action or you can view
the light he
you're as minimizing the transit time
physics has these equivalences of local
and global descriptions and they they're
completely equivalent and they come from
symmetries and conservation laws once
you have symmetries and conservation
laws you get these equivalences there's
nothing like that really in computing
because this computing object breaks
every imaginable symmetry on the other
hand this ala is is a uniform medium and
so we're interested in revisiting it's
essentially constraint programming but
now constraint programming where there's
a direct mapping onto its solution so I
showed you the sort example before let
me show you sort done this way here's a
funny way to sort you can take an
unsorted list you want to find a
permutation matrix weighted by indices
into the matrix and it's maximally
sorted when you multiply big numbers x
big indices and small numbers x small
indices so this is a statistic made
extrema when you've sorted in n with
constraints that rows and columns are
normalized to one you can then do a
relaxation to turn these into real
valued variables in the permutation
matrix that let you go in the interior
for the experts you then look for a duel
which captures the locality to do the
optimization and when you do the dual
what you get is what essentially looks
like in an auction you have nodes and
they bid on variables and then the
variables kind of go based on the local
auctions on the nodes but those words
aren't where this came from this is just
a dual decomposition mathematical
program I'm adding the words to describe
it but what's interesting is if you look
at essentially what this auction is
doing it's the sort i showed you with
one extra step when you write variables
that are a vector they have coordinates
in whatever space you're in preferences
feature vectors but they also have
coordinates on the piece of paper you're
writing them and essentially what we're
doing in this conformal computer is
we're implementing the piece of paper so
when the vector gets multiplied by the
matrix we're actually implementing the
space of the mathematical symbols as the
computation and so with that
identification of the representation on
the spatial structure then these
equations essentially become the sort i
showed you that's not automated but it's
a sketch of a workflow to go from a
global statement to this distributed
solver and in fact those ideas are
proving to be very powerful in reverse
engineering the internet to show what it
makes extreme mole and then use these
distributed optimizations to forward
engineer protocols as dynamic solutions
not not static protocols so asynchronous
logic automata is a programming model
that locally looks like physics now
constrained optimization is a way to
make global statements into distributed
solutions as a sketch of what a compiler
might look like from a high level
statement next is what is the operating
system look like today in the OS the OS
is like a hand of god that can reach
into the computer and do stuff but if
the computer is this extensive medium
you don't get to reach in as a hand of
God the the operating system has to be
in band and so here's an example of
loading the sort when I'm doing right
now is I'm streaming in a folding path
then on that folding path I'm streaming
in a configuration and I'm doing it by
sending data so the data is the same
data the processor uses but now I'm into
using one more type of cell a stem cell
a reconfigurable cell and the
reconfigurable cell is turning into
processor cells by the data streaming
through here you can just barely see
that blinking now the interesting thing
here is this is all running asynchronous
and unclog as these get connected you'll
see a little blinking because they have
something useful to do then they don't
have anything to do but watch what
happens when it gets to the very end
once it finishes a frontal propagate of
consistency and now everybody has
something to do when the sort turns on
and you didn't have to figure out how to
schedule the execution and distribute
the clock just everybody had something
to do and now the sorts running and so
that's a way to load a program if the
program is say this screen by coding for
its construction
now that in turn has a very interesting
implication if a program is a shape and
you can code for its construction you
can code for other shapes that are
shapes so this is actually part of a CAD
workflow to take mathematical
descriptions of objects into folding
codes and the reason we're doing that is
this this is the thing I did a year ago
with my new Prakash this is a computer
where what you're looking at is high
speed video many kilohertz video these
are hundred micron channels these are
bubbles in this case nitrogen and water
and this is a one bit memory toggling
this is a ring oscillator this is a bit
triggering a bit that triggers a bit and
then this is combinatorial logic when to
come in at the same time they go out in
both directions when one comes in it
goes out on the left so that's a logic
gate these are stages and combinatorial
logic so I just showed you all the
things you do for any digital logic
family non-linearity gain fan out
persistence of state but here each bit
is a unit of information but also a unit
of material second piece is this was
something saw Griffith did in this
thesis these are mechanical strings that
interact magnetically locally and they
fold so instead of having today like
metrology in a control system these
strings mechanically fold into shapes
and so these two slides together are the
ingredients you need to take everything
I showed you but now not implemented
virtually as electrons in a computer but
implemented as physical objects and the
reason we want to do that is we want to
create life the there's a hierarchy of
simple self-assembly to coding for
construction to programmable assembly
with algorithms and ultimately biology
and there's a range of laying scale
somewhere between in nanometers you can
do the
us with life large length scales you can
do it anyway but from there's a meso
scale that's very hard to fabricate
complex structures and so we see ba and
Harvard and Makani power with DARPA
support are taking everything I showed
you but now implementing it not
electronically but physically and the
purpose here is not math but
construction we're reimplemented
molecular biology instead of at
nanometer on micron two millimeter
scales equivalents of enzymes and
proteins and folding and replication to
code for construction so here's an
example of a workflow here's a wrench
and then this is videos from Jonathan
Bachrach Makani you can decorate the
wrench to find a Hamiltonian path a
continuous path through the wrench you
can then take that wrench and put it
into one of the strings i showed you now
running in 3d and so what's happening is
each of the cells locally is trying to
drive its neighbor into its desired
configuration with no global knowledge
and then you get the global wrench by
folding it from the local string and
then if you send in a different ala
folding code the same string
well this is more than a simulation this
is a design workflow from CAD to
physical modeling the project is to do
it physically and we can do it on short
strings and the next few years are to do
it on longer strings there's a lot of
steps to go from this at microns but we
can fold short strings this way and the
project is to take the couple slides
back and scale that so what that leads
to is Shannon took us from analog to
digital communication that lets you
error correct and communicate around the
world Vaughn knaimus von Neumann took us
from analog to digital computation this
was the last great analog computer that
got worse the longer longer around now
we opinions but making chips and
airplanes is still a fundamentally
analog progress process and what's
emerging is the real killer app of
everything I'm telling you ultimately is
to digitize fabrication just as happened
in the 40s and 50s for communication and
computation and so coming to the last
thing I want to talk about to do that
research we spent millions of dollars to
buy machines that makes anything I
started a class how to make almost
anything that was to teach students to
do the research i'm showing you but i
was swamped with students not there to
do research just to make stuff so kelly
was a sculptor with no engineering
background and this was her semester
project hi I'm Kelly and this is my
screen lock do you ever find yourself in
a situation where do you really have to
scream but you can't because you're at
work or you're in a classroom or you're
watching your children or your in any
number of situations where it's just
not permitted well screen body is a
portable space for screaming when a user
screams and discrete body there scream
is silenced but is also recorded for
later beliefs where when and how the
user chooses
Oh
I'm going back today
this is a web browser for Paris let's
try out surf the net talk to their owner
this is an alarm clock you have to
wrestle with and prove that you're awake
this is a dress instrumented with
sensors and spines that defends your
personal space each of these was a
semester project in the class and this
happened so consistently I realized the
students were answering a question I
hadn't asked which is if we implement
this whole digital fabrication roadmap
what's it good for and go back kennels
in the head of digital famously said
nobody needs a computer in the home
decks bankrupt you have a computer in
the home but it's not for inventory and
payroll in the same sense you can look
at these and say persons saving screams
or web browsers for parrots or defensive
dresses are fun and frivolous now we'll
talk about things that make money in a
real business but as you know so well
personalization customization is what
really is driven just about any
technology and what the students were
doing is personal fabrication and the
point of this is not that it's a
scalable business model and not that
it's mass-produced it's not stuff you
can get at walmart it's stuff that you
can't get at walmart it's stuff for a
market of one person it's exactly
exactly personal computing but now for
fabrication and it's one of the
strongest technical forces I've ever
seen in technology every year on campus
I teach this and it's just overwhelmed
with students desperate to take it to
create the stuff so that in turn led to
a little outreach project NSF said we
spent so much of their money we should
do some outreach and we thought it was
be boring to have just a website or a
class so we set up little prototype
tools in the field and we just did one
in Boston and it had a very unexpected
result by an absolution
principal voices in association with
shell we've had a digital revolution but
we don't need to keep having it we can
declare success we want what's coming
now is the digital revolution in
fabrication my colleagues and I started
teaching a class called how to make
almost anything and the idea was just
that it's a program looking at how the
digital world relates to the physical
world and one of the core things coming
out of the research is the idea of
digital fabrication making the Star Trek
replicator an assembler that makes
anything you want by building the atoms
on this is designed where you put in the
millions of dollars of equipment at MIT
are like the mainframes of digital
fabrication we can make anything we want
using those tools in 20 years we'll make
it so you can have it in the home the
fab labs are in between they spread all
around the world letting ordinary people
create technology from South Africa to
the north of Norway and from rural India
to inner-city Boston instead of spending
vast amounts of money to send computers
and energy and communication around the
world you can spend much less to send
the means to create it energy
communication computation just to say
the words they sound big they're being
tackled as billion-dollar mega-projects
top-down fablabs is tackling them from
the bottom up we're just finding so many
people with such interesting inventions
and such great ideas sharing that is
where I see this going so where that was
shot is a few hundred miles above the
arctic circle so far north that
satellite dishes look at the ground not
the sky because that that's the way to
the satellites and I didn't wake up and
figure you need these tools there we did
one in inner-city Boston it's about
fifty thousand dollars in equipment that
sort of approximates both what you can
do on campus and what you'll eventually
be able to do when we can do the fully
coated construction but from inner-city
Boston it went to this is the coast of
Ghana in secunda tecate and this is so
shun go via Township in South Africa
that lab in Norway rural India just
about every single day I get messages
now I want a Fab Lab and about once a
week somebody councils their life to
devote themselves to this and they want
to know where to report and we didn't
make this up we didn't think this up
what's happening is it's not a digital
divide it's an instrumentation and a
fabrication divide people who want to
and modify the world not just get
information on a screen so there's a
kind of a flow we've been seeing in the
projects it starts with technical
empowerment these are young girls who
made a few hundred dollars on a street
corner in Boston doing rapid prototyping
with a laser cutter too informal
technical education we had set up that
lab in Ghana and we had designed a
little network censor and then there was
an eight-year-old girl who wouldn't
leave until she had made it
hey go on inside
one key
um
my name is Valentina cookie I am eight
years old I made a steamboat is wrong
with the relative of the board
records about to load the microscope
pitkin all of you do that so there's a
sense in which she's not just catching
up she's kind of skipping over then
these labs started doing useful stuff
like instrumentation for agriculture
turbines for energy this was rapid
prototyping of the housing using the
tools to make how scale parts and then
two projects again these weren't meant
to be useful but that grew up in the
field I wanted to mention this is one on
how do you bring internet access to all
the places like this shanty town in
South Africa so instead of mass
producing a computer that you give to
the world to solve its problems what I
have here are these parts this is about
ten dollars in parts that you make in
the lab it's about 10 milliamps and what
it does is it implements internet 0 it
does a network protocol it talks to a
PST cute ps2 keyboard and it does NTS
your pal video and then what I have here
is a fifty-dollar cisco linksys access
point that we're using as a server so
this is a very thin client so thin that
our server is the cost and complexity of
what most people think of as a thin
client and then the thinner client and
so if we set this up I can show you this
is it doing gmail this is google news
and these don't all need to be the same
this is aiming at the space in between
SMS and and windows but for ten dollars
and 10 milliamps you can produce your
own internet access and they don't have
to all be the same you can have ones of
different sizes different languages
different skills and the skills and jobs
are local and the supply chain is local
and then in turn you need to make the
connection and the issue generally is
the the existing telcos are terrible but
regionally there are fire fiber
backbones getting pulled and so these
are processes in the fab lab this is
using a vinyl cutter to make a smaller
folded dipole array to do roughly 12 10
kilometer and then this is using a
bigger tool to make an tennis to go up
to a 100 kilometer scale so these are
the tools to make the high-gain links
initially using these cisco access
points and then looking at the internet
0 radios and so these two together are a
way to use field fabrication
to do computing not with heroes in a
place like this coming up with the
computer and then giving it to the world
to solve the problems but providing the
tools now this doesn't scale to the
regional on up network you still need
managed infrastructure but for the last
say hundred kilometers down to the
terminal you can really do bottom up not
just use of computing but design and
production of computing and so this is
at the stage of just going into field
trials and beginning to look at larger
scale fan out of that so I want to close
with if an eight-year-old girl in Ghana
can make her own internet terminal it
just breaks the boundaries here in the
valley between research education aid
industry it's sort of all of them and
none of them so to keep up with that
we're spinning off three organizations
from this fab network one is a fund to
do micro VC micro finances has fan out
but its banking VC you know well but
speculative technical risk but that
doesn't do fan out if you can make an
internet terminal for for a few dollars
it's a great business model but you need
global capital to go to local inventors
local inventions to glow to go to global
markets and production not in
Flextronics but in local sites all over
the world and so the fab fund is putting
together the infrastructure for that
there's a degree program for amazing
students like that eight-year-old girl
who are refugees from broken school
systems where instead of coming to a
place like MIT the lab network itself
becomes the campus and finally a
foundation to support the operational
scaling this is that lab in the north of
Norway it's run by a Sami descendant
herder but if you look at it I went to
MIT for the machines to do research and
they're still plenty can do at MIT you
can't do here but a lot of Owen what I
went to MIT for you can do there now I
went for the libraries those are
certainly online thanks in part to
google and i went for the people we run
a broadband video MCU and so I see the
people in the Norway much more than my
colleagues at MIT we're all too busy to
talk on campus so the assumptions of a
central research lab like MIT are
beginning to not make
there's still things you need on my t4
but there's a boundary where instead of
assuming all those things are scarce
resources they can be globally
distributed that's the ultimate impact
of digitizing fabrication but the kind
of pleasant surprises we can do it today
and just a final note is all the
infrastructure to create this network is
being used for one other very amusing
project is it a fun group of people like
the animal behaviorist I on a recent
Peter Gabriel and a few others who've
started looking at stuff like this and
thinking about animals and so the
project that's just starting and this is
just a passing note that it's ramping up
as an interspecies Internet doing
everything I said where instead of
people it's it's animals all around the
world interacting with animals and
interacting with people and we're just
starting early trials of that so
stepping back everything I showed you is
linked off the seitan in these books and
the flow is internet zero is a
short-term thing I PETA leaf nodes for a
dollar driven by buildings conformal
computing a sort of middle of the field
of view how do we scale high-performance
computing and I want argue very strongly
it's by recognizing that computer
science really needs to revisit
assumptions in the 50s and look more
like physics when you get that right the
computing scales with the physics and
the last piece is when you connect that
to the physics it means you can make
programs but also things and digitize
fabrication and the close to home
messages internet access can come from
the bottom up not mass-produced from the
top down so with that thank you and I'll
be happy to take questions
is this empowerment of individual people
put you on collision course at least
with certain governments and certain
jurisdictions like regulated spectrum
and so on so the question is what about
governments and jurisdictions so the
amusing story about that is this picture
is taken in South Africa we were doing
field trials and in doing those field
trials we broke a variety of laws and
the agencies whose laws were being
broken had people within them
encouraging us to break the laws there
are plenty of people who didn't like it
but there are plenty of people in the
agencies who recognize that it just
didn't make sense and they liked it that
we were doing a demonstration project
that showed it broke the laws so there
there are a lot of regulatory issues but
ultimately it's it's just too leaky you
can't control this or another version is
we deployed one of these labs in
Afghanistan the summer and it was in
partnership with among others military
agencies and we had interesting
discussions with like rooms full of
generals where half the room would say
my god we have to classify this and the
other half of the generals would say
what i would say which is first you just
can't control it it's not a it's not a
controllable resource but more than that
of blowing people up is a mature market
need that's well Matt you don't need all
of this to blow people up there's good
ways to do that already it's kind of
meet all the other needs that are less
well Matt and that's what was really
behind sin the lab to Afghanistan so it
leads to very unusual partnerships it's
not that it's all yes or all know but
they're strong advocates in agencies you
might think would be opponents you
showed a bunch of problems that you can
do in linear time in your model I was
wondering what is an intractable problem
in your motto and for example can you
translate the P versus your shoulder
first the linear time trade-off is very
easy to understand see if we look at oh
I know any of these the linear or
actually let me go back to this
the linear time trade-off is simply each
bit is unit of time space state logic
and so it's an order and win so you get
to take order and off almost any
algorithm because each bit of either
storage or communication becomes a bit
of processing so it's no more than that
but it's an it you get order and off
anything you can think of and so there
are a couple places that's really
important one place that's dear to me is
I'm hoping we can finally bury
floating-point numbers in that fixed
point math it takes a thousand fixed
bits to equal double-precision
floating-point and since we can do this
in linear time I think we can get rid of
floating-point numbers a second huge one
is matrix math is linear time so you
don't need fast anything convolution
just about any matrix transform but it
it's for structured things like that
it's not for all algorithms it doesn't
its order a it's a it's one end speed up
it doesn't change other classes and so
many it's a reason to do this but all of
these are other reasons to do this the
order n is a very nice result but I
don't oversell that it doesn't
fundamentally change computational
complexity it just changes the one
factor of n in the scaling but that it's
a big factor of n
um you mentioned that with the internet
zero stuff you have a lot of cheap nodes
that are running ipv6 um how do you
allocate addresses on that did they each
have their own a mac address as you
would on Ethernet and then are those
globally routable so in this internet 0
world there there is no Mac we've
essentially collapsed layers 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
they're all the same thing meaning that
the the packet is the logical
description it's the medium access and
it's actually what's in the medium so
there is no Mac there's just IP
addresses so routing it is up to how you
want to handle the address allocation
it's a large important question that
we're just up to in these test beds the
way we did it because these are aimed at
see there's two steps in answering that
these are aimed at building scale things
we're in a room like this this would say
be one internet zero network and then
the intention is not that you can talk
to the light bulb from China even though
you couldn't in fact it led to some
funny debugging where we accidentally
did do that but from here you go up
through the hierarchy of the internet
and so there's there's levels of
aggregation above it so in this case we
just did randomized addressing you could
do more order organized addressing
scheme so one among the partners working
in this or people like JP vesser and
Roth drums at Cisco of IETF gurus who've
been looking at these questions of if
you have huge numbers of IP devices and
in particular if they don't have max how
you do addressing so we're hint we're
we're answering that question on on the
scale on this scale it raises larger
questions beyond us that we would invite
collaboration on
so can you talk about what well the
energy source be for your your linear
self-folding string at the meso scale
pity and little wet what will the energy
so you won't thermal energies nothing
worked this is how we're going to
physically make this yeah
so there isn't a single source in that
we're doing versions of that where those
blocks are centimeters millimeters and
microns and it's a different answer for
each of them and there's also versions
that are rewritable and right only so
the right only is its elastic energy and
it's done by weaving essentially the
electrically driven version you're
sending power down the backbone so
you're not storing power locally but but
the communication bus is also a power
bus passing power locally and then in
the micro scale version these are micron
droplets and so its surface energy of
droplet droplet adhesion what is the
energy for the strength of space you
mean in this video again in each of the
ones I showed you there was a different
answer so in the elastic answer it's
there's a mechanical elastic energy
that's getting minimized in the local
joint in the electrical one there's
Elektra permanent magnets that are
minimizing magnetic flux energy in the
droplet one it's a droplet droplet
fusion in each of those there's a
different physical energy but the key
attribute is those were three different
interactions but they're local
interactions of local joints and so each
joint is minimizing the physics of that
interaction locally and then you get
this global forcing
yep
sure so the question is we have trouble
with past that don't fold by
construction know in that the I haven't
talked about how the whole CAD workflow
works but it's based on what makes this
interesting is a constructive proof of
finding non-self intersecting passes
that are guaranteed to fold so the
question is not non-self intersecting
there's now a more interesting question
is in protein folding there's primary
and secondary and tertiary structure and
alpha helices and beta sheets and we're
finding the need for something like that
in that it's a bad idea to do this all
in one go you want to make sure motifs
and assemble them and we're starting to
look at how you sort of map geometrical
structures into these motifs one of the
things is in thinking about next steps
in each of these because almost out of
time I wanted to advertise on the Ala
we're making chips in these roles but
what may be closest to home is we're
working in particular with the National
Labs on massively parallel simulators of
a la s as well weighted program really
big computers so one area of overlap
might be just given a whole pile of
computing this is a different way to
program it on the internet zero stuff
this is now getting commercialized by
cisco and schneider and all of them and
is going into test beds and so if you
want to do IP to anything that would be
a route for this and then this stuff is
going the thin service center clients is
just going into field trials and so
another possible connection is to play
with prototypes of that and the early
field trials okay
okay then I'm here for the couple hours
this afternoon and happy happy to
discuss more thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
