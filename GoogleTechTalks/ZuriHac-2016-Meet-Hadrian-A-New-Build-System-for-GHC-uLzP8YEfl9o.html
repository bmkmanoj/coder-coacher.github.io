ANDREY MOKHOV: Thank you.
I'm pretty happy to be
here and give a talk.
So three years ago, I
was here [INAUDIBLE].
And I was a complete newb.
I didn't understand anything
particular out of the talks.
Well, I tried to.
But I failed.
And so, I'll give a talk.
And it's going to
be really simple
compared to the previous talks.
So Andres just did a great job.
He explained a lot
of advanced concepts
in a really
easy-to-understand way.
But I'm going to talk about
a really simple concept.
So the most advanced thing I'm
going to use is a [INAUDIBLE].
And the talk is going to
be about the new build
system for GHC called Hadrian.
How many people here ever
worked on the GHC Build System?
So not many people.
So out of those, how
many people loved this?
OK.
Oh yeah, there's one.
So how many people love
writing Haskell and working
with Haskell code?
OK, so most of you.
So that's the direction
that we have taken.
So we have taken the
build system of GHC,
which was written in Make.
And we have translated
into Haskell.
And hopefully, it
will make the process
of working it more enjoyable.
Now, this work was done under
the guidance of Neil, Simon,
and Simon.
So again, I was mostly a newb
when I started this project.
But they helped me a lot.
So I'll also thank
New Castle University,
who pays my salary
while I'm working on it.
All right, my talk is going
to be split in two parts.
The first one is
why we are doing
this and what sort of problems
we're trying to solve.
It was an evil system.
The second part is going to be
about introduction to Hadrian,
so what we've actually done.
This is the first slide,
sells you everything.
Probably, that's the motivation.
If you peak into
one of the Makefiles
in the GHC Build System,
that's what you see typically.
So there are three lines.
They don't feed,
so I broke them.
So it's roughly 19
dollars per line.
It's [INAUDIBLE] make macros.
And we are trying to get rid
of this impenetrable unreadable
stuff.
So really, one of the
main issues we are solving
is that Make is just not a
good programming language.
It's not a good
language to work with.
One of the reasons is that
the program model is really
just a global namespace of
mutable string variables.
What could be worse?
You can't even represent
numbers naturally.
So you have to code
numbers into strings
and associative maps and
everything into strings,
which is very hard.
Obviously, no encapsulation
or information hiding.
So it's very
difficult to maintain.
If you have things like spaces
or columns in your variables,
you're in trouble, because
they are special characters.
And variables are
spliced into Makefiles.
So if you're using a
variable, basically,
if you have a column there,
somewhere in a Windows file
pass for example, is
[INAUDIBLE] you are in trouble.
Because it's works as a
buildable separator, et cetera.
And these dollars,
they arise because when
you want to expand,
splice in the variable,
you have to apply this dollar.
And if it appears somewhere
inside a variable,
you have to use double dollars
or it translates to one dollar.
And one dollar will
have two dollars,
which later will translate
into one dollar and so on.
So it's really hard to keep
track of how many dollars
you need to use.
And if you're off by
one, basically, your
build system doesn't work.
And you don't know why.
So we are using
the Shake library,
which is basically embedded DSL
in Haskell in Build Systems.
And just a quick one-slide
introduction to Shake.
On top, you have the
typical build rule in Make.
So this is where
Make actually shines.
So if you have a really
small build system,
Make is perfect, because
it's so easy to understand.
It's a simple rule.
It tells you how to build
object files from C files.
To do it, you just execute gcc.
So it CC_OPTS to
some variable, which
stores the options you
typically pass to C Compiler.
And this dollar less-than sign
stands for the file that is
matched to this pattern
that has extension .o.
But unfortunately, it
doesn't do it to scale well
beyond the symbol rules.
And here is how this symbol
rule was replaced with Shake.
So it's a little
bit more verbose,
but you can do more
things with it.
So this whole blue
block has type rules.
This is the rule type in Shake.
To create it, you use this
operator, percent greater.
So it has two parameters.
It has a file pattern.
So it's similar to
the Make build rules.
So you say, this is how
I built object files.
And the second parameter
is this function
from FilePath to
Action, which tells you
how exactly we built it.
So it's an Action
[INAUDIBLE] in Shake.
Basically, it's an I/O
with some additional things
like need and command.
So what do we do here?
We first compute the
name of the source file
by replacing the extension.
So we change O to C. So we
put in the variable source.
And we need to source.
So this is explicit dependency.
We record the dependency.
We are saying that
whatever a source changes,
this rule is rebuilt. And
an important point here
is that this is what's
called a monadic dependency.
So the list of
dependence doesn't
need to be known
statically at compile time.
So the list can change.
For example, you can
parse the C file.
You can find all the include
statements and add them
to the list of things you need.
So this allows you handle the
dynamic dependencies really
nicely.
And the last statement
basically executes the CC
with some common [INAUDIBLE]
on the source file.
So that's Shake in one slide.
And let's go to the second
problem we are solving.
This is dynamic dependencies,
which I just mentioned.
So in GHC, we have a lot
of dynamic dependencies,
which basically
means that we don't
have a static build graph.
And when we are thinking
about build systems,
we are thinking about
these dependency graphs.
And Make only allows
you to express
a static dependency graph,
where all the dependencies are
known upfront when
you write them down.
If you want to take care of
things like Include or Import
statements, you have to
organize the build system
in several phases basically.
So in the first phase, you
compute all the import,
include dependencies.
So then, your build system
restarts essentially.
And now, with this
information, it can go further.
This is really a
complicated mechanism.
It's easy to get it wrong.
And it's a source
of many difficulties
when you're working as
the current build system.
Actually, in GHC, we have
quite a lot of generated files.
And these generated files
contain Include statements.
So there are actually
several levels
of this dynamic
dependency graphs,
which we need to take care of.
And the solution is to use
Shakes monadic dependencies.
So this neat operator
is really powerful.
You can have several
needs in your build rule.
And you introduce
new dependencies
as you discover them.
You start with a
top-level target.
You find out what it needs.
Your record them.
You keep discovering
other possible
build tree of the
dependency tree.
And you keep discovering
this dynamic graph.
And it just works.
You don't need to
mess with surprises.

We also need to take
care of build rules
with multiple outputs.
And this can be--
there's this workaround
to make how it
typically expresses.
You're saying that GHC Compiler
produces two files, the object
file and the
interface file dot hi.
And you are saying--
well, there is no syntax
for expression multiple built
outputs for when you run GHC.
What you say-- you say that the
object files are used by GHC.
But the interface file is
produced when you actually
build the object file.
It's how express it.
So the build rule for the
interface file is a no op.
It just tells you that we need
this object file to be there.
So essentially,
as a side effect,
you also build the
interface file.
But then, there
is a problem here.
So if you delete this
interface file, what happens
is that Make tries
to rebuild it.
It tells it, we need
the object file.
But it's there.
So this rule is not fired.
So you just end up with
a mission interface file.
So your build fails.
So this is a really poor
solution to the problem.
So you want to be
able to express
multiple outputs explicitly.
And that's how you
do it in Shake.
So basically, you
can have build rules
which produce multiple
results and only just
have the names of the list.
Instead of having one file
that matches the build rule,
you have multiple
files that match it.
Another problem which
is pervasive in the GHC
build system is that sometimes
we need to reduce concurrency
in the build system.
So for example, because you
maintain some level state--
so during the build of GHC, we
need to register its packages.
And this is done by invoking
GHC Package program, which
mutates the global state.
It mutates the package database.
So you can't have two of them
running at the same time.
So if you want to register two
packages, what the old build
system did, it
basically introduced
some concurrency action
dependencies, we call them.
So there is no real dependency
between these two packages.
But you need to register
in a particular order,
because you want to avoid them
being done at the same time.
And this is really fragile.
So it's easy to get this
order of registrations wrong.
So you introduce some cycle and,
then, basically you're stuck.
And it also is very inefficient.
Because if a package is
ready to be registered,
you can't do it until it
reaches its order in the queue
basically, until all the
packages in this order
have been registered.
So it limits parallelism.
It's hard to get it right.
And it actually introduces
quite a lot of complexity
to the build system, which
is absolutely accidental.
You don't want to
have this complexity.
Because it's just a really
clumsy way to express this,
the main issue.
And we just use Shake's
resources to handle this.
So you can easily define
a resource in Shake,
such as, in this case,
Package Database.
You say that you only have
one item of this resource
available.
And whenever you are
running GHC Package,
you are consuming this
one item of resource.
And nobody else can use it.
With this pattern, you can also
express read-write conflicts.
You can say is that it's
OK to have multiple reads
from the package database.
But as soon as GHC writes to
it, you can't have any reads.
So what we do is
we actually create
the package database resource
with, say, 1,000 items.
And the writer, GHC package,
consumes all of them.
But readers consume
only one of them.
So this allows you to have
multiple reads and only
a single write.

Another thing is
fine-grain dependencies.
In GHC, we have
this file generated
by the Configure script, which
contains various configuration
add-ins, like pass to
the builders that we use.
So where Alex lives; where
the archiver, R, lives.
Also, what features
they support--
does the R support
this at file, where
we can pass all the parameters
via a separate file?
And this is a pretty big file.
And if anything changes
there, basically, all the
build rules tries
to be dependent.
And in Make, you have
to rebuild everything,
even if only a
single line changes.
So if you only change the
pass to Alex, for example,
you'd have to
rebuild everything,
even though you probably only
want to rebuild all the rules,
which are run by Alex.
So we should build by Alex.
So it is possible to
solve this problem in Make
by speaking this configuration
file into multiple files.
One file per
information setting.
But really it uses some
additional accidental
complexity to the build
system which you don't want.
And we use Shake's
polymorphic dependencies.
So Shake allows you to
depend not only on files
but on some other things.
So in this case, we
want to depend actually
on individual
configuration settings.
So we say that this the builder,
which actually runs alex
depends only on this first line
in this configuration file.
If it changes,
this rule is going
to be rebuilt.
Because maybe you'll
stop to use a new version
of Onyx somewhere.
But if it changes, you
don't need to run our rules.
So with rules, we
should build libraries
of object files, which results
in quite big savings in terms
of build times.
If you change just
one setting, you
don't have to
rebuild everything.

A big source of
complexity in the existing
build system is the way of
computing command lines.
So it's not as simple as saying
that, oh, Haskell files are
compiled with just one
simple indication of GHC.
So you invoke GHC
with the source file.
And you put the result
into the object file.
But it's not that simple.
You have to have different
lists of arguments
for different packages
for different ways
you built objects files.
For example, you typically build
libraries in a vanilla way,
and then also with profile
information enabled,
and then maybe with debug
information and what not.
And here's a snippet
of the old build system
where, basically,
what you're saying
is that there are way dependent,
way specific options that you
want to pass to GHC.
So HC_OPTS is basically
Haskell-compiled options
that you want to pass.
And either way, you're
building a particular file,
it's profile is
used for profiling.
You need to pass a static
and prof arguments to it.
Also, if you are building
a file in base package,
you want to add to
this-unit-id base argument.
And there are a
lot of-- basically,
like 32 such patterns which
records various special cases
for way specific, file specific,
stage specific, package
specific arguments that you
need to pass to GHC when
you are building a single file.
And it's possible to
do with it in Make.
And the current build
system somehow uses it.
But it's very inflexible.
So we have this WAY-p-HC-OPTS,
which basically allows you
to specify way-specific options.
But what if you want to also
have file-specific flex?
You basically need to
extend this variable
to now takes two parameters and
not only of the WAY parameter,
but also the File parameter,
and not to mention two of them.
And this basically propagates
to the whole build system now.
Everywhere now, in
the build system,
you have to have
these two parameters.
And it has to support
somehow wild cards.
Maybe you don't care
about file pass.
Maybe you do.
And so, it's really difficult
to implement and make.
This is just a poor
program language.
So our solution-- we develop
a small and better demand
specific language in
Haskell, specifically
for computing command lines.
And I'm going to
introduce this language.
So this is the end
of the first part.
The introduction basically
explained why we are doing this
and what problems we
are trying to solve.
You can find more details
in these two papers.
The first one introduced Shake.
It's by Neil Mitchell.
It's &quot;ICFP 2012.&quot;
There's also the link
to the website, which
contains a lot of details about
how Shake build system works.
And the second paper
has just recently
been accepted to
Haskell Symposium.
It's going to be in Japan.
Maybe I'll see
some of you there.
So basically, the first
three or four pages
explain the motivation,
why the current
build system is so complicated.
It's not because GHC
implementers didn't try hard.
They tried hard.
The current version is a false
rewrite, almost from scratch,
of the build system.
So it's not a weak attempt.

We believe it's just
impossible to scale it.
It's just impossible to
scale Make for big projects.
And so, you can find what
it does in this paper.
And also, there are some
documentation in the GitHub
repository for the project.
And now, the second part is
&quot;Introduction to Hadrian.&quot;
So the new build
systen-- what is it?
Abstractions we are using.
Now this guy is Hedron,
the Roman Roman emperor
who was involved in quite
big large-scale construction
projects, like Rome Pantheon
or Hadrian's Wall, which
goes through Newcastle.
That's where I live.
So I decided to
pick out this name.
He's a really good guy.
And we have now asked
him to build GHC as well.
[LAUGHTER]

So let's go ahead with
all the data types
we have in the build system.
So you can start
using it after stock.
So please.
So basically, GHC
source code is organized
in some logical units,
which are called packages.
It's typically pretty
typical for all build-systems
in general.
So you don't typically
have all the source code
just in one globe.
You've can somehow
logically organize it.
And the packages in GHC, usually
is the libraries or programs.
So you have the base library.
Or you have GHC,
which is a program.
And they are built differently.
So if you are
building a library,
you want to compile
all the source files
and put all the objects
together in the archive.
If you are building
a program, you
want to leak all
these object files.
And the data type, which
is [INAUDIBLE] a package,
is basically the
name of the package.
So Base, for example.
The file passed through it.
And the type is a
library program.
I've got a couple of
smart constructors
for these little-types.
So if you write
Library Base, it knows
exactly where to look for
libraries in the GHC source
string.
It knows its base.
Because libraries should leave
in libraries, slash space.
So it constructs the
file path for you.
So genprimopcode is
utilities and executable.
It knows that utilities
live in the utils directory.
So it constructs
this file pass code.
Every package can be built in
multiple ways, as I mentioned.
So you can have the vanilla
way, which basically just builds
as it is.
Then, you can build a package
with profiling information,
maybe for multithreaded use with
debug information, et cetera.
So there are many
different ways.
How do we define them in a
file called-- in a model Way.
And we make use of
Haskell's model system.
So we actually hide
the information
about how it's implemented.
So users of the GHC
build system don't
need to know how it meant it.
We only provide the names of the
ways, so you can compare them.
And you can ask the
model, for example,
for suffixes of object
files for different ways.
So if it's a plain
vanilla object file,
it will have .o extension.
If it's a profiled
object, it will
hear of p underscore object.
So basically, these
alternating connections
are from the existing
build system.

So each package, in
addition to being compiled
in multiple ways,
is also compiled
by multiple versions of GHC.
So that's another complication
we have in the build system.
There are several, what
we call, stages of GHC.
Stage 0 is the GHC you
have on your system when
you-- because GHC is
written in Haskell.
So you need a Haskell
compiler to build it.
So this Haskell compiler that
you have is called Stage0 GHC.
So in Stage0, we therefore
use it to build Stage1.
GHC Stage1 is a version of
GHC which lacks many features,
but which is used then to
build Stage2 GHC, which
is what you want.
This is our end goal
of the build process.
We want to build Stage2 GHC.
And sometimes we use Stage2
GHC to build GHC again
as a self-test.
So hopefully, the binary
Stage2 GHC and Stage3 GHC,
they will be the same.
So we are kind of
bootstrapping building
GHC in several stages, until
we reach this fixed point.
And there is data type-- yeah.
Hopefully, we reach this
[INAUDIBLE] when I was here.
So we have this data type Stage.
We describe all the stages,
suggest enumeration.
And then, Stage,
Package, and Way--
they form what we call
GHC-specific built context.
So whatever you
build in the file,
you build it in this context.
What is the GHC you
use to build it?
Is it the
bootstrapping compiler?
Or some Stage1 or
Stage2 compiler?
What package you are in--
is that the library base
package or something else?
But unless you provide
different flags.
In what way you are
building this file?
Again, depending
on this way, you
have to add different
flags to the command line.

To build files in GHC, we invoke
multiple external builders.
That's what any
build system does.
So there is quite a big list
of builders we use, 26 of them,
I think, currently.
And they come and go.
Some of them become upset
because we replace them
with Haskell in
the build system.
Some new builders come.
And so, we have this
integration data type,
which lists all of them.
So some of this build
was actually built
by the build system itself.
For example, GenPrimopCode
is a utility.
It's a package in
our build system.
And we build it.
And then, we use
it to build things.
So we have this change of
change of the [INAUDIBLE]
dependencies.
So GHC Compiler is a mix.
So GHC Stage0 is the one
we have in the system.
GHC Stage1 is the one we
built. This GHC model-- there's
also the complication that
we use the same builder
for different things.
So we've used GHC to
compile Haskell files.
But you also use it
to link Haskell files.
And we also actually
use it to compile
the CML files, et cetera.
So actually, there are multiple
modes in which we use GHC.
Depending on these
modes, we need
to posit different options.
So if you are linking
a file you have,
the options will be
different than when
you are compiling a file.
But no, Haskell's
data types allow
us to express us all nicely,
without no big headaches.
And then, we use this build
type for various things.
For example, we have
this convenient function
builderPath.
So it takes a builder and
then performs some computation
to find out where it leads.
So it either looks up that
integration file, which
I showed you, or some
Excel builder cell,
listed their locations.
Or it actually finds out where
we put the results of our own
build.
So for example,
going from a code
somewhere in the
build system, we
know where we are
going to put it.
And so, we will just
use this location.
Yep?
AUDIENCE: With this [INAUDIBLE]?

ANDREY MOKHOV: So as
I will show you later,
we actually separate
these two things.
So we compute the path.
And then, typically we need it.
Because we want to make sure
it actually is built. Yeah,
you're right.

So now, we put everything
that I've described
into a data type called Target.
So Target fully describes
what we're going to build.
It's the context in which
we built a particular file.
It's the builder we
used to build it.
And it's a set, lists of inputs
and outputs that we have.
So as an example here,
is a preludeTarget.
So its prelude is
a Haskell file.
It lives in libraries
base slash Prelude.hs.
So the output is going
to be the Prelude.p_o.
Because in this
particular example,
we are building it
in the profiled way.
And we put it into the
build directory somewhere.
Se are going to use the GHC
Stage1 builder and the Context
Stage1 base library
in profiling.
So it's going to fully
describes a particular target.
And from this target, we want
to be able to built the command
line that they're going to use.
So this brings us to
the computing command
like for Target problem, which
I mentioned in the motivation
part of the talk.
So given this prelude
target, how do we actually
come up with this command
line that we need to involve
to build this target?
So we want this
function, command line
which takes target, into an
action of list of strings.
And this is basically
a reason why not
we use it to remove the
plumbing details when
we're constructing these
expressions for describing
common lines.
So we use this
type of expression,
which is a [INAUDIBLE].
So you read the target
that you are building.
You do some action.
And you produce a
value of type A.
So this is an example how you
can produce this new command.
In the first example, you ask,
what is the current target?
And from the [INAUDIBLE].
And then, you always add 02.
Then, if the current
way is profiling,
then you also add
this dash prof.
And you also add -c
and the input file
and -o and the output file.
That's how we can
build the command line.
It's still verbose.
And I'll show how we actually
make it more concise.
So to make it more concise,
the key pattern here
is this conditional statement.
So we add the prof flag on
the particular condition,
this case, if we are
in the profiling way.
And this pattern is pervasive.
In the build system,
we have thousands
of additional
statements like this.
If some condition holds,
add this particular flag.
And so, how do we
handle this nicely?
So we handle conditionals
using the type of predicate.
So it's not a really good type.
And anyway, it doesn't
save even one character.
So you could just try Expr Bool.
I'm not sure whether we need it.
Maybe I should drop it.
But these are predicates.
These are expressions
which compute Bool values,
Boolean values.
And this is an example
of a predicate, Way.
So it takes a Way
and computes true,
if we currently are
in the profiled way.
And it computes false otherwise.
So what we do, we ask
what the target is.
And we look up the Way.
And if it's the Way we
provided as a input parameter,
it adjusts true.
Otherwise, it turns false.
And we have predicates
for other things.
We want to be able to check
when adding command line facts,
like, what is the current stage?
What is the current
package of Bool?
And so on.
So I'll show you some examples.
So we add this convenient
operator, question mark,
to use these predicates.
What it does-- it
has the predicate
on the left-hand
side and expression
on the right-hand side.
But the predicate holds.
It kind of appends
this expression
to the built command line.
Otherwise, it's appends
mempty, so it keeps it.
So it's kind of unary
&quot;if&quot; statement, sort of.
So now, we have this
prof expression,
which uses this predicate way
profiling with this question
mark.
But basically, it will
add the prof argument,
if we are in the profiled way.
And this allows us to
make these long lists
of special cases
for various things
to be really concise
and easy to read.
And so, the various we are
going to put in expressions
are going to be monoids,
because we want to build up
long lists of expressions.
So we are going to just
conconate them with mappends.
And the particular type we are
going to use is going to Diff.
Why?
Because we want these
expressions to be
modifiable by users.
So we write down
these expressions,
these build command lines.
And then, at some
point, user might
want to say, actually,
I want to remove
this particular flag
from the command line
or maybe add another one.
And so, actually, what you want
is you want different lists.
Well, we want to be able to
modify the list of command
lines at any point of time.
That's why we're actually
not just concatenating
lists of strings,
but we're actually
concatenating functions
from list of strings
to list of strings.
So let's do data type Diff.
It's basically just the
same as [INAUDIBLE],
I think, in Monoid
library, in Monoid model.
So they form Monoids.
So you just use
function composition
to stitch them back
together in the right order.
Because you want the
right-hand side to order right
what is on the left-hand side.
So users can append
something which,
for example, removes arguments
which are previously edited.
And we have this data
type, Args, which
is different lists of strings.
So this is how we build up
expressions for command lines.
Here are the facts that
we are going to use.
So Append attaches a list of
arguments to an expression.
Remove filters out some
flags, if you don't want them.
And Arg just appends
a single argument.
So now, with this
machinery in hand,
we can now write down
the previous expression
in a more concise way.
We're saying that, if we
are using GHC builder,
we want to pass
arg2 argument to it.
If we are in a profiled way, we
want to pass the prof argument
to it.
Then we almost pass
dash C. And then, we
feed the input from Target.
So getInput basically
just reads the input field
and make sure it's a singleton.
So if it's not a singleton,
it reports an error message.
And you have multiple
expressions like this.
And you can concatenate
them all with mconcat.
And you put the user
args on top of it
so user can modify
everything that you've said.
So if you want to modify
something, a flag in GHC,
you can say, builder GHC
question mark and, then,
for example, remove 02.
Or you can say, build up GHC
question mark args minus O0,
for example, if you want
to switch of a translation
without [INAUDIBLE].
So how, putting
everything together,
how do we build a target?
So this is where
this new comes in.
So we want a function
that builds a target,
produces some action.
So what do we do?
We find the path the
builder's appended to use.
So Builder lives
inside the target.
So when we pattern match, we
extract all the fields here.
Then, we need this path.
So if this builder
is built by us,
we need to make sure that
we actually have built it
before we can use it.
Now on this next
slide, checkArgsHash--
I'm not going to go into
details how it's implemented.
But basically, we can track
changes in the build system.
We can track changes
of command lines.
So if, say, you modify
the build system
and you add a new flag
to invocation of GHC,
that will give you all around
all affected GHC rules and all
the results that are affected.
So if you only add some
flag in the profiled way,
you'll run all GHC
in profiled way
and all the dependent build
rules but nothing else, which
is very convenient.
Then you extract.
So you basically run args.
you give it the targets.
You run the [INAUDIBLE].
And you extract the list of
arguments you want to pass.
And you execute the builder and
these particular command lines,
a couple of flags.
So that's it in terms
of the introduction.
So I think, there's
nothing more to it.
The rest of the complexity's
builders expressions.
So there are about
100 files in Hadrian.
And this obstruction
suggests maybe 10 files.
The rest, 90 files, deal with
how to build these expressions.
Because there are all
sorts of exceptions,
all sorts of different
rating systems
we need to take care, all
different various tag-specific
options, file-specific
options, et cetera.
So the rest of the
complexities explicitly dealing
with command line generation.
So we can built
Stage2 GHC, which
is the primary goal
of the build system.
But there are still
a lot of limitations.
So we will lag far
behind the current
build systems in
terms of the features.
So we can only build in
vanilla and profiling way,
and not dynamic or [INAUDIBLE].
There are many ways
we don't support.
We don't do validation.
So we have to fall back
to the [INAUDIBLE] system
for test suits.
So we use the test
suits which are there.
We don't do different
[INAUDIBLE] styles.
We don't do most of the build
flavors, only some of them.
We can't do cross-compilation.
And we can't do source
and binary distribution.
But we can build Stage2 GHC.
So I'm really happy about that.
There are 46 open issue.
So please help me
deal with them.
And we already
have several people
contributing [INAUDIBLE] hacks.
And I'm very happy that
we have some help here.
Some experiments we have
done-- so in the paper,
you can read more details.
We studied 11 common use
cases of the GHC build system.
For example, edit a
source file and rebuilt,
add a new build command
flag and rebuild,
and things like that, a
git branch and rebuild.
And in most of these cases,
Hadrian is much faster,
because it just
builds far less stuff
than the [INAUDIBLE] system.
And we also did some
quantitative benchmarks.
So Hadrian is also
faster on zero builds
and full build,
particularly on Windows.
So on Windows, for some
reason, Make is really slow.
I don't know why.
So the new build
system is much faster.
And even on Linux we
have some speed up.
And that's it.
So I'm going to finish
with this nice picture
by Pieter Bruegel,
&quot;Tower of Babel,&quot;
which I think think actually
represents build systems.
So they're huge, just
monstrous things, which
involve multiple languages.
And we have to use different
builders, et cetera.
And probably, I'm this guy
here, asking for a placement
with Simon Peyton Jones,
who tells me, build GHC.
[LAUGHTER]

That's it.
Thank you very much for this.
[APPLAUSE]

Yeah, any questions?
You're welcome.
Yeah?
AUDIENCE: Will the Hadrian
[INAUDIBLE] Haskell binary
rights, so that if you adjust
the package you [INAUDIBLE]--
ANDREY MOKHOV: Oh no.
Because GHC is written
in the Haskell,
we need a Haskell compiler
in the system anyway.
So we use this Haskell
compiler to compile Hadrian.
AUDIENCE: So there's
some small [INAUDIBLE]
ANDREY MOKHOV: Yeah,
there's a small shell
script or a COBOL script.
So basically, you
could do it with COBOL
or with the shell script.

Any other questions?

Yeah?
AUDIENCE: The difference
[INAUDIBLE] shows.
They are very simple.
Like, you can only
filter things from before
and add things at the end.
Thus, do you ever need
positional awareness
when you're doing this?
ANDREY MOKHOV: Sometimes,
we, for example,
need to remove a bare flex.
So maybe you had
minus o something.
It's possible to do it.
Because you have the full list
as your input to the function.
You find for this minus o
something and you remove.
You can do this, yes.
Yep?
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I
apologize for this question.
But [INAUDIBLE] use a
Haskell program that you have
[INAUDIBLE].
ANDREY MOKHOV: Yeah, so I
really don't know anything
about cross-compilation.
There are people here
who volunteered to help
and people elsewhere
who volunteered to help.
I hope, with their help, we'll
be able to figure it out.
Yep?
AUDIENCE: What method
do you use to discover
the module dependencies?
ANDREY MOKHOV: So
model dependencies
are recorded in COBOL files.
So each package in GHC
has the usual COBOL file.
For example, if you
have a file path,
it tells you that it
depends on base, et cetera.
So we need to parse
these COBOL files.
AUDIENCE: But I mean, modules
within a single library.
ANDREY MOKHOV: So GHC
has this functionality.
You can ask GHC
to parse the file
and, basically,
find the imports,
and tell you the dependencies.
So it's like [INAUDIBLE].
So you know that you're
[INAUDIBLE] around.
You see it's minus m.
Option is similar
thing with GHC.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
ANDREY MOKHOV: Yes, mm-hm.

Right.
Well, thanks.
We can chat over [INAUDIBLE].
