nuclear here but I built Google Mars I'm
here to introduce Sean Raymond from the
University of Colorado's astrobiology
Center he's a NASA postdoctoral fellow
and he's going to talk about looking for
habitable planets and stellar
simulations all right well it's a
pleasure to be here thanks for coming to
my talk and I'll tell you guys today
about some stuff we've been doing
dealing with how planets form how they
evolve and what are the chances for
planets like Earth to form and survive
around other stars so starting off here
is a completely artificial image I made
showing for planetary systems so in the
bottom right is kind of a schematic of
the inner solar system
so here's Jupiter here's Earth you know
here it's Mercury Venus and Mars and the
asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
so in the solar system we have one
planet that we know has life on it you
know we have liquid water on our surface
you know the temperature is about right
for things like us to crawl around on
there all right now here three other
systems that have been formed
artificially in computers and computer
simulations that are obviously imperfect
but we think are a reasonable
representation of reality and so there's
a lot of variety and other kind of
planetary systems that could be out
there for example this system up here on
the top right has a planet that looks a
lot like the earth in it but the system
itself looks quite a bit different
there's a whole bunch of six or seven
Mars sized icy planets out there and
there's no Jupiter there's a giant
planet out there it's only about the
size of Neptune which is about 20 times
less massive than Jupiter up here in the
top left is a system that formed this
planet right there which is right at the
right temperature for water to be liquid
on this planet's surface so you might
think it's a good chance for life this
guy but it turns out that during the
formation process it didn't actually get
any water so this planet right here is
in the right spot for life but it's got
no water so that kind of sucks and down
here in the bottom left is a system that
looks a lot different than the solar
system we have
a hot Jupiter this thing is about
Jupiter size a big ball of gas and it's
very close in very close to its star
even closer there's another kind of
earth-like planet but it's really too
hot it's kind of like a hotter planet
way too hot for life but exterior to
that hot Jupiter is this planet this
guy's you know about the size of the
earth maybe a little bigger and it's got
a ton of water on it's got maybe you
know 50 or 100 times as much water on as
the earth so it's probably covered in
oceans that are many miles deep so the
kind of things I'm going to be talking
about today are you know how and where
two earth-like planets form and when are
we going to find planets like Earth
around other stars so that's kind of
stuff I'm gonna be telling you guys
about in the next half hour an hour so
and before I get going I want to thank
NASA who has provided me with funding to
do this work for the last few years and
also to Danone for inviting me out here
so here we go so before we get going let
me just give you guys some details about
the solar system this is kind of the
thing I give to all these public talks I
do just so everyone's on the same page
here we want to know what is going on in
the solar system
so in our solar system we have you know
terrestrial planets close in close to
the star close to the Sun and big balls
of gas further out the the biggest
planet in the solar system is Jupiter
it's about 300 times more massive than
the earth and its really the big kind of
the boss of the planets it does most of
the you know it's gravity really
dominates the solar system and then you
know the earth is special obviously
because we have life on it and one other
thing I forgot to mention is in this
picture right the distances between
planets are not the scale the distance
from the earth the Sun is called one
astronomical unit and for example
Jupiter is out at five astronomical
units
you know Neptune's out at 30
astronomical units so oh right I guess
it's good so kind of to start off here
let's talk about how or where planets
form so here's an image of the galaxy
this is an our galaxy
you can't really see our galaxy because
we're embedded in it but this is the
closest galaxy that we think is quite
similar to our own this is the end
dromeda galaxy it's a big spiral galaxy
and if this were the Milky Way because
we think the Milky Way looks about the
same as in dromeda we would be kind of
somewhere out here not in the center not
on the very edge but probably about 2/3
of the way out you know from the center
to the edge of the galaxy so that's
about where we are and the total number
of stars in here is about you know a few
hundred billion you know not too many a
few here and there so we're out there
now where do these stars form we know
they're forming in the galaxies
somewhere and they form in places in the
galaxy called giant molecular clouds so
hopefully you guys are familiar with the
constellation Orion
it's very bright up there in the summer
sky right now and so Orion's shield is
out here and this is Orion's belt if you
look carefully there's a little fuzzy
thing in Orion's belt and that's called
the Orion Nebula and when you look at it
a little closer up it looks like this
this is a young kind of star forming
Factory this is a big cloud of molecular
gas and each of these little clumps
they're kind of hard to see here but
little clumps in there are actively
forming stars right now and that's not
the only one of these that's close by
there's another one for example called
the Eagle Nebula this is a famous Hubble
Space Telescope image of one of these
young star forming regions and so this
is kind of the these are the big you
know clouds of gas that are forming
stars right now in terms of planets
where do they form well they form around
stars right and so here's kind of a
schematic image of what we think happens
during the plant formation process just
showing a lot of things happening at
once you know here's the stars right the
center in there there's some jets that
are magnetically thrown you know
vertically away from the star and in
this big disk of stuff planets are
forming so for example here this is a
young jupiter-like planets that's
forming and it's got so much gravity
that actually carves a gap in the disk
itself and further in you can see you
know there's there's more stuff going on
there's rocks that are colliding with
each other too
bigger planets and we think this is
what's really going on up here is an
image of a disc around a young star
where we think this is what's happening
in that disk this Lane right here this
dark Lane is actually dust which is
obscuring the light from the star and so
you know most of the material is
actually in there even though it's the
hardest part to see and then the disc
kind of flares out from there and it's
easier to see that outer part of the
disc where it flares up so there's a lot
of things going on you know during
planet formation you know to get from
this cloud of gas to a system of planets
that looks something like the solar
system you know it takes a lot of steps
and there's a lot of stuff going on I
just want to kind of emphasize that you
know there's a lot of things going on
like gravity there's things colliding to
grow into larger bodies there's all
sorts of magnetic field effects and lots
of stuff going on and so what we're
doing now is trying to look at little
pieces of a puzzle independently to try
to build the picture up together but of
course you know there's lots of things
going on and they haven't all been to
put together yet so next we know where
planets form now which planets could
have life what do you need to have life
on a planet well the answer is we don't
know because we only have one example on
so it's hard to extrapolate from one
example you know how to to what you
really need but you know we can give it
a shot anyway the things that we really
think are necessary are water you know
heat and some kind of organic molecules
to build your life and so not only do
you need just any water you probably
need liquid water the one thing that all
life on Earth has in common is that it
needs liquid water in some form and so
we think that's kind of a good place to
start when looking for life around other
stars you know it could be that there's
life there relies on something else like
liquid methane I don't know but liquid
water seems a pretty reasonable place to
start in terms of heat you know there's
lots of different sources of heat out
there and the one I'll be talking about
most is just a very simple thing that
it's kind of intuitive which is heat
coming from the central star so when
you're further away it's colder and
closer to the star it's hotter very soon
so where does this happen and where do
you get this mix of ingredients
and the place that this happens is
called the habitable zone so this is the
schematic of the solar system with the
Sun with lipstick right there and and so
there's kind of an annulus this ring of
distances from the star where the
temperature is right that you can have
water as a liquid on the planet's
surface you know to close in it's too
hot too far out it freezes out dice the
trick is in order to have life like I
mentioned before you can't you don't
just need the right temperature you
actually need to have water as well and
so this is actually the universal symbol
of life on a planet right there so a
happy planet anyway so you need water so
it turns out there's a little catch-22
in terms of forming a planet in the
right place for life and with the right
composition so on the earth for water to
be liquid it has to be hotter than about
zero degrees Celsius but you know the
earth formed in this disk of gas and
dust and the pressure is very low in
there and it turns out that in these low
pressure environments ice condenses at a
much lower temperature so to have ice
form it has to be actually colder than
about negative a hundred degrees Celsius
and the only way to get water on a
planet we think is for it to be impacted
by icy bodies like comets or asteroids
so that means that your planet that's at
the right temperature for liquid water
is too hot to actually have any ice on
it or have any water on it all right
that means that these building blocks
here the stuff that planets are formed
of right around here is actually dry and
so how do you end up with a planet in
the right place that also has the right
composition and that's kind of a
catch-22 and the way that you do it is
actually by mixing during formation so
this is kind of a schematic of close to
the star you know close to the Sun
things are mostly rocky further out
there mostly you know part rock part ice
and on this picture the habitable zone
will be somewhere in here so you know
we're in the rocky zone but we want some
water as well so how do we get that well
you got to mix these two regions up a
little
so so that gets the whole issue of how
planets formed and this is kind of a
schematic of the disk from which we
think that the you know the solar system
formed and so like we saw before it's
kind of cold or further out and the
stuff that you have to build planets is
different in different places so very
close to the start you got metal and
rock further out you get some water you
know because it's it water is volatile
but not really volatile and further out
you can have actually you can actually
build planets out of things like carbon
dioxide and methane and nitrogen and
things like that so you know how does
this actually happen what happens in a
bunch of different stages and I won't go
into too much detail here but there's
various stages in the process because
you're starting from tiny microscopic
grains and you end up with plants as big
as Mars or so how does it happen well
first the grains kind of settle to a
thin thin region in the disk and then
they grow via several different steps so
for example here's a simulation showing
snapshots in time of larger bodies you
know bodies growing in this disk of kind
of starting from things that are about
to decide about a mile across and ending
up with things that are about the size
of the moon or so and so that process
takes maybe you know a few hundred
thousand years maybe a million years or
so and then the real building of planets
like Earth is starting from these kind
of moon sized things and building those
by gravity and collisions into things as
big as the earth so how does that happen
well here's a very simple little thing
to remind you about orbits in case
you're not familiar with them so you're
gonna see these words semi-major axis
and eccentricity a lot coming up in the
next few slides and so just to remind
you say major axis is just you know the
average distance between an orbit and
the star and the eccentricity is how
elliptical it is so circular orbits have
zero you know very elliptical ones have
larger numbers between zero and one and
so for things to collide you need to
have some eccentricity because if you
have you know a whole bunch of circular
orbits they never intersect you can't
collide so for example if one of these
guys in the middle suddenly magically
got an eccentricity of 0.5 then its
orbit would cross a whole bunch other
ones and then you can have collisions
between bodies okay so so here's a
little movie of planets growing and so
just so you guys know what's going on
here we got eccentricity and an orbital
distance and the colors represent
composition so red means dry and blue
means 5% water in this case and so so
one is the Earth's Sun distance the Sun
is here at zero and there's actually
Jupiter's actually in this simulation as
well it's just off the edge of the graph
it's out there at about 5 and 1/2
astronomical units so so here we go so
you can see very quickly things are
starting to happen and up here by the
way is just the the time going by an
mega year so in in millions of years so
plants kind of grow they tend to grow
faster closer to the star where orbits
are are faster and you can see for most
you know for the first 10 or 20 million
years everything that's in the inner
disk stays red and this stuff out here
stays blue there's still no water this
guy here is growing it's at this time
it's about the size of Earth and you can
see it's still red and then at some
point there just change color what that
means is that it got impacted by
something that started off out here you
know whose orbit got changed and
eventually made its way into the
habitable zone which is you know at
around one astronomical unit or so so
these three plants formed relatively
quickly and maybe 30 or 50 million years
or so and then we have this belt of
asteroids similar to our own asteroid
belt which is kind of slowly clearing
out and so over you know it takes me 100
or a couple hundred million years for
for things to happen at the end of that
movie there were three planets the one
that formed right around one au was
about the size of the earth there was a
little bigger about two earth masses and
it had a bunch of water had about the
same water as the earth or so the earth
on this scale is about kind of greener
so so what happens if you do this a
bunch of times then you get a whole
bunch of dots that
colors so so what you really get is that
you get a large variety of outcomes like
I was alluding to earlier so you had a
large variety both in terms of okay in
that case it was about 5050 about half
of the mass went into planets and about
half the mass ended up getting ejected
mostly by the giant planet but it varies
from case to case depending on the
configuration of of the giant planet in
the disk so in terms of this there's a
whole bunch of variety in terms of
outcomes both in terms of what the
planets look like so each of these is
the outcome of a simulation with the
solar system for scale you know in each
of these cases a planet formed on an
orbit very similar to the Earth's so in
the habitable zone so that's the one
that's close to one here so for example
this guy right here is the planet that
formed at about the same orbit as the
earth is but completely dry it didn't
get any water during formation this guy
down here is unusual in that it's very
large this planets about three times as
massive as the earth and it has a lot of
water about 20 times more water than the
earth and this guy up here for example
you know this planet is very similar to
Earth but the system itself looks quite
different so that image I was showing
you at the very start of the talk is a
different way of visualizing this stuff
so taking a few of these outcomes and
then you know making them into something
that looks a little prettier just you
know try to try to get the point across
you have a variety of outcomes in terms
of the planets themselves and also the
context the system of planets that
they're that they're in and in addition
to just seeing variety we also see kind
of some systemic effects for example on
you know in cases that look like our
solar system you have a giant planet
Jupiter out at five times the earth-sun
distance you know what happens if it's
orbits a little different oh you got a
question
there's a there's a distribution of
inclinations which are so they're not
they're not anything exactly the same
plan they're in a relatively thin plan
to start but not exactly so there's you
know it's three-dimensional in online
music it depends on the case it can in
in in most cases it it converges where
all the planets are within a few degrees
at the end but not always
so one systematic effect that's quite
strong is that the eccentricity of the
outer giant planet really affects what's
going on we you know with the with
earth-like planets and why is that it's
because its orbit ends up coming a lot
closer so for example the star here is
this you know the black dot there and
each of these circles represents more or
less the orbit of the earth so you can
see if the giant planets on a circular
orbit then all this material you know it
stays relatively far away from the earth
and it's not intersecting the orbits of
this stuff this asteroid all stuff which
is what supplied the water to the earth
in the first place but if it's
eccentricities pretty big than it does
it's kind of interfering with the
process
and all this water it's stuff that would
have ended up on a planet like the earth
instead gets checked out so if you have
a nice circular orbit which is you know
similar to Jupiter's orbit
although Jupiter's orbit is not
perfectly circular but relatively
circular orbits of giant planets kind of
help water be slowly delivered to
planets like the earth whereas if
they're very eccentric then it disrupts
the process and chucks out most of that
water it's tough and so what you have
left behind are planets more like Mars
which are relatively dry and relatively
small so there's lots of different
correlations like that but this is kind
of a very strong one a very clear one so
now how do we actually go about finding
planets around other stars you guys have
probably heard that about 250 planets or
so are known right now most of them were
detected by this technique the radial
velocity technique and so it's actually
measured is the wobble of a star in
response to the orbit
the planet you know simply you know the
planet and the star orbiting their
common center of gravity and so the star
itself is wobbling with a certain
velocity and so by measuring the wobble
of the star towards or away from
basically towards away from from us we
can figure out that there's a planet
there and it's pretty incredible the the
precision of the current instruments is
such that they can detect the radial
velocity of a star which is you know ten
or a hundred light years away they can
detect that velocity down to actually
about a foot per second or so so kind of
a slow walk across of the room is how
fast you know how well they can measure
the speed of a star you know 100 light
years away it's pretty incredible and
that's the kind of precision you need to
find planets like the earth actually so
that's one technique this has been the
most successful technique today
here's another technique which is really
picking up now it's called looking for
transits basically it's a star classes
in front of the basically as a planet
passes in front of the disk of a star
you know from our line of sight the
brightness of the star dips and it dips
periodically once per orbit of the
planet
and so by looking basically by
monitoring the brightness of many
hundreds of thousands of stars then the
planets whose orbits happen to be lined
up just right you know will cause this
kind of signal and you can you can pick
that out and so currently I think twenty
about twenty planets are known to
transit and there's a couple upcoming
missions that are gonna really clean up
using this technique they're going to be
space missions and so they won't be
restricted to only observe during the
day and be confined by weather and
things like that they're just gonna
stare at a given patch of sky at about
100 or 200 thousand stars non-stop for
five or six years looking for planets
like Earth and so it's pretty exciting
so what have we learned so far from
these plants that have been found well
about two hundred and fifty plants have
been found as of Saturday there were 248
planets known outside the solar system
and there's a lot of weird planets out
there most of the ones that have been
found are the big ones because they're
easier to find you know the vast
majority of these are jupiter-like so
they're big balls of gas
they're not you know little rocks and
their orbits are really different than
those in our solar system so for example
if you look down here on the bottom left
in yellow are the orbits of the
terrestrial planets in the solar system
so Mercury Venus Earth Mars and in red
are orbits of four known extrasolar
planets and so these are not the red
ones are not from the same system
they're from different systems but kind
of showing the variety of orbits that
are out there there's some really close
in ones like ridiculously close in those
are called the hot Jupiters because
they're like Jupiter and that they're
big balls of gas but they're
ridiculously hot because they're right
next to their star there's a lot of
really elliptical orbits out there too
really eccentric orbits so I'll talk in
a sec about that so for example each of
each of these dots showing the kind of
orbital distance versus eccentricities
of these dots is one of the known
planets and you can see there's a lot of
them up up here that have significant
eccentricity all the plants in the solar
system have eccentricities below about
0.05 or or 0.08 or so but in a few cases
their planets that looks something like
the solar system for example in this top
right that this system called 55 Cancri
has one planet whose orbit is very
similar to Jupiter's its outer planet
but it turns out it also has three hot
Jupiters as well so that planet that
that system 55 Cancri kind of looks like
the solar system and unlike it at the
same time it's like it cuz has of one
planet like Jupiter but unlike it
because it has a bunch of plants that
are really unlike Jupiter so there's a
question in the back
no it's not these are these are
well-established eccentricities but it
turns out it is as more data on a given
planet are gathered eccentricities do
tend to go down a little bit by a couple
percent but it wouldn't affect the
overall distribution it's much easier to
detect things that are closer to the
star but it doesn't really make a
difference if they're more eccentric or
not any other questions yeah no not
usually they any system that's older
than a few million years has this
similar eccentricity distribution we
think and it turns out that after a
given time then you have more time for
planets that are in the system to go
unstable so you might expect that
further on you know older system or
older systems will have had these
instabilities but the fraction of those
that will have such instabilities is
probably pretty small so moderately it's
moderately true that old ones will have
more eccentric orbits but not to a large
degree so that's kind of what we know
about extrasolar planets so far and so
in terms of these earth-like planets you
know the weirdos that we saw with these
hot Jupiters and the really eccentric
giant ones so in the context of those
guys can you have earth-like planets and
those systems as well so one of the main
models for how eccentricities grow in
this thing so where do these large
eccentricities come from is the idea
that you and instability between systems
of plants that formed on more or less
circular orbits so in this case three
planets formed around the system those
outer two just interacted the Lapp one
of them got chucked out and the one
that's left you can see it's on a very
and so we think this is probably how
lots of large eccentricities came in
back and so the time scale for this to
happen is longer than you know this 100
million years that that's here oh sorry
hundred years here it's probably more
like you know millions or hundreds of
millions of years but the same process
is probably responsible for at least a
large fraction of the very eccentric
plants so it's kind of neat they have a
little dance in there and then one of
them gets chucked out it depends if it
has enough energy that when it's
completely gone from the system
otherwise it might remain on a very wide
orbit it just depends on the energy of
the the kind of last strong encounter it
had with the other planet so in the
context of that one thing that can
happen this is not the case at all
you know all the time but one
interesting thing that can happen is
this thing called planetary systems
suicide so imagine a system where
actually not too different from our
solar system imagine you have Jupiter
and Saturn there in black these black
lines are giant planets and you have a
nice earth-like planet that formed but
imagine that Jupiter and Saturn's orbits
we're a little bit closer in such that
they're actually unstable on the long
time scale they're unstable on a time
scale that's much longer for then the
formation time of the earth-like planet
though so the earth-like planet forms
everything seems you know happy but then
you know these two guys have a close
encounter like we just saw and one of
them gets chucked out and what's left
behind would be something on a on an
eccentric orbit and it turns out that in
most cases it depends on the exact
configuration of everything but in many
cases the earth-like planet in that case
would be destroyed so this is this
really happen well we don't know for
sure of course because we haven't been
able to watch this happen around another
star but there's some evidence that it
could happen this is that distribution I
showed you before and this box up here
are planets that would be able to form a
planet like Earth if their eccentricity
started lower and then in some impulsive
event got good you know knocked up
higher so we think this is kind of one
of the many processes that can happen in
terms of planets forming evolve
and killing each other now here's what
about the hot Jupiter system well we
think the hot Jupiters actually don't
form where they are these are these
really massive things really close to
their stars we think they've probably
formed further out maybe around where
Jupiter is now and then migrate inward
how does that migration happen it
happens by interactions between the
planet and the disk of gas from which it
formed and so here's a little schematic
of that process the star is embedded in
there and this is the giant planet right
here and it actually has enough gravity
to carve out a gap in the desk and then
interactions between the the disk and
the planet tend to push the planet
inward and it can end up being stopped
very close to the star something like
you know one tenth or even less than
that maybe 5% of the Earth's Sun
distance so basically they formed
further out and move in neat little
animation so as they migrate inward the
trick is they're migrating right through
where planets like Earth are trying to
form and the question is what does that
do to planets like Earth the naive
answer and the answer I thought was the
right answer until recently is that it
screws everything up and the chances for
forming earth-like planets are gone but
it turns out that's not actually what
happens so here's another movie in this
case you know the same as before where
the the colors represent composition in
this case this is a giant planet that's
migrated through this disk of stuff and
this time is in thousands of years now
so this guy is artificially being pushed
inward and what happens well these
vertical lines are actually special
places they're called resonances each
you know at this at this one here the
orbit of each of those guys is exactly
half that of the giant planet the
orbital period is half of that and that
turns out to be a special place where
eccentricities excited a lot and because
of these resonances some material can
actually be pushed inward and some ends
up getting a little too close to a giant
planet gets scattered out and so after
this thing plows through this disk of
stuff you know a bunch of material
remains in here and a bunch out here
and so the question is you know this is
a relatively short movie half of this
material ended up getting pushed inward
and these are planets you know kind of
what I would call hot earth planets so
earth because they're rocky and hot
because they're they're really close to
the star and normal earth plants that
might have life would be out here around
you know around one astronomical unit
but you know there's always crazy stuff
out there and can that actually form
planets like Earth you know it's not
obvious and so I have another movie to
show you that they can so here's the
same kind of thing happening that
migration happened really fast because
instead of going for a hundred thousand
years we're going for a couple hundred
million years that my you know the the
giant plant have moved all this material
in here that we got two hot earths in
there and all that stuff out here and
because of interactions between the disk
of gas and these growing protoplanets
you know eccentricities got damped and
and things proceeded in a way that was
not too different than before and so at
the end of this movie there's actually
two large plants to the form there's one
of these it's a hot earth this guy's
about four times as massive as the earth
and this guy out here is about three
times as massive as the earth and kind
of the most striking thing about this
planet here is it's in the habitable
zone it's it's at the right temperature
for water be liquid but it's a lot
different than the earth in terms of its
composition it has actually about 50
times more water than the earth so more
or less the same size as the earth but
something like 50 times as much water so
what does that mean in terms of what the
planet looks like well maybe this is
what it looks like right we don't know
this is an artist conception of what the
planet might look like this is the view
from from that planet that's covered in
water that's in the habitable zone at
sunset because that's the best time for
these kind of artist impressions
so the sun's just setting there you can
see this is that that hot Jupiter the
even a little speck in there is that hot
earth plant that also formed and you
know the surface is probably covered in
water in on the earth storms get really
big over water and they tend to peter
out over land and so on a planet that's
just covered in water you might end up
getting really big storms and so we
decided to throw in a really big storm
as well but the storm couldn't be so big
as to block the view so it's kind of
just approaching the timing is just
right let's take a question
it is so deep
like freezing cold crushing depths of
the earth of
yeah that's a tricky thing is some
people think that ocean covered plants
are not not actually good places for
life
because the surface of the planet
actually keeps the ocean in touch with
the atmosphere you know there's erosion
from rainfall and such that gets gets
fed down into subducted plates and so on
and that actually has long-term
consequences for the climate and so you
know what would that what would happen
on a planet where you don't have that
interaction you're not able to to
basically the to erode away this
material on the surface and no one
really knows the answer so lots of
people are thinking about that but it's
still pretty theoretical and where can
the you know where could life exist in
the oceans I don't know this is actually
probably pretty similar to the situation
on Europa which is the planet of a moon
of Jupiter in that case we're pretty
sure that there's a relatively thick
ocean of water probably the kind of
salty water underneath the the surface
of Europa the service's ice and the
depth of the ice is something like a few
kilometers and then you have a layer
maybe 50 or 100 kilometers of water and
below that yeah Rock probably and people
have been thinking a lot about whether
life could exist on the Eroica that's
well and so the real answer is no one's
known no one knows for sure but there's
lots of these feedbacks that are really
nice on earth and the fact that you
probably don't have them on this planet
surely plays a role in there and we're
not exactly sure how important it is but
even though we're not sure that life
could exist on these planets we decided
to speculate about what it might look
like
I thought it might look like one of
these create again we actually did that
to get on the blog a marine biologists
blog because it worked too okay so now
in terms of looking for these plants why
don't we actually Anna finds a planet
like the earth around another star and
the answer is we may have already done
it and I'll mention that in a sec but
here let me just kind of highlight some
upcoming missions you guys can look for
if you see things in the news there's
these radial velocities kind of wobble
technique searches those are ongoing
those can find planets that are a little
bigger than the earth there's this
transit mission that's looking for the
eclipses of planets going around other
stars and then there's a whole bunch of
other kind of crazy missions that are
you know 10 or 20 or 30 years away that
are hoping to not only find such planets
but actually look in detail maybe get a
spectrum of the planet try to learn
something about the planet's atmosphere
and if we're lucky something even about
the surface so a long ways away from
knowing the details of everything that's
going on on the surface but looking for
some kind of signs of life on them so I
mentioned that we may have found a
planet like the earth already
that's this planet called Gliese 581c
there was a big press release about this
in April and this star is is right here
on this is a map of of the constellation
Libra I guess and so this this star is
actually quite close to the earth it's
only about 20 light years away but it's
what's called an M dwarf star it's a red
dwarf star it's about 30% as massive as
the earth and it's only about 1% as
bright as the Sun oh sorry it's but 30%
massive as the Sun and only 1% as bright
as the Sun and so even though it's
caught it's very close by it's very
faint so this little faint blip there
and so Swiss team used the radio
velocity method to find some planets
around this star and actually because
the star is not very massive as the
planet orbits the star the wobble
induced by the star is larger so it's in
some sense it's easier to detect because
the wobble is larger
but it's harder also because the stars
are intrinsically fainter so it's kind
of a trigger thing but the big press
release was most earth-like planet yet
and initially they claimed that this
planet was like the earth you know had
the right temperature was in the
habitable zone and all this stuff and
I'll tell you guys in a second I was
probably wrong but it's close it's very
close and so we've kind of the details
of this planet are are that this planet
is about five times the mass of the
earth it's in a system of three planets
that are currently known the inner ones
about the size of Neptune which is 15
Earth masses then the next one out is
this one that was claimed to be
habitable which is about five Earth
masses there's one that's even further
out that's about eight or masses and it
was initially claimed that this is
Planet C which is the the middle of the
three planets might be habitable might
be in the habitable zone but there turns
out they were long it's probably more
like Venus than Earth it's about 50%
hotter than it is on the earth and so at
least in terms of our current thinking
of the habitable zone it's probably too
hot but it's pretty close it's within 10
percent or so in terms of its orbital
distance to the habitable zone and the
fact that they can find one that's so
close means they can probably find one
that's in the habitable zone and if this
planet we're a little further out it
would still have been detectable you
know what does this plan actually look
like well no one knows for sure it's
probably something like 50 percent
bigger in size than here and you know
here's a little artist conception of
what it would look like from this planet
you know with the red dwarf star and
another planet close in and then the
other one further out so kind of the
main message here is that we can find
these planets that are a lot like the
earth can't find ones that are quite as
small as the earth yet these ones are a
little bit bigger you know the situation
is not quite the same they could not
have found such a planet orbiting a star
like the Sun when this technique at
least not yet but because it was a
relatively low mass star the Haverhill
zone it's much closer in because they're
fainter
they were able to find this planet and
if that was there then there's probably
a whole lot more that are on similar
orbits but maybe a little further out
and it'll be really exciting when they
actually do find one that stands up and
and is really like the earth and so kind
of what's the next what's next in this
kind of field is we're kind of putting
more pieces together trying to get the
general picture of when things happen
and how they happen and adding more
physics in there and the key questions
we're addressing are you know whether
these water rich plants like the earth
can form around other stars what
conditions you need to form them you
know where should we look for them can
be guided missions that are that are
searching for them and it really comes
down to the question of you know are we
alone are there other Earth's out there
is there life out there and the place we
think that's good to start there is our
plants like Earth that might have life
out there so that is all I got for you
guys thanks for coming my talk if you
have any questions feel free to ask
right now or you can visit my website or
feel free to email me any time so that's
it thank you very much
how far away from the Sun did the
planets in our own solar system form is
Jupiter Saturn so that's alright so the
question is how far away did the planet
from the Sun did the planets in our own
solar system form and no one knows for
sure people are looking into this right
now and it's thought that the earth
formed more or less locally where it is
right now Jupiter and Saturn are a
different story there's actually a
really interesting stuff that's been
done lately Jupiter and Saturn probably
formed in a different configuration than
they are now actually all four giant
planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and
Neptune probably formed in a more
compact configuration and I mentioned
those giant planet instabilities that
can happen Jupiter and Saturn probably
actually underwent one of those about
eight hundred million years after the
solar system formed there's an episode
in the moon's history which we think is
also relevant for the earth which is
called the late heavy bombardment and so
impacts on the moon are such that
there's a big spike we think there's a
big spike in the number of asteroids and
comets bashing into the moon about you
know seven or eight hundred million
years after the moon formed we think
that also happened on the earth you just
can't see it on the earth because the
Earth's service is recycled much more
and what's the cause of that we think
the cause of that is actually this
instability between the orbits of
Jupiter and Saturn and the instability
wasn't so strong that one of them was
chucked out completely but it was strong
enough to really destabilize these belts
of comets and asteroids and end up
sending a lot of them in work and a lot
of them bashed into the earth in the
moon so where did they form I mean they
probably formed in a slightly different
configuration but more or less where
they are now it's not known for sure
whether they could have formed really
far away and ended up where they are but
people are looking at that right now
so the question is how can there be an
instability between Jupiter and Saturn
that ends and they're having circular
orbits so their orbits are in circular
they're about five percent
eccentricities of about five percent and
the way the instability between Jupiter
and Saturn happen is quite different
than the one the movie I showed you the
movie I showed you is just a couple
planets and that's it the instability
between Jupiter in happened Jupiter and
Saturn probably happened for a different
reason it happened actually because you
had the giant planets forming here and
further out actually you know where
where Pluto is now for example it's
called the Kuiper belt out there there's
probably a disc of maybe 30 times 30
earth masses worth of stuff and
basically what happens is because of
scattering between giant planets
scattering of that disc it turns out
that there's an interesting process that
happens where scattering of you know
these small bodies asteroid like bodies
causes the planets to move kind of a
reflex from that scattering and it
caused the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn
to slowly separate and the instability I
mentioned is actually when their orbits
cross what's called the two-to-one
resonance so their orbits were initially
closer they cross this resonance the
resonance is where the orbital periods
are an integer ratio so Saturn's orbit
would have been exactly twice Jupiter's
orbit and then from there they keep
going and so the instability is the
crossing of that resonance and if that
that actually shakes things up quite a
bit but because of this belt of stuff
further out that prevented anything from
going too crazy that prevented you know
Saturn from being completely ejected and
that kind of stuff the belt of material
served to damp down eccentricity and in
that process lots of that cometary
material ended up colliding with the
moon and probably the earth as well
your simulations predict them hardly as
you deserve
that's a good question I'm actually
doing other research on that right now
so the question was what about moons of
large planets and how they form and
evolve alright so we think that the you
know large moons of Jupiter and Saturn
for example probably forming little mini
solar systems basically they form from
little mini disks that are orbiting the
giant planets as they form just like the
plants themselves are forming in discs
around the star and so they probably
form in a similar process with
interactions between the gas and smaller
bodies kind of colliding - to form
larger moons do they survive for a long
time well they have for Jupiter and
Saturn anyway you know would that always
be the case we're not sure
for example if Jupiter and Saturn had
had a stronger instability like the one
from the movie you know it's possible
that they would have actually come very
close to each other and in that process
that would have probably destabilized
the moons of you know the very clothes
and moons of Jupiter and Saturn and also
you know as these planets migrate
through all this rocky stuff like in
that movie I showed there's lots of
close encounters where things that are
trying to build plants like earth end up
whizzing really close to the these moons
and so in some cases the moons can be
dis stabilized but you know we don't
know for sure because we haven't seen
any moons around other giant planets but
they probably survived most of the time
I would think just given that we have so
many large moons in the solar system
sure
I was just curious to kind of like
summarize the search portion of it so
you're looking for planets that form at
about the same mass in the habitable
region of the earth area or
temperature-wise that also have the same
ratio of water like and you're looking
for also I the right ratio of water to
land I guess is that sure I mean that's
a big question is how earth-like does a
planet need to be to have life on them
right there's a long checklist of things
on earth that seem to be good for us you
know we have about the right mass we
have a nice water content where we have
both continents and oceans you know we
have these long-term feedbacks like
plate tectonics which drives various
cycles which help with the climate you
know do you need all those things for
life and we you know the answer is you
don't know the simplest way to do it is
to say you need you know heat and water
and some kind of building blocks but
then as you keep going you know you
could say do you need a planet that's
really earth-like and I like to think
that you don't but I'm you know no one
knows for sure or do you just need these
these relatively simple things so for
example some people I have some friends
who hate the word habitable zone and
they go nuts every time I show these
kind of pictures because wait if you
need a source of heat it doesn't have to
be from the Sun it could also be
internal heat so maybe there's a place
there's actually you know Mars is not
habitable but if you go down a certain
amount then the pressure is large enough
that you could actually have liquid
water if it's there and maybe the
temperatures right as well so there's
kind of little habitable niches on
various planets that might have life and
we haven't even probed it yet okay so
and then the other question I had was is
what is the nearest one of these like
how many light-years away is it oh I
forgot I looked this up recently I think
the closest known planet is four
light-years away and maybe five and you
know I don't know offhand but it's a few
light-years away is the closest known
star that has a planet of any kind and
right now there's no stars that have
known earth-like planets but you know
the cloak the best candidate is that one
I mentioned Gliese 581 that's about 20
light-years away
typically these these searchers are best
for very bright stars because what they
do is they actually spread the spectrum
out like crazy so they need a lot of
light to start with so they need bright
stars so that means either closeby stars
or intrinsically bright stars and so
most of them are within say a hundred
light-years or so any other questions
yeah we have done simulations with
multiple star systems right now we're
kind of applying these models or one
thing we're doing is trying to apply
these models that seem to work pretty
well for the solar system to a whole
bunch of different cases and see you
know what really matters and it turns
out in multiple star systems things work
pretty well as long as the stars is
separated by a critical distance so
within some given separation then you
know the gravity of that second star is
strong enough to disrupt everything you
know beyond some given distance then
it's okay and so it seems to work out
okay and there's also there's other
cases where you can even have planets
around in a triple star system for
example and it's the same kind of thing
where you need a certain stability
criterion to be met in terms of you know
the gravity of all these bodies and once
it's met then things work out okay and
you can map that on to what
configuration of stars is okay for life
I mean other questions
you say that as long as the binary has a
sufficiently wide separation then you
can still get planet formation what
about very close binaries ok so close
binary stars it turns out it's the same
kind of thing in terms of the stability
they have to be separated by a certain
distance in terms of dynamical terms
from you know the habitable zone or
whatnot and so very close binary stars
are ok for for having you know a
habitable planet exterior that's over
ting both components of the binary or
you can have you know a binary system
where you're actually orbiting one of
the binary stars and yet and the other
stars exterior to the planet's orbit
either one of those works and there's
certain limits on each one each you know
the orbit of each binary component
so it's it's pretty striking to me how
in the the data right now I've just
measured you know extrasolar planets how
how large the eccentricities of the
orbits are and it seems at least this is
one way in which our solar system seems
to be kind of very atypical or
relatively atypical just looking at the
distribution I'm wondering if you could
comment on that you know our our we you
know unique in some way that you know a
big scattering event hasn't occurred
which typically occurs and do you see in
this distribution of eccentricities that
we've now measured are you reproducing
that in your models or your models not
really address that point yeah that's a
big question is whether you know we're
normal or whether we're really unique
and it turns out in that distribution of
eccentricities the median is about 0.2
or 0.25 so you know half of them are
relatively large eccentricities but
there's still a large number of plants
out there that have kind of lower
eccentricities like Jupiter and Saturn
and so I forget what the fraction of
planets is that has eccentricities as
low as Jupiter and Saturn but it looks
like we're kind of part of a
distribution and there's a couple
planets that have been found just
recently to have orbits very similar to
Jupiter's in terms of both their large
separation from the star and also being
pretty circular and so we think it's
actually you know it's very hard to find
planets that are further out because the
amount of time you have to wait to
discover a planet depends on its orbit
you have to see at least a full orbit
more or less and so planets further out
take forever to orbit their stars
Jupiter takes about 12 years so if you
wanted to find Jupiter around another
star you have to be measuring it
non-stop or not non-stop but taking
measurements over a timespan of of 12
years or so and so those kind of planets
are just now being discovered and it
looks like we're we're not the most
normal case because the median is
something like an eccentricity of 0.2
but there are plenty other planets out
there that have eccentricities like
Jupiter and Saturn in terms of how those
eccentricities got there there's a lot
of people thinking about that and the
kind of the current best model is is
that model I mentioned of instabilities
between planets so planets we think form
on more
circular orbits and they form in the
presence of these big gaseous disks and
the gaseous disks actually serve to
stabilize the orbits a little bit as
well but they don't last that long the
gaseous disks last something like 10
million years or so so the planets form
there are nice stable orbits within this
disk then the disk dissipates and then
the planets can become unstable after
that and so we think that the cause of
of the large eccentricities is is
largely due to instabilities later on
and we had an instability in our solar
system but it was relatively small and
it didn't increase the eccentricities of
the planets that much you know just by 5
or 10%
okay so in terms of organic material
like what you know how do you get it
there well that's a big question there
how do you get life itself but in terms
of organic material I didn't talk about
this very much but the the source of
organic material it's kind of similar to
the source of water so I didn't go into
too much detail in there but the main
source of water on earth we think was
probably asteroids the asteroid belt
right now has very little material in it
but we think that you know early on in
the solar system it had a lot of
material most of that was cleared out by
Jupiter and some of it ended up
impacting the earth at a young age and
it delivered not only water but but lots
of organic material because lots of
asteroids actually are very rich in
organic matter and so that's a that's
one source of organics and also comets
as well so it's kind of similar to the
water stories that organics probably
were delivered during formation
so the question is about the role of
magnetic fields in terms of the movies I
showed it has very little to do with it
the magnetic field is important for the
planet migration process basically the
magnetic field can can the things that
it can do that are relevant to what I've
been talking about are it can do things
like carve a gap in the disk so you have
this disk of material around a star and
it basically truncates the disk very
close to the star it doesn't you know
the distant flow all the way into the
star it closed it started flows into it
goes into a certain distance and from
that distance it actually material
travels along magnetic field lines and
that can affect in the end it can affect
the planet migration process it can
affect how fast planets migrate it can
affect where they stop in their
migration and so that in turn can affect
you know how and where plants like Earth
can form and so it ties in in that way
but in terms of directly affecting the
the gravity and the dynamics of plants
as they form it only affects that very
inner portion it doesn't affect things
around where Earth is for example
anymore okay well thank you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
