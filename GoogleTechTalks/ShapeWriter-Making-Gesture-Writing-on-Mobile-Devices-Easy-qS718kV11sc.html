screams and it is actually so extreme
that every word has its own gesture
fundamentally it's about connecting dots
on a graphical keyboard or soft keyboard
or stylus keyboard it goes by many names
it's really the same thing it's about
connecting the letters that forms a
shape in that same shape fundamentally
represent a word and that's what shape
writer is and let me take a step back
explain why I've been involved in this
research for about 10 years of time
because it was really motivated by a
need in the end user computing paradigm
shift that is we all know that computing
end-user computing has moved beyond the
desktop it's pretty much a cliché to
say that really is information in the
cloud and there are many outlets or
information terminals to that
information cloud that yet are in
variety of forms ranging from mobile
devices phones handheld devices desktops
laptops netbooks to wall
surfaces are appliances and cars but
there's a major bottleneck to that
vision that is text entry and text entry
is a long festering problem because it
is indispensable in human machine
communications name ranging from
note-taking to email to search the SMS
to blogging you name it there have been
many great work done in this area
however it's fair to say that none of
the previous work has brought text entry
to a level that is even close to desktop
typing and that is a bottleneck to the
beyond desktop computing vision so this
makes it's a very interesting problem
because it is important it is also
interesting problem because we believe
it becomes tractable in the past few
years first of all desktop level typing
is a very old technology in fact it's so
old so that one half century old it's
about century older than information
theory so we have been knowing
understanding information since Claude
Shannon for about 50 years so text entry
is fundamentally a communication problem
it's funny I encoding problem an
encoding decoding problem except the
code has to be in a form that is
comfortable for human users the other
reason that it is interesting problem
because now we have so much
understanding of information but will
also have so much computing power even
on mobile phones so it makes it possible
to come up with more modern solutions to
text entry this is a cartoonist
cartoonist view of how human writing
technology has evolved over the years in
fact writing technology occurs with
major turns of human civilization
evolution in early days we carve symbols
on tablets then
works paper in writing were major
invention in the history of human
civilization and then the Industrial Age
brought us the typewriter which stuck to
you today and then we move to computer
age and then today we're looking for a
new way of carving symbols on tablets
speaking of symbols of course there are
lots of wonderful inventions in human
history if you look at them these
beautiful inventions were largely due to
accidental reasons or reasons purposes
that are no longer really valid today
also writing systems in the world often
migrates from one place to another due
to geo political and social reasons they
are rarely designed with the purpose of
making communications really easy but
somehow they always work out the one
exception is probably the Hunger script
in Korea which was actually actively
designed system led by a korean kim
cynjohn in the 15th century it's a in
some sense more rationally designed
system it's at one of exceptions so
today are the questions that can we do
something better with our understanding
of information and with the computing
power we have today and that really is
another motivation of our work on text
entry but text entries also are very
difficult problem the difficult because
the goodness of solution for this
problem is multi-dimensional and they
are often in conflict with each other
now the least of them are three major
important ones the three important
important ones are has to be easy it has
to be efficient and also has to be
mobile and those three requirements
don't necessarily go together if I can
put them on a chart would be convert
every goodness to other dimensions of
goodness to speed then we want input
system that start out fairly high speed
let's say 15 words per minute comparable
to block letter writing and that would
be
considered relatively easy to begin but
then we are not going to be happy with
that so the system has to be eventually
able to migrate to a level of
performance that is close to desktop
typing level which is like 40 words per
minute or more and of course we want
this process to be relatively short and
also we don't want that process to be up
front that is nobody is going to accept
another typing class before they are
able to write anything with the new
technology so that learning has to be
embedded in actual views all this
together make it quite difficult two of
them eastman efficiency are actually the
conflict of efficiency are actually at
the very heart of almost all major novel
interaction innovation that is do you
want to make it very easy or do you
wanna make a really efficient or you
want to both and it's usually very hard
to have both because fundamentally a
easy user interface is psychologist
called recognition based so these are
human centric terms that is GUI is
extreme example of this that is you look
and select the users behavior is largely
driven by the display or by feedback by
stimulus again human centric from a
human point of view it's outside in it's
a controlled closed-loop process in
engineering terms for the human user and
that kind of user interfaces turned to
be easy but they are not Leslie
efficient efficient interface ironically
a good examples command-line interfaces
they're actually quite efficient because
it's recall based opposite to
recognition based its memory driven and
inside out it's automatic and it's open
loop again engineering terms the other
dimension is that easy interface tend to
be elemental steps her oculi
hierarchically organized but efficient
actions turn to be larger and chunked
and random access so these are often in
contrast buxton and curtain back in
their work on
marking menus articulated some of these
problems and solutions they come up with
I gave a talk last year on this topic so
let's see how she Parker actually
resolved is conflict between ease and
efficiency so she Parker starts with a
soft keyboard or stylus keyboard so
keyboard in some sense a soft keyboard
in some sense is the extreme of GUI that
is every single space is filled with a
button and completely outside in it's
completely feedback driven or
recognition driven say if I want to drug
type the letter quick I go look for like
you and then you and I and C and K and
that gives me the letter the word quick
but shay parker list you can still do
with shapewriter but surely parker takes
a major step beyond that first of all it
connects those letters into one shade or
one stroke and that begin to become a
form of shorthand and look at the level
of complexity of this one symbol it
gives you five letters out the word
quake but what's really interesting with
shape writing is that over time this
recognition based looking letter
reacting to letters from letter to
letter kind of behavior start to
migrating it's a gradual but continuous
process let's say this is a illustration
over time so people will actually look
less on the keyboard but more driven by
the memory more driven by the geometric
properties of that stroke so next time
they will look even less of the keyboard
more into the shape and again the
keyboard metaphorically phase away in
the users I by the shape from the users
memory become a gradual and stronger
driving factor to the writing process
ultimately it will become completely
shaped driven this again is a continuous
process because there are so many words
you will never remember every single
word it's always going to be a
combination
but the progression is continuous and
gradual so in other words Trey Parker is
really about bridging ease with
efficiency the East site is the keyboard
if in CC is gesture and gestures are
numerous so how do we actually do it
technically well fundamentally it is
about using like using information
redundancy so we know actually if you
look at the original paper of Claude
Shannon a mathematical theory of
communications he did a lot of
observation of how letters are redundant
in natural language and think about it
so the average length of English word is
about five letters just five letter
permutations will make about 12 million
and of course the other letter
permutations towards just that alone is
12 meeting five letters / Malaysian
loans to 12 million but what is the size
of our active writing vocabulary
vocabulary of a real user about 10,000
all the words there is in the American
national corpus is only 65 thousand
which by the way is the size of shape
Arthur's dictionary so shaper denotes
that many words so this is to say there
are lots of white space in the
information in the representation of
words and that's where fundamental a
exploiting but different from fiction
fiction replaced input method has been
around for a long time but what makes
shape for acting different is that it's
not giving choices so user would search
a look and select from them which in
turn would bring them back to a closable
process but rather that redundancy that
amount of white space is casted into the
writing process itself as lower levels
of error tolerance so you can
fundamentally miss those letters as long
as the shape is closest to the words
using tent will still give you the
Intendant word the way I to actually do
this is in principle quite simple that
is pattern recognition I'm shape on
gesture key on keyboard
so the gestures or geometric patterns
these patterns gets classified into
65,000 patterns and the closest one is
returned to the user and that's in
principle in practice of course the
Devils are in the detail that is how you
do this efficiently and how to do this
reliably given the large number of
patterns or templates that you have to
deal with so with shay parker with the
current embodiment it has multiple
channels of recognition one chat one
channel is shape that is it looks like
the useless gesture skeleton or malai
zit and translated into a location and
size independent representation and
compares that against in principle
65,000 other patterns that in shape only
and then it also compares where you draw
the shape beginning ending anywhere in
between with a nonlinear weighting
function and what and then there's
potentially also language modeling that
we haven't exploited much because of the
competition of constraints on that on
those memory constraints problem way
primarily on a phone so all these
multiple channels information were
independently detected and then they
were lumped together by a statistical
basing framework they were integrated in
a probabilistic fashion in a scalable
mathematical fashion what's also
interesting set of weights between the
different channels were actually
dynamically adjusted this is what's the
one benefit we have in terms of
understanding human factors or human
action laws one of them is called
so-called ficks law that is ficks law
tells you if I tap a word on graphic
keyboard from a letter to letter I know
every pair of letters distance and
therefore food stall can tell you what
is the speed if you actually do that if
you do actually recognition based
performance or outside in kind of
performance you look to every single
letter you trace from letter to letter
that level performance should follow
food stall prediction but when you
surpass that it means you are doing more
and more recognition
driven action and that was the past
which law so the system actually
dynamically in real time calculating
feed slot predictions for every single
word and use that as the relative ways
to shift weight onto one channel or the
other so if I write really fast
obviously i'm ignoring the location
information in shape parker will pay
more attention to shape and that's a
very fundamental part of shape writing
technology that may not be appreciated
in the early days of shape Reuters use
but over time that's where that's how it
can get user to a high level of
performance technically once we figured
out this technology you actually can use
this technology for many other things
for one thing you can take a step back
say well if people don't know about
shapewriter if people don't know about
gesturing they still think soft keyboard
as a way of tapping then you can still
do that for example you do quick q UI CK
and that's the word quick but when
people I actually do this often they do
this q they actually miss ru they missed
again either missed again XML see they
missed again kada missed again what they
actually get is something else often if
they do fast but if you think about it
those those parts if you connect them
implicitly that's still a shade and that
shape or geometric pattern can be still
fat into a shape writer recognizer and
it still return the word quick rather
than w why I XJ and we call this
discreet shape writing or implicit shape
writing we also called elastic stylus
keyboard esk because you introduced
elasticity to humans action or error
tolerance so as we say the the core of
shape our design is about ease and
efficiency but the next question is that
can we make shape harder even more
efficient other than just the geometric
representation themselves in fact the
tillamook bench reps nations for all of
the words
are defined by a keyboard so therefore
the keyboard layout got to matter so
obviously by default we are all familiar
with Corey and there's lots of the base
and theories about how it came about one
of the most authoritative review was
written by hazel llamada at Tokyo
University in 1980s it has a very
exhaustive search on his topic it's
basically the qwerty keyboard was
designed in such a way that the keys the
common letter pairs are tend to be on
opposite side of the keyboard let's say
qu is common but you can see Q's on one
side would be on the other side and so
on so forth so that means the gestures
all the patterns define encore he turned
to be zigzag back and forth left and
right in a very similar fashion so in
that sense it's not ideal design or
shapewriter it gives you a longer travel
distance actually more than necessary so
can we do better than that well let's
say a window it goes back and forth just
intuitively but we can do better than
that again using a small funemployed
piece of human factors knowledge called
its law so freeze long says that if you
know the distance between the two keys I
know their size you can actually
reliably predict the amount of time it
takes to move from letter s to letter I
then of course we know not all that
repairs are equal but that's for easy
that's you combine any text corpus and
find out all the diagraph tables or the
digraph that works with frequencies and
you can use that to wait the letter
pairs and you calculate an average time
to make a tab on that keyboard and I
call that fits digraph energy the ring
the reason I called energy is because it
really is the amount of energy
expenditure proportional to what users
have to spend once we have energy
function we can view the keyboard really
as a
molecule think about it so that's how
statistical physicists find out the
structure of a molecule that is you have
an energy function you want to find
where the minimum minimum energy state
is which should be the structure the
most stable structure of a molecule so
we use the exactly same method very well
known Conda Challis random blog so the
random walk with the drive these
lighters each letter is a Adam the atoms
we interact with each other but it's the
totality for all letter pairs that
interact with each other would
eventually find minimum energy state we
actually also introduced additional
constraints today to the optimization so
the letters other than trying to
minimize energy but also have a tendency
to start from ABCD to XYZ in this angle
the color the darkness of the color
represents how late that letter is in
the alphabet so that nomics user would
have some clue about where to find a new
letter so if I may I'll run short I will
run a short trial of the actual modulus
random metropolis random walk a
simulation process optimization process
so here we start with courting and once
we let the energy start to work you will
quickly find will try to put push
letters together very quickly they will
push the letters together rather than
having them apart and the common letters
like at space went to the middle and
comment letters tend to go into the
middle a less likely lighter less common
letters into going outside and the
letter pairs were taken care of and of
course you can also adjust the
temperature of that molecule so that get
the atoms get more bouncy or you cool it
off so it gets two more stable and this
is known as annealing so now it's
cooling that are cooling down and
doesn't move much and then we bring
temperature up it will start jumping
again and eventually we'll find pull
itself out of the local Mainer
and find the optimal solution and this
is continuing that any optimization
still continuing so we call that atomic
because that keyboard is really designed
by atomic interaction not by artificial
rules or heuristics but it's really
optimal if you use atomic to do shape
writing let me move to more demos to see
how well shea-porter works on atomic
layout let's see this is an atomic so
this is a tonically out no I'm sorry
first one ah so that's atomic I'll just
write some random sentences let's see
note that i turned on an animation of
the stroke so the blue stroke is what i
draw and a system animates what it
thinks is what i intended and the amount
of animation shows how much i missed
that that sentence so this is a
supposedly what Confucius said actually
being a Chinese that never figured out
what the Chinese words are for those
words let's write something on Morgan's
that
so as you can see the shape atomic
become more rounded and more isotopic if
you will because terms of going 20
directions rather than zigzag back and
forth so I'll just write couple more
sentences
well
actually really looks look notice ah ops
one thing good about Trey Parker is that
if you make a mistake it's relatively
easy to correct because its stroke based
rather than unlike speech recognition
and the next best choice is always there
or you can rewrite it very relatively
easily okay that's better ha he notes
that cuz that's a nice feature i tapped
ask the system knows that it's at likely
one word zap them to get together see
more
notice the worst shape i've heard rather
than zigzag back and forth becomes again
more rounded let's say let's read
something else let's say the word
knowledge I write further carefully in
that case let's say I missed every
single letter of the word knowledge and
you know his animation shows how much I
missed it in fact I can miss it a lot
let me push it say how magical music and
still give me the word knowledge
okay um what's also interesting instead
it's actually remedy it's more difficult
to represent words it's actually
relatively easy to represent commands
and user interface of force has both
text entry as well as command input so
doing command actually it's a lot easier
in the sense that it has a much smaller
recognition space so if we start the
gesture from let's say a command key or
ctrl key and do word like copy instead
of writing the worst copy it actually
does the command copy and you don't
believe that's true I can also do taste
or for that matter I can do or anything
you can think of Frank I notice that the
systems it's actually printing notice
that the system actually in this case
does incremental recognition and give
you a preview so that you can use that
to explore the command space because we
don't know how many comments out there
you can think of something that you
maybe that's a command you can try it
out and as you try to say let's print as
you go the systems they if I release now
actually or to give me can print only
only although I only did PR and nothing
completed or I can just go for the
shortest path to the command print
because command might be used very
frequently and that's an important
feature but what's interesting about
this is this is actually returning to a
command interface which is random access
rather than going through hierarchical
selection process so it's much more
efficient there's a lot more to shape
writer and I'll just show you quickly a
few nice features one instead as you
noticed that the system does automatic
formatting
does say automatic from any in the sense
that
maybe okay that's another interesting
feature that I introduced studies the
system actively search for the users
active writing vocabulary so the word
formatting in this case may not be the
active in users active writing
vocabulary so the first time I write it
actually didn't gave me as a default
choice but if I selected it that the
system does a one-step adaptation to it
it will remember that is your active
work to Brighton book memory so next
time we don't get me to work for Matt
leave you I had a typo or yeah so it has
automatic DAP tation in that sense also
it has a case key I say please oh say
iphone No ok let's say icons not a word
what about a word that is not in the
dictionary I do I say it's not a word
and I said well you better remember it
and the next time and so on so forth but
the case key is interesting texts to
sell reverse polish operator in the
sense that you don't require the user to
commit a case up front you can change
the phone anyway you want afterwards so
it could circle cycles through all
possibilities afterwards shree party can
also become much more powerful if it is
adapted to a particular context let's
see if it addresses the music list or a
contact list or a math then in principle
it can understand valves are legitimate
vocabularies in the Gulf gave those
words higher weights automatically and
that will be very powerful but it's also
a very fun process that because it's
gestures flute and we've made it even
more fun by
designing a little game what balloon
pops up with carrying a word and I have
a puppet to write if I write the right
gesture to it but what's really
interesting about this is that the
balloon the words that cared about it
below comes out on a schedule that is
regulated by so-called Eri expanding
rehearsal interval a very well-known
piece of research by memory
psychologists Tamland hour and New York
that is you want to have most efficient
use of practice by automatically
doubling the time new material is
rehearsed but in this case it actually
if you hit it it will double it if you
don't hit it it will come back in the
same cycle so automatically it would
just that in rehearsal interval so
although a very simple game he actually
embed a very deep psychological research
or result we have also done lots of
interesting research that are didn't
haven't panned out a one of them is that
I had a really capable student tour
enderson who spent kaffir exploring can
you turn gestures into really musical
tones so you'll actually hear some
auditory feedback and hopefully that'll
make them more interesting more fun but
also more discriminative because we
think about musical instrument and
dancing but they are they kinematic
pattern and the sound pattern are
completely cobbled so but it was a very
challenging topic we actually finally
have a paper to be accepted to appear
soon on that topic it's actually very
challenging but a very interesting
research topic one of the other that
happens is you start off title something
that you want to correct it because you
started do you have have you thought
about when you start doing a stroke and
I realize I've gone to the wrong letter
is there any way that I can actually
recover without actually committing it
yeah that's a very good question but
it's kind of a trade-off in the commence
strokes research we actually have a sort
of a pencil action so if you go to a
pencil area that will just abort that
action and can start over but again it's
gesture based system correction is not
such a big deal so if you get it wrong
sometimes i do really realize that wrong
path on wrong track I give up I just do
one action either type on the backspace
key or just do a delete gesture and you
can rewrite it so it turns out to be
relatively minor especially once you're
proficient with this relatively minor so
either way would be fine but that's
certainly a possibility so uh well we
have to collect some data of course to
to show that this is really true all the
hypotheses and theories are actually
true so again back to this chart but
before I show the data I have to say
that actually text input empirical
research of text input is surprisingly
hard just ask question about Dvorak
keyboard versus courting and
surprisingly controversial and you will
say why don't someone just run some
experiments show well those experienced
have been run repeatedly and now
depending on who you are and depending
on amount of training you gave them more
touch up classes you gave you always get
different results because the amount of
learning specific two words that occur
to human users so it's surprisingly
difficult although seemingly a simple
question so again back to this chart
this is a one of our studies showing
that if you gave Trey Parker to average
user
to write random sentences simulating
real use in the first session of 40
minutes they start with 15 words per
minute ended up on 25 words per minute
that's already higher than handwriting
recognition can ever achieve then this
is a simulated long-term performance
that is if you keep one sentence random
sentence and asked user to rewrite their
sentence over and over repeat that one
sentence in 15 minutes so to saturate
learning as quickly as possible and
that's the level of performance you can
see people reach from 30 40 words per
minute to up to 100 words per minute
again as one sentence simulating a
long-term performance and anywhere in
between the idea why two shapes really
come to the rescue in terms of driving
human memory which in turn drives the
writing process and this chart shows yes
they actually remember shapes about 15
shapes procession / 40 45 minute session
that is actually a lot because in four
stations of time you will start remember
about 60 patterns and those 60 patterns
constitute about forty percent of taxi
driver right in fact because of the non
linear distribution of known as zips law
in any natural language in fact in
English the word the th e alone counts
for between three to seven percent of
whatever you write so you actually
benefit very early from the shape memory
and furthermore the less common words as
i was doing writing you can see
sometimes i hesitated because i have to
look for letters but some common parts
already came were embedding in my mind
and i can get much faster so uh but
whatever lab studies you do isn't going
to be the ultimate answer the ultimate
answer has to be in the real world so we
actually begin to do real world studies
back in 2004 and the time this was
called shark it was released from IBM
alpha works on a tablet pc form form
factor this was actually even impacting
2004 it was very well received
in fact the mobile technology blogger JK
on the wrong wrote a very upbeat piece
about it calling it revolutionary
breakthrough other users thinks this is
the biggest step forward in computer
action computer interaction I've ever
seen it's a completely new way of
thinking about words also interesting
that again this was driven by a vision
that we need a solution for off the
desktop computing but actually some
people plugging external Wacom tablet to
the tablet pc they say there are instant
convert they actually prefer that over
even keyboard which is probably a rare
case but there are some users like that
options as well the press were also very
enthusiastic from 2003-2005 the large
number of about 100 paper 100 articles
press articles written about shapewriter
ranging from in New York Times to BBC
News this is the San Jose Mercury News
article what's interesting the call it
new way of writing and the word new way
of writing was actually written in shape
writer as a subject line of of the
article but the other interesting
comment was BBC News it called it Total
Recall because of the theory they seem
to understand that boost PDA read
writing but then the experiment as to
continue despite the press coverage at
the time and despite a very enthusiastic
reviews from the user it was a fairly
small number it was a few thousand users
probably who have downloaded shapewriter
tablet partly because tablet didn't
become as popular as people anticipated
and partly because the technology was
really a prototype it wasn't a real
product or rough edges to it at that
point uh we found that it was really
hard to make it a real product with
product with without real a real team
dedicated to it so furthermore the
handset makers actually were actually
skeptical back at that time about
whether you can put a sophistic
technology like
is a recognition based technology unto a
mobile phone in real time indeed it come
to think about it so the dictionary of
65,000 words or 50 to 60,000 words by
runs in shape in shape I her if you
print them out it's 1200 pages 1200
pages so in principle shape harder every
for every stroke in super Girdwood busy
go look up all these 12,000 pages of
1200 pages and find the right one of
course it has to be lot smarter in
pruning techniques to get to the right
one instead of second namely it has to
be real time so it has to be
imperceptible amount of delay namely
about 50 minutes thank you so that's a
challenge and the handset makers were
skeptical about whether we could do that
cycling example speech recognition
technology very hard to do it as well as
desktop so this really needed a
dedicating so in 2007 there's a company
called shea-porter Inc formed based on
spin-out technologies based on this
research program from IBM and the team
is dedicated to the development
customisation service and delivery of
shape Parker I'm very various product
platforms that's a good question so
that's actually what's mated mobile so
if you in order to be a mobile device
mobile solution it has to be very
scalable to size and two different form
factors but one of them is that you
should be able to use either stylus or
finger or even a thumb of course these
have different level of test arity
naturally so stylists will be more
desperate that the extras but but it's
less convenient so Shri part actually
can adapt to both and ideally you can
also tune the shapewriter recognizer
parameters to accommodate different
modes if we get the chance their last
four meters you can tune in terms of the
weights and so on and so forth
yeah well we haven't done that kind of
comparison but I'm surprised personally
by how well it actually works with
finger one hurdle though with finger is
that initially your finger obscures the
keys and you don't have the confidence
you say well what's underneath my finger
and your fingers is not transparent
which which is can be a problem but once
you overcome that confidence problem
then it's okay because shape art is
highly error tolerant you really don't
have to worry about what's underneath
your finger as lens use your shooting to
that letter and cross it or even miss it
you still get the right words most of
time but another interesting development
of course is lasting 2008 all of a
sudden are touchscreen devices become
the new direction of mobile devices and
many many other electronic devices
thanks to impart Steve Jobs and his
company but many other companies are
doing that another interesting exciting
news was the google android operating
system for mobile phones so this made it
ecosystem that's possible to deploy
shapewriter and indeed that's what shape
or engineers did in few amount of time
they deployed shape over android iphone
on windows mobile and on tablet pc o to
get 0 in few month of time they were
able to achieve that and that's not
something we could do as researchers
without the professional engineers and
designers and testers with different
kinds of expertise including natural
language processing you I mobile
development and so on so horse so how
did we do with this run of release while
the most successful wines the iphone
release to date its head the last count
was about 1.5 million downloads a nice
feature of the app store is its review
system so there were about 600 reviews i
did a rough analysis of it eighty-two
percent of it were completely positive
they say words like you know typing on
iphone used to be tedious and
frustrating for me but now I have at the
time of Scott writing pad its first
release for a good reason because it was
not really shape writer in a sense that
it's not a complete input solution it is
application due to the SDK limitations
that we could not have access to all
applications so it's written as an
application a standalone application by
itself there's a a conduit to email but
it's in direct conduit to email but this
says that now I'm actually typing faster
writing faster on iphone then I was on
my blackberry which is a very
interesting comment the next comment
says revolution revolutionized typing is
the understatement of the year the
technology should be part of every
keyboard Oh touchscreens someone
nominate these guys for a Nobel no joke
I have to say there are lots of not lost
there's small percentage of about six
percent of completely negative reviews
and this is one example why doesn't it
work with SMS and the other stuff isn't
that stupid to quit application and
launch another and go back yes he's
right or she's right but that's not
beyond our control that is we don't have
access to those applications ap is the
good news is that our angel application
was also written as a standalone
application because enjoyed did not have
an input framework at the time either in
fact i had a communications with the
android input team while they were
developing the input framework i'm glad
and now it's finally out what android
sdk 1.5 enables third-party development
for system-wide input method and our
engineers busy implementing the next
version of shapewriter android because
most people wanted wider applications on
iphone what's really interesting from a
design point of view is the strong
emotions shape ordering blogs and here
are some of them brilliant this app
rocks kulith coolest thing ever an
intensely intensely amazing idea
exciting so fun it's hard to put down
addictive
astonishing and so and so forth and
that's so on strong emotions to go with
the gesture experience which is really
interesting no actually that's another
very good point that is the app store
gives us such a wonderful modern
software deployment system it also
potentially allows us to collect data
back but however because it's a text
entry systems people are very sensitive
to that we actually don't collect any
data right now and even that even that
many users actually check with us and
ask us to actually collect it does this
data gets sent to free poker before they
actually download shapewriter or some
people who are very sensitive to that
but we hope you venture will be able to
make a version with a certain agreement
with users to at least send some
aggregate data so we can understand them
better but we're certainly anecdotally
have seen people using atomic I would
say that's rare but atomic isn't
necessarily the final word optimization
and I will touch on that shortly so the
vision of enabling desktop level input
on all devices all devices all sizes I
think today is coming closer than ever
and we're very excited excited about
that possibility but still if there's
future work to do one is that the
keyboard optimization the keyboard
optimization of atomic was to minimize
the distance that may not be actually
the best metric in terms of shape
parking experience so we're actively
working on that to find the optimal
design for Shay parking keyboard and
that's ongoing it's actually quite
challenging but very interesting the
other thing we want you to do is a
deeper elegant mathematical
understanding of shape writing space in
terms of how error tolerant that space
is as a function of the number of words
in a dictionary I am very much looking
for looking forward to that type of more
mathematical rigorous understanding the
other even bigger picture is that as a
new way of writing if you can call it a
still I'm satisfying many ways one of
them is that they still requires video
attention so can we get ray Parker to
the next stage that is completely
removed visual dependency so the
keyboard would merely a pneumonic device
only if you choose to look at it and
most of time you don't even need to go
to look at it by utilizing more
computational intelligence and that's
really still first for the research to
come I want to thank my collaborators on
this project it's a large number of
years it's a quick overview of about ten
years of work pro-lok Christensen who
did his PhD with me Barton Smith is a
close colleague of mine at IBM and
engineers some of Engineers these are
some of the engineers at shapewriter
think in beijing's in its Beijing
service I have to say this work was not
possible would have not been possible
without IBM's dedication to basic
research in fact well IBM's mantra is
innovation that matters to the company
and to the world I should also say link
shopping University which supported the
parola and invited me as a visiting
professor and they subsequently adjunct
professor in order to supervise pro lost
PhD thesis research of course tripura
engineers and entrepreneurs the
executives of shape are in had the
courage to take this on and make it a
basis in Denver and that's without them
it's not possible and the early adopters
of shape record are really tremendously
helpful the reviews comments wrote to us
a very good suggestions what we improved
product tremendously based on those
feedback so
oh yeah will be interesting doing that
definitely absolutely probably will be
good to talk to the gphone team but
right now just recently the HD 1.5 made
it possible to do a system wide input
method or many many levels of
integration of trey parker to a device
so the lowest level is writing a
stand-alone application which is really
kind of a awkward way of doing the next
level is a system general input method
which we already have on windows mobile
because it always had input method
framework and now enjoy it has that but
there's another level of integration
that's even better that is if you
actually have more design you can check
the advantage of shape writer and
connect shapewriter more tightly with
applications like the music list or
contact list or any of these so I namak
Lee adjust its lexicon to the users
contextual needs and that will be even
more powerful so the many things you can
do for example you can do commend SI g
for signature or command email that put
your email or there are many many things
you can do if we have the access to
really system design and that's the next
level of integration but right now our
engineers are busy working one on the
system integration of it only system
level not application level not the next
level system application when he came
out
today is keyboard right interesting that
even yeah so I mean yeah I think it a
part of it is just that it's hard for
users to adopt you think no matter how
you know about how much potential minute
that there is too wordy keyboard be a
bath yeah one good thing about shape i
heard is that it is a qwerty keyboard
you can always tap as a perfect a board
and you don't even have to make that
choice and there's no even mo switching
it as long as as soon as you start
making gestures it will turn clicking
shapewriter otherwise it's just a soft
keyboard and you can also use the same
intelligence to do error correction on a
tapping so that makes it a little bit
easier the other comment on graffiti is
that yeah was really made the new era of
PDA computing possible at least
initially but graffiti fundamentally is
still a long hand writing system is
writing one letter of time whether that
justifies the amount of learning you
need to use for alphabet however close
to natural lacking alphabet was somewhat
questionable although to lots of people
myself it wasn't a problem it was really
fun but it was still not optimally
efficient method yeah once you get to
that stage today with pattern
recognition technology you can actually
do pretty well with with cursive writing
in natural alphabet so that need is an
00 that there but again as long as you
write longhand it's very hard to get
high speed it's very hard to get the
level of typing in fact why I write
letters oh I know serve on a PC
committee I would scribble all over the
thesis and won't get there if I try to
read it I really couldn't read it myself
so let alone to be recognized by a
computer
the other questions that what about
shorthand traditional shorthand is like
a correct system or a pitman system
those requires large amount of learning
and also they are highly contextualized
so only the person who actually take
notes in shorthand and transcribe them
transcribe them to longhand they will be
able to actually read it in the long
term otherwise if you don't do the
transcription soon enough they will
forget what they meant as well so in
that sense che parking is really trying
to find all this conflict conflict
requirements and find a solution in that
constraint space again ease and
efficiency from east to efficiency no
upfront learning required but in use you
will get better and better and that
