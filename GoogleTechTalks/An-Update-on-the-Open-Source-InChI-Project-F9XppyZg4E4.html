talk about an open data project related
to chemistry and without further ado I'd
like to welcome our guests Steve and
Igor
thank you very much Kat it's the delight
to be back we were here about a year ago
and we've made some progress and I guess
the other thing I can I can claim about
wine to come back here is the sushi is
as good as it always was I don't know if
the search engines improved in the last
year but as long as the sushi stays at
the high level it is I'm I'll even come
back a third time what I want to talk
about today is basically suggestion that
Simon made last year when we were here
explaining to us naive scientists and
chemists that search engines Google and
the others who remain unnamed don't seem
to like long strings and they seem to
cut things off in a variety of ways that
make it very good for searching but very
bad for chemistry so the suggestion was
that we need to take these inchi strings
some of which as you'll see in the some
of the slides later on can get fairly
lengthy with large molecules and come
down to something that is reasonable for
search engine now and in the future and
what we've done is created a hash code
which is in a sense relatively
straightforward but Igor plaintiff was
with here with me actually came up with
a very good algorithm as well as a very
good way of breaking the hash code into
pieces so that it was a lot more useful
than we thought it might be in the first
place in terms of chemistry and science
as as well as being as close to unique
as one can get it because hash hashing
down never-never is perfect you always
come up with collisions so let me go
through some of the stuff some of the
repeat from last year but will hopefully
get to the interesting things later on I
put all my slides for the last 10 or 15
years up on the website my son put
together for us and so you can actually
get all the slides for
here as well as from Google and the
information about the inchi project and
all the developments will also be up on
the on the u-pack website itself you
pack being the International Union of
pure and applied chemistry the people
who name the chemical elements and they
also are responsible for the standards
for chemical nomenclature and now for
chemical structure representation
there's actually a team of five of us
working on entry to all volunteers you
pack has about five people who actually
get paid in North Carolina and then
another 1500 who belong to all the
committees and the divisions who
volunteer their time for the for the
work the of the five people there three
of us at NIS T myself I'm a guest
researcher there so that makes it sort
of four and then Alan mcnaught has
recently retired from the Royal Society
of Chemistry and he's the one who
handles the interface between the entry
project and you pack in terms of getting
the support and agreement it's actually
a very good team it's a sort of unique
set of circumstances where we have five
people and we're all very happy with our
particular little niche in life I sort
of do the sales and marketing for no
Commission and no sales
Steve Stein is in charge of Dmitry and
Igor and he oversees the technical
aspects of the project and then Dmitry
and Igor do all the actual programming
so they're they're the brains behind
everything and they're the ones you can
blame when the algorithm doesn't work
and then as I say Alan's the one in
England who handles the higher level
interactions with you pack the outline
of the presentation give you some kind
of background in history the development
this new thing the entry key and then
talk a little bit about its adoption and
use and then some sort of conclusions
what we're hoping for and believe that
in Qi is an agent of change we have
never had any reasonably good standards
in chemistry for structure
representation obviously some
organizations would disagree with that
but they're the ones who have their own
proprietary system so they like us or
prejudiced but one can be prejudiced and
correct I've discovered
at least I am I don't know about others
I was going through for this talk I
checked some of my emails which I've
saved for the last decade or so for no
good reason in general but this was one
when I was still working for the
government at the Department of
Agriculture and I was planning on moving
over to NIS T and I sent Steve Stein a
straw man proposal as to how to get this
project started and this goes back
November 15 1999 that's just about eight
years ago and came up with an outline
some of which was slightly controversial
at the time less so nowadays but this is
in a sense you know this is this is day
one and it's it's interesting to see
what's actually happened over the years
I have an incredible number of emails
from people over the next couple of
months in 1999 telling us this whole
thing was impossible and then a couple
of consultants saying well it's
impossible but if you want to hire me to
help you I will anyway so the objective
of the project was to create a unique
label this case the u-pack chemical
identifier which has the awful name of
inchi which will open source
non-proprietary then a fire for chemical
substances can be used in printed and
electronic publications and data sources
enabling an easy much easier use of
linking the verse a collection of
scientific chemical and other data and
information it's basically a project
whose time has come if we had done this
10 15 years ago before the internet
before Google and other search engines
it would be technically just as good but
I don't think anybody would use it first
of all cuz we wouldn't even be able to
tell people about it and the ability to
communicate and have people exchange
information with so much poorer in those
days than it is today we fortunately
have a group of people outside the
United States in the UK mainly Cambridge
University Peter Marie rust and his
group and some group in Prague in the
Czech Republic who are also very much
interested in open source so this is
really an international project and each
of these groups has contributed
considerably to the feedback and improve
development of the
of the inchi and the related software
we've also been getting cooperation
lately from a whole bunch of software
vendors particularly those with the
structure drawing programs and it's it's
quite clear and obvious to us that
unless you can get the mainstream
chemists to use this it's not going to
become a standard and the structured
drawing programs which everyone is using
ChemDraw Isis Isis draw MDL draw chem
sketchcam axon and so forth these are
the things people are using every day
and if they're using that you can get a
little button on their existing software
that creates an entry then they don't
have to learn anything it's right there
and and you know that's getting people
to learn other proprietary or even non
proprietary systems just won't work I
mean you'll get a couple of people but
virtually you know the percentage is so
small as to be relative pretty much
irrelevant this way we have somebody
else doing the job for us we just
include the algorithm in their software
package whether the software is free
open source or in the case of ChemDraw
and so on you have to you know buy it
ChemDraw actually has a very nice
business model every new version they
refuse to let you upgrade you have to
buy a brand new one and so but it's it's
probably the most popular one around so
the latest version 10 incorporated in Qi
and if anybody wants to use in Chi with
chem-dry they have to buy the new
version so I guess we both benefit from
that
I think ChemDraw benefits a little bit
more financially than we do
ok this is one thing about in Qi and
this has to do a little bit with the the
Google base kind of thing it's an
algorithm it's not a it's not a registry
system it's not a database it can be
used for that if someone wants to do it
but we basically just give you the
algorithm and you decide how many
structures you want to convert and put
into this form and what you want to do
with them and and the the registry
systems the main one being from Chemical
Abstracts really index is just the
literature so it's a in a sense very
complementary and and also very
different from anything that
being done here although a lot of people
seem to confuse it and want to believe
that there's a duplication of effort but
there is nothing and in our mind that
comes anywhere near duplication excuse
me I've been I've been traveling so much
for the last three weeks my throat is
getting to me from all these airplane
trip flights
so anyway using the in cheek a knowing
you'll find a match if there is is one
you don't have to worry about things
being deaf didn't done differently by
different people since there is only one
one algorithm and so this way you don't
have to worry about in particular things
like smiles which has a variety of
versions and in fact another version of
smiles is on its way I just was in a
meeting in Barcelona last week and Yossi
Tate's who who runs daylight explained
how they're releasing a new version I
think version six or something of Smiles
which of course will be different from
one two three four and five and he would
like everybody in the world to buy six
and even in particular his existing
customers but for one reason or another
he really doesn't expect it so everybody
has a different version of smiles which
doesn't really help and you'll see later
what one of the problems are with that
okay
what's new since we were here last year
primarily we've gotten a lot of usage
and support from the software companies
and again this is the key to everyday
use without that you know we can sit
around here all day talk about how great
it is but we can't get anything but the
but the current audience which is about
six people here to use it we're not
going to get very far we developed and
tested the hashcode the in cheeky this
is something egg or did and can answer
questions the other is the Royal Society
of Chemistry a chemistry publisher of
with a considerable number of chemistry
journals has adopted inchi for all their
chemistry journals as well as a whole
bunch of other xml work that they're
doing very interesting projects and
we've just recently u-pack mainly and
she really has joined the Microsoft bio
IT Alliance and we're hoping that as a
result of this that Microsoft will adopt
and she is there
chemical representation okay the digital
naming of chemicals this is you've
probably seen this before it just
explains the chemical structure is the
true identifier that structure air
presentations are not unique or
convenient for computers so we we want
to convert this unique structure into a
name by using the algorithm which is the
the entry the characteristics it's easy
to generate it uses existing software so
it's just it's just put into the back
underneath everything or into our inside
of everything and so you really have no
idea it's there and you shouldn't have
to worry about it
as long as there's a little key or a
button to press and get it then it makes
a lot easier it's expressive it contains
all the structural information it's
unique and unambiguous and it's going to
be easy to search and particularly the
entry key there are a number of features
which I'll talk about later you can find
it and find the exact structures from
any of the search engines as long as we
get them to index everything this was a
slide I put together must be around the
year 2000 when we got started there was
a whole question of what this project
was going to be and so I came up with
the slide which was green and red and
the green part are the things that were
allowed to do and the red part are the
things that have already been done
commercially there was no reason either
for the US government to n is T or you
pack in an international body to try and
reinvent the wheel and and put together
and software to do various things so the
graphical structure input is red that's
the kind of ChemDraw Chemex on chem
sketch software that exists there was
absolutely no reason to you know
reinvent that as long as we can get them
to incorporate the algorithm the
normalization canonicalization machine
representation serialization algorithm
and the in Chi and the entry key all
those things in green all the things
we're doing which is basically just the
algorithm then they're a whole bunch of
naming engines are you Peck names
display and search and things like that
those are things again that various
commercial companies do and those are
things that we absolutely have nothing
to do with and all we want to do is be
able to interface with those which is
going on now and so we're just sticking
with the one area of expertise and and
need at least need in our point of view
which is the algorithm the formal
requirements for doing this is that
obviously if you have really have
different structures there should be
different inches whereas if you have the
same structure and just have tautomers
or electrons moving around depending
upon how you feel like drawing it and
you know what where you went to school
and what you were the way you were
taught you should be able to get the
exact same inching no matter what and so
that's the that's was another
requirement the two problems of course
with with inchee or anything going on in
chemistry is the chemicals the various
equilibrate mixtures the imprecise
connectivity the chemists have no idea
what the heck they're doing and then of
course the chemists themselves they have
different conventions different ways
things are handled and between the
chemicals and the chemists you really
have a lot of problems because you're
doing in one case with humans and the
other case with with chemicals which are
difficult to handle in many ways so the
three steps to the entry first we do is
we normalize then using standard graph
theory of mathematics canonicalize the
structure and then a format or output
the the actual inchi relatively
straightforward we've used algorithms
that have existed for decades we just
clean them up made them more efficient
and so forth but you know chemical
structures a chemical structure a graph
is a graph the mathematicians have
solved this problem a long long time ago
and chemists are just you know using it
whether they realize it or not
some examples of starting with an input
structure normalizing a canonicalizing
it taking care that the tautomers the
basic connectivity what's what's done
with it from an input structure I'm sure
everyone's seen some of these slides
before using a tortimer guanine how
we're able to to handle the tortimer
part of it
to come up with the same in Chi and then
one of the more clever things Steve
Stein actually came up with this was to
layer the in Chi in terms of specificity
so you start off with the main layer
which is just basically the connectivity
and then you have things like charges
and stereochemistry and isotopes and
fixed hydrogens then you you reconnect
everything together you can add in
polymers you can add in just about
anything you want I mean the layers can
keep on going down in depth and if you
have that information or want that
information you then can find it if
necessary they're not that many examples
where I think anyone's actually going
down very many layers but it can be done
you can add three-dimensional coordinate
information that you know you can
excited state information you can just
you can go crazy as chemists sometimes
do with the amount of information in
some cases that they have about a
structure the in Chiqui now this is the
real thing that's changed in the last
year the string as I said before it was
too long for the search engines to use
so we came up with this 25 character
hash total hash code from 25 characters
and it's split into pieces the first 14
are the basic structure the connectivity
the next day 8 of them had to do with
these various layers then there's a
Czech character and then there's a flag
indicating certain features about fixed
or knocked affixed hydrogen's they're
really fascinating part is is these this
two part thing mainly the first one of
the 14 characters you can search for
stereo isomers and tautomers and stuff
like that just by using the first 14
you'll find all of the stereo isomers
and all the tautomers and Igor's put
this together based on this sha-256
cryptographic hash function okay what
the in cheeki will do facilitate web
searching and if you don't do that then
you know as I say I think we're lost
it was previously complicated by
unpredictable breaking of the inchi
character string by search engines and
that's another thing this is this 25
character string it's only uppercase
letters if we used upper and lowercase
search engines throw away the difference
between upper and lower case they don't
care if you put a number in they
probably use the number as a break break
point and so we would get screwed by
that to you search engines are just so
wonderful I'll tell you I mean this but
you know if you think about it and Igor
did he came up with a solution
in spite of Google and Yahoo and all the
others okay so the this permits the NC
representation to be stored in a fixed
length field makes chemical structure
databasing much easier and also allows
verification of the strings after
network transmission caffeine it's our
favorite one for a variety of reasons
you see the inchi you see the entry key
and you see where the first 14
characters beginning with the ryy that
handles just the basic connectivity of
of the structure and then the the second
block encodes the proton positions the
isotopes and so forth and then the last
part of it well the last two items the
flag character the a about the fixed
hydrogen isotopes and then finally the
cheque character this is one of the
longer inchi strings that igor came up
with isolated from hawaiian soft coral
and you can go check it out in hawaii if
you want to one of the most toxic non
pesticide substances over seventy stereo
chemical elements and centers it's
pretty long and then although all the
way down at the bottom are the 25
characters that represent the entry key
so you can understand why it would be
pretty hard to use this thing in
anybody's search engine fructose
I mean there must be God knows how many
fructose is in the world this is just
two of them the D and the L the natural
one and you can see the differences
between the two and you can see the
entry string and shiki string in fact is
different in the second half but the
first half is identical so you can find
all the fructose --is by just having one
getting the the first 14 characters of
the in Chiqui and use that as your
search string and you'll come up with
all the fructose --is that have been
indexed by
search engines and this is just really
detailing what I just said about the the
first part of it being the same and then
the second part being different between
the D in this case the DNA oh another
example that Igor put together was the
stereoisomers of menthol again you see
the first and second half's of the of
the in cheeki the first half all being
the same and all the various
stereoisomers having different eight
characters for the second half
representing the different stereo
information the collision resistance
like any hash it's not unique for a huge
data set we've had to limit the number
of characters again partly for the
search engines but also you know I mean
if they no matter how big you make it
someone will come up with a bigger
database and find a collision someday
but right now it seems to be pretty good
the estimated resistance is in the first
block is about six times ten to the
ninth
the second block is smaller because
they're fewer characters about almost
four times ten to the fifth we've tested
this thing on fairly large databases up
to past little bits past ten to the
seventh and then chemspider and a few
other relatively large databases kim
pubchem and then the Cancer Institute
has a database of about 30 million
unique structures that they've come up
with and they haven't found no one has
found the collision so far which of
course doesn't mean it won't exist but
we feel pretty good about the
practicality of this thing so far as I
said it's been adopted by a variety of
people and these are really the people
who are practically speaking or selling
it for us or at least allowing it to to
be sold or marketed or used the
structure drawing ACD labs they were the
first ones Cambridge stuff with their
ChemDraw k-max on with the marvin
program the BK chem was another one of
these open-source and just recently the
MDL drawer which is now simek's draw
they've been sold to simek's iBM is
using it an internal project Steve Boyer
as using it site ejek is using it in
their analysis pipeline pilot software
they had been using smile
but their problem is they've been
dealing with the pharmaceutical industry
and various pharma companies had various
versions of smiles they were spending
more time on the helpdesk trying to
explain to their customers that there
was their version of smiles which was
different from sight edicts internal
version which was causing all the
trouble and if they would only use inchi
then the helpdesk could actually help
them with real problems as opposing to
helping them trying to figure out the
smiles issues the open babble project is
using at the worldwide molecular matrix
and now with the we're hoping the
Microsoft bio I tell Alliance we we just
have a press release from from you pack
and and Microsoft and this is just in
the process of of going through I can I
can talk about this offline as to why
it's actually going to happen with the
personalities involved in it but it's
probably better not to put it on the
video some sample databases using entry
obviously NIST one of the justifications
for cooperating with you pack was that
we needed it for our own hundred or two
hundred thousand chemicals the NIH
pubchem project is using it that's about
eleven million the NCI as I said had
about thirty million there's some small
databases from EPA because there's not
very much data environmental data that's
actually out there and of course the
current administration tries to minimize
anything that might be useful
information about what's really going on
in the environment UCSF has there's Inc
project for docking about four million
the CAG is a small database from Japan
I think it's protein structures the ISI
web of science from Thompson has about
two million
John Wyler their mass spectrometry
registry about five six hundred thousand
FDA with their gene tox whoops sorry
the chemspider which when I started the
slides we're about seventeen is now
about twenty million and then this
crossfire bio Stein database of about 10
million structures or organic structures
with a great deal of information on
preparation and synthesis and and
properties couple publishes the Royal
Society of Chemistry with their project
prospect
that's really a it's a neat thing I mean
this is a software that helps you know
just pull apart everything in a computer
readable paper and tag things and index
things there is still some manual
intervention but most of it is now
automate it and it's really pretty good
prowl science has a drug of the future
publication and they've had inches to
that and the biomed central this is one
of these open-source chemistry
publishers they're starting up chemistry
journals and we'll use entry from day
one and we've been talking with the
people in the European Patent Office
they hired a woman a few months back and
she was planning on using the the in
chief or the representation there the
EPO since one of the things they need to
do when they search for patents is
search the literature to be sure there's
no existing prior art and this is about
the only easy way to do it there are a
whole bunch of URLs one of which the top
one there is the google video from last
year there's a group in Prague who's put
together an information website Peter
Marie rust and Nick day is graduate
student put together this inchi
frequently asked questions which is
probably the more better best
documentation we we have and it's not
ours although I guess it's actually
better to have other people document
your stuff than doing it yourself you
get much much better input and feedback
than if you think you can keep it short
by yourself because you know everything
these people actually had to learn it
before they could actually write the
frequency ask questions or the answers
to the frequently asked questions and
then Tony Williams with his chemspider
has been a very big supporter this whole
thing and has added that to all his
database structures just a little bit
about this RSC project prospect the idea
is to make the science within the RSC
journal articles machine readable
through semantic enrichment integration
of metadata into text readers can now
clicked on named compounds and
scientific concepts and to download
structures or a link between other RSC
journals it's a really neat project and
a couple of people are now looking into
doing it a couple publishers in fact
some internal pharmaceutical companies
think this might be a better way to to
link all the information they have
this was originally developed by Peter
Marie rust and people in his group there
at Cambridge it's one of the few
projects that comes out of a university
that actually is some practical use and
value and the RSC really took it from a
university project to an operational
system and this just is more detailed
about the whole project prospect and I'm
sure you can if you want to know more
about it you can look at this slide but
but it's better off just going to the
RSC website they can give you a good
deal of details about it the Microsoft
bio IT Alliance according to their
director Rudy potent zone the key is and
shiki is a critical link in making the
goal of improving biomedical data
interchange come to fruition in the near
future as more companies and
organizations use the IU pack in Qi and
in shaquita converting from connect
information the international science
scientific community will benefit we
hope they are participate participation
and the Alliance can help expand its
usage a couple of other members of the
Alliance a seller Asst Cambridge soft
Kim axon so there are some companies
besides the farmer companies and and
companies software companies that
support the pharma industry that bond to
the Alliance so to summarize this the
overall features it's the only publicly
available method for creating a unique
chemical identifier it's free and open
source it's a sort of web 2.0 everyone
uses it and collaborates as opposed to
coming from any kind of central source
that's why there is no registry there is
no no master database that anybody on
the project has I'm the closest we have
is 100 some odd thousand a mass spectra
and some thermodynamic data at n ist but
that's just the one database that
belongs to the N is T in the first place
it's sponsored by you pack the
International Union and primarily has
been implemented by NIS T with a lot of
feedback in cooperation
and this server of information that we
get a lot of a lot of really good
questions and and help from from the
community you seem to find this an
extremely useful thing to have now and
the and she allows the chemical
community use the key as a universal
chemical identifier which is I said you
know makes it a lot easier for searching
and it unlocks a lot of data from sites
around the world which you couldn't get
the information previously a number of
publishes and and database owners tema
german publisher Elsevier thompson two
of them I guess the largest scientific
publishers in the world are using it
prowl science which was just just bought
a couple of weeks ago by Thompson and
then John Wiley they all have this free
structure and a number in linking
systems to now use things that they
never had in the past again to not to
want to belittle it again open source no
costs that can be generated by anyone
anywhere there are very few in chi-chi's
associated with the literature so this
is not a duplication or an overlap with
any organization doing abstracting of
chemicals and it's it's really the only
thing available for people have
different databases that want to link
together the in chi-chi's are always
like anything else as well as the
entries are created by the the owners of
these databases so they control what
what it's done and it's very easy to
from that point of view I think to
understand why it's being adopted this
is just a long collection of
acknowledgments including Simon now I
added you this year right underneath
Alice Cooper but that's another story if
anybody wants to hear that I'll tell you
tell you about that later and that's
about it be happy to answer some
questions and I thank everyone for
attending and I hope we can learn a
little bit more about how we can get
Google to participate a bit more in the
project if that's if that's possible and
useful I realize chemistry turns out to
be such a small in a relevant area that
it's it's difficult to get any of these
large companies like Microsoft we once
went to talk to Microsoft number years
ago and they said is it a million
dollars a software possibility here and
we said well maybe it's a million dollar
a decade software possibility and they
said yeah I don't know it's not a
million dollars a day I don't think we
want to talk to you anymore so you know
we realized this is tough but you know
we're just all these narrow minded
scientists so we're just just hoping
somebody will one day get a little bit
of interest in it we'll see how it goes
again thank you very much and Igor
myself will be happy to answer questions
Jerry right yeah
well each of each of the second blocks
are different because depending upon
where the stereochemistry Center is what
it is whether there's a tortimer so
those are all those are all different
it's just the kind of the basic
cognitive 'ti is the same I mean this is
always one of the trouble the chemists
have you know they draw a structure and
then it may or may not have
stereochemistry it may may not have
tautomers may or may not have hydrogens
moving around and so forth as there is a
certain Sara chemical Center yeah
you want to say something Egor
it's not basic chemical suit or basic
molecule skillet or so it's not
yeah it would be it would be very nice
yeah III suppose it's possible to put a
layer in with it to try to specify a
stereochemical center in fact it means
that we should add a reactivity to
ensure that which is designed for static
chemistry and you say about dynamic a
mystery about chemical reactions so it's
it's a puzzle but a rather difficult
difficult rather long story rather gonk
way chemistry is not as good as it
should be well I mean you're dealing
with chemicals and chemists so between
the two of those what you want makes
sense but it will take a while to say
the least
right right yeah I mean the closest the
closest we have is that flag character
you can see the next to last line there
and indicating something about the
stereochemistry being there or not but
not the specific stereochemistry center
that's the problem but you know some of
these things as igor pointed out with
one of the other slide which is it yeah
this one you know this has a heck of a
lot of stereochemical centers and if
you're interested in just one of those
it'd be pretty hard to tag it I think
that's that's the problem if we did tag
it this thing would get even bigger and
longer it makes sense when you have a
relatively small system and a small
number of possible stereo centers but
the trouble is you have to build the
system to handle something this size and
once you do that
I suspect the combinatorial numbers get
completely out of hand and you're not
going to get a search string that Google
or anyone else can handle
yes that's all yeah that's right this is
not particularly large but it's large
enough to show the you know how how
difficult that it is and and what the
advantage of the key is and the hashing
down I guess you know the only argument
I might make that's sort of half
satisfactory is you can limit using this
to probably a small number of
possibilities when you do a search and
you're not going to be able to limit it
down to just that one stereochemical
Center that you want to see but if you
have a database of a couple hundred
thousand if you can narrow it down to a
couple of dozen or less then you're in
much better shape than you are now so I
mean yeah now that you have a fixed
length short key it seems the next step
might be to write a little program that
would print out a bar code that people
could include in their papers so that
when you have printed material you can
move your mouse over the bike route bar
code and it would read out the inchi and
look it up for you oh that's it
yeah Tony Williams is big on barcodes as
the fellow runs chemspider yeah and
working we have to suggest that because
he he worked on that when he worked at
ACD labs he was he was big on bar coding
and they they may actually have some
procedures to do something like that the
big problem right now is getting these
bloody publishers to adopt it and use it
and the difficulty there it gets back
again to this whole issue of chemistry
is you talk to Elsevier which probably
has more chemistry journals than anyone
else with John Wiley which is very big
in chemistry forgetting the American
Chemical Society since they seem to be
going off in their own isolated world
anyway and their comment from from
talking to some people at Elsevier was
yeah this is really great but you know
70 80 percent of our journals are not
chemistry we have this enormous
production system we can't modify it for
chemistry so the question is how can you
get them to basically do a post
production
of adding things like inchi barcodes
whatever you want to talk about into
their production systems and the same
with Wiley and so forth I mean the the
RSC project prospect I mean they just
started from scratch threw everything
away and integrated it into their basic
operation but they're they're British
Chemical Society and so everything they
do is chemistry the big publishers
Thompson Elsevier Wiley you know they're
not a hundred percent chemistry by any
means a very small percentage and we
just we just can't seem to get to first
base with them yet I think sooner or
later they will realize its value what
I'm going to visit tema and Wiley in
Germany next week and again to open a
conversation and the dialogue to see
what they want to do but I whenever they
tell me they got this production system
and how are we gonna modify it I throw
my hands up because I don't have a
network I have an answer just spend all
this money and do it but or tell them to
require their authors to provide it as
part of the text yeah well I think we're
gonna get out of Iraq before we can get
to one things to change I'm my wife's an
editor for Elsevier and I told her about
what open access really meant and she
says I'll be damned so I'm gonna spend
my grant money on open access and I
think you know this is the whole thing I
mean it sounds great
it's it's it's the have-nots who really
like open access open source and there
are a lot of those but they don't vote
against this and they're not empowering
control yeah yeah that's why yeah but
it's it's just it's a very slow process
and I'm just hoping that this is you
know the first step and I'd say in a
year and a half we've really gotten a
lot of traction out of this if you think
about it I mean smiles has been around
for since around 1980 and the Chemical
Abstracts registry system has been
around since the early 60s and we've
been around since 2006 so it's it's
going to take time but we're certainly
we're much more on internet time
scale I think then the others had been
and I think you know we're getting we're
getting a couple people to want to do it
and that's that's what we need I mean we
need you know we need the right people
to push it and cooperate and it's hard
to say I mean would we're back to
dealing with people and we know we know
about people they're about the worst
group around here to try and control and
handle and improve so I kept on saying I
believe I believe intelligent design is
correct and not evolution because if you
read the Bible you discover nothing's
changed in 6,000 years and I think you
know that's and chemists are even more
conservative than than that so it's it's
it's it's tough it's tough for the only
the only really successful open-access
project has been this xxx archive of
Paul Ginsburg but that was actually
started in the 1930s when these guys
were mimeograph in physics papers and
sending them around by mail I mean so
well Paul I shouldn't say all Paul did
but you know all Paul did was
computerized the whole thing and he had
he had an entire community whose mindset
was in doing this and we have an entire
community in chemistry his mindset is
not doing it so you know what do you do
and how do you change them all and you
know we've turns out genocide just
doesn't work too well or it's not as
acceptable as it used to be so it's it's
it's tough to to make this but that's
where we come out here that's where
we're talking to people that's where
we're hoping we can get some more
traction is this really being videoed
but I have high hopes um I was talking
at lunch two weeks ago I started out my
crazy travel in Iceland with my father
who be a hundred next month and so I
figured if I assuming I'm not adopted
and I have decent jeans I'll be around a
while to push inchi anybody else
comments questions
Igor do you have anything you want to
say about the key ok all right well
again thank you all very much for coming
and thank you google for letting us have
this opportunity to explain what we've
been doing and maybe somebody from
Google who's watching this video will
try and pick up the project and help us
move it along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
