is tomo stephen dorff er I'm the host of
this tech talk and it will be all about
how defines directions how to find there
you are how you can more easily find a
destination or you want to go to if you
look at today's mapping systems you know
we need to map you need to know where
you are either somebody's either you are
or you need some GPS coordinates but
then it's still hard to reach your
destination because you really need to
understand I maps very well and you
don't really know which turns and
Hendrika found out that there is a much
easier way on how to give directions and
how to find the actual destination and
you call the system folks not and he
will introduce how system works and keep
you some real life examples ok enjoy the
tech talk by henrik a killer thanks you
Tomas folks nav Google's next quantum
jump from degeneration to smartness
first of all let's do chrono drum i will
present i introduce myself and say how
did I come to an invention then I tell
something about today's misery and
mainly toxic max two o'clock speak about
the solutions inventions and we will
make some exercises then I'll make 20
minutes later or make my proposal to
goose to google and start the discussion
1430 should be the end first of all
let's talk about our my target group
material group are people who cannot
understand maps like Homer Simpson let's
go my my target group Homer Simpson also
people don't like geo coordinates who
cannot divide the horizon in 360
directions they confuse left and right
continuously blind people
def Tom stata mama mama murder people
rumba bandura people who cannot
associate a name with a place or forget
names like me people who have to guide
others for example in an emergency case
people who confuse east with west as me
illiterate people cannot read but I can
read numbers or person who just want to
be under pendant but they say I have a
brain why should why should I be
dependent but this target group can
divide the horizon in 12 directions they
can read a clock I'm talking about six
billion people and I defend this target
group and I please do me a favor try
also to defend this target group and not
yourself of course you will see I don't
need these tools but today the target
group is our this person it bearers new
clothes you you know the story some
swindlers towed to the imperor oh we
have nice tools nice orientation tools
rating tribal a triple-a but only
intelligent people can see them and imp
error is the decider he like this dis
tools but my target group said I can see
the closest am I not intelligent but a
child said no the Emperor is naked he
has no closes the clothes aren't
beautiful and now I introduce myself
that's me
I am this child I have I'm inventor I
have the capability to see the things as
a child tues well how was the story II I
grew up in some power loom and leave it
some years within a Japanese colony and
there i have i've seen that a japanese
house number is very complicated then i
decided i would change this i will find
a system for to reform the house number
in japan and always when i was
interviewed on a room I saw that there's
the radiation is wonderful you need no
Maps almost no map and after many years
I've discovered the reason for that the
reason is there is the orientation polar
you orientate around the cryst state and
that means that the polar orientation is
better than other orientation in a 1977
I had a thesis with imaging image
processing on brain I will talk about it
then I discovered fundamental weak
points on the actual system and also
gigantic market gaps a simple answer to
a simple question where to and a simple
crash answer to the simple question
where e this was the Texas how does our
brain work what do we have to memorize
we can I'm talking about orientation you
can orientate orient complicated or
nature out and the difference we will
detect if you compare in and out just
imagine us a small light black box and
we just look what comes in and what goes
out
first of all let's see what goes out we
have to memorize Maskull comments on the
second crossing go to the right this is
a comment to our Moscow after the church
go north east is also a comment to our
muscles but it's not possible to
memorize directions that was the first
disclosed I had if I show to you my
hotel is in this direction you you can't
not memorize this direction you can't
just memorize an angle angle to the wall
angle to the Sun angle to North angle
due to the wind direction but you cannot
memorize a direction the conclusion is
on the outside you can just memory you
have to memorize angles no direction
just angles because of that are you c a1
a2 a3 these are simple angles the Nitro
our our navigation is angle navigation I
need angles our brain need angles what
is a angle angle is a space between
between a target direction and a basic
direction this is an angel if you have
no basic direction you can not
reconstruct it then you have no angle
and this is one fundamental error the
signage and the orientation system
nobody cares about a basic direction now
you have Wall Street East Webster glad
but you don't know where is the north
side if you don't know where is north
you don't know where it is and that's
scandal we need angles and Mauer my
target group
only know left right nothing else only
left right and sometimes they confuse
left with right then rotation collapse
will arise and the difference between
complicated Metro is not on the outside
if the if the root is the same the
angles are the same that means the
difference between complicated Metro
isn't an inside but do we get on a
complicated navigation we get names
pictures lat long we need angles and
this this conversion happens on the left
brain side it's a very complicated
process and if something happens then
orientation collapse will arise the
difference is i give you the angle you
need we can make a example now and you
can memorize it directly on the left and
the right brain that means you don't
need the left brain hemisphere I call
you this direction 12 this will be 369
please extend your arm to direction 8
this is 12 again again this is 12x10 288
wonderful wonderful I give that I just
gave you a number and bassist direction
and you have decoded with your
capability to read a clock you have
decoded it to a direction and this is
the system
okay today's misery II this is the
system we have actually you are here the
north direction is on the sky but our
brains need wear to an angle and not
wear well the Emperor said no we need
new closes its not correct we need
something new and what did the swindlers
said I have we have now the revolution
for the third millennium other people
said no that's not enough we have to
quantifies this direct dis dis where
with the precision for nano meters Tomas
this is the direction of vision this is
the direction this is the where of this
room some particular within this room I
don't know where this room bundoora
nanometers the resume is archaeologists
will find you here because with this you
cannot orient this is disgusting another
think maps are toxic tools because if
you found find something on map it's not
the same as to find it on reality for
example which squared square Greed's you
just find something on map but it's not
a tool for to find it yeah on the
reality square grids are not a good tool
in as we say before sadly for we need
where to this time we need to
earth and it's very complicated today to
discover such where's and a map only is
our friend if the horizon matches map
and reality for example World Trade
Center tower to which one is at our tool
you need a map for just identify two
twin towers but if you you hold the map
wrong you will decide wrong this is the
system today that means only if red
right on map is identical to write on
reality it would be your friend if not
we find and today the maps forces you to
memorize a long chain right left right
left right left and if you do just one
confusion the chain will be ruptured in
the basic directions with the system
change constantly if something happens
you have great troubles and another
another point no nobody knows when we
look on a map we make a photo of it and
you feel constantly you make you make
fat photos of it in if if you have some
problems then you and you lose your
orientation then you will try to find
the correct maps but the maps maybe are
not actual if I at the moment I see on
the map I have to go to the right side
if I change my if I change my my
direction I should delete the last map
but it's not possible to delete maps the
nature give didn't give us
a delete possibility my message is avoid
maps as possible a good map is a map
where you find immediately the
information you'll need then you may be
needed one other twice times but today
you have to read maps constantly other
pool tools now there is a study of the
United layer up Ian you know that has as
shown that yearly 1 million colors of
emergency services aren't able to say
where they are 1 million where are you
will because of that in Germany they are
changing the milestones to this system
the system is a quantified position but
nobody understands it I i will show you
how we could do this better try for
example to book a flight to London first
of all you have to decide which one
Airport but you should don't know the
airports you can't book flight other
tools postal codes water it center tower
to let long colors mark on floors that
is nothing what our brains needs as we
saw before we need angles this is a
degeneration I would say ok then let's
talk let's talk about solutions
as I told you I am inventor and have
developed it to systems for four to
answer the questions where to and where
the first one is an egocentric all
system the nature one in the other
system is at exel center call system the
clock is outside of our bodies and for
these two systems will need hardware and
software but is this hardware is signage
maps and display but the most important
is teach where knowledge and then
algorithm for for co versions let's see
the ego clocks acquaintance where to the
first clock have defined it the
convention and I call it the F clock in
front of you is the f12 direction your
direct you are looking to f12 i'm also
looking to f12 with these you could
instead of saying left on the right you
could say f3 + f9 let's make an exercise
please be so kind and point to your f8
wonderful you have pointed through
station angle venice and Mecca here you
can see the side edge goes to the to the
wall no more but your imagination pole
your imagination power goes unfinished I
Muslim and have to pray now please point
to my
after x 0 speak speak you have to guide
me now please I'm Muslim see me at six
hours later than yours fantastic yes you
can I like it I like it the second clock
is the Munich clock where the convention
is m12 is the north side yes this will
be m and 12 and three is Sun Rise m9 is
sunset II the B Line is another
convention is your target direction and
you're cool vidas where are you looking
for well looking to your Co V this is
your actual flight view or drive
direction these tools are very easy to
learn we make some exercises after but
now I'd like to make this exercise now I
talk about our and elf please point to
our ml am-11 and fantastic you have
pointed to is land Vancouver and Hawaii
congratulations again I have to pray
please try to please say me speak to me
and blind speak to me our M direction to
Mecca speak in five congratulations yes
you can ok
well what is this this is a system it
exists since 120 years in its called
time-space convention that means right
hand is clockwise is to later left hand
is to took earlier for example F clock
use the pilots when they speak with a
tower careful a danger from your two
o'clock position then he looks to f2 for
to look for them a blind person says my
soup is on eleven o'clock my sandwich is
on two o'clock and my dog is on at five
o'clock if I want to give the sandwich
to the doc and now please pay attention
then I have to turn the sandwich three
hours to later that's exactly the angle
our brain needs my target group just by
just makin calculate five minutes to is
33 hours that's better than to say 90
degrees my target group don't know what
is nated 90 degrees anna application an
example is a beautiful picture but you
know but for orientation purposes it
says almost nothing just a little text
who vidas seven then you know everything
you know I'm looking direction m7
direction when Osiris behind of me is m1
if I would be near the TV tower and I
want to go to this to this area the red
area and I have to go in direction north
and 12 chest a little text and you know
much more than them today christus state
decreased stator looks like Covey's
he looks to sun rise if you know this no
all other directions the Sphinx in Egypt
covetous three state of Liberty will be
this five that's knowledge if you know
that you know all other directions e
zigzag navigation that's what we do
today I had to write again to right to
left and again to left if you confuse
right or left then the chain is rupted
better than this is to say or to
memorize m12 to north and talk into m6
again m2m 9 that means you have another
two who could help you if some problems
arise much better is the b-line
navigation just give the beeline if it's
not possible to go to the beeline Daniel
you try to you try to use another
another direction for example there is a
way free direction m 11 then you know
you are too late on the next occasion
you correct it to earlier but now in 8
is to earl earlier on the next
possibility you correct to later and so
on and so on will exercise this and this
bill I navigations are kind of watch
angel just one figure m10 easier watch
angel it's an angel if you have problems
Justin ten o clock there's not ten
o'clock and we did you could navigate
without maps it is possible
okay but for to answer the questions
where we need an X or central system the
same clock as before but outside of our
of our body and this is a what what
comes now is a quantum where a
quantified position and it's a Columbus
egg that any child could have invented
the system but comes now you see the
actual maps where are we now a what does
a mean don't know the quantified
position has the format stay to school
Jewish non-state to school where are you
and m and this will be the format of the
position code how does it work well
first of all I have to choose a point
where to Center the clock I call it m0
ms munich lock in zurich I've decided to
suggest gross monster could be mr.
Bricker or something else rad house but
grows Minister is very good then there i
divided the horizon in 12 directions and
called the direction to north m12 and to
south and six and according to this we
are in sector and eight this decision
about m0 must be taken very carefully
each for each city were to decide very
carefully where to Center the clock
because it has deposit will harmonize
signage cartography navigation device
search machinists will talk about it I
have already defined it 200 cities make
New York
it said San Francisco etc we are sector
and eight so our logical position code
should begin with the m8 but that's not
enough but it's really a good tool it's
a good tool for you for someone who
doesn't know where is jury where is
brunch register you just say sector and
eight then we should consider the radius
the distance 2m0 in steps of blocks of
houses or 100 meters or 100 yards
doesn't matter something ere are 10 mins
one kilometer around gross minister
according to this our address would be
m8 r15 our distance to gross Minister is
one half kilometers another information
any child could understand my target
group but it's not enough this to it is
to information we have to divide the
sector's I call it horizon minutes the
main directions are horizon hours and we
need horizon minutes but not as angles
but not as eyes angles but in my case I
came to the conclusion that is much
better to define the horizon minutes as
also as a distance why because for
navigation I could compare meters with
meters and not meters with angles that
means m8 point 10 is one kilometer later
than m8
according to this opposition is in 8.3
we can make a interpolation if you know
where is m eight point 10 we can also
imagine where could be an 8.3 and with
this i have invented a search grid I
have this is a convention have invented
a search grid where the index on map can
be the postal code in the reality this
is a kind of spatial milestones and it
allows interpolation h3 and allow the
extrapolation you can use this map for
to imagine where is and 6 are 40 today
you have just with your addresses you
can cannot use this map but here you can
also address systems which aren't on map
another characteristic now these are the
red rectangles of this grid looks almost
like classic rectangles but they have to
bend at sides the bedsides a lot to
immediately detect where is downtown
fantastic characteristic another
catalytic this grid is zumba bo gritz
abc123 aren't zoomable because of that
you can use them on navigation device or
internet that means there is no grid
because why because there are ssible
zoomable but my grid is zoomable just
the indications change
now you see em 8.3 9.6 and the right
angles are 300 x 300 meters well this
was it a urban system but what what
shall you do between cities for this I
have defined it a global system a global
clock unipolar system as an alternative
to geographic coordinates it's called
watch rose watch as the clock and rose
as the wind rose and it's composed by 12
petals the length of each petal is
20,000 kilometers and the width is 3300
3 kilometers and so you can address
everything bridges cities trees Road
exits in a in a language which children
can understand for example Tokyo watch
rose m1 if the pole would be in Munich
then we could recognize the shortest
distance from Munich to Tokyo is in
direction m1 the rate is about 10,000
kilometers and the minutes are about
thousand kilometers that's an average
just a just a small arm just let a
figure for example rio de janeiro watch
rose em7 the distance also about 10,000
kilometers and the minutes 2008 child
can read it from the map and from other
from other orientation tools have
already defined it two thousand cities
with watch rose please visit my homepage
watch race watch rose calm
very important there you can find a test
program which proves that the system is
completely correct vertical pointing
I'll show you're now a parasite
pictogram another Columbus egg for to
orient with this system we need to know
where is where is the pole where is m0
na came to the following following
Columbus egg call it vertical pointing
Jess death is just the placing of
symbols on the periphery of vertical
surfaces the convention is a round
symbol is the pole and a square symbol
is the north side if this would be the
dart pointer I'll put it here then you
know the north is right hand if I will
put here no Lord is behind me II I will
see now you see for pictures with the
same information the pole is in
Direction f10 and nord is behind almost
behind direction f7 and you need that
for to navigate we'll make some
exercises later if you have now the
solutions and append it from your view
direction you always recognize all
directions the information where Plus
this basic basic direction forms an
orient ater
the future we will we will not be need
stupid stupid signage but orientate errs
that's all you that's all you need
logical position codes and basic
directions well now we can install new
tools for example crossing calls Lucy
crossing codes know where the
information which could help you to
navigate you know where is the where is
downtown where is north and the distance
to downtown in which sector you are now
a lot of information which are not you
know station codes bridge codes and
intelligent postal codes these are new
information which allows folks neff now
we come to the topic you can navigate as
elegant as interview the real you
orientate polar and you can now orient
polar also endure make a proposal after
how does it work as I said we have to
just to compare figures today when we
navigate with house numbers we have to
compare two figures for to decide to
left or two right here you do almost the
same but you had first of all you have
to look outwards because of the
time-space convention if you look
outwards right hand we will go to later
clockwise when you want to know where is
the right side of a river you have to
look downwards in this case you have to
look outwards then you can
compare this I call this folks nephew
just compare their ages 4 to decide my
sty go unless I go outwards or inwards
and for to the side must I go clockwise
or counterclockwise we make some
exercise and with this you can define
children can defy have tested this with
street children in Rio de Janeiro no
problem if you know that you have go a
little bit outside and a little bittle
to little bill to later then you know
that you did you have go between these
two direction we'll make some exercises
you really do nothing else than you do
with house numbers you just compare
major minor and he you'd do the same
your radius is 15 the target rate is 33
and you have to go outwards m6 is m6 is
earlier than an eight so must go to
early we'll make some exercises now our
position is an eight ar-15 as we said
before please point to do to this
direction this is the center pointer
gross minister is in this direction
please try to do it with the arm with
the arm and or speaking regarding sector
m8 you want to go to sector and 2i i
won't i won't say you know where it is
tell you after can anybody do that okay
you can do it after at home if you are
in Sector a child would think like this
if I'm in Sector m8 and went to go to
sector m2 I have to go through and zero
because of that I must not compare the
radius I just I just get my beeline
might be line goes through and 0 but if
I want to if i want to calculate how
much the distance i can add the radius r
68 + 15 and this is Bluebell Dorf this
is the local this is the logical
position code from do bendorf just come
jessica pare the sector's just compare
the radius in this case it was easy
should be easy after some experience
because the sectoral opposite another
example 7.5 air 12 this is m 0 we have
to go inside our our ages 15 register
office inside we have to go to later or
two earlier
you's a pop if the pole is behind this
is later this is earlier we are sector
m89 well in 7 z direction means we're
cool these directions and this station
engine this would be the code of the
station angle m 7.5 r12 we make a
triangulation ok i will show you later
i'll call you again when I explain this
ok I have a slide for your answer when
you compare the radius you divide the
horizon into two parts when you compare
the time then you divide the horizon in
four parts and when you compare these
two directions with the two arms you
divide the horizon in 12 and 12
directions in 12 parts very very easy
but you have to you have to make some
exercises and with this system you could
orient almost without maps in the most
case without maps where it could be this
m12 are 90 I would say look it again on
YouTube and try to make this exercises
airport cloten
now that's now triangulation after some
experience you will detect that logical
position codes are something like the
hand our our hand the radius is the
length of this hand for example if you
have to vote from m1r 45 to m4r hundred
then after some experience you easily
detect that your b line is m5 you have
to learn it it takes some some minutes
but when you you have this you have
memorized this system and it will feel
free you can find you can find targets
just by thinking now we come to the key
of the system the system is a hybrid
between polar system and a Cartesian
system the mystery is here m7 is an
angle and point 10 is a distance this is
a very strange marriage between an angle
and a distance that was never before and
it makes everything very very very
complicated and you have to consider the
binding of the earth it's a it took me
very many many years to build a
converter from geo coordinators to
logical position codes and this
converter also generates the quasi polar
grid as I said very very complicated and
it should be a standard and it should be
a taboo for people who like nanometers
or 360 degrees it should be a standard
for my target group okay now we come to
the end mobile applications make a
simulation
of over orientation for his a little bit
sweat smartphones and you invited to
download to download this program for
pockets one from folks navcom outside of
the window i have a gps receiver
receiving see now this satellites the
the converter is it's fantastic and with
the with this converter you can define
the pole or m you can define the pole
for example in Zurich and we can say I
want a a conversion with a precision of
100 meters 10 meters 1 meter or system
watch rose with one kilometers the
system with this urban system this code
would be M 1227 are 70 each other and
with this program you can change one you
just can't change manually all
coordinates new Oh always give you
so it doesn't matter this was just a
manual indication you can now change
this to gps standing or GPS moving we
are standing we are not moving so it's
another condition come eight that's it
that's our position from the satellite
that's for them is with the in meters
you can see the precision of the GPS
conversion in directly in meters not in
nano degrees but directly in and with is
you could magic cube could navigate
Forks nerve first of all for the order
facility the rave
good
what is this ok this was this team for
laptops it's not completely yeah it's
something ok let's show you this for
munich ok this would be the XO XO center
co system that's my address from my home
the vertical information led long i
convert it to my logical address which
you can find on my visit cards but i
need a go center call directions but the
system doesn't know where is the north
side it will now generate generate the
the great but it has to know where is
the north side where would you say where
is the north side you can do it now
using the f clock from your point of
view the north is on f3 is it correct
you have to type f3 and you say anything
gross minister is direction f10 your
direction or my direction and the
interesting is you can now orientate
rate as entry you in rio you always have
in your mind the Crist's title and if
you turn you feel that the crystal also
moves and it there is something like
that and a very interesting
characteristic is this the system is
zoomable
I would say just do me a favor and
download the system from fox com then
you can play and orient Zurich with this
next application please do me a favor
and look at Manaus online calm and there
click pod to statistical pontus
telescope then you see stables for and
see thanks error r8 the time is late
just do it for yourself try to imagine
where are these touristic attractions
without maps just a substitution for the
postal codes another application search
machines please visit my homepage
foxnews com / search there you can for
example ask well the tech talk is on an
eight hour 15 give me all hotels between
radius 10 and radius 20 in the sector's
seven and m9 this is another quality of
search machine Google Earth now if the
user asks for then we would present this
natural search grid the grid is always
the same the only thing will change
depending on the zone that indications
will change air 200 or 100 you makes a
zone then there will appear another
radius
well coming to the end with the system I
have a Harmoni between cartography
imagination power signage and
electronics and search machines and I
need only two systems one urban system
and one global system I don't need a
Bavarian clock a German clock and
European clock just local or global now
the conclusions these are no tools after
the following us p it's not a nice to
have but a quantum jump a quantified
directions and I quantify positions it
makes smarter and less dependent it
sharpens also your orientation sense and
possibly the number of accidents will
reduced you need less signage signage as
before and very important only square
grids and postal codes get obsolete all
other orientation tools will remain I
just want to abolish square roots and
postal codes it's nothing but hurts
Google the maps will be easier to
understand you just consult it one or
twice one time or twice then you know
everything you did and we're very
important it's a voluntary learning you
don't want to folks navigate doesn't
matter doesn't matter nobody has to do
it it should be an orientation standard
worldwide the same and it opens gigantic
business logical addresses and my
proposal to Google is a basic proposal
just use the system
as I'm recommending for example the
address of office mountain view and this
is the San Francisco address of the
office mountain view from sutro tower in
San Francisco direction in for the
distance is 492 almost 50 kilometers and
the minutes are 116 that is a logical
address instead of postal codes if
Google dues that and it will begin the
dominant effect all over all over the
world they would accept the system but
my top level proposal is the monopole of
the system the competitors are making
money transferring intelligence to the
machine my proposal is to make the
people smarter and make money with this
with conversions selling listens for
conversion and for addresses for example
five dollars a month for Google or for a
hotel there is no price yet and with
this goodwill could only influence
people also outside of internet good
influence with logical address you can
reach people outside of Internet well
thank you for irritation here my
addresses and I hope I've shown you that
this change from degeneration to
smartness could be a good job for Google
and now we begin could begin with a
discussion but i think i could also the
questions always the same because of
that i take the liberty to to disclosure
then a lot of people
ask about protection measures you can
reduce my page under the title of
license what is to do with the way is
impossible the response is beeline
navigation the poll for example where we
will be the poll of the watch rolls
system it's not defined it yet the
minutes we had so it's it's not an angle
but the distance and my vision is this
is today 2010-2020 just orient ators and
2030 you need nothing we have learned to
orient normally just with codes you have
you have again a sense for distance and
in directions then you don't know it
don't need Maps you don't need signage
you don't it's almost nothing you can
just you can naturally okay the mainly
addressing is not so interesting then we
could start with the discussion thank
you sir ball let's sorry for my bad
english i speak many languages but
terrible
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
