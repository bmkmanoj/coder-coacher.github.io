would be a most interesting talk and for
Google standards even a bit unusual so I
think I spend a few sentences to set up
what the topic will be about we will
hear about communities in the Western
Amazon and the spiritual traditions now
typically if you think of highly
developed spiritual traditions what
might come to mind
it might think of Zen monasteries in
Japan or zoos in India or mount artisan
in Greece but what is maybe much less
known is that they're also highly
refined spiritual traditions in the
Amazon
however like with many miracles in the
rainforest we tend to destroys and
before we learn about them and this is
actually concerned here to Paul is hard
and the tradition we are talking about
under polishes would generally
categorize this as shamanism now
shamanism being produced the oldest of
our religions has something in common
with modern science Bose plays a premium
on the on direct experience
that makes this approach to finding more
out about the universe attractive to the
Western scientific mind at least I feel
that way and the specific strand of
shamanism we are going to hear about is
about using sacramental plants
intelligence to basically explore or
should maybe say this differently the
sincere student of nature would argue
that intelligence are legitimate tool
for the student of nature normally we
think of when we think of exploration of
nature we think of things like our best
to is what are those we would think of
things like sir Large Hadron Collider
ozz plongeur Herschel telescope such as
they've been deployed these are sort of
the epitome of
human exploration tools however
psychedelic or psychoactive substances
have a role to play in exploring what is
probably the most riddling of natural
phenomenons that's a phenomenon of human
consciousness and why is this so I think
there are two reasons one is
methodological essentially when you
partake of psychedelic substances the
your consciousness gets altered so you
get we get to see different states or we
can see what conscious could be or could
entail or could not entail so
essentially we get a much more plastic
viewer or like a 3d view of what
consciousness could be because we
understand better what are the qualities
that belong there and which ones don't
and that is a little bit akin to two
methods we use in machine learning where
if you have too little data and let's
say we have only a few images you change
those images a little bit let's say you
scuse M or you scalar them and you still
get this way with limited original data
more data points for your study and then
the last reason this might be a valid
tool is that the human or the nervous
system the human nervous system by
virtue of being a physical substrate
takes part in all physical interactions
known or unknown and through the direct
physical interactions with the external
world it is conceivable that percept can
be formed that are in ways that are
unknown to us as of yet in that sense I
feel that this whole area is extremely
fruitful and intriguing for people
working like many people here in
artificial intelligence systems so Paulo
Roberto name has spent a large part of
his life to the preservation of such
traditions in the
Amazon is actually a classically trained
psychologist from Gama figlio University
in Rio when he has worked and the
unafraid clinic and in a suicide
prevention center in Rio de Janeiro and
then in 1976 he had his first encounters
with a tradition we will hear later more
about the tradition of Santo de me and
was introduced by Padrino Sebastiao and
then later in 85 he played a very
important role role working with the
Brazilian government in legalizing those
traditions so in Brazil these are
perfectly legal activities and while
this is not necessarily the case in all
countries as of yet he also has worked
with the United Nations and he Bahamas
which is a Brazilian Environmental
Protection Agency to preserve key
forests that protect some of those
communities because of the traditions of
course depend on preserving the land and
that host them and he has recently uh
knows is dear to his heart
started in the energy on private
heritage foundation in Rio de Janeiro a
project called Echo Park tapa da matta
they are also going to hear about this
and Paulo's
desired speaker is not just talking here
at Google but he has given lectures at
Harvard and many other places as a
distinguished experts on these topics so
with that going to hand it to Paulo
well I'm happy to be here but my heart
fuse that said about what is going on
with our mother had as a fever that is
affecting us all I'm going to talk about
the role of sacramental plants in
environmental protection Sacramento
plants they do open the perception they
hope expands awareness they grant what
we can call the visionary experience
that take us to self-knowledge when our
perception opens and our awareness
expands we can commit an act of
knowledge in the relationship between us
and ourselves between us and our
similars between us and the cosmos and
the universe we know first we're going
to take a look about what's going on
with rainforests rainforests used to
work by 12% of land surface nowadays is
only 2 or 3 percent and this only two or
three percent lives
half of life species on the world so far
we know around 10 million species so we
can say that 5 million species lives at
the rainforest but the situation as
we're going to see it's not so good at
all here's Africa so from from Gabon to
Kenya line the forest is to there but
this is very fragile this is very
endangered because of a political social
and economic problems in Africa
this is a very vulnerable ecosystem if
the environmental programs or
environmental protection systems if they
stop it somehow is a matter of month
just a few months everything a vanish
the wildlife the flora and the fauna
because as we are as we understand now
environmental protection along it
doesn't do the job
we need to always bring social inclusion
and local economic development otherwise
the situation there is very sad and it's
finishing is finishing is disappearing
that's the situation Africa the globe
and we're gonna see the next area that
is salt in Asia that goes there is
really treated to by development in the
beginning was Japan who is pushing
extraction of natural resources in an
unsustainable way situation all got
worse because of China China and India
they are drawing the draining all
natural resources around if we could
take a look for instance Laos where
Manya
Thailand many forests already disappear
that there's in the place of those
forests they have palm oil plantations
huge palm oil plantations occupy now a
place that was a Nature Center is full
of rainforests so that's the situation
in Asia that's a really difficult really
difficult situation because again social
and economic problems are affecting very
much the possibility to protect those
places
now we're gonna change the move the
globe a little again and then we go to
Amazonia that's in South America
Amazonia is the last broken piece of
rainforest in the world is formed by
nine countries as you can see oh you
have the Gunners there and then
Venezuela Colombia Ecuador Peru Bolivia
and Brazil but it's still huge we
already lost 20% of that forest 20%
doesn't exist anymore
but we still have a huge piece of forest
with the gigantic quantities of life an
incredible variety of qualities of life
you see that's the mega diversity see
for instance in one hectare like 2.5
acres you can find 487 species of trees
in US Canada together in millions and
millions of acres you find 700 species
of trees the first time I had contact
with biodiverse in Amazonia was an
ice-cream shop when I got there to
choose an ice-cream 40 flavors of fruits
that I never heard that before
I took a half hour to choose one after
try many ones if you go to like a little
village by the river and you ask kids
about names of fishes they come with 56
- names of fishes in Amazonia we have
more species of fishes than the Atlantic
Ocean so far they know 2,500 species but
there's much more that many we have
eight species of birds it's a gigantic
giant biological treasure is the last
great biological treasure bathroom
we don't know how much is the value of
that in the 90 in the 90 people say that
Amazonia could worse like 33 trillion
dollars and now people are talking about
more than that so when we burn the
forest we are burning money burn the
forest but we are burning very precious
biological resources so and this mega
diversity comes from time see temperate
forests they came after the last glacier
age a very young like 11,000 years old
Amazonia is at least 2 million years old
time enough to life proliferate in
hundreds of thousands of species
Amazonia is a priceless in refuge the
ice didn't touch her there so for
instance in Europe they have like 300 20
species of butterflies in Amazonia there
is 1000 300 species of butterflies there
are so many ants that there's no word
for ant in Amazonia because each specie
had their own name so they have 30 40
names for ends fruits for instance and
the Western words a consumes around 200
species of fruits but in in the forest
there are 3,000 species of fruits
indigenous people they use 2000 species
of fruits so it's a huge everything is
very huge there in just one single tree
you can find more species of insects
than entire England
in one square mile you'll have 50,000
species of insects so life they are so
precious now sometimes when you are in
the jungle have to speak very loud
because the birds they sing so loud that
you cannot hear each other
and we have their equatorial geographic
position that means equatorial Sun and
eight months of rain so is it look
through there everything goes very fast
in the Amazonia
but why because the ecosystem the
Amazonia ecosystem is a hydro biological
system composed by three factors first
is evapotranspiration during the day
there is the evaporation during the
night the transpiration that forms the
gigantic amount of what steam in the air
water still that come backs to the
forest as rain so this is a cycle that
feeds the forest this cycle has been
interrupted by the forest station
once the is deforestation no more
evapotranspiration or more water still
no more rain and what happens what
happens is desertification that I'll say
is going a rate that is almost
unbelievable that's 20 years ago 23
years ago people talking about one
football field per minute being the
first date now people are talking about
one football field per second and in the
future we don't know what's gonna happen
so I was I saw there in the 70s to the
seventies the eighth was only the X and
then at the 7th and it came to chainsaw
and we think that was the end but
there's something worse than the
chainsaw giant tractors giant attractors
with the ship chain between them you see
and they go and they put hundreds of
forests per minute down because Amazonia
was old ocean so if you dig there you
find Sam so there's just a huge level so
the trees have horizontal roots
very easy to go down CN is going down
it's going down they put everything down
let it dry when it's dry fire fire you
can see like almost like a 2000 kilo
meter long smoke cloud when there's the
fire system there is something that
everybody there is Elmo is a really a
tonic catastrophe of unbelievable
proportions you see and the communities
who preserve their spiritual tradition
who preserved the use of sacramental
plants they are studying themselves they
expand their consciousness they open
their perception to understand this
drama now and what is our destiny are we
supposed to burn together with the three
years what's gonna happen we feel very
endangered if you do the heat of the
fire in our neck see and we are seeing
everything being destroyed
Danna we use the sacramental plants to
understand that not to and and then we
see like we see like a we see like a
drunken drunken hippopotamus at the
Louvre Museum see breaking everything
destroy everything the day afterwards
the Mona Lisa whereas their art were
there to sculpt everything destroyed
with no possibility to be replacing well
another perspective that we see that is
the environmental at the Posche you are
familiar with adipose the Greek name
midnight they killed the father to
possess the mother for us white people
killer the Father God has no more limits
no more ethics and is raping the mother
now she blind and guilty doesn't know
what what's doing so to understand a
little further than that the sacramental
plants and our visionary experiences
took us ten thousand years ago to the
glacier ages see when many people died
many people dying people
- 25 27 years old many people died of
hungry of code see this was a big trauma
and collective in conscience of
humankind that creates a confucian of
accumulate only who accumulated survive
it accumulated in the bad in the body as
fat and accumulated outside to see and
immediately was created a relationship
between accumulation and power the ones
who accumulate it they gain power over
the ones who did not accumulate it and
and we can say that because there is no
limit they come and they ask for one
thousand leopard skins and next time
they ask for ten thousand already ask if
it's possible to get a hundred thousand
and it ends and is added many many
places already see what we happened in
Africa with elephants with rhinos is
ending is vanishing but in this ice
trauma Theory there is a lack there
because indigenous people they cross it
over the glacier ages but they didn't
lost the respect for the earth they did
they did him splitted from the earth in
our culture there was a guy the other
was posted from paradise
and then there was a splitting between
man and nature business people they
preserve the connection they kept the
connection with the earth and they leave
it for thousands and thousands of years
from animals from plants and all
European get there everything was
untouched in Patagonia you cannot even
walk in the beach with so much sea lie
on sea elephants cos was a matter of 200
years everything disappear so we
understand that this communities that
the preserve there are traditions they
are spirit had now the fight for
environment they didn't lose the
connection with Mother Earth that's the
role now of the sacramental plants
now in Americans from Canada to
Patagonia most of the culture use
teaching plants in their religious
rituals with the purpose of illumination
healing initiation reads of passage now
and but when the science from Europe
arrived they are they commit a kind of
scientific mistake let's see when they
heard the report of the engines about
what are the effects of those plants
they classify it as our cinema genex and
that was a mistake because those those
those plants they don't cause any kind
of hallucination hallucination according
to psychiatry is the perception with no
object you see something that's not
there is a projection of yours analysis
in a tourist State is a pathological
state of mind
you don't have time reference you cannot
communicate you alienated from yourself
and from reality and this doesn't happen
with the use of sacramental plants
fortunately in this state there was a
guy last century called Aldous Huxley
that he brought the concept of the
visionary state the visionary state is
very different from Allison entire state
visionary state you keep time space
reference you see there is no break in
your communication is the country
instead of alienated you have expansion
of awareness awareness expands to where
awareness expands as a sphere inside
mind reaching subconscious and
unconscious levels that Sigmund Freud
dream unconscious become conscious and
then you know yourself
these plans has been having a very
important role because they keep the
people connected to nature when you know
when you meet yourself you meet yourself
as part of an immense ministry that is
life in the universe and so keeping this
connection people are facing the
environmental challenge there I'm gonna
tell about three three brief stories
about people who were using those plants
and sometime somehow succeeding to the
fight for the preservation of the
environment the first was Patrick
Sebastian but it Sebastian is my
father-in-law he's a great spiritual
leader in the Amazon and in his in his
visionary experiences in the 70s he saw
the fire coming it's a big fire coming
everything was burning around him that
happened ten years later in the 80s the
place that he saw burning actually they
were already burning and he was told to
take take his people and move to the
deep of the forest and he did he went to
a very hostile area full of malaria epic
in black fever but it well succeed they
opened their rubber trails make
subsistence a Greek agriculture have
their houses everything again was in
harmony see just when they reach this
point of balance appears the biggest
cattle rancher in the region with false
papers hired killers claiming for the
land and in this moment that that was
1982 I was arriving there had a
scientific Commission to study Santo
diamond together with the government
military big de stammers military
dictatorship in Brazil the military
federal
is scientific commission to study about
the sacrum and the uses if was harm or
no harm was the effect so a format a
commission with psychologists
anthropologists sociologists to study
the use of sacramental plants there and
that was the right woman to arrive
because so the military help it
the community to move to another place
because she didn't want to be there
anymore so there was a place called
seldom appear in the community 1980 to
move it to there one year take one year
to move you see and we stayed there and
we are very happy very happy because
finally we got the support so we went to
Brasilia capital of Brazil to receive
the land title's but there was a request
that we should the first age forty
percent of each land title that we
received to prove that we are occupying
and then we refused to sign we refused
to accept that because that means that
we have to the first aid for it you have
to cut 40% of the rubber trees and we
live from the rubber trees at that time
so we stayed they are waiting for the
next cat erection to come and to wipe
out everything fortunately this time I
was invited to speak at Harvard
University for the Harvard speech series
and I met very interesting people there
that took me to the United Nations
environmental program in New York and
they liked it very much our ID our
solution because we are showing the
problem but we are bringing a solution
that we call in that time extractive
reserve you can live from the forest
without cutting one tree our mothers so
generous that we can live from fruits
from iOS from medicinal plants from
Dyess the mast is a huge is a huge
renewable natural resources stock there
that we can live from there the entire
year without any kind of the first
station so the toukas United Nations
took us to the president of Brazil we
proposed ours
Ellucian so we were granted with 1.5
million acres of land and that still
there are - today is a preserve area
mental protection area and we are
developing their sustainable extraction
and forest management plans is very
important to know the forest to know
what we have there and how to deal with
each species so fortunately seldom
appear is going over well and it's
developing a whole new system of life
there the other case is the yawanawa
yawanawa is an engine nation that lives
in the West Amazonia in the state of
Akron these people has they suffered a
lot in the hands of the rubber barons
since the end of 19th century they they
live in a system of slavery there were
slaves of the rubber barons and the
rubber barons used to how you say when
you do the cattle you brand their names
in the skin of the engines see if the
engine runs away from the rubber feud
you could catch the guy so was a very
strong brings people brave people they
turn it away the rubber barons together
on Independence there was the first
indigenous people in the West Amazonia
to have their land title's and so they
were granted with a 700,000 acres of
forest but unfortunately when they're
feeling that they were happy balance
came religious missionaries a religious
mission has replaces material slavery
for espírito slavery see they were
prohibit to use any sacrament any
ceremonies any rituals that the shamans
were Bennett's see and so they very very
hard life during 30 years
thirty years that were occupied by these
missionaries see so in 1992 in Rio de
Janeiro there was the echo 92 was a
United Nations environmental conference
and one and the son of the chief of the
tribe that's my friend he came to Rio
introduce them to many people in the
conference to the United Nations
environmental program he knew a lot of
good things that was happening what's
going on in that time and then he came
back to the tribe and turned away the
missionary elegant very soft very
peaceful he thanks for everything they
receive it and they say please come back
to your country because many people they
are needing they are much more than we
are here so thanks for everything
goodbye and this was do it and so
software the missionaries they didn't
have any option they left and when they
left there was incredible rescue of a
spiritual and cultural legacy of the
engines they brought the shamans back to
the tribe they put the shaman in the
center of the tribe and said to the
shaman please tell us who we are
you really want to know that she was the
second let's call the plants the plants
will teach you who you are and then now
yeah one hour is a very solid people
indigenous tribe that are spearing the
fight for the environment there so but
but the point is Mother Nature she waits
for the union of their children to
preserve life from terrible enemies so
we are waiting that Google can help the
inter connecting them with the world
very interesting possibilities that we
can do with the websites computers GPS
in a sense since remote monitoring
that's very important for them that is
that from their tribe if they could use
it Google Earth they could monitor their
immense territory see and there's very
nice advantage techniques when you can
photograph the land by airplane with
their air photos you go to the feud with
the GPS and then you can mark about the
tree that you are seeing the photograph
is there is a Brazil nut tree for
instance see so you and then when we
interface air photos with satellite
photographs you can do forest inventory
through satellite photographs by the
shape of the leaf of the tree you can
identify which three years how many
trees you have so you can monitor a very
immense territory using those systems
and now it's time now it's time to unite
the ancient wisdom with very modern
technologies like that we can overcome
there's a hope even that we are feeling
the big of a catastrophe incredible
environment okata there's a hope there's
a hope and many people many people trust
life many people trust the Creator the
Creator II didn't create that just by
chance you see he knew that they would
that would happen a human can know that
demographic explosion is a matter of
time natural resources be all consuming
but the still we are created so we have
a hope and this hope is based on Union
the people union of all the children of
Earth to be together to protect our
mother and another case another
community that use those sacramental
plants to our seldom are seldom are is
natural heritage private reservation in
Brazil if you buy land if you have
you can turn your lamp or private
reservation once you commit to conserve
and to preserve life there so we live in
real real is the only series like six
million is a metropolis is the only city
in the world that has a National Forest
inside the city it's a big green island
surrounded by building cars the city
itself and seldom are we live in the
border of the National Park you can see
that at the Jesus statue Copacabana
Ipanema can you see The Girl From
Ipanema there she's in the beach there
she's very beautiful
and so we live we live we are neighbors
we are a permanent preservation area of
the Dukan a tional Park so there is a
very mental vocation for our land you
see what's the best sustainable use for
that land for us is the social expansion
of environmental conscience our goal
there is that because we can receive we
can gain a lot of visibility we can
receive hundreds of thousands of
visitors per year so what we're gonna do
with that we want to provide a kind of
nature's experience bring people back to
nature and they can be educated in a way
that they can expand their awareness and
become natural defenders the problem
with this national parks conservation
unit is very beautiful places is that
there's nothing to do there I've been
here at the Erika Erika
in the north of California when this
acquires in there too and I took my
family was very beautiful there but we
stayed there ten fifty minutes
very beautiful take photograph the ocean
do three years but the kids say no
there's nothing to do let's go see so
there's not enough permanence time to
create bonds with nature so we want to
create
we want to provide a collage Co
experience to the people there that will
call ecwid ventures we need to keep the
people in the forest in a way that they
feel connected and they feel good they
feel great they feel the force the
strength the pleasure of being in nature
create a bond and once you create a bond
you start to defend that and the way for
us to do that first we need to democrat
ties the access to nature the many
beautiful places on nature there are
only tough guys or with a lot of skills
availability to run risks that can go
there old people too that they cannot go
because they need to be a mountain
climber you need to be Explorer so we
try to bring access people can have
access to the forest like like a sky
tram that goes over the canopies you can
go there and from there you can do many
things like you're saying that this for
instance is led over tracks that no
engine you just have brakes by gravity
you go it's very fun attractive exciting
we can have for instance via ferrata we
have a big rock wall after the forest if
your attic is done in a way that with
those iron iron rings you can climb can
have place for put your feet you can
bring your family to mountain climb
mountain climbing from a hundred people
make one or two can do it now the VFA
had a fifty percent of the people can do
it so we are thinking about this is
there this is the sky tram that you can
go over the canopies and watch the
forest watch the birds everything there
and we have another attractions too like
a ropes course this will be the visitor
center now everything in this park will
be a REO because the heart of the forest
is the floor of the forest is the ground
in the ground that leaves micro organism
and that makes the recycle of the forest
and we have in the forest to the animal
trails that you cannot touch that so
people will always be over the forest in
a way that they can really appreciate
that they can really receive
environmental education yeah we have to
the suspended trails that people can
walk all over the forest
well the suspended trains are trails
that you walk over the forest and in
that trails we want to make a kind of
educational experience we want to give
voice to the animals so the animals can
come and tell their story about what is
going on with them and like a character
in the future it work how can the
suspended tree and suddenly behind the
tree comes the Amur leopard and say help
we are dying and it starts to tell his
story see this for the kids for young
people it's very important so people can
really expand their awareness about
what's going on and do something after
the awareness expanded take people to
action each visitor that comes to a park
like that will plant a tree each tree of
that will be replanted in the vested
areas in the slums in places in Rio that
is already the first state that will be
a whole reposition of the forest they
are even bringing the local young people
to participate in these environmental
actions so that's what we are doing
that's what we can do and I'm here I
feel like a like I promised that but oh
but borrow I am a borrow with a message
inside
I understand I'm coming from the people
that are cast out there in Amazonia
isolated very far away from this kind of
forward asking for help asking for
support the Sun is only one the moon is
the only one that appears to all of us
and now we need help at this moment we
need to fortify this communities that's
what we can call sustainable development
I said before see environmental
protection only succeeds well where is
connected to social inclusion and local
economic development even those three
factors they need to be balanced to if
local economic developers to be
environmental protection the create
social inclusion not so it needs a
balance with this balance we can really
protect which can really kick it to the
next generations life on Earth so that's
why I'm here and that's why I'm here
requesting for help to the local
communities there are there facing this
incredible challenge that's to keep life
on Earth
any questions or comments
yes so ya wanna wah-wah-wah Vedas
technology eventually sound so my
question is for the Janna wa yanha Wow
tribe that we saw how develop
technologically are they very technology
they're the young people there is very
bright young people there is very
intelligent
and they understand about that when I
went there three months ago and we
talked very much about all the
possibilities to bring technology for
them to for them to their environmental
programs protection and they need they
need a forest management plan we are we
are signing a cooperation agreement with
charging botanico of Coyote janeiro to
develop this forest management plan and
they get very excited when I talk about
the possibility about monitoring their
their their territory so Google words
for instance so the level of talk
technology is low but their potential
they have immense potential and to learn
and to work with those new technologies
in order to preserve their environment
see ya local government they are stolid
computers in the school they have
computers only they are little school
there but from there this can be
enlarged it now and we are thinking very
some program very important for us is
the formation of new shamans shaman is a
dangerous fishing not only in the Amazon
all over the world you can see that
young people not so interested and the
shamans are there
they don't have so much power as they
used to have in the few in the past so
it's very important that we can work in
the new that the formation of new
champions that is a program that we have
the Onawa let the shaman there it cause
yahwah is a 97 years old guy and he's
like encyclopedia he knows everything
about the forest
so we're thinking about programs that he
can train young people not so young but
people for 4050 years old can be
training as shamans they have the sacred
village they have their village but
there they have a sacred village that's
only for shamans see they they have
their retreats
they make their diets they learn how to
use the medicines and then they can
become new shamans so you're improving
programs that modern technology can come
and the ancient wisdom can be preserved
of course we can make a Google project
for their main information many
knowledge can be stored video recording
voice recording and many things that can
be started but I believe that is not
enough see we need really new sham did
this not started owning computer
father's but in people people that came
is the way that has been working for
thousands of thousands of years oral
tradition oral tradition comes from a
generation to the other
see we need to assure that this process
will continue how to preserve the the
transfer of knowledge from generation to
the other decision
the shaman I'm talking about it's like a
boy he's very young
a bottleneck chosen some ways how
different sacramental plants are let's
say from ordinary drugs used in the West
like alcohol I don't think that let's
say Ireland or the US or anybody's
worried or the kids don't drink enough
anymore that's just not a concern while
using those plans commitment is
completely different from yes because
there's a variance is how Kahana alcohol
people sometimes they drink to forget to
forget their problems their stress their
lives and drink to forget Sacramento
plants we drink to remember it instead
of forget we remember who we are
what is our nature what is our divine
nature
drugs alcohol are alienating substance
like scape scape you escape from the
reality you scape it from what you're
going on
Sacramento plans is the opposite effect
they bring you to a very important
encounter with yourself in another state
of awareness then you can really see who
you are where you come from where are
you going what you've been doing of your
life so that's a quality difference
there that's very important even there's
some statistics already about that that
the indigenous people were another
community that go for alcohol they
vanish the guy distinctive the ones who
use Sacramento plants they are one
strong that's we call the jump of the
cat in Portuguese oh cool do got the
jump of the cat because I Disney's
people they have been so traumatized
they were so offended they were so
humiliated they were so hurt that
naturally they make a traumatic clothes
they clothes they don't trust anybody
anymore didn't wanna see
no new people day and when they close
themselves they isolate themselves and
this starts to shrink it starts to
disappear this starts to vanish ya wanna
wanna or they're doing the god they
opening they travel they come to our
commute in Rio they sing their songs we
danced together use the sacramental
plants together the medicines they have
they have incredible medicine that most
of the people doesn't know I don't know
if about here but for instance they have
the eyes drop antigenic ice drop they
like very much to eat the kind of monkey
it's a gourmet gourmet monkey yeah they
like it very much but the monkey varies
mark is there are the master of
camouflage now he can be like in that
boy and you don't see because the
camouflage with the bark of the tree so
the engines they get a palm tree they
put that in the eye it hurts a lot first
two minutes system that you're either
it's natural Amazon 3d and then we see
the marking snake-oil entheogenic that
you people they expand their conscience
open by the skin contact so and this is
four or five there's like 20 30 or even
more instead of newly they're burning
instead of studying they are destroying
that's the drama our hope is that I'll
say environmental conscience already is
expanding and due to this expansion that
many things are being protected so far
so this is our mission is the mission of
each
it's not a mission only for the
scientists or only for the
environmentalists or for whoever every
every first citizen has the right to
exist and in the power of the creator
each piece each being has the right to
exist so humans is our mission to
protect our mother at this moment in
many different ways in many different
ways
yes of all the population it's still
happy it's still it's still happening
it's still happening now but now less
you see but let's say there is still in
Amazonia there is to around 10,000
missionaries with the Bible in the hand
ready to go and do some studies with
some professors in some of these
indigenous languages but those who were
led by missionaries they just said no no
you don't come here or they would say
they would say things like okay we'll
let you study the language but we need
access to that other population they
block access at least in my experience
yeah there is going on a silent
revolution you see among indigenous
people towards the missionaries
indigenous people is very humble I don't
know if you've been already named is not
struck it's incredible the way they
receive us there it's incredible the way
they make us comfortable they open their
houses they open their families they
open their hearts you see I took my kids
to the to the indigenous tribe there I
was amazed at the way they were
interacted in one or two days they were
already feeling like a warrior and an
engine they're being initiated by the
shamans I'm very proud of that I'm very
happy that I could take some kids out of
the computers and Facebook's and MySpace
and all those things and they have a
live experience in the forest my sixteen
years old kid he met a sacred animal
yeah you get there you dress I do not
going dress it to the repo say oh yes
can we our Bermudas no you're supposed
to do to wear a skirt and painted your
body and use a feather dress and drink
the medicines and suddenly for my son
his feather dress it get down and became
a true animal and starts to fly over his
head
and it starts to have a visionary
experience in this animal with his claw
he cut the air he cut the air open a
passage for another dimension and he
took my son from this dimension and they
flew together
my son just sixteen years old has a
typical shaman astral travel even he he
went to our house and real vision here
he saw his sister sleeping in her
bedroom he came back he flew over the
forest he saw somebody there was there's
a very precious visionary experience
indigenous people they open for us and
there is this thing that this missionary
system is not working very much this is
starting to fall apart so and the
yawanawa what happens to them there are
11 other indigenous nations in the west
Amazon that follows their example so
many arias missionaries are the internet
away already and people have you gained
their spiritual independence
not so much a question rather prompting
you to one thing that suffer mazes me
and that so little known is the degree
of knowledge and sophistication that
comes with mastering the use of various
organic substances yes explain me how
that's like compa frog it's being used
plant which has a very specific use only
to be used once in your life yeah maybe
you can talk a few iconic lots like this
interesting medicine equal to and n is
taken from a frog there's a green frog
in the Amazon the resin over the body of
the frog and we are talking about how
people discover that we're talking about
the ways of knowledge because there's a
classic way of knowledge through
deduction but there is another way of
knowledge through revelation how how
they understand having thousands and
thousands of species how they know that
a vine like that with a leaf like that
we get together and become a Sacramento
that's the power the combo the combo you
get you got a vine and you and you like
that vine and it starts to burn the skin
making some points in this game you burn
here here maybe seven points you take
that you know there's a fresh skin under
you take the resin of the frog and you
put there a matter of two or three
minutes if you like burning the mask it
takes you and then starts as a very
strong process of cleaning
usually the engines used that when they
have bad luck on hunting they have bad
luck they don't find the heart or they
should but they miss but or they should
but they miss the heart the alligator
comes and it they their battle they have
the bad luck something they call Panama
this kind of bad luck so they're close
things are not working well in their
lives so they took the combo and the
combo makes physical cleaning very
important physical cleaning mind
cleaning too emotional cleaning
spiritual cleaning so it's a
purification that's the common factor
between all the sacramental plants in
the world not only in Amazonia what what
similar is this cleaning process this
purifying process is that kind of
purging effect that happens not only at
the physical body but happens mainly in
the mind in the personality many things
that we hold in ourselves and in
conscience whether they came up they
came up and they can be release it and
once they are release that the effect is
a very good it's a very good feeling
that you feel clear if you pure you feel
strong if you more sharp more
intelligent a few more encourage you
have more love your capability to
forgive Hansen's very much see hope in
life everything changes very much and
you from from the combo they have the
rumor to rumor is an antigenic enough
the one that you have a longer tube and
you blow from not from the masculine
nostril somebody
is incredible the effect of this
medicine in mind level see one of the
things that the Pope Dalai Lama the
shamans everybody looks for is a soft
free space and mind how to interrupt the
sides all the religions they look for
that state when you're such free you
don't break the connection some
medicines from the Indians takers -
they're the kind of effect that when you
have when you are under the effect of
this medicine that you enter in
communion with the spirit of the
medicine the spirit of the medicine
teaches you how to extend inside of
yourself to go to a place where you see
where there's no sorts no memories no
imaginations no fantasies no confusions
no because there's an art of
contemplation in the visionary
experience it's very important a
visionary experience that you can
interrupt your thoughts and once you
interrupt your thoughts are a lot of
imagery in star circle the problem is
that those images did generate thousands
of shots and then you broke it again so
there's an art of being very quiet art
of dominating the mind dominate the ego
the souls more than the yoga the spirit
is more than the other so the spirit can
dominate is a Shh I need to be stillness
the Tao Chinese town still needs the
nothing less
but everything is place there's no sort
and then you can connect and then you
can know and then your life can be
revealed to you
the meaning of your existence the sense
of your life what you are doing here at
this moment that can be revealed to you
without rational categories
is a different way to know yourself but
this needs to happen in a source free
space inside the mine and this medicines
they take us to their okay a few minutes
overtime so I'm maybe just check on any
last question
um my question is maybe also for Tatiana
but it's about preserving the oral
traditions that you were talking about
and I was wondering about the question
of language and whether how many
indigenous languages there are if each
tribe has its own and if they know any
Portuguese or if there's an interest in
the young culture in Brazil to learn
those languages and to improve that
communication and to diffuse the
knowledge that they have there is a
sacrament has 42 names 42 languages
they're of the people neither 72 ethical
groups that use those plants so they
have 42 names but basically for instance
yeah one hour most of the people speaks
Portuguese so it's a very good
communicator and most of the indigenous
people most of them they speak
Portuguese so it's a good possibility
and there are schools they learn
Portuguese in their in their land their
local language so it's a very good
possibility of communication and an
access even I'm thinking about the kind
of I would say that exchange student
program they base it on the experience I
have with my kids there we're thinking
very strong about that take kids from
the city to the forest where they can
hunt they can fish they can run barefoot
in the forest they can feel they can get
in touch with some part of them that
usually they cannot get in touch in the
city when you go to the forest when
you're running in the wild barefoot with
the engines you if you you enter in
contact with another dimension of
yourself
camera screen system is no mercy to
sound and we want to do the same thing
now we want to bring some kids from the
tribes to our houses you see so they can
share some of the experience with us
they can learn
you see they can out say have enlarged
their vision of the world see and so
future generation starts to be a lie it
say that for us is very important the
preservation not only of nature but of
culture and spiritual traditions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
