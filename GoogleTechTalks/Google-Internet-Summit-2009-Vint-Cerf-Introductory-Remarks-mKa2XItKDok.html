internet evangelist and part of the
reason that you're here is that my
mission in part is to get more internet
built all around the world and your role
in this in part is to help us
collectively understand what's happening
to the internet and to appreciate what
we can do to make more of it happen some
of you have come from very long
distances and I deeply appreciate the
effort that you've gone to join us today
for example Alan Malden where's Alan
there's Alan over here came from
Bratislava and at least one other person
is coming from Europe who will be with
us later on and that's what if he who
actually based here in the Bay Area but
was in London yesterday so and others of
you I'm sure of travelled at least from
the east coast if not from other
relatively far away places so I want to
express my appreciation for the effort
put forth about 25 of us in the room are
outside of Google or non Googlers and
about 65 when they all get here are from
google our purpose today is to try to
capture objective and quantitative
perspectives on the state of the
internet and we're trying to do this on
many different dimensions some of them
legal statistical technological
application space and things of that
sort and so particularly appreciate
people who have taken the time to
develop materials for for this
particular event or at least to adapt
what they have and I also want to
emphasize something about the nature of
this this two-day session it's my fault
if you feel like if you're one of the
participants in presenting that you
didn't get very much time that's my
fault I tried to keep the presentation
aspect of this event relatively small in
the hope that we would have a lot of
discussion and what I would like to see
and hope
will happen is that we raise issues and
have discussion is among the panelists
and within with the other participants
so we can illuminate issues that might
not otherwise have have gotten
consideration so there's this structure
is wrong on discussion and short on
presentation also and the interest of
saving time I'm not going to ask
everybody to identify themselves and the
usual thing is going around the room the
side effect of that is that I would ask
you to go and introduce yourselves
during the breaks to somebody you don't
recognize and somebody you don't know
that's in this meeting I fondly hope
that there will be linkages established
as a consequence of this symposium that
will persist over time that will be
beneficial to all of you and to us as
well this because this format is a
little bit experimental i am absolutely
open to and encourage critical remarks
about the structure and the organization
and if you will share those with me I'd
appreciate it if we decision if we
conclude as a group that we should do
more of this we want to take your
comments into account and organize any
subsequent sessions in a way that we
collectively think is an improvement
well I'm going to spend just a few more
minutes trying to set the stage for what
is going to unfold over the next two
days i am not going to go through the
agenda you've seen that many times in
your email and you'll see it on the
board over there on the whiteboard so I
don't plan to go through that the way I
see it right now is the Internet is at
an important flex point i think in its
history it's 2009 we are experiencing
some scaling issues which are in some
way is not new but persistent the
network is much larger than it was 10
years ago or 20 or 30 years ago we are
plainly about to run out of the
allocable ipv4 address space we are not
very far along on the implementation and
deployment
of ipv6 generally in the network the
ISPs have been very slow to implement
such a service and even if they did
let's assume that tomorrow morning we
woke up and everybody was running ipv6
the scaling of the routing system to a
network which is compatible with the
size of the ipv4 address space is an
open question in my mind so scaling in
many different ways is still an
important issue bandwidth is another
problem space because the access speeds
are not uniformly high everywhere and as
the applications increase their
necessity the need for a higher
bandwidth the core will also experience
a need to increase its capacity cloud
computing is adding yet another
dimension to the way in which the
internet is being used we're of course
major users of cloud computing
structures as our others in our universe
and so those are all related to the
scaling challenges of the net security
and privacy are at the top of many
people's lists of problem areas for the
internet and some of you are
particularly deeply concerned and
interested in that I don't think that
any of us at least I don't see my way
internally clear towards how those
things are all going to be resolved
intellectual property has become a major
issue in the net will spend some time on
that tomorrow when we get to some of the
legal aspects of Internet and issues
that are arising it's a side effect in
part of the fact that it's so easy to
duplicate and distribute digital
information the regime's of the past the
copyright regimes that control physical
access to copies is significantly eroded
let's say by the way in which the
internet and particularly the world wide
web application work I would say
similarly ecommerce is an increasingly
important component of the net and yet
we are deeply concerned about
authenticity and integrity of the
transactions to say nothing of their
confidentiality and finally there's no
question that internationalization is an
important element in the Internet today
and tomorrow some of the statistics that
most of you will be familiar with say
that there are almost 700 million people
on the net from Asia and another 400
million in Europe for some definition of
Europe which keeps changing and another
250 million or so in North America 140
million in South America and so on the
internationalization of the net has many
impacts one of them of course is that
the preferred languages and scripts that
are needed to usefully apply the
internet are changing well beyond the
early stages of the net when we used
simple ASCII characters as a way of
putting information on the net and
making references to things so now we're
faced with bringing up scripts for other
languages the World Wide Web has done a
good job for the most part of
accommodating that the domain name
system has not and so we're still in the
throes of trying to resolve how to make
that work better well there are many
many other things that I could say this
morning but you didn't come here to
listen to a preamble you came here to
participate in a set of what I hope are
healthy and perhaps even exciting
exchanges so I'd like to stop here let
me ask if there are any questions at
this point for anyone who's
participating and if not I don't see any
hands going up we will move on now to
the first part of our agenda and that's
to look at the internet from a
statistical point of view and to do that
I'd like to invite Steven Stewart to
come and chair this session
