a
professor of geology at Arizona State
University and my former boss he runs a
research center that does daily
operations for several instruments on
board Mars spacecraft and he's just sort
of an all-around smart guy so he's here
to talk to us today about remote sensing
greetings it's a pleasure to be here as
Michael said I'm at ASU I'm a geologist
initially then became a geophysicist got
interested in Mars and unfortunately to
date have then had to become interested
in remote sensing because that's the
only way we have of studying Mars so
I've spent most of my last 20 years or
so building a variety of instruments I
thought I'd start off by sort of
summarizing my last 20 years of my life
a sort of frightening statement to say
these you know for machines or the
summarize what you've done for the last
20 years but these are instruments about
yay big mostly infrared and we've sent
all of them to Mars and so what I'd like
to do today is talk a little bit about
just a quick introduction to sort of the
physics of remote sensing so we're sort
of all on the same on the same point and
then show a few examples and then just
talk about some some applications I'm
reasonably well aware of what you guys
are doing in terms of remote sensing
with visible and google earth etc what
I'm want to try to do today at least an
introductory level is discuss some of
the other aspects of remote sensing
other wavelengths that the importance of
time etc to see what other information
one Kuip quite one could get and if
nothing more just sort of set the stage
a little bit to get you thinking about
okay well maybe we could do that for the
earth or maybe there might be something
useful there or maybe there might be a
an end result that would that that could
be incorporated into the things that
you're doing ok so just pardon me but
I'm going to not know in the audience
really well I thought I'd just give a
little bit of overview about what to
what would do I
female sensing is and what some of the
key physics behind it and just to
summarize in the simplest case remote
sensing is just using images I mean
everyone's been doing ever in this room
has been doing remote sensing since you
were born your eyes are probably the
single best remote-sensing instruments
ever designed your ears aren't bad
either and so it's a in the simplest
case we're collecting visible light
spatial patterns temporal variability
and using that information to construct
a three-dimensional model of the world
around us the next level is to take full
use of the electromagnetic spectrum our
eyes evolved to focus on the light put
out from the Sun but there's a whole
spectrum of electromagnetic energy that
goes beyond visible I want to talk a
little bit about that and then to me
what remote sensing really is about is
extracting quantitative information from
all of that information not just the
patterns that we see but quantitative
compositional physical information about
the nature of the of the surface
whatever planet is on just going back to
high school real quick remind everybody
visible light about a half a micron I
again mostly today be talking about
near-infrared and thermal infrared which
have wavelengths of about 10 microns but
obviously you can do everything from
gamma ray and x-ray remote sensing all
the way out into radar and microwave so
there's this whatever that is nine
orders of magnitude a variation in the
wavelength of light and to say that we
use sort of from point 32.7 microns out
of that nine orders of magnitude is a
pretty limited piece of the
electromagnetic spectrum that most of us
use and i'll be talking a little bit
today about both reflected and emitted
light again most sensors visible light
sensors use the Sun as a source and
Laila
at the reflected or scattered light that
comes off of surfaces we can have other
sources of energy we can we can
illuminate the scene with microwaves or
radar and we can certainly look at just
energy that's emitted every every object
which is not at Absolute Zero is
emitting energy all of you are emitting
a lot of energy right now and we can
sense that and make use of that emitted
part of the spectrum as well I think
I'll get you the word slides here pretty
quick and then I get down to looking at
some images just again as a quick review
remote sensing is typically broken up
into two broad categories one is active
remote sensing where you're actually
providing a source that source
traditionally has been radar or lidar so
you are illuminating the scene that has
some real advantages because you can
control the wavelength you can control
the illumination angle you can control
how much power you put out you can
control both the observing and
illumination geometries you can work
when it's night you can work when it's
cloud covered so active systems have a
lot of benefits obviously they take a
lot more energy you have to actually
illuminate the source yourself the other
piece of part of remote sensing is the
passive side and this is traditionally
been the one of the largest parts of
remote sensing and I like you can I
think you can break it up again into
three basic categories or the physics of
what's going on is fundamentally
different you can look at very high
energy interactions and that would
include things like gamma rays and
x-rays here on the earth were shielded
by our atmosphere not very many gamma
rays and x-rays get to the ground but on
airless bodies like like Mars there's a
lot of cosmic rays a lot of high energy
sources that get to the surface excite
the atom at the nucleus level generate
gamma rays and
x rays which we then observe and we can
tell literally what elements are on the
surface by looking at the spectrum of
gamma rays that come off so that's their
the interaction is going on at the
nuclear level what I'll call moderate
energy is ultraviolet invisible photons
those have enough energy to excite or
interact with the electrons that are in
you know that are surrounding the
nucleus so slightly lower energy but
there's we'll see in a minute we're
actually exciting electrons to different
energy levels and then the final one is
or the low energy infrared and even out
into the microwave now the energy of the
photon barely has enough energy to cause
these bound atoms within a structure to
to vibrate okay so each one of those
then based on the energy of the of the
electromagnetic wave that's hitting the
hitting the material interacts at a
different level and each one of these
x-ray uv-vis infrared is providing a
unique piece of information about the
atomic structure of the material that
it's interacting with and I'll spend a
couple minutes talking about that okay
some basic some basic physics to remind
everyone light of course is an
oscillating electromagnetic wave that
has a wavelength a velocity the velocity
of light and a frequency and those are
very closely related velocity equals
wavelength time frequency okay in
frequency as we'll see in a minute is
important the frequency of the light
depends a lot on how it is going to
interact with the material one of the I
think one of the most useful equations
to keep in mind is a equals H nu the
energy that a photon or a wave contains
is directly proportional to its
frequency so that gets back to what I
was just saying unless and the last
point that shortwave high frequency
photons carry a lot of energy long
wave low-frequency photons carry much
less energy and therefore they interact
at the atomic level very differently the
other thing to keep in mind is
electromagnetic waves as the name
implies are oscillating electric and
magnetic fields and so if light is an
oscillating electric field and I
interact with something that has charged
particles either electrons or a tour
nuclei that electric field can interact
with those charged particles and it's
the nature of that interaction then that
causes light to be absorbed okay it's
the reason why things have color it's
the reason why water heats up in a
microwave it sort of that it's the
process by which light interacts with
material it's the fact that I've got
oscillating electric fields interacting
with charged particles and those charged
particles are going to move in the in
the when they're bathed by that electric
field and that so we take me you convert
the energy in the wave into the kinetic
motions of the material okay just a
couple more points here similarly at the
same time that these electric fields are
oscillating the atoms in any crystal
structure are also oscillating okay
they're bound in there by the forces
that are holding those atoms together
but they're certainly not you know balls
on sticks like you see in a chemistry
class there that a much better model
would be balls on Springs so I've always
been trying to find somebody who would
make a beautiful model of a complex of
molecule where you have these little
masses and they're bound together by
Springs all those masses are free to
move around okay and it just like in any
system of masses and springs that the
the motions of that system are going to
have resonant frequencies they're going
to vary with the mass of the atoms and
they're going to vary with the strength
of the bonds
so in any given crystal structure you've
got these these masses and they're held
together by these bonds every one of
those pairs of atoms has a a specific
resonant or harmonic frequency that it's
going to naturally want to vibrate at
okay and that's then sort of the key to
how light is going to interact with this
material because what happens then is if
I have this oscillating electromagnetic
wave that's coming along if the
frequency of this oscillation say some
frequency nu two matches the frequency
of this harmonic resonance frequency
within the material then this electric
field will excite these charged
particles cause them to move and in the
process reduce or subtract energy from
that wave so that when the wave comes
out the other side it's reduced in
amplitude okay this is a fancy way of
saying this light is absorbed by this
material but the thing that makes it
that important here is if the if I have
a wave that's at some other frequency
that's different from this resonant
frequency of the material then that wave
tends to pass through the material more
or less unchanged okay there isn't a
strong interaction and so the light can
light can come out so in this particular
process and you can imagine that if I
took a spectrum of white light and
illuminated a surface the waves that
come out the other side the spectrum
that comes out the other side I'm going
to be missing those frequencies that
correspond to these natural vibrational
frequencies within the within the
crystal okay
let me come back to that okay so that's
so that's two pieces of basic background
the third piece if we're going to talk
in particular almost I want to focus now
on sort of infrared spectroscopy I want
to talk about the emitted part of remote
sensing and to do that we need to talk
about the source function what what
energy is being emitted by a material
I'm sure you're all at least at some
level familiar with the concept of a
blackbody curve plunk back in the early
1900's derived this equation from first
principles of physics using the quantum
nature of the energy structure of
materials and was able to to predict
than what we observe and that is that
the amount of energy emitted by material
varies with wavelength so here I'm
showing wavelengths in microns and
temperatures zero degrees centigrade 20
degrees centigrade so this blue curve is
basically a spectrum of the light that
you're giving off okay all of you are
emitting all of you are at about 20
degrees C maybe 30 degrees c and you are
emitting energy and the energy that you
are emitting is peaked at about 12 10 or
12 microns okay if i were to heat you up
to 6,000 degrees c what would that how
would the ship owed your peak wavelength
be if you were 6,000 degrees c somewhere
in the visible okay the surface of the
sun is 6,000 degrees and this these
exact same curves whole just as well for
those temperatures as our temperatures
and so if you plug in 6,000 degrees C
two things happen one is there's a lot
more energy emitted and the wavelength
at which it Peaks shifts to shorter and
shorter wavelengths
so the Sun is peaked down at about a
half a micron which is exactly why our
eyes have evolved to be most sensitive
to light at about a half a micron as
we'll see in a minute the world is a
whole lot prettier place in the infrared
than it is in the visible least the
natural world is rocks and minerals are
and we would be as a geologist I would
be much better suited with infrared eyes
able to look at the world than with
these crummy visible ones that I'm stuck
with but the force of thing is we can
build detectors that allow us to see in
the infrared ok so materials are
emitting energy and they're doing it in
an ideal world they're doing it as
predicted by by plunk from his famous
equation in the energy coming off of an
ideal surface would look something like
that ok but now we have to butt in in
punks world things weren't bound
together there were no boundaries just
free to move around it was not bound to
anything else when I start creating a
crystal structure where I have atoms
bound together then we have these
harmonic motions these preferred
frequencies and now the light that's
being emitted is no longer follows
perfectly that the plunks function we
start to see these absorption bands
which are due to the vibrational motions
of the material that upper curve shows
the black line is the idealized pong
function the red curve is a measured
spectrum of a a mineral in this in this
particular case just a nice simple
quartz crystal and then typically what
spectroscopy us do is they take the
ratio of those to create something
called the emissivity the beauty of the
emissivity is its independent of
temperature if I just measure the
straight radiance then those curves are
moving up and down with temperature to
change the shape of those curves is
changing slightly but the ratio of the
energy emitted from a natural surface to
an ideal sir
stays the same so this emissivity
doesn't change whether I'm measuring it
at 20 below zero or at 500 degrees
centigrade this emissivity of course
won't won't change okay so to quickly
come back to our vibrational model
what's happening is if I can explain
this sort of quickly and simply deep
inside the material I've got all these
motions and I've got it's generating
this plunk like distribution of energy
as that energy tries to escape from the
from that crystal it's being absorbed
preferentially absorbed at frequencies
or wavelengths that correspond to these
harmonic frequencies okay so this
particular frequency that corresponds to
a wavelength of say twenty microns
that's one of these harmonic frequencies
so the energy that's trying to get out
is preferentially absorb the atom likes
that energy it vibrates at that energy
it takes the energy out of the wave and
so what we see coming out of the surface
there's a deficit of energy at that
particular frequency so the point of all
this is that these infrared spectra
which we can quantify remarkably well
you can get right down to the basic
physics of fun of vibrational modes and
all this other kind of stuff there's
this beautiful quantitative basis of all
this but for remote sensing what we
really care about is that because every
known substance on the planet has a
unique crystal structure it will
therefore have unique vibrational modes
and it will therefore produce a unique
infrared spectrum ok so I can make a
list of minerals that mean something to
a geologist chords clay olivene calcite
this is what they make concrete out of
each one of these minerals and has a
very unique and diagnostic infrared
spectrum that's based on its its
internal crystal structure it turns out
that a lot of what we
about the chemistry of in the crystal
structure of materials has come over the
last hundred years from studying their
infrared spectra okay all right and it
turns out you can get incredibly
detailed with this it's one thing to say
this mineral is sort of different from
that one but these are examples of
minerals that I don't expect you to know
but these are classes of minerals which
are very very similar but if I start
replacing to the iron atoms with
magnesium atoms that changes the
fundamental frequencies because the mass
of those atoms is changing the frequency
of the system is changing and these
absorption bands shift around so it's a
very diagnostic tool down to very
precise levels of what the crystal
structure of material is and the beauty
of a of an infrared spectrum from a
remote sensing point of view is I can
measure from orbit around Mars the light
that's given off measure this spectrum
and determine what the composition of
the surface is ok I don't have to touch
it I don't have to put it into an
instrument I don't have to do anything
to that surface I can just measure its
infrared spectrum and get a very unique
identification of what minerals on the
surface and we've done that and I'll i
think i'll show some examples a little
bit although i'm i've spent the last 25
years studying mars and i think i only
have one slide in here on Mars so for
better or worse if you came if you want
to hear about Mars you can be
disappointed okay the other thing that
you get from an infrared measurement
which i think is extremely interesting
is this idea of temperature okay the
spectral information is telling this
composition just just that but the total
magnitude of the energy emitted is
telling his temperature the hot or
something is the more it emits okay
that's fine but we can take that in
information and use it in a very
quantitative way you can you can develop
very sophisticated models that predict
the temperature of a surface as a
function of time of day based on the
physical properties of that surface its
grain size its conductivity its
subsurface layering whether it's a
metallic material you can put all that
stuff into a model and predict how the
temperature will vary with a time of day
so for example large rocky materials
will hold their heat really well at
night though they've they've stored a
lot of heat during the day and then that
heat comes back out at night so rocky
materials will stay warm at night very
fine-grain sand and dust materials we're
not able to conduct heat into the
interior we're not able to store any
heat so at night that upper layer cools
off very rapidly and there's no stored
heat to come back out and warm the
surface so we get these these diurnal
curves that vary significantly on
whether a material is rocky or
fine-grained so for example here's a
place on Mars that here it's very warm
at night okay and here it's relatively
cool during the day we can go into these
thermal models measure those
temperatures and say okay this is
actually bedrock this is pure solid rock
standing on the surface of Mars this
stuff that was relatively cold at night
and heated up during the day that's you
know say millimeter sized gravel so you
can actually get very specific
quantitative about this and be able to
pin down the particle size of surfaces
to you know I can I can tell whether
it's millimeter gravel or two
millimeters diameter gravel based on
these very precise temperature
measurements okay so from the infrared
then we get composition we also get some
indication of the physical nature and
then finally I wanted to come back so
that was the vibrational spectroscopy
the low energy and if you remember back
I was talking about the moderate energy
UV visible light that's where the
photons have enough energy to actually
interact with the electrons and if you
think if you remember back to an energy
level diagram of hydrogen or sodium the
electrons in the cloud around an atom or
you know nor the ground state they can
be excited to a excited state if that if
the energy to go from the ground state
to the next level up is equal to the
energy of a photon then what happens
that that photon excites the electron
oftentimes that will be a collision
within the atom instead of the electron
just jumping back down again and giving
off a photon it will before it can do
that another atom will collide that
energy that was stored in the higher
energy state is converted to kinetic
energy of the atoms and so again if I
took a flashlight shined it in if I have
light whose energy corresponds to one of
these energy states it will excite the
electron and what comes out the other
side will be I won't see that photon
coming out the other side okay this is
the basic concept of ye objects have
color ok this is what's going on and
dies and going on in the things that you
see with your eyes it's photons exciting
electrons and being removed from the
beam ok and just some quick examples
this is down in the visible light so
this is half micron 1 micron 2 microns
our eyes end up cut off here at about a
point 7 microns these absorption bands
are due to electrons being excited
within atoms within the within the
material so a lot of remote sensing near
infrared remote sensing that's done has
to do with these electronic transitions
that are going on where photons are
being absorbed and used to excite
electrons the problem with electronic
spectroscopy is there's only a very
small number of elements where this
process actually occurs at these kinds
of wavelengths and specifically it's the
transition metals and I know I was
crummy in chemistry in high school like
member transition metals are but iron is
one copper is a good example okay so
basically this if you this kind of
spectroscopy works in nature in
iron-bearing minerals okay well if you
think about driving around in the
deserts most of the color that you see
is yellows and oranges and browns and
butterscotch is and tans almost all of
that is due to iron-bearing minerals or
iron stains and those those stains those
iron met brain minerals have colors
because of these electronic transitions
if an atom if a mineral doesn't have
iron in it like quartz for example
that's why it's colorless because there
are no elements in there that can
interact with the photons and have
energy levels at the right appropriate
levels to absorb the visible light okay
so it works great for iron-bearing
minerals but the world isn't necessarily
covered with iron-bearing minerals okay
all right so that's the end of the
physics lesson let's look at some real
examples and again what I'm going to try
to focus on for the next little bit is
things that you're not used to I mean
things that don't have to do with
looking at the world in invisible light
this is a Landsat image Landsat is a
spaceborne imager it has
seven bands you can use bands one two
and three and construct a natural normal
light image that would that you would
recognize this is an image of a delta I
think in the Amazon region constructed
of some of the other bands okay think
that the wavelengths that your eye
doesn't see but I would still say you
know this is pretty close to what we've
been doing humans have been doing all
along looking looking at the world okay
so that's that's sort of what the world
would look like I want to show another
example this is Phoenix this is a more
or less normal Landsat scene it's not
quite red green blue it's a green red
near-infrared many of you are familiar
with this this is a false color image
we've taken each of the wavelengths and
shifted it down one so green is
displayed in the red gun of the of this
projection read in green and
near-infrared in red as a result
vegetation which is very bright very
reflective in near-infrared light
because it interacts really well with
elective the electrons are easily
excited vegetation shows up bright red
okay one of the things though that you
can do if you want to emphasize certain
things and bring out certain
compositional information you can
actually make ratios of those bands so
instead of just making a color image I
can take two bands and ratio them and so
this this is an example of taking one of
the bands where vegetation is very
reflective in one where it's not making
a ratio of that and so here any
vegetation is very clearly identified as
being you know in this ratio you also
see other things that that show up and
my point is not to dwell on this but to
simply say
you see certain patterns and certain
information if you look at it just a
quote normal color image you see other
information and other patterns if you
start ray showing the images or in some
other way trying to extract information
from them so for example clear clear
differences say right here between
urbanized and non urbanized actually can
show up better in some of these ratios
than they do in the original and they're
just in the color image this is an
example of what I said about but the
world would look like if you had
infrared eyes I've taken this set of
spectra and you can fly a spectrometer
but they're big and expensive and
complicated and they're hard to get to
work I can also build a camera and
infrared camera it's relatively
straightforward and only has three
filters and if I put one of those
filters at 10 microns one at nine and
one at eight and took an image and then
I displayed the emitted energy at 10
microns it as red nine as green and
eight is blue then for example if you
look at quartz it's emitting a lot in
what then becomes the red band not much
in green and not much in blue so in a
fault color infrared image that courts
would look red okay similarly if I take
a mineral that's bright at this
wavelength and he's absorbing at these
two other wavelengths and display it
it's going to look blue okay so if I
flew an infrared camera 3-band infrared
camera across the desert instead of you
look you look the flag belong you look
out the window the world is brown and
gray and tan in the infrared this is
literally what the world would look like
if you had infrared eyes and to a
geologist or someone interested in the
composition the nature of the makeup of
the surface this is what you'd see and
this is
basically a geologic map of this
mountain range without having to do
anything at all I mean geologists spend
years detailed mapping to try to find
all these different mineral deposits and
rock outcrops and different types of
material this infrared image is
essentially giving you that information
instantaneously I can see quartz rich
sands and I can see volcanic rocks and I
can see gypsum bearing salt etc okay so
it's a tremendously powerful tool for
mapping the composition of the Earth's
surface this is an example of the
surface temperature in Scottsdale
Arizona bright is warm and in this case
pretty darn warm at the surface
temperatures we flew this in August
those surface temperatures are probably
140 degrees Fahrenheit cool dark is cool
and it's pretty darn cool the cool
temperatures are probably about 80
degrees Fahrenheit so where would you
want to have your house next to the 140
degree baking hot asphalt and dirt or
next to the 80 degree nice cool lake and
golf course well okay so but the point
is these infrared images actually
provide a tremendous amount of
information about temperature which
feeds into all sorts of other important
things in Phoenix we're trying to
actually use these to measure Lake
temperatures and swimming pool
temperatures and cut and calculate
evaporation rates and how that's
affecting the humidity and there's all
kinds of environmental impact of all of
these crazy golf courses and all these
lakes that show up extremely well just
by looking at you know the temperature
effect of those things and I'll just
touch on this this is a really detailed
spectrum again from about 20 microns
sorry let the units down to about 5 my
so it's an infrared spectrum extremely
high-resolution looking at gases in
there in the atmosphere in this case the
atmosphere of Mars even down if you look
at that box you can build spectrometers
that have that kind of resolution this
is how we're monitoring trace gases in
in atmospheres so there's a tremendous
amount of information that you can get
about the composition of the atmospheric
gas one of the when I was hunkered with
Michael a little bit one of the topics
that came up about what can you do with
remote sensing from a practical point of
view a lot of the times you're dealing
with a scene that was taken looking
through the atmosphere and you're trying
to separate the atmosphere from the
surface if you're just trying to make a
beautiful map of the ground you want to
remove the atmosphere if you're an
atmospheric scientist you want to remove
the surface okay so i used to call this
atmospheric correction but that
atmospheric guys got annoyed about that
because it was so now i try to say we're
separating the two there's basically two
ways to go you can do very sophisticated
ready to transfer modeling and there's
packages that do that where you put up a
radiosonde and you measure the
temperature and the pressure in the
water vapor and all the stuff that goes
into incredibly complicated model and
you try to remove that in that signal
from the ground or you can do scene
based approximations which in the real
world the only practical way to go and
there's a bunch of ways to do that and
I'll just show a quick illustration this
is an infrared seen one of these
beautiful three bands red color scenes
in this particular scanner is a line
scanner that looks out in both
directions okay so looking straight down
we're looking through a certain amount
of atmosphere off to the side of the
image we're looking through almost twice
as much atmosphere and as a result you
see this band of yellowing down the side
okay this is an example of this type of
problem a really simple way around that
is to say I'm going to assume that
statistically the ground is sort of
randomly distributed so what i've done
here is i've just taken a
column average of the entire scene and
those three lines and represents the the
a single line that it's a average of the
all the lines in the image and you can
see the effect of the atmosphere with
these with this absorption that's going
on over on the edge I could try to model
that or it can be really simplistic and
say I'm just going to take this
signature and subtract it from every
line in the image okay so this is just a
simple scene based example and you can
see what just something even that simple
is done this material which looks yellow
in the original data suddenly looks like
it's supposed to do in this scene
corrected data so there's a lot of very
simple ways that people have been
devised over the years in a practical
sense to to separate the tremendous
amount of information that's in these
and that's in these images okay let me
just quickly show I'm not a radar expert
but I just I didn't want to talk about
remote sensing to not mention radar
there's a tremendous amount of
information in radar as well hear what
you're seeing is all of this bright
material is basically man-made metal
rich material this is a scene from the
radar experiment that was flown in the
shuttle again over Scottsdale and you
see a natural desert veget watered
fields but this incredible signature
from the from the metal in the in the
city you can with radar you can transmit
those these electric waves you can
transmit in this way in that way and
which way you transmit them has a huge
effect on what happens so for example
they don't the main difference between
those two scenes is whether or not the
way was transmitted vertically or
horizontally in the first case it's
vertical the electric field and the wave
was oscillating vertically and so where
I had electric power lines there was
very little interaction in the second
case the wave was oscillating
horizontally
where I have electric power lines I get
a very strong interaction okay so one of
the beauties of radars you can actually
tune that you can design your experiment
so that you can pick up different things
and this is just an example of three
different radar images combined into a
color image with you know aunt astok
amount of information in there okay let
me just quickly go over a couple of
applications this one I've showed an
example of this is again an infrared
multispectral image of some mountain
range in the southwest remarkably very
few people use this type of information
even today to try to do compositional
mapping of the world this is what we
have this is the type of instruments
we've flown to Mars we have better maps
of Mars than we do of the earth of
making you know trying to look for rock
types and minerals on the planet one of
the things you can do in addition to
make you know pretty images you can
actually look at the spectral signature
ii of all this information you can you
can take that spectral information and
try to classify the scene so for example
this is a Landsat image of Phoenix then
this is taking that spectral information
and classifying the scene I'm going to
blow in zoom in on this is the airport
so you can make this again it's an
automated tool you define what the rules
are you know what each of your classes
would it consists of what type of
spectral signature it has and so we're
looking at cultivated grass vegetation
commercial compacted soils water asphalt
concrete so you can make these
classification images of a city that
then you've extracted a lot of
information about that city and you can
you've done a lot more than just make a
pretty picture of the city I've actually
got information that I can use to study
for example study the city over time see
how desert is being converted to
agriculture or agriculture into urban
urban use etc okay the other thing that
you can do with remote sensing of cities
in particular is look at temporal
changes this is an example of Beijing
from a very early nineteen seventy-eight
relatively low resolution version of a
lance hat instrument this sort of ugly
gray color here is most of the urbanized
part of Beijing in this false-color
image fields and vegetation are showing
up red and it doesn't take much to sort
of note the difference between 1978 and
2004 in that same area two years ago
there's virtually no agriculture or
vegetation left in this in this region
okay yes there's yeah they're in this
particular case there is there is a
seasonal difference in an ideal world
you certainly wouldn't want that but one
of the problems it's talking earlier
it's remarkably hard to go back very far
even in the you know from the satellite
data oftentimes we only had you know one
image a year it was even acquired so but
you're right and that that certainly
complicates that complicates the whole
situation and in particular in China
where their cities are evolving quickly
it's it's remarkable how much change is
occurring you know Shanghai was a
relatively small city surrounded by
vegetation 30 years ago today it's it's
grown dramatically it one more example
you know Hong Kong so you can you can
you can use remote sensing in the time
domain as well to really look for
temporal changes
in in Earth's surface we hear it you you
hear a lot about things like you know
deforestation and rainforest but some of
the actually some of the most dramatic
changes are occurring around cities as
they are growing spectacularly you can
from the nighttime temperature you can
study things like urban heat Islands
assuming you've what you've heard of
this this is a nighttime temperature of
image of Phoenix and a couple things are
apparent first of all where the warmest
parts of the city well they're the roads
the buildings that huge bright blob up
there is the airport okay it's pretty
easy to see where the man-made sources
of heat are what's interesting though
and it sort of surprised a lot of people
is how warm that natural surfaces are as
well okay so sometimes converting from
if we if you converted this mountain
into houses you might in that particular
case actually lower the temperature okay
so studying heat island developments in
cities is complicated and these types of
infrared data are extremely useful this
for example is the Gila River which
doesn't flow at all okay there's no
water in that river at all it's all
underground but there's enough
underground moisture flowing through
this dry quote-unquote dry riverbed that
the evaporation from that moisture is is
cooling off the surface okay so that the
point here is there's a tremendous
amount of information in these infrared
images another quick example this is a
handheld infrared camera looking out at
tempe town lake a small little lake
man-made lake just close to asu and i
wanted to use this to illustrate a
well I guess I won't come back to it so
even simple you know you don't have that
fancy aircraft or satellite infrared
imagery just handheld infrared cameras
now are becoming inexpensive enough that
you can begin to put these in strategic
places and monitor things like you know
water temperature and surface
temperature in Rhode temperatures etc
one of the points that I was going to
make is oftentimes of for the view
trying to do any type of scene
classification or automated scene
identification one of the things that we
have real trouble with is telling water
from asphalt they're both really really
dark and in fact there's you know cases
of automated Rovers that drive out onto
a lake because it's smooth it's dark it
looks like a perfectly nice surface to
drive on the one place that water and
asphalt really differ from is in their
temperature okay so if you had a
temperature information as well then
suddenly identifying to dark things is
trivially easy okay so one of the things
that we're trying to do is identify
water based on it's based on temperature
you can also do things like monitor
volcanic eruptions this is a satellite
image in the visible with a superimposed
infrared image it's an active eruption
taking place in Kamchatka from space and
so for volcanic hazards and volcanic
eruptions obviously the infrareds a
powerful tool weather gets a lot of
attention as well it should but there's
other things that go on in the
atmosphere besides just rainfall and
cold fronts this is an example and this
is the western coast of Africa that's
Gibraltar and that Spain for scale so as
is a huge piece of Africa and part of
Europe
and this is a big dust plume that's
blowing off of the Sahara Desert okay
these dust plumes are not uncommon and
oftentimes they reach all the way across
to North America you can detect easily
detect Saharan dust in the air in New
York City and from space with remote
sensing you can certainly you can track
these things you can see them coming on
the other side of the world you see the
same sort of effect this is again dust
being blown off of off of the Chinese
continent and headed headed east so
there's a tremendous amount of things
that go on the atmosphere besides just
besides this weather and say so again
just to plant seeds of things pollution
aerosols volcanic ash volcanic dust
these are additional things that you
could that you could monitor from space
it's a couple more applications some
things that we're doing that I wanted to
mention as part of a NASA activity a
couple years ago a few years back I
started up a thing called a hundred
cities project whose goal was to try to
monitor a hundred cities around the
world and in doing that we were trying
to collect all kinds of information not
just satellite data not just remote
sensing data but socio-economic data
geographic data land use data zoning
data and what we're finding is when you
start combining those other levels of
information with the imaging data then
suddenly economists and sociologists and
all kinds of folks get really interested
in these datasets okay and so for things
like Google Earth that have this
beautiful imagery what we're trying to
do is look at other pieces of
information that you can add to that
whether it's things like the depth of
the water
table well logs traffic accidents air
pollution air quality thunderstorm
tracks whatever there's a tremendous
amount of information much of which you
can get remotely that you can add to the
image data and this is just an example
where we've we've built up this system
that's trying to use some of these
satellite data in this particular in our
case you know temperature data as well
to add to the existing visible imagery
one other thing that I just wanted to
mention this is something that Michael
actually was working on back when you
was at ASU this is an example of six or
seven global data sets that we have for
Mars we have a total of fifty seven of
these and they everything from mineral
type to rock type to where dust storms
have occurred to changes in surface
albedo to nighttime temperature to
elevation data what you find is when you
put this 56 data sets together then
suddenly people are doing a very
sophisticated research on these global
data sets okay and I don't think any of
the ones that are in our set of 56 are
classic visible remote sensing they're
almost all thermal radar topography
laser etc so I think this is an example
where on Mars we're probably doing more
sophisticated combinations of remote
sensing data than we're actually able to
do here on the earth and I think you
could easily develop these very similar
types of data sets here for the earth ok
I think I have
okay i won I wanted to show one other
example this is an example of a infrared
spectrometer so it's that full spectral
resolution that I showed for the Martian
atmosphere you can actually develop
these now where their imaging systems
for each one of those pixels is a full
2,000 points spectrum so for each time
step for each pixel I can then take that
full spectrum and identify in this
particular case gases that are being
released ok so for pollution monitoring
for looking at you know what's coming
out of smokestacks for what's coming out
of cities these this next generation of
remarkably sophisticated imaging
hyperspectral instruments I you know
it's it's a it's a it's a tool and a
technique which i think is going to get
have tremendous potential and get a lot
of use only within the last few years
we've been able to build instruments
that are capable of doing this build
computer systems that are capable of
processing these data but it's it's a
extremely exciting way of looking at the
world in a much more complex terms than
just with RGB ok I think I'm going to
skip this one and just close with a
couple of other thoughts I just came
back from I spent last week at a NASA
conference with folks who were looking
at what astronauts are going to do when
they go to the moon and without getting
into the detailed politics of that in
NASA's mind we're going to send
astronauts to the moon and the
scientific community was then tasked
with what are they going to do when they
get there okay you could easily argue
that you have that problem backwards but
so I was tasked with what could you do
observing the Earth from the moon okay
and my first thought was that's really
stupid we have 25 earth-orbiting
satellites and we have geostationary
weather satellites and you know we're
looking at the earth just fine from the
earth but it turns out that they're
actually a few interesting things that
that that you can do for example this is
the earth from geostationary orbit this
is the classic weather satellite view it
turns out those things are pretty far
away there you know 30,000 kilometers up
but they're still close enough that you
don't come close to seeing the entire
Earth so for example you can't see the
polar regions at all up at the top you
can see you know Alaska and the Aleutian
Islands are just about disappearing over
the limb of the planet viewed from the
moon that's what the earth would look
like at that same under that that at
that same time and so for that there's
there's two particular things that are
that are real interest and I don't know
you probably you may know this the polar
routes from North America to Asia always
go over the Aleutian Islands and
oftentimes they go over in the in the
polar night and the Aleutian Islands are
the single most volcanically active
place on the earth and there at any
given time there are a dozen or so
volcanoes that are erupting twice on two
separate occasions 747s have flown into
ash clouds unknowingly and had all four
engines stopped in both cases those
engines were started before that
airplane crashed ok but this band of
islands and the Aleutians is it's a it's
a dangerous place to go so one of the
things that people have talked about is
putting sensors up that are constantly
staring at those at that chain of
islands monitoring volcanic eruption
as it heads up for jets not flying
through them the other thing you can do
clearly you know the polls are extremely
interesting from a climate change point
of view and we don't have good
continuous coverage of the polls so
they're they're actually things one
could do from the moon looking back at
the earth and it turns out with a
modest-sized telescope you can actually
see you can get the 500 meter per pixel
imagery of the Earth from the moon okay
these are some examples i won't go into
them but these are some of the examples
of the infrared mapping that we're doing
on Mars and again I think it's a sad
statement to say that we probably have
better data on the composition and the
physical nature of the Martian surface
and we do the earth simply because we've
flown some more sophisticated
instruments to Mars and be prone to the
earth yeah yeah there's no there's
definitely a fewer nasty plants on Mars
than there are here on the earth and as
a geologist I do think that's a good
thing but not everybody does okay and so
I think that just the summary then
remote sensing across the
electromagnetic spectrum and through
time I think has a lot of potential for
providing a lot of quantitative
information about the world that people
are going to want more and more access
to and they're going to I think be able
to come up with more and more
applications for how they actually might
use that data and I'll certainly stop
there and I apologize for droning on
like a lecturer I will certainly take
questions
when you're discussing emissivity a
process that I think correspond stinkin
essence is anything useful in
fluorescence the question was you know
the comment was in describing emissivity
I was describing something it was
similar to fluorescence and that
certainly is the case you can you know
you get these waves and they excite
things and you can be excited and then
cascade back down you can be excited and
you know inflorescences is one of those
processes where waves are excited or
absorbed electrons are excited and then
that as that electron comes back down to
its original ground state it can give
off photons if it comes down in a series
of steps then it actually gives off
photons whose wavelengths is different
than what it absorbed hence fluorescence
and yes there's a lot of information in
that typically you illuminate in the
ultraviolet and materials then re a mitt
or fluorescent visible wavelengths but
there's a lot of information in that I
find scorpions in our backyard by
because they fluoresce at night until
you can you can find them easier than
but there's that's a good example of
another way of looking at the spectrum
yeah what fraction of the universe
plants or just came you back each you
are from a strum
this is not to be plans okay the comment
was what fraction of the earth's surface
can you map geologically without the
interference of plants it's a well
Southern California I can do fine
Arizona I can do fine rainforests snow
north northeast forests no it turns out
if you even if you have like twenty
percent of the ground covered with
plants or thirty percent forty percent
you can still get a really nice
signature through it one of the
interesting facts is that huge parts
from a human perspective large parts of
the population of the earth live in
relatively arid places okay so
monitoring those you know mapping those
is really useful the other thing you
know from a climate point of view the
arid places on the planet are the ones
that are undergoing the most rapid
change we can detect changes in
vegetation so you can detect deep you
can desertification if you will in arid
regions the polar regions are extremely
interesting looking at alpine glaciers
and housing how they're retreating so
there's a lot of really interesting
processes that you can map that are
going on in places that don't have a lot
of vegetation on Mars you could do it on
the earth
material is identical to an opportunity
for a spectrum that differs in the
ultraviolet yes that that I guess the
point I was trying to make and I didn't
make it very well was that every
material has a by definition has a
unique crystal structure it's made up of
a unique set of atoms that are bound
together in a unique way you can
identify that it's an amorphous material
but things like glasses for example
don't have nearly as complex a infrared
spectrum as a a crystalline material but
so any any crystal mineral plant
man-made whatever if it's got if it's
got a crystal structure it will have a
absolutely unique infrared spectrum okay
and it and if you have enough and and
you know enough depends on what you're
looking for but for geologic materials
for biologic materials several hundred
spectral bands is plenty to be able to
identify those uniquely
alright thanks very much
