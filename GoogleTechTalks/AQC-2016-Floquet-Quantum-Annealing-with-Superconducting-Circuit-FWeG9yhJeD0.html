going to present our new results on
quantum simulation in quantum annealing
with superconducting circuits using the
flick a technique and this was done in
it's an eatable Institute in Denmark
together with under Sorenson so there
are many advances in superconducting
circuits going through decades but today
I'm going to talk mostly about recent
advances it coming up last year so these
are chips off or as a small system but
highly coherent to transform qubits
which allow for quantum computing in the
digital fashion but here I will be
mostly interested in quantum simulation
with this system and this application to
quantum annealing so let's take a
transport chain and the Hamiltonian of
this in rotating frame will be nothing
else but just a Hamiltonian of bosonic
oscillators with non-linearity and
nearest neighbor hoping so if we
projected into lowest subspace we will
have this correspond to spin one half
Hamiltonian with magnetic fields which
can be controlled in time but the kaplan
will be of XX + YY time so it will be
fixed to isotropic XY model and that's
of course can be used for to demonstrate
digital simulation with high fidelity
see phase gates however it has limited
possibilities for analog simulation so
this is just a single point in the
parameter space and for using this
hamiltonian you can actually go and
simulate something with digital and it
was shown to be universal of course it
will be superior if we implement the
quantum error correction however it's
still expensive in the sense that you
need to torture eyes the dynamic so once
you do that of course see if delatori of
simulation won't be huge and especially
its limited
by current capabilities once you can
engineer your Hamiltonian and do this
analog approach you get the continuous
dynamics without on and off errors you
don't have trata errors so in some sense
the fidelity will be much higher but
typically it requires this device which
is designed for your problem so it's
very difficult to configure and there is
still an issue of error correction for
this kind of simulation approach and I
want to ask either an alternative way
how how we can do it trying to keep both
a advantages of both approaches and the
one way will be to do something we
called the flick a quantum simulation so
I want to introduce a simple example at
least how we can switch from XY
interaction of transference to the isin
interaction and this can be imagined
with just two cubed system where we have
XS + YY Kaplan and we put magnetic field
on the second qubit it rapidly
oscillates in time and what happens it
will simply do nothing with the first
term so that will be just as interim we
want but it will rotate the second spin
sizes there will be YY kaplan and YZ
kaplan which again rapidly oscillates in
time so if you do everything right and
we consider this frequency of
oscillation to be large what we can do
we can average these terms 20 and it's
easy to imagine that y y minus y will
eventually canceled out so with this we
will be left with effective as interim
from this can wait with argument I can
go to a more detailed theory saying that
what we need is the time-dependent
Hamiltonian with the static term and
large a periodic term with a flock a
period t and universally proportional to
the frequency of oscillation we can
eliminate the storm with a unitary
transformation and this rotating
Hamiltonian later should be averaged out
so
the unitary dynamics now what matters is
actually the periodic unitary and it's
the integer number of periods it will
correspond to effective time independent
Hamiltonian which is also called Flocka
Hamiltonian given by the infinite number
of terms first one will correspond to
the period averaging of your time
dependent Hamiltonian second term will
correspond to the double integral with a
commutator and the higher order terms
will have similar fish can be written in
similar fashion so the important message
is that well this is just period average
in the first order correction will have
1 over Omega Prefecture so if Omega is
large then we are left with a single
term and this indeed will be the
Hamiltonian we want to simulate well as
a chance we'll just contribute to errors
now let me construct the transverse
Eisen model as an example of this flick
a simulation so we put on even sub
lattices oscillating magnetic field and
what it does it kills the YY interaction
term additionally we want to put the
transverse magnetic field on on sub
lattice which can be static and we will
need a time dependent magnetic field for
even sub lattice so a little bit more
technical what we will do is it we do
the transformation for even sub lattice
and define the function G of T which
will which is integral of magnetic field
next the rotated Hamiltonian will
actually have a bunch of terms some are
useful and some are not so when we
averaged over a period we get the eyes
in term which is the one we want to see
then we can cancel due to choosing
properly G of T we can cancel zy kaplan
the same is possible to do for y by
kaplan we
have a static term for all subtleties in
the same fashion we can cancel the
emergent y field and having the time
dependence of original magnetic field we
can average it to some constant value so
in the end will we will be left with
Samson which resembles isin Hamiltonian
so to do so I will choose cosine
modulation of magnetic field and the
important part is that the amplitude of
this magnetic field should scale
proportionally to Omega and this Omega
should be much larger than the energy
scale of two body interaction if we do
so and choose the magnetic field to be
time dependent then for lambda equal to
zero order of Bessel function we can
realize exactly the flick a Hamiltonian
corresponding to transverse aizen model
now I want to actually simulate
something with this approach and i also
want to compare it with existing
approaches so for this I picked up the
digital one which is of course the third
water way to implement transfers aizen
model with transplants and with this or
what I need is to apply XY unitary on
two cubits then do the same rotating it
around x axis on for one qubit such that
i get minus sign instead of plus and add
transverse magnetic fields on all cubits
so this single trotter step should be
repeated so many times and if we imagine
infinite number of times this will
correspond to unitary dynamics of
transfers isin model as a proof of
principle calculation we can imagine
just the four cubed chains with no
decoherence we will start with initial
state which is highly excited and
measure magnetization so the solid line
just shows what
we'll get with analog simulation and the
dots correspond to stroboscopic periods
of Flocka simulations and we can see
that there is a reasonable agreement
what does it mean reasonable can be
quantified by the infidelity of
simulation so the infidelity for flaca
simulation actually grows in time and
this we can understand this appearance
of this higher order terms which we
neglected for the digital approach we
can see that infidelity grows more
dramatically due to the fact that we
fertilize the dynamics and here i must
explains it to compare these approaches
it's actually very tricky because they
are different so what I do here i say my
frequency of oscillation is fixed so my
simulation time is fixed and i can
calculate the number of stroboscopic
periods and naively we will imagine that
the number of toronto steps will be the
same as a number of stroboscopic periods
fine so we can see that flick i approach
works for a dynamic simulation but let's
look at something more useful and the
useful sin will be to actually do an
eland with this hamiltonian in Flocka
basis and prepare some for example
cluster states so if you start with this
hamiltonian we can anneal it to sampson
which will be ghz in the ex basis and
with continuous annealing we can go up
here i chosen time to be smaller than we
need for unity fidelity just such that
the oscillations here look much nicer so
if we knew continuously we can also
imagine the same annealing in the time
with the time-dependent Hamiltonian so
here I will present a numerical
simulation of the full time dependent
Tony on given by this highly oscillating
air terms but what is important that
stroboscopic periods the dynamics they
will correspond exactly to the
continuous annealing so for example with
this technique we can prepare the gz
states a heaven original XY type of
Hamiltonian fine let me next to quantify
how well can we do in dealing with this
technique and for this I will need to
fix the frequency fix the kaplan and
also total annealing time to some larger
value and there will be a question of if
i have a number of trotters the
stroboscopic period six what should i
put forth rotor steps this can be
understood from the following a picture
in Flocka approach what we have is a
fixed two cubed coupling so it's always
on we we don't manipulate it but what we
do we modulate say magnetic field on
each cubed however for the digital
approach what we need we need to apply
first of all X Y interaction two times
on first pair of cubed then we will need
to do it separately on the second pair
of cubed so this is done sequentially
and already we cannot achieve the same
number of trotter steps as stroboscopic
periods additionally we will need to
have the separate magnetic field so in
the end it will be three times as small
and keeping this in mind as a function
of number of qubits the infidelity of
course it grows for the continuous and
unit since I measured to the target
state it also grows for Flocka annealing
and has this shift but with a digital
approach what happens is that it
actually performs very well for the
small number of qubits but at the
stage it grows more dramatically and
this can be quite quantified using the
following slide so first of all the
infidelity of Flocka approach is highly
sensitive to the frequency at which
human delayed so ideally you want to sit
at the very large modulation frequency
but this comes at the price that the
magnetic field you use or the amplitude
should be large as well and that's of
course will be limitation since we
cannot put it in infinite for a digital
approach what happens if we taught her
eyes the dynamics is it for a small
number of total step you typically you
cannot get large fidelity of simulation
while for a large number of sort of
steps it nicely converges to some very
small infidelity so here is of course
very important where do you sit in the
terms of parameters of your system and
it has a kind of threshold like behavior
finally I would discuss briefly the
imperfections of the scheme so of course
it will be decaying the cocoons which
should be treated carefully but these
are same for annealing and in flick a
basis and in the digital fashion then
the effect that we need large magnetic
field actually produces another type of
error since we drive not only 01
transition but also want to transition
in an harmonic ladders and here's
anharmonicity becomes very important to
prevent the leakage out of logical
subspace and for realistic parameters if
we take the frequency to be 20 times is
the coupling constant and taken harmony
CTO of the transplant qubit then we can
imagine that in two microseconds we can
in you let's say four cubed chain 20
point 99 fidelity with analog approach
and the fluck approach will actually be
very close so it is possible and
moreover with coherent flux qubits I
believe this can be highly improved
finally so far I just benchmark the
transfers
in simulation but the real goal here is
to go to generic simulations where we
imagine different magnetic fields on
each cubed and with this we can organize
a onion so tropic couplings and general
Hamiltonian so the first example I
already worked on is the modulation on
even on sub lattice along the arbitrary
static axis with this what we can get is
this general type of Hamiltonian which
is XYZ type being non stochastic and
this will have of course implications
for annealing resist the type of
Hamiltonians what can be done what
cannot be done is this these
coefficients are not independently
controlled so to do so we will need to
consider arbitrary rotating axis and
this is under development finally the
main motivation was actually to go to a
cluster model with these couplings and
if we allow for additional tuning knobs
this will be possible in future so
finally let me conclude zit I consider
the different approach to start with the
static hemel considering time dynamical
Hamiltonian which can in configurable
way model the effective Hamiltonian of
the system of interest its can be
optimized such that you use your
resources wisely and possibly this can
also be applied to non stochastic
Hamiltonians and I already tried this
approach showings it indeed you continue
with high fidelity to this Hamiltonian
so thank you very much for attention
right we have time for a couple of
questions questions so I have a question
I mean you said that these frequencies
you know they have to be very large
compared to the coupling basically but
it's a trout it has to be they have to
be very large in comparison with the
global energy scale of the problem what
I mean you said if you have a problem
that you know with the n qubits right
yes you increase n do you have to
increase the magnitude of these
oscillations I guess the general
restriction is really what you put in
front of the Hamiltonian here so
typically this will be the only a
relevant energy scale which matters if
you start with X X plus y y Hamiltonian
and the flick approach who will work
well like the infidelity will not grow
with number of qubits so i guess here
what you really need to sink is it j is
small for nearest neighbor interaction i
actually don't know what happens if you
allow for larger connectivity I was
worried because invisible you want to
prevent these oscillations of generating
transitions between different states
right so you will leg to avoid I mean
going from the lowest energy level to
the highest energy level if you want and
that's difference of energy is given by
the global magnet a lovely so here I
guess there the trick is that Omega
should be much larger than J because you
want to consider the flick a period to
be much smaller than everything what
happens in the Hamiltonian so if you can
to satisfy that you are fine I mean you
want to period a
courage and nothing should happen in
this time scale right so any other
questions right so if not this thank
Alex and again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
