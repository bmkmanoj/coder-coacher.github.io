you our to speak
these gentlemen are with the joomla
project which is open source content
management system they're joining us
today to tell us a little bit both about
the joomla project and jewels projects
participation in the google Summer of
Code program so please write in
welcoming welcome i hope that sound is
working yes it's working already and
we're actually going to talk about the
joomla project and we did in summer of
code and i will hand it over to to lose
because this won't work you can flip it
thank you we be called laughs at the
joomla bizarre we're open source and
we're working hard on being one of the
best open source content management
systems in the world we're going to look
back we're going to look forward and we
want to tell something about we did in
summer of cards this is us Louis I'm
Louis is Lee developer in fact he will
be Lee developer soon he isn't yet
untitled Lee developer is one of the
developers of our new joomla framework
miju McCourt remember I will explain
something about our organization what we
do there Lewis is coming from the United
States and he will check out the nine ok
wilco is one of one of my recruits to
come and help with the project he I I
met him on the forums sort of one of
those random open-source things and
within a matter of days i knew that i
wanted him to join the project i asked
him to join along with a couple of the
other core team members and now he is
actually coordinating our development
he's sort of the open-source equivalent
of a project manager and developer and
just overall good guy
as as you said we're going to look at
sort of where we came from because we're
a relatively new project well it's an
old project and a new skin where we
where we've come in the brief period of
time that we've been around and what our
plans are for the future how the juma
bizarre and the cathedral that it's it's
an interesting mix we try to find the
balance between you know the purest open
source world and being able to choose
the right tool for the right job and and
sort of embrace the commercial aspects
of things as well and then of course the
most important part of the talk i guess
the google Summer of Code impact on our
project and how we've used it as a tool
there we go okay we came from a project
called Mambo or manbo depending on which
part of the world you're from this was a
content management system that was
released I think back around 2000 2001
commercial company in Australia released
it and it was released on sourceforge
and a few guys picked it up and started
working on it and it quickly became
popular mostly due to its user interface
it was one of the first ones that was
just easy for everybody to use people
could pick it up and play with it one of
the most common questions I get is what
happened because about a year ago
everybody that was joomla are everybody
that with Mambo at the time split and
left and it was one of the more
interesting Forks if you will in the
open source world because it was
completely unanimous and completely
silent like there were there was no
bashing coming from from the developers
end it was just there was an open letter
to the community and everybody just
moved we like to call it a spoon instead
of a fork because actually everybody now
at Mombo is new and everybody now at
joomla is what was Mambo
it's been an interesting ride but this
is one of the important things about
where we are we started a project from
scratch we had no infrastructure all we
had was a code base and of course that's
very important but we had to sort of
rebuild the community around it and
rebuild all of the sites and
infrastructure and everything that it
takes to keep an open source project
running and it's it's been really hard
and I think because of the level of
access we seem to have achieved that
seems to sort of get lost and how far
we've come in the brief period of time
that we've come so here's a quick
timeline Jimmu was born in September
first 2005 we released the first version
which was rebranded in and you know bug
fixed which was joomla which is very
similar to the Mambo roots we opened up
our our Forge our developer Forge very
soon thereafter it actually as it stands
now is the largest installation of
sourceforge enterprise on the planet VA
software donated it to us and has been
hosting it ever since and this has been
one of our greatest successes because
all of the developers that build on top
of joomla register accounts there and
they have like the full power of the
forge and you know the source of
repositories and the wiki and the
trackers and all those sorts of things
it was the developer network is
something that we that we did a little
later on there was always this sort of
stigma that the joomla developers didn't
really talk to the outside world so much
we were always sort of looked at as a
not closed but because it's such a
tight-knit group there was not a lot not
as much outward communication for such a
community that we have because it's very
user-oriented and so we created the
developer network which is just a site
in our within our family that has blogs
on it that we communicate with them and
it houses a lot of our developer
documentation and things like that and
that turned out to be a great success
followed by our greatest success our
extension site which joomla is a
pluggable system you you can upload zip
packages that it automatically installs
for you and it's very much joomla is
very much like the operating system of a
content management system and then the
the packages that you install are like
the applications and a lot most of the
applications that exist or a third party
we don't write on and so what we need
what we found was that most of our user
base had trouble navigating the fords
looking for packages and things like
that so we built this extension site
which actually gets more traffic than
any of our other any of our other sites
at this point it's one of our greatest
success stories and it was actually
built by one of our third-party
developers see much further on jun 15
this is the rewrite that really is what
joomla is jim 15 is a complete rewrite
of of the existing code base it's the
object oriented framework it's lots and
lots of fun to play with and it is the
direction that we're going in it's been
evaluated a usability wise we look at we
make lots of decisions based upon user
feedback because most of our communities
user anyway it is the future and it's a
it's a wonderful milestone to have a
complete rewrite of the software in that
brief period of time our official user
manual was released not long ago and
then joomla 1.25 the one point o series
the beta was released on the twelfth and
actually the as everything goes as
planned the final will be released
tomorrow so that's the brief history of
it this is actually part of the success
story on when we first started this is
what a google search for joomla looked
like
there was basically nothing okay and
where are we now and where are we going
we have 75,000 registered users on our
forum 55,000 register developers on our
Forge obviously these numbers are
self-explanatory we've blown up huge in
the period of time that we've been
around the traffic that we get is
ridiculous I still marvel at the fact
that we've I mean if different people
have different ideas about how important
Alexa is but for us to be that high in
this brief period of time is just
stunning to me yeah as with what I've
noticed to be a lot of open source
projects the concentration is in Europe
we've got a lot of obviously a lot of us
and other areas but this is the
analytics for the entire family of
joomla websites and that is actually
actually stunning how popular we are in
Europe which is why all of our events in
Europe seem to attract so many people
I'm continually amazed a lot of our
developers are there an enormous number
of our users are there as well this is a
few days ago and as you can see there's
an awful lot of hits now on joomla so in
a period of about a year we've gone from
nothing to just enormous amount of
popularity the Google Trends graph is
actually also a really fun thing to look
at but this amazes me all right it's I
can't believe I'm even part of a project
that was able to do that in that period
of time and then musings in the future
but knows but it's I'm like I said
continually amazed at how popular we
become as quickly he's gotten there okay
so future last release of 10 is very
soon tomorrow hopefully the 1.5 release
is a completely new framework we've one
of the things that we've tried very hard
to do is provide backwards compatibility
so that all these third-party developers
won't have to rewrite everything because
everything has changed in the new
version so that's been something very
important to us the future release is
something that I will be working on
immensely it's just sort of the dream if
you will it's it's had many names over
the years even back in the Mambo years
version 2 point 0 will be basically
throwing all of the toys and gadgets
that we've worked on and wanted to work
on for so long but couldn't because of
backwards compatibility reasons and more
on that when we talk about the Summer of
Code involvement that's Summer of Code
was something that we we definitely use
to do research and development this is
actually one of my pet projects as well
we partnered up with the Eclipse project
or a committer on the project and a few
other friends that I've met at different
events and we are creating a joomla ide
j code and it will be the first preview
build was built a week or so ago and it
will be a fully branded and personalized
joomla ide you'll be able to deploy
joomla packages there will be Wizards
for creating joomla components and
things like that it's it's really
exciting because I don't know of any
other projects at least in our area of
the world or that that have something
like this and one of the things that
we're trying so desperately to do is
attract developers and show that you
know we are serious project for
developers as well because our user base
is just so overwhelmingly end user that
we tend to not get the sort of the
attention from the development community
that I personally think
we should so a quick look at our
structure it's one of the things I
learned at the Summer of Code summit was
that all of these projects didn't have
very different structures ours is
equally different we started out with a
core team which sits on the top right
now I think we have 22 23 something like
that guys and it's a flat structure
there are project leads we have three
interim ones at the moment but other
than that it's a completely flat
structure and most of them are not
developers actually most of them are we
have coordinators are the different
working groups and these would be the
working groups translation quality
interesting development and all of these
and what we've done is basically created
a three-tier system the core team is the
coordinators and the people that make
the overarching decisions and things
like that and provide or actually
enforce the direction the working groups
are worth most everything happens we've
just with the new version done
internationalization for static
translations for the different text
strings within the application and the
translation working group is a group of
people I don't know how many languages
we have now but i think it's upwards of
70 70 s of different translations of the
joomla application and they have all sub
teams but the translation working group
is made up of the leaders of each
individual translation group the quality
and testing group is something that's
pretty new well it's not necessarily new
but it that they're very active we've
changed the way that we structure the
project during during the development
phase we everything is run by the
development working group which is a
group of 15 now I think and he would be
the coordinators but as soon as we reach
an RC status we pass everything off to
the quality and testing group and then
they drive development yes
like with an extension the translation
working groups at the moment basically
all it does is the core but we provide
API abilities for and you can install
language packs so any third-party
developer can use the same system that
everything else uses and create the
translations in my guess and it's a
relatively new thing because the
translation in its full form only
happened in the 15 version which is in
beta right now so as my guess is as that
progresses a lot of these translation
working groups will likely be picking up
on the more popular extensions and doing
that sort of thing as well and we've
allowed for you to install like a core
language pack or a extension language
pack so gives you the ability to do that
so any rate when you pass when we reach
the RC status the probably in testing
drives the release and they drive
everything so at that point the
developers are basically sitting in the
back seat and the testers are checking
for bugs and filing reports and
assigning bugs to developers and then we
attack them as we have time and when
everything settled and they sign off on
it then it gets released sites and
infrastructure this is probably outside
of I guess development the most
important working group that we have
because it's the biggest one it's the
biggest one by far yeah these guys run
the show I mean these guys are on the
forums all the websites and make sure
that we are available to the outside
world so it's nice having the separation
so that developers can worry about
developing and these guys can worry
about making sure that everything's okay
within those communication lines
documentation group self-explanatory
designing says design and accessibility
is a relatively new thing too they worry
about the website designs and and such
for all of our websites they also focus
on accessibility and usability for the
application itself so these guys tend to
be more experts in the realm of web
standards and making sure that we are as
usable
and functional as we can be for the
largest audience that we can reach and
then marketing and media which is I've
heard many open-source people say well
you really shouldn't have marketing and
media because that sounds very corporate
it's not that it's not that evil it's
just that it's nice for us to have a
cohesive voice and those guys it's a
very small group help that and they also
help plan events and things like that
and then underneath the community and
it's it's an open thing but the flux
between the community in the working
groups is pretty good and it we welcome
any help obviously we're open source so
this structure relatively new but it's
working out amazingly well yeah covered
a lot of this um we don't have a very
very strict hierarchy it's a very flat
organization at the top and in the
working groups underneath is a very flat
organization organizations and then the
community so it's very much like a
meritocracy if what you do is what
defines how important you are we have
300 project leads because our old
Project Lead stepped down he was burnt
out I'm sure and they are making a lot
of the decisions from a structural
standpoint but again it's very flat so
it's not as if there's you know a real
solid hierarchy we have a non-profit
foundation open source matters which was
one of the first things that was done
after the split to make to protect the
assets of the project and make sure that
everything stays open and free obviously
based on volunteers all most work is
done in the free time actually the
company that hosts all of our our sites
pays one of our got one of our site
number structure guys to just maintain
the sites which is a really nice gesture
so it's donated and at the same time
he's being paid so that that's all that
he does not for profits gift economy
this is actually a really important part
of it we we all have basically the same
in goals and one of the things that I've
learned is culturally we're all very
different because we're very spread out
all over the place but we all basically
have the same goals and we tend to help
each other without even really realizing
it and I really love that aspect of it
the motivation is really high because
you know much like the difference
between taking an art class or a math
class in school if you take art it's
because you want to take it not because
you have to and the same is true of open
source and the meritocracy aspect of the
status is based on what you do and not
who you are and for this I will okay let
the develop coordinator explain we lose
explained we're moving to a more
structural unorganized way of doing
things we're putting in a working group
structure we're in the transition to
putting things in place and one of the
things we did with the development
strategy lose explain something about
quality and testing is put a decent
development strategy in place we have
written on documents it's you can
download from a site where which
actually describes our development
strategy and it's all topics in more
detail we do have a code of conduct
actually we took it from the ubuntu a
project because we liked it and that's
the way we want to do and want to act in
the project it's very important when
people who are not familiar with
outsource just understand how you work
in outsourced it's different when you're
in business environment doing things and
doing things in open source to
membership like loose explained in in
the mumble times we had a core team
doing all the stuff and was relative
small group I need people yeah it's a
small group and we said okay we want to
open up the project because it's growing
very fast and you need to have some kind
of mechanism to add people who want to
help out in your project
one of the most important things is our
do you handle conflict resolution you
you will have some conflicts to solve
and in the company you just going to say
just shut up or go away and in obsess
it's slightly different also resignation
it's a people can be enacted for over a
year and then return so what's
resignation but it's when people want to
step in and there's just no room to
handle the project because we yeah we're
we're doing this in spare time so I
can't handle 100 developers in my spare
time it's just impossible 15 people I
can do but 50 people is already a
problem so you need to have some kind of
mechanism to keep the project going and
keep the active remembers be there so
resignation yeah that's something that's
that happens and not often because most
of the developed are very active but it
happens we we're thinking about the
development lifecycle and cloud-based
lifecycle we have a very simple version
strategy major minor and maintenance
movies on the major minor maintenance
releases the development working group
is in the lead as Luis explains and Anna
mentions releases quality and testing
determines what's what needs to be done
that's a structure we put in place I
think three months ago and we really
like it because quality of the product
is just improving
and the last bullet communications and
tools yeah we have development working
group with 12 people coming from 12
different countries and different time
zones and that's a challenge because not
everyone speaks language every air fare
well and we're English based community
and there are cultural differences oh
yes there are cultural difference victim
sometimes you say something and you're
completely misunderstood and then the
conflict bruising is it comes in place
sometimes but it's it's something you
need to be aware of doing things and
very important because in rare occasions
we meet I've met loose for two times now
two times a googleplex by the way
communicating with each other not seeing
each other is the challenge yeah we have
several tools we use we use IRC for
chatting we have skype to do live video
chats of course we'll use a lot of the
googler tools just to to have mailing
lists etc and it's a basic set of tools
everyone needs need to know if and need
to use
what what did some of calm inference for
us actually I I came into the project
when Summer of Code started Luce Luce
asked me to be a mentor and i ended up
to do the program management of all
projects we did what does it mean for
joomla basically this year's summer of
code was a research project we wanted to
research new technologies we want to
incorporate in our to point our
framework we will have a view of the
project we did and technology we have
been researching and yeah we did
challengers as I would tell more about
that what actually was a result of that
the Google summits in October it was it
was in film in November and it was a
great experience to interact with other
people of obsessed projects when you're
in your project you talk to other open
source projects but there were about 90
other obsess projects and just
interacting with those how do you handle
things how do you manage growth because
we are pretty a new project how do we do
those things and it was really great to
be there the last bullet some of the
structural changes Lucic explains were
tested in some rough counts we didn't
tell anyone about this but really we did
test some things does it actually work
in an absurd environment to put some
structural changes in place and we did a
questionnaire to all the people involved
the mentors and students while why do
you even want to be involved in open
source but in this case why do you want
to be involved in open source of and
google Summer of Code this is this is
nice people just want to be part of the
project and add new functionality and
say hey I have an ID I want to build it
for you by the way this keem least came
from anonymous questionnaires getting to
the students that participated and these
were the top answers that we got ya
for students it's the first step in
professional career at college today
yeah just this study how you can program
and summer of code they actually do it
and are guided by people who have a lot
of experience in the business area for
some students this is this is really
true to earn some money in summer $1,500
is a lot of money and and we understand
it and to learn real life project work
one of the things that and other open
source projects already mentioned it
students are the most brilliant people
you can find in your project but they
have never done project work that I want
to jump to coding and don't do any kind
of planning so basically they learn how
to do project work and interact with
other members of a team and it's very
important and yeah this may be
flattering for us being contact with the
core team members we want to talk to
everyone but actually some of the
students are here and we can interact on
all the things we want to do in the
project and its really nice and the last
one it's fun just some of codes just fun
to be there and interacting with people
doing an ass things meeting interesting
people it's just fun basically I think
the whole juba project fun or else I
wouldn't be standing here but okay and
this is a project structure of the
program structure we did besides the six
sponsored project we did two
non-sponsored project I can be yeah that
one I can handle very crazy the non
sponsored project didn't even start so
the money thing is is helping out when
you want to do something eight projects
by the way is is huge doing eight
projects in 12 weeks there's a lot of
work not going to manage we're glad we
did six projects and I see the things we
did one of the students Lawrence will
tell something about
a the xml RPC implementation we did one
of the other students will do will tell
something about the ACL I think we did
we did a proof of concept to the Ajax
with the HX implementation in our
framework basically these projects are
scheduled to be implemented in our to
point out framework and we had all this
project delivered a working proof of
concept or working beta and the xml-rpc
project is now in final stage or at
least it's in bed states and the pretty
awesome application doing very nice
things Summer of Code where did everyone
come from my student was here in the US
so yeah timezone differences were a real
challenge and because Luis and I did
project management and we did have very
little sleep in that period because we
wanted to interact with everyone on a
regular basis for instance we asked
everyone to do a weekly report and we
wanted to interact with them how's your
project going do you need help basically
anything to get things moving and the
red dots are the mentors and the blue
dots are the students challenges and yes
like in an open source project in summer
of code you will see you have to handle
same things like timezone differences
also a cultural differences are there
it's it's it's when you have a German
mentor it's different than you have on
us mentor believe me it is knowledge and
skills sometimes the student knows a lot
more about the subject and the men
toward us and and that's sometimes the
challenge a student who thinks he knows
better and sometimes he actually knows
about guiding them through the project
and really put some results at the end
that's a challenge to who's the
difference between knowing the
technology and
huh okay anyway there's a difference
between knowing the technology and
knowing how to create a solution based
on the technology and one of the things
that we found that a couple of our
students knew the technology very well
they knew what they what they wanted to
do and they knew how to I guess
programmatically make that happen but
again there is a very different there's
a very big difference between being able
to write an application and being able
to work through a project and work with
other people and I think that's one of
the one of the things that the google
Summer of Code really helped to hammer
home with a with a bunch of students so
yeah we have that by doing some kind of
planning and when students started we
asked them to write a project proposal
defining some milestones define some
kind of planning because the experience
we have students are so so excited that
they're part of summer of code that I
just want to do everything and they
forget that i only have 12 weeks to do
that thing and let's challenge to to say
okay just do ten percent of what you
want to do and then we're happy to that
you finish it release early nothin we
had eight let six branches where
students committed the codes on a daily
basis so every day you could check out
the count and see what the student
student has been doing it's very
important than that you have those
opportunities in your tooling that you
actually can see progression and if the
student doesn't commit code for a week
or two then you know you have a problem
communicating very very important to not
only for the students itself in a mentor
who's guiding him but for a complete
summer of code project it's important to
say what are we doing how are we doing
things which prob do we do we face and
how do we solve them and the last one if
you track oakley
students I hey that project is going
light like hell I want to catch up I'm
going to do extra effort to keep keep up
and present my work in a nice proper way
and next year we will do we will focus
more on this because actually the weak
leader reports it's difficult for
students to write them to keep up to do
12 reports because that is the only
thing we want to do is cut cut cut cut
cut and that's okay but the week report
is important to what our results it's
questionable that you can give a hundred
percent positive evaluation we gave our
students this year the benefit of the
doubt next year will be more strict and
we will more more organized up front
just saying okay when do we give a
positive level of evaluation and not
we're talking to Google how we can
manage that in more the market
perspective for other products because
other projects struggle with this this
problem also we're very proud we have
three of the students joining the
development working group from the sixth
it's a 50-percent score and they
actually are very active for students at
the moment and we're very glad to have
them around and eventually one mentor
also joined the development working
group and yeah that's that's okay if
students put so much time into the
project during summer of code and I end
up in the working groups that's that's
okay to give you an estimate students
put in some time there was my children
were put on 400 hours in this project
that's an amazing amount of hours that's
more than it should have done what he
did and I meant was did 50 to 90 hours
and we agree that needs to be more next
year so we do a first strict selection
on who is going to mentor or not and
yeah probably just part of the job I
don't know how many hours we spent a lot
a lot now you see the sick projects and
the antic term evaluation we did also
I've written report about summer of
coats
describing how we came to this results I
think Leslie will block about it I'll
she promised to do so but we will see
okay what do we expect from google I'm
wrapping up this presentation and then
we have room for questions just do the
thing you do and help us out to have
more hits on your side 30 minutes is
we've blended so that actually are hits
and we have to have the more next year
and at least I expect the river behind
that 300 million hits now I'm just
kidding we're very fertile it's you have
google helping us out this way it's
awesome what you do for open source we
really appreciate it and it's fun to to
be part of it and actually yeah we hope
you just increase the average of you
make just what I'm asking and we end up
with a slight now that here underneath
what joomla actually is actually one of
our leader Philippa so onions and

about a project but it's being part of a
community where you actually can work
together share knowledge and do great
stuff and having fun and Leslie winner

was our presentation I could we can talk
for hours and hours about a project we
