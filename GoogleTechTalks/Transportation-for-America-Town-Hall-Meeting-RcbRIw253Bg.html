thanks so much for coming we have a
couple folks from transportation from
America today with us to town hall
meeting we have Alana preuss who is the
at this right outreach and feel director
for the transportation for america
campaign and with her we also have
will's will hands field who's a regional
organiser so I'm handed it over to Alana
thanks well thank you all for coming
here today I promise to be hopefully
lively about this debate and what I'd
really like to do is make sure I hear
from each of you here and anybody else
who wants to join the conversation about
what you think needs to happen because
the transportation for america campaign
came about about a year ago because
individuals nonprofits business leaders
elected officials all started to
recognize that what we're investing in
with our transportation money from the
federal government wasn't working and
private businesses like Google and small
cities all over the country we're
starting to wrestle control from the
federal government about what they
wanted their own transportation future
to be and people realize that that's one
way to go about doing it but the other
way would really be to change the rules
of the game at the federal level so that
we could build our communities the way
we want our businesses could get
employees around the way that they won
and we would actually support that from
the federal government but the big
question to me today and that I want to
turn over to you guys in just a little
while is how do you think this money
should be spent the transportation bill
is a lot of money that goes out across
the country up until this year talking
about five hundred billion dollars from
the federal government used to be a lot
of money it's still to me a fair amount
of money going out and historically this
is money that's have no strings attached
to it what I'm going to do is talk for
just a couple minutes about the campaign
what we see as unique opportunities
about why we think this change is time
to happen now a little bit about the
transportation belen and how this money
gets spent but really more specifically
to come to each of you with questions
about what we
you like to see happen in your community
around here in this region and how do
you want to be able to get around so a
little bit about transportation for
america it is a national coalition we
are a campaign of as i said individuals
nonprofits business leaders elected
officials who have come together to
advocate for changing a federal bill
called the Surface Transportation Act
this bill comes up every five years five
or six years and the federal government
decides how much money to spend and what
are going to be the rules of how that
money is spent all across the country
there's a whole bunch of partners from
across the country there's over 250 now
we started with 15 about a year ago
people understand this idea pretty
plainly that we need to change the way
we're investing in transportation but
the question is why do we see this
change now we've been in fact investing
in a federal transportation system for
about 50 years right 50 years ago
President Eisenhower set us on a path
1956 he announced we are going to do
something that no one has ever thought
of before we are going to connect all of
our cities with an interstate highway
system they thought it was ludicrous
they said it would never have work they
said it will take too many years in the
1980s we finished the interstate highway
system but today we're at a crossroads
the 21st century we need something very
different because the country that we
have today is very different from where
we were 50 years ago our economy is in a
very different place is all I'm sure
everyone knows the high gas prices from
last year were one thing but the
economic troubles that a lot of
households are dealing with today is
another issue households need to be able
to trim the fat from their budgets or
trim anything from their budgets
wherever they can and giving people
different ways to get around is one way
to reduce their costs we also know that
we have energy concerns this is on the
climate side and on the security side we
have to deal with climate change
transportation contributes one-third of
our national greenhouse gas emissions
and we have to make our country secure
from foreign oil what does it mean to
reduce the amount of oil that we use
so that we can be a safer country we
also know that our demographics are
changing we know we across the country
we did a survey on where people want to
live and this was national it's not
specific to this region of the country
but we found that over thirty percent of
households would want to live close in
in a smaller lot near the shops near the
schools near the businesses if they
could afford it what is affordable is
obviously relative by region but we also
found out that that was in fact lower
than what is the true demand in many
areas and only about five percent of the
market is being built that way right now
we also know that in about 30 years a
demographer did some projections for us
in about 30 years we expect that only a
quarter of all households will be
households with kids people without kids
and people with kids don't necessarily
want to live in the same places don't
have the same housing demands the places
that people wanted to live
overwhelmingly in the 1950s and 60s is
very different from where people are
going to want to live in the next 20-30
years the demand has changed the tide
has turned we need to make sure that
transportation can meet those needs we
also know that there's the system is
most broken broken broke the federal
transportation budget ran out of money
last year it had to take and get an
extra gift from the federal government
last year but it's also broken i'm sure
people heard about the minnesota bridge
collapse it was an atrocious an atrocity
that happened and we want to make sure
that that doesn't happen anywhere else
we invested in this interstate highway
system it is in fact a world-class
interstate highway system we need to
maintain it nobody puts out an amazing
system that's in fact working pretty
well and then neglects to at least up
keep it but what we do need to do is
look at building out the rest of that
Network building out the rest of a
transportation system making sure that
our neighborhoods we can get around by
sidewalks and my bike making sure that
we have trains and buses and high-speed
rail that connect our our metropolitan
areas and making sure that we're
creating as many jobs as we can we know
that fixing the highways that we have in
five
Act creates more jobs than building new
highways so if we're even just looking
at maximizing our job creation out of
something then we need to look at it
differently and as I said before we have
household costs that we know for
somebody who's on a tight budget or a
fixed income if we can give them an
affordable place to live where they have
bus or rail that they can get to their
combined cost of housing and
transportation will be lower we need to
make sure that we're looking at equity
considerations climate considerations
and making sure that people can get
around the way they want to so I just
want to emphasize we're talking about
real money here right this bill they're
talking about doing five hundred billion
dollars for transportation across the
country last time it was a little under
three hundred billion dollars this is
not money to sneeze at it is not chump
change even at the federal government
level this is a lot of money and what I
am out here to say and hoping each one
of you will join me in is that we in
fact need to get a lot more voices heard
about what people want to see of
transportation in their community in
their region and in their state so
there's few challenges to this there's
this thing called politics in DC it's a
little different than it was you know
just a year ago I would say but there
are a lot of entrenched interests that
just like building roads they've been
doing it for 50 years they don't want to
change it and they want to just keep
doing that without having any strings
attached there's also always opposition
to whatever change in status quo is out
there but there's also 50 years of this
one system we built a highway we
finished it but nobody has really come
up with the next great plan what is the
vision for the 21st century do we need
President Obama to stand up and say the
vision for the 21st century is to
connect every major major major
metropolitan area with high speed rail
in the next 30 years just like
Eisenhower did in the 50s is that what
we need next we need to have those
voices and those ideas and the
innovation come together at the federal
level to know what we want next and so
transportation for america is working
with people like you and
business is like Google I hope across
the country to get people together and
say what is it we want and make sure
that those voices are heard there's a
few goals that we have for the next
transportation bill though we want to
make sure it creates a lot of jobs seems
like a simplistic idea but it's not just
about jobs it's about jobs in the local
communities jobs that give jobs projects
that give jobs to people in a given
community so that we can have more in
each location across the country we do
want to make sure that we build a
world-class rail network some of it will
be high speed some of it will be plain
old regular speed I just took the train
from Sacramento and I can tell you that
parts of that are not particularly high
speed but we need to make sure we're
connecting our metropolitan areas with
rail and that's both for people and for
freight we're going to have a huge
amount of influx of freight getting
shipped across the country if it's just
in trucks our cars will be in a
standstill we also need to maintain the
existing system we have to make sure
that we're keeping our roads in and our
bridges and our trains and our buses and
our sidewalks and our bike weighs in
good condition the whole system that's
out there we have to make sure that it's
good and we have to make sure that we're
giving people more options on how to get
around people are clamoring to live in
downtown's in town centres in cities
more than ever before we need to make
sure that there is enough housing and
enough options for people there and make
sure that there are different ways for
them to get around and there's also a
lot of interest for local governments to
be able to decide some of this
themselves as well and decide their own
fate so the major question to me is what
do people want to see and we are working
with people all across the country in
April and in May this year to in fact do
meetings like this in big cities and
businesses and small towns to talk with
people about the projects that they'd
like to see the vision that they have
for how we should be getting around
and what people would like to see out of
this next big chunk of money it's not
going to be a simple task to change it
but to make that change happen we have
to get a lot of people to talk about it
and really change the way we're thinking
about what's what are their options what
is possible in our transportation
investments because it's because it's
truly an investment in our communities
and in our businesses so I've given you
a brief introduction about these ideas
and what I'd like to do is in fact ask
you to think about what you'd like to
see so do you think that the federal
government should have priorities in how
what what it spends on transportation we
have a few ideas they have to do with
climate and energy security and health
and safety and things like that crazy
ideas but I'd like to know what you guys
think but also how do you want to get
around and how should our stuff get
around what do you think are the right
ways that we should be doing this and
believe me wills going to capture all of
it and then what projects do you want to
see what should what should google be
able to do i understand that Google is
one of has a one of the biggest private
transit systems in the country should
that be Google's responsibility does
Google need to hold that up is that a
system that should be part of a larger
initiative in Northern California so
that more people have that kind of
access to get to their jobs and what
else should we be doing across the
country and before I go any farther I'd
like to walk away from the mic actually
and see if anybody wants to volunteer to
go first and say what
it's not being reported we'll just blend
true it so just the priorities include
things like cafe standards it's a good
question so cafe standards are the
standards by which how clean is how what
kind of fuel efficiency our way that's
not hard a transformational trip short
there's an energy bill of climate bill
that are obviously being provide right
now I'm fed up for discussion federal
level that they included increasing cafe
standards but because it just went
through last year at the initial increas
I don't think that's going to be part of
this climate bill the cafe standards
that are not part of the transportation
transportation bill solely about how
much money is in the off who gets that
money and how is it divided and what are
the rules for spending so have your
standards are not the picture I'm
Jessica way I
your google transit and a few
transportation related project so i
think in transit agencies in the past
year and i feel that one of the
questions information
so what translate
to get all the transportation there so
that people general like writers would
actually find out to access as
so ideal that if the difficulty of
actually getting people to take public
transit is one is there is a musical
and a second is people don't really know
what kind of solutions
so I think that if part of the bill and
help the transit agencies or event
transportation general to help the
general public to access these
here that's one way
you're talking about 5 billion dollars
500 that's our bike five hundred billion
dollars of investment how would sit
there to know that these colors are
spending in the right place or how the
have done some of the research alive
just like for example barb projects an
expression it's difficult to find out
where the proposal I exactly asst and
that's so for insisted getting all they
want
hell with that line affect my daily job
so you can start using fools to make
this kind of information more
transparent and then keep that
information out there Deana make it
impossible for Google Yahoo Microsoft to
crawl so anybody going to the website
type in bart extension project that
needed it see detailed map of where that
project is words it's supposed to go
what is the current process image of
mine suspending I don't know if the
politicians want to give that much
transparency but if you want to citizens
to you get involved
formation team all right so they feel
that their boys is Ashley I'm doing a
few things about that and then what will
continue one is about the information
sharing I think it's absolutely key even
just getting maps of all of the not let
alone all the heavy rail transit
stations across the country but we're
all the bus stations and can you add
that to google maps it does the map the
information doesn't exist in one place
so that it could be searched in any kind
of way and then information sharing to
add that technology and to provide
resources for even small systems to be
able to have that information online is
key and we in fact throw a pot of
innovation money so that anybody could
compete for funds to be more innovative
and more high-tech in the way that they
have more transit system or their road
system working but the truth is in fact
that the stigma that you talked about in
terms of using transit in most places is
gone either because they people don't
have options and they have to use
transit or because you look different
generations and different thoughts about
how to get around now and there are more
people on transit now then since since
nineteen fifty-six refers to the highest
ridership
that was before we started will be
interesting patent system so there is in
fact the amount of people on transit
will skyrocket over the last few years
we expect them to sustain on the
transparency side absolutely i think
that is top-notch top of the list being
accountable and transparent alex gets
bent so that anybody yeah I'm actually
going to say that the system is
reporting and the reason is that if you
look at the time it takes you to get
from here to there and back to the
public transit it's much longer than get
breaking your own heart will so how that
problem gets significantly address it's
always going to be proficient and in
particular if I ever have to look at a
schedule the system is doomed I can look
at them out what if I have to look at
the schedule we're gonna go around
fighting two wars I'm not working on a
project called high tech in China and
the goal is two men hitchhiking same
chemical hope because we were all hope
your generations philosopher so and i
know that in the nine lots of projects
bay area the support van and i studied
one particular body died in the labels
and now only I see hundreds of sites it
basically provides cell phone the
internet to say my person either
hundreds of these kegs in practice
Association people trying to get
together do it but the question is why
women is will the government sort of
resuscitate well then vehicles will be
having a bandage hanging high 50
especially an official itching sister
brandi see here looks like it's one get
slugging that also happens here if not
the east bay fat people jumping in with
each others bars are crazy and me the
fantasy is a two-block result well you
can get any to get them anywhere
anywhere safely is a lot so you have a
very expensive cell phone i don't know i
can't even take again around the
slugging system if somebody came up with
a dry sticks you cannot live an
innovation slugging project could you
get money out of this innovations grab
cool that we're proposing possibly the
vanpool issue is very interesting it
died off because there was a task code
needs to change and I can't tell
it's something that we've actually just
changed back and so that the whole
vehicle system hopefully we'll see a big
resurgence in town in a more official
capacity I think it's pretty much I love
the idea of this way home just for more
division handful look at the back road
they have it on their website they just
went through that are the
is five years of dark
well partially let me just give you call
it there's the gas tax that everybody k
is whenever you put gas meter car that
does that really no different five years
people are driving us and so reflecting
much less of the gas tax in the report
which is why last year the
Transportation Trust Fund broke because
there wasn't enough the people were
driving as much of him hit their mark of
how much money the couple were you take
the five hundred billion it's going to
have to have a lot of it can't I don't
remember stopping at how
the last bill was 286 billion dollars
and we're going to be that's 11
insurance so if we plateau and about
half of it coming out of the gas tax if
we continue to draw that is one of the
solutions being proposed it's not that
politically loved of solution some
people think you should raise the fifty
cents console the arrest wish it's the
word of the 286 billion gets divided
among all of the states with depending
on how much money they put into it now
much gas actually collected and they get
to spend it out of over 100 different
programs that exist in the federal
transportation bill some of them are big
pop up the service transportation
program which in theory was created so
that you could spend it on any kind of
service chance terrian faculty facility
spent all right and a little bit on bike
77th other ones are specifically for
senior permeability and these for
seniors to see so there's all the
logical
policy
one of the things that we're proposing
is back to set up 100 programs you need
to 12 you need to pick your top
priorities and you really have to focus
in on seniors and disabled green frame
kind of get things around without
destroying them how do we make sure that
were having the fixing what we have pool
money so for me tables where you have
pocket says we really need really need
to heavily invest in transit so there's
a lot more so that it doesn't it so we
think that this is not justify this guy
the other act organizations and elected
officials across the country that are
further mobilizing around team
transportation to me the questions how
much what about air transit we need a
modernization of their traffic control
and the airlines are not going to go
greatly improved efficiency yes not lose
them that all of the air policies come
out of another piece of legislation this
one and this campaign specifically focus
on service transportation the air
control though is very interesting
question them and has more to do with
the solvency of the airline industry's
than anything else there's a lot of
people who think that the airline
industry's anything that's under a
couple hundred miles is going to stop
being from a part isn't profitable
anymore going to do short haul place and
so in a lot of parts of the country
especially in the middle of the country
the airlines are not doing the short
flights between you know major cities in
long time and so you have to go out of
state come back into state to get
between the major cities and so all of a
sudden there is this really clear and a
lot of people's minds about how they're
going to get around and one of the
things one of the ways but I think the
major rail investment is important is
because won't have a short haul flight
projects and we need to make sure
so I the left side you'll see a road
networks and how we choose that the
right hand side you know so comparisons
of Roma public transportation network so
if I have rows or you know we have plus
de pages making roads they all intersect
we don't know how last well it lots of
different routes by lots of its
transportation agencies several
different places those things are the
same roads going everywhere
transportation oxygen are rich
like if i want to go over a creek which
is really a ditch or what the Palo Alto
I have to switch bubbles right because
there's some arbitrary limit public
transportation jurisdictions if I have
my map it shows all the roads as a
matter who provides the rose whether
it's federal government of the state or
local County if I could have a clip of
presentation so I get to point out that
this is maintained by you know vta I
want to go talk to find out more
countries they make up tell me where
into the intersection but they don't
show me that round and say now I want to
go to an interchange 13 another
intersection easy but you have little
presentation to have to get off the
vehicle and have wait for the next one
shows up you know go on grant I'm
information as I track whenever I google
how it's available why think and to
Google Transit another
it's park aeri hard fight our
transportation world and the book lists
we don't have your question where you
have to go so the next slide so there's
a lot of hours here I think that an easy
and cheap solution Royals to deal with
the information sighs yeah I called a
good public presentation into the
information age and the key insight for
the point transportation agencies
they're not a Catholic since identity
well they are but they also have my
information it's just as important so
why can't I go and you find the API or
Los Angeles MTA and go download their
information so i can go make my own can
you know handcrafted schedule or put it
on my back what I say or do this as well
what's the continual cost for this well
I should be negative because you know
they first of all there's almost no cost
or keep running decisions but people
will be able to use your system and
actually will improve productivity the
real-time information slightly more
expensive but I'm shocked the club
technicians don't know where their buses
are or where their trains arm it's a
security issue so now if a doesn't know
the pizza and you call them up a little
and so you know we've had this
technology exists on shelf customer
and then it's going to say but if we
know we know where they're going or they
stopping were not stopping it was
written during class information yes
please I'm more concerned about how the
money is I'm sorry because I'm more
concerned about how the money has gotten
rather than that how the money spent so
what can the government do to get more
private investments or or even like
private donations towards something like
this rather than using tax dollars
that's a great question and that's
something we can pack in looking at a
lot there's a special about something
called value capture put it in a row the
personal putting in a transit stuff you
look at how much the proper got is gone
and can you capture that value as an
investment back into the infrastructure
system so that the private landowners in
fact are to get that route there have to
invest back into it there's a lot of
interest in this idea when the trolley
lines first started going out from city
center it was the developers would have
paid for it to go out to a certain place
and so from looking at how do you in
Beck even allow that to happen because
right now when you have a trance
we're a local government has to provide
a match but half of the cost cast
comfortable community or from the state
none of it is allowed to come from a
private investor and so even by making
that an allowable inclusion of the match
cost we could start really changing that
equation and there are a lot of
developers who started working with us
because they see that the future really
for the next 50 years of development is
going to be downtown in towson or
compact close to their communities
because that's different demographics
ergo that's where people are going to
see the pendulum swinging all the way
back and they're following months in
their financial interest and they want
to be allowed to invest in the
transportation system or to bring it to
where they are at or bring it back
downtown which is a great question the
other part of it is that right now the
money for highways and transit are
different but they have how I chose fun
and a transit test fun and we propose
the therapy
so that you can look at one pot of money
and saying what is the best use of this
ruse I should I would like to go back to
this thing Jeffrey just put up so the
particular crossers fairly low to go do
this one is we can wait for the
government and working equality the
policy side of it why can't we just
using like became a research why can't
we definitely knows what when I talked
with Google carotene when they first
started working and I get two answers
what is first of all they were not used
to making their information available to
others they just didn't know how to do
it and the second one was some agencies
did not want to release their
information because somebody might
misuse that information so i can go
attack a bus upon you exactly awesome
it's not clear how you would misuse this
information it could be misleading that
you released the information somebody
could publish a schedule that was off by
humanity problems but they didn't
understand that with information the
more people who have it the more
valuable in these moments because I mean
so it seems like so there are
organizations of dudes like that I was
looking several stories next immunity
and they serve so contracts next meeting
it but gps
my son bust we travel around yeah so
we've done a free version less than any
agency that wants to force kind of use
us and we'll just ride your buses for
that it's actually I mean they may not
know so there's two questions where one
is a policy question of I'm scared of it
may better know how to use in what we
would use it for the second one is a
technically it's a technology question
right it seems like the technology side
we can answer you for google i/o going
to do it I don't know put the policy
question of second i'm just wondering
which one is the harder one agencies and
the other problem right now is the
transit agencies are cutting service and
cutting jobs because they don't even
have enough money for gas into buses
that they do have and so that to think
about something like this rating is the
fact a great idea and would make a huge
a huge difference i think from a lot of
different perspectives to do something
like that for most places and use be
honest open the way that there can be me
about things but from a policy
standpoint a lot of places are starting
to realize that they need to be out
there in front of people in front of
their community in a more tangible and
easier accept more accessible way to
four people genius I'm sorry I think
it's good I mean you miss arguments one
last time would it be possible to play
is it illegal or is it there's a break
any rules if we let's say you know I I
heard about this like our campus have
nature system called dash which basic
tracks your cars at once running through
that can build real time traffic
like we build Android devices i do that
and like you know you just come in your
gps data to mobilize aqui aqui na be on
time we talked all those more about
traffic controls anybody dash went out
of business the tomtom visit because
they have all these GPS devices around
which apparently upload information to
build your headquarters they will tell
you the speed on the highway you want to
know what's better than Cal print yeah
I'll give you an example of it I've been
going to the Caliphate shortly so first
of all they don't know where their
trains are and they go out and seek
proposals regularly to go figure out how
we make real-time information available
and they get these figures back
million-dollar we will have the money to
go through this so basically what
happened what happened is there is a
Twitter excite you know if people are
airing this information yet and it's all
free right that's it took when I saw it
last week there's an accident if there's
all these Twitter things right like
train delayed graduate school it took
you know what an hour to set up and they
don't they don't understand I think one
of the people of these systems have been
there for a time and it's just not
it's both policy and
so yeah so I said it's both policy and
pending issues so for the funding issue
actually the work 107 God's transit
agencies the United States and provide
fixed route services and a lot of them
are running with only half a person or
portable precision maintain the
schedules so for them to provide a day
specification which is a very simple
attacks based spat that's open they
don't have dedicated resources to do
that and that sober just agency that
helped to twenty something plus agencies
in Virginia's state to provide that data
people and California is doing similar
things for working with Caltrans to do
that but overall the bottom line is the
agencies they have funding and then oh
and also like technical resource
from all that occur so can I help them
to be that good reading we interact that
ties to the policy issue is that if
there's a policy
you need to make that information
available for the Internet age like the
PDF format for your for your schedule
doesn't cut it we need to provide that
in a some more of a crawlable RSS taco
feeding doesn't necessarily have to
but right now is with Sony agency Dudley
becomes a standard so so I think these
two links are intertwined and then was a
large agencies they are more worried
about how much when revenues they will
lead from their own trip planners by
providing David that's an interesting
addition yeah okay you know I think one
of the things that you fascinating to me
out of this discussion is in fact we're
working on the legislative language of
the translation we are proposing call ha
nu pieces new language and if there is a
really simple way to a data collection
side that we would need to add language
to make this easier and more automatic
and you have ideas about that i would
love to follow up with you about that to
make sure that you know the next
transportation bill passes and all of a
sudden it's really easy to do what
you're talking about because it's open
all of these doors and there's some very
specific very simple language of it
requires this kind of this kind of data
sharing
so getting away from public transit one
of the things that have attributed to
the formation of the interstate highway
system was the demise of passenger rail
and you can spend 500 billion dollars
all you want it's not going to
revitalize passenger rail unless there's
some change to the structure so the
wheel costs are reflected for both
driving and for the rail ground there in
chance of something like that happening
that's a really good question giving us
gas cards right I mean part of the
problems the gas right it doesn't
actually reflect any increase in cost it
doesn't reflect the true cross to drive
in road to maintain it to Lucien from it
I mean there's a whole bunch of things
that aren't included I don't think
that's what you but what has changed is
public opinion people all over the place
in small towns that never thought about
this before
all different generations I really say
that they want to get around another way
and so it's really about meeting the
demand is already out there in a lot of
places just to do that is the enormous
mentor and then to go to the next step
farther will be will take even more
thought about the things of your topic
but it but to reflect that you posted
something happen reports there's a lot
of interest in a vehicle miles traveled
tax and this comes back to that privacy
of information tomtom knowing where
everybody's guy I mean they try this out
and work Washington and they did a pilot
to see if they could you know they put
the gps and interviews card you can
provide the private information but they
knew how many miles each person drop
drove within the state and because of
privacy issues it's not going to happen
on fun at least not now but that's what
a gas taxes would be pretty good at
along not with 306 if we start
increasing our cafe standards and more
people start buying Priuses you're
reducing the amount that people are
consuming gas but they're still using
the roads and bridges so they're still
incurring the cost of the wear and tear
on growth so unless we move over
something like a vehicle miles traveled
time then our course can get a hundred
percent efficient but we're not covering
for possible
searchers 02 distribution of your miles
per gallon sorry if it shifts forward
right for the important distribution
doesn't change that show forth then the
political mechanism has to be to
increase the average cost per gallon as
that you know as the date they average
in bg's wonderful yes so it's not a
technical problem have to move to an end
our issue and deal with the privacy
problem what you do you just have to the
easier solution is to get the political
will to go move that forward because the
political will move it in love then
marketing is actually marketing I'm not
sure what your blessing that the
political will to increase the gas tax
by fifty percent I don't think is any
better than the villain LOL to create a
vehicle miles traveled with tax there's
a back a lot of interest in starting to
collect the data or put systems in place
that may eventually go to be on the last
travel text then I think we'll start
taking but I don't think we're going to
one thing to remember that doing it is
pretty regressive and so it really hits
the lower middle class most of those
kind of people there are many ways solve
Shepherds too many of our laws inflate
the knowing of the poor people can't
afford that to reduce all these
complexities into our God when we should
address the poverty not all of the money
but I want to do something else it was
the train it was was not true that the
imploding of the passenger chain what as
a result caused highway system and it
was in fact the reverse it was the
increase in the highway system to myself
maybe in second day the second angel in
common with the effectiveness of the
highway system that destroyed the
passenger right it was the wealth
effectiveness artificially low price as
a purchase of the rack systems a lot of
builders purchased the problems
that's a little different artistic who
burn through a casa de passenger rail
but there are a couple of interesting
things that come about that before
Amtrak and to the care of the passenger
rail the the trains were named and were
required to give passenger train
priority on the rails and they were
required to maintain morale that's your
grade so you could reasonably pay
passenger rail at that reasonable speed
but since things got transferred Amtrak
I'm not sure the laws changer
enforcement but now you get situations
where an tracker and arrange for an hour
or two while almost the freight train
went through and that would never happen
in 92 right it's interesting that is
going to coalition that we're working
with one rail that is not the first time
for freight and passenger rail folks are
sitting at the same table together to
figure out what they want out of the
transportation it's been that bad enough
that they haven't about what they want
when in theory their interests are very
much sharing in terms of the future fate
of any kind of bread and so we're
working with a longing to try to
you know what's the anchormen now that
we need to start changing to really
create a long-term passenger and freight
rail will wrap up for us so I want to
think about non-human now actually don't
know even basic facts like what fraction
of total transportation kilometers is
for humans
humans or if you measure output animals
into the document i think it may be
large I don't know if we measured it not
in terms of just a full number of trucks
but sort of value I don't know how it
breaks down either what up people versus
non people what what are our ratios
this is crazy awesome prizes some of our
funding agencies up garbled when they
ran out of money off of women's all
doing some people who spend twenty
dollars if you offer to come out measure
affects a passenger miles measured
something you could get this in all this
problems about preventable san francisco
history they thought people get some
funny seducing some measure absolutely
and in fact a profit-making company you
showed google that they were going to
make top 20 million dollars by cost or
something for change okay hey boys are
actually much cheaper and that's about
what you want to do there's a couple of
different grant programs that are
competitive you're not going to just
give away money we're going to say
you're going to compete for this amount
of money to be able to do something
really innovative Frey's wedding can get
that national recognition is incredibly
what happened jack yeah i think that
whole measurable results tough it never
happened in the transportation bill we
imagine a lot
members on the roadside of a job
congestion numbers with very little
a lot of
and I don't even that's
people like
each subject
I think so
if you do
real its journey
your
so what are in terms of air-cool other
where its buses
Britain
the
and then the argument will be
a long time
then I'm wondering if there's a skill to
say how about we put all the public
transportation with interactivity
there is a there's a baby that's where
we will talk and just like we provide a
free Iraq
to all the mountain residents maybe
we'll start providing data to the buses
and again
people get on the bus
because they are we targeting were
delivered solutions are given to the
holidays and we want to attract I think
so yeah so those are those
and also for Virginia Department
transportation so
project
dynamically the prices so when you're
driving and then the bargain lanes would
have to try to depend on contested
adjustable length
so that if you really are
dollars to use a row and then that price
change has swype events you know
projects like those will be wish I
thought our government encouraged that
as I have a competition and
that congestion pricing is happening all
over the world and is going to be
probably in New York or anywhere else
last year and it's a great idea it's
going to happen the rail is interesting
when it's actually a full railcar it's
just as efficient as anything else but
it only works in places where you have
as community it doesn't work in rural
areas of small towns not nearly as much
the guy who is the Secretary of
Transportation Louisiana morale is set
to settle and you're from louisiana
stricter and face you want to have
brandy Annika's it's such a great
exciting idea Louise IAM isn't ready for
buses between the towns and cities it's
more cost effective we can we can get
people in place to place and you can
start building your towels in a way that
will get us towards residential between
month area so i think that looking at
all these pieces together really key
there's the added challenge to that is
that developers don't follow bus
stations the way they do throughout the
station so you're looking at really
value for these investments they haven't
figured out that station them soon I
mean it just does have the same impact
as if you move away and so that had a
investment a train station even a light
rail station is a huge amount of
leverage peppermint value a lot of
people are talking about bus rapid
transit now
as a fixed guideway train its Boston not
as big of an investment as a train I'm
going to see what I have two more subtle
one
you're going
buzz premise
and certainly
Oh
does that mean
so here's my client requests that you
guys figure out how Google can play I
mean you have some of them as innovative
ideas on how to start college if
somebody calls then I heard really of a
long time and it does make a lot of you
can add a pc but i do like any on pc and
marketing people about what are the
great ideas of what we leave so i think
talking with each other about the
solution and what can you do what can
google specifically do to help create
some of these solutions we're working
with people all over the country for
book operators and the users and all the
other parts of the system on the growth
of trainings on bypass on walkways and
we can start trying things out to you
I'd also love to see Google come to the
table in this work with us on California
is the fact a huge part of the problem
and solution on transportation if a huge
number of senators opportunity two of
those but members of Congress who are
key to the solution on the
transportation and having you each talk
to your friends and talk to your family
and talk to your members of Congress and
people to talk to their members
about this is in fact really important
as part of your suit because people just
down here you go to bc and it's like
they're in this little of it you don't
really hear what the rest of the country
needs and you need to make those voices
a lot and so how to get those voices to
the table I'd love to work with you on
how to come up with more of the
solutions I really love to work with me
on and you really continue to bridge
this out and connect up people in this
new information age so that's it you
know I'm here for a little while I'm
happy to take any other questions but to
be able to know me
for now you're driving and I thank you
very much for your time today
