we'll start late that will begin here to
introduce a professor Tarun Khanna from
Harvard Business School who specializes
in business strategy international
business strategy and specifically has
been focused on emerging markets for the
past several years he has a
undergraduate degree in engineering from
Princeton University and his doctorate
from Harvard in addition I found out
this morning that Professor Khanna has
been investing in and it's kind of a
nice clearinghouse for new in new
ventures in India and around the idea of
or around Indian nonprofits so I'm not
going to give too big of an introduction
because I think professor Khanna can
introduce himself fill the rest in and
as well as talk a bit about his book and
I think that he would like to have this
as a discussion today so he has some
slides to show you and we'll start with
that I have about an hour
thanks for thanks for coming out it's
nice - nice to be here oh it's so much
about Google and never had a chance to
actually take the time to come so it's
nice to my stretch should be here for a
few hours and thank you to Alicia for
putting it together you know I'm autumn
Utley interested in economic development
mostly in the developing countries
around the world unsurprisingly poor
countries around the world through the
private sector and so I spend I split my
time about 1/3 as a card-carrying
academic sitting in small tiny rooms and
scribbling away with mathematics and
numbers and things exactly what you
think a point he had an academic would
do and then the rest of the two-thirds
I'm very much out and about starting
companies they started a number of
companies mostly in India and Southeast
Asia some have a China footprint and a
couple of nonprofits also in India
trying to spread some good ideas so this
is the perfect kind of group of people
to talk to and I would like to to hear
what you have to say as much as my
talking all the time so what I thought
I'd do is I brought some slides there
about 20 slides I don't need to go
through more than three or four of them
maybe so maybe I'll start by putting up
some ideas and some examples and this is
really a distillation of about depending
on how one counts 10 to 15 years of
walking the streets of developing
countries it's focused on China and
India and interacting with with
entrepreneurs and government officials
in a range of industries so this is not
necessarily the new economy at all
though I think a number the principles
that apply across the board and it free
rides on you know 15 years of my
students at Harvard who now are involved
in various facets of life in China and
India and different in different
capacities anyone recognize this yes
yeah this is this lien from Slumdog
Millionaire I thought that would be the
perfect way to start because I think it
encapsulates all the themes that I want
to talk about so in fact I don't need to
put any more slides I can just talk off
this one you know it's uh it's it's a
little bit of a rags to riches kind of
feel-good type of story where a kid from
the slums
it doesn't quite get to riches but gets
to find a way out of
poverty by exploiting his own human
capital that's the story that's told I
think a little less well in the movie
then in the actual book for those of you
who are readers you find the book
actually quite interesting and you know
this is a also shot in the movie it's a
very for those of you how many of you've
seen this movie okay it's that dirty
part of the movie right at the beginning
so I won't go into describing the
details those of you who haven't you
should check it out check out the movie
but this is the actual slum Dharavi in
Bombay which is sort of the the
inspiration for it and the amazing thing
about therapy in addition to just being
a large slum is that as you can see it's
it's a ramshackle kind of place but it
actually is a very vibrant ecosystem
there's a lot of entrepreneurship within
it is a very dense pattern of
information exchange they are now very
well established stores that take people
through therapy and everything that I'm
saying about our we could be true in any
one of Asia slums at this point I think
I don't think that any extraordinary but
this particular one is just the one
that's been focal point of attention and
there are you know so one thing one
thing one thing that sort of worth
puzzling over is you know why in a dense
urban space does something like this
even exist why is it that you know
countries that are reasonably fast
growing at this point cannot do
something about the slums right or to
ask the question a slightly different
way since I think the purpose of my book
was to exploit the variation if you will
between the Chinese circumstance in the
Indian circumstance and to and to put
forth the point of view that in some
sense these two societies have evolved
in such divergent directions in some
sense of whatever China has been able to
do very well India is almost
congenitally incapable of doing and vice
versa is the strong point that I would
put forward so you would never see a
slum like this in an urban urban center
in China it would be removed very
quickly with some good features so that
removal and some bad features to it and
the opposite would be true in India or
to make it to even personalize it more
the the southern tip of Bombay which is
where I grew up
is home to some fabulously wealthy
people even by world standards in some
skyscrapers baseball corporate for those
of you who are familiar with mom
but at the bottom there is a fishing
village that's incredibly dirty and that
fishing village kind of looks like this
a little bit nicer than this but not
much and so you have to sort of wonder
you know how can you have such extreme
concentrations of wealth and extreme
depravity cheek-by-jowl next to each
other why does that persist in India but
is not allowed to persist in China and I
think it has to go it goes to the very
heart of what one means by what one
thinks of as property rights or even the
rights of individuals and one way that I
like to encapsulate it and say it for
for an audience that but I think
appreciate some degree of abstraction
would be to say that the very notion of
rights is is that societies come to
terms with public interests and private
rights in very different ways and for a
variety of reasons China and India have
wrestled with this trade-off
fundamentally differently so in China
whenever you have a conflict between
public interests and an individual's
rights society will tend to adjudicate
in the favor of public interest in India
it's the opposite whenever there's a
tension between public interest and an
individual's rights
India is congenitally geared both in the
laws and in the public processes to
favor individual rights now often that's
to the detriment of India sometimes what
happens in China is I believe to the
long-run detriment of China and
sometimes if they're poles so to
personalize that in this situation you
know that private rights of these
individuals are allegedly to some extent
I think the large extent being protected
by not bulldozing the slum away right
it's not in their private interest to
move them away because all the people
who live here are migrants from the
villages who've come to the city over
time and they are engaged in frankly
productive enterprise that benefits them
and benefits around them now stepping
back you would say that maybe Bombay
would be better off if we bulldoze this
and created some nicer space and some
more efficient infrastructure than even
this and this is provided de-facto but
the private rights of the individuals
have been protected or in the fishing
village that exists in the south of
Bombay cheek-by-jowl with some
fabulously expensive real estate it's in
my interest in my family's interest as a
resident of the skyscraper is to move
the fishing with it away because it's
kind of unsightly it's not nice to let
out a window and see the fish on the
street but it's not in the interest
of the fishermen who have been living
there for in some cases 150 200 years
for them to be moved away from there and
the Indian Court system comes in kicks
in to protect the rights of those
fishermen and saying that any time a
rich guy like my family tries to get
them moved away either by bribing them
away or by getting a political process
involved and my family has been wronged
very much along with other families and
rich areas trying over the last decades
to say maybe we should move these guys
out but but the Indian system kicks in
to say that know the rights of the
individuals in there are sacrosanct and
so we cannot do that even if you say
that there is some broader purpose in
mind now I absolutely think this has
serious cost from the Indian economy and
the one-line summary as to why India you
know cannot build cities overnight the
way the Chinese can is is exactly
encapsulated in these particular
examples and even at the court system
which itself is notoriously inefficient
in India fails the court of public
opinion would step in to say that no you
can't do this so the public the media
will kick in and say that this is not an
appropriate use of power by the elites
against the masses and China is just the
opposite you know lots of great examples
of this on a day to day basis
now obviously I'm caricaturing and
painting the situation much more extreme
because there are situations where
infrastructure gets built in India and
there are situations with the rights of
individuals are protected either by by
public processes or by public opinion in
China but by and large the central
tendency of what I'm saying I think I
stand by so one way to say it now come
back to this is is when you think about
property rights which is a cornerstone
in some sense of how we think about
economic activity happening
China will air in the direction of
public interests whenever there's a
conflict in public interest in private
rights and India were there at the
direction of private rights there is a
similar conundrum with information right
and to communicate that I'm going to
show you this graph which is a little
bit it requires a little bit of
explanation it's created by a friend of
mine who is a professor at in Singapore
now but at NYU before that it's it's a
graph that shows on any given day what
percentage of stock prices on the
exchange that country move together
so the u.s. is at the bottom and China
is near the top what this says is that
on any given day in the u.s. about half
the stock prices move up and half move
down on average in China either
everything goes up or everything goes
down and India sort of in between so
think about that what that means is that
in China there's really no way to look
at the stock price and from the stock
price to conclude anything specific to
that particular company so we cannot
look at Google stock price and say that
Google is good or bad because Google's
price is moving along with the entire
economy and likewise for any particular
equity that's traded on it on a Chinese
stock exchange in the US firm specific
activity or the particular decisions and
actions of managers teams of people like
yourself matter a great deal for the
fortunes of the company and that at the
end of the day is what a market is meant
to do it's meant to take resources and
direct them towards towards better
manage companies yeah good yeah it still
holds yeah it's been replicated many
times by different people the one-line
summary is that when you don't have that
much that much when the markets are not
set up to extract credible information
about the actions of individual
entrepreneurs or teams of people it
ceases to be a conduit to allocate
capital human capital and financial
capital towards better uses of that
capital right so the market isn't
working
but the bigger point that I'm trying to
make is about information you know how
does information actually get
transmitted in societies is a
fundamental construct of how societies
work right and in China where as the you
know it there's a little bit of a glass
half-full and glass half-empty situation
here which is certainly in pockets of
China whether it's industry pockets or
urban pockets or you know eastern
seaboard southern part of China etc
information dissemination is much more
rampant partly as a result of technology
companies now than it was five years ago
or ten years ago but it's still a very
far cry there lots of things that are
undiscussables
and the way the equity markets have been
set up is it's very hard to discern
information about particular companies
from from this yeah sorry janitor
yeah the question is if I if I heard it
correctly is it that information
dissemination is reasonably similar in
Poland which is the thing on top and
China no what I would say is that the
extent of firm-specific information
that's encapsulated in the stock price
is similar on average in other words you
can learn as little about the median
polish company as you can about the
median Chinese company from looking at
the stock prices in a day to day but on
average that that inference would be
technically accurate but how we got to
that it doesn't say anything about it
right it's simply a summary statistic
that's being presented up there I'll
give you another example sort of a
personal personal personal story there's
an amazing lady in Beijing and in who
surely turns out to be from a
politically connected family which is
part of the story at the end of the day
but she started something called sizing
which is a which is a wonderful
wonderful website that anybody
interested in China should and you know
the nice thing about sizing is that the
the the Mandarin the Pathan guar website
actually has the same information as the
English website right in other words
there's nothing is lost in translation
but you can actually go to the website
and check out economic news and they
have been in the in the business of
really in effect ferreting out economic
issues and economic corruption
investigative journalism of a sort that
didn't exist in China even five seven
years ago but you can go to sizing and
get all sorts of stuff and so when I sit
across and discuss with her you know how
do you think about your job she says
well you know my job is really to is to
be very much on the forefront of digging
out issues that have historically not
been available for the Chinese public to
consume about economic activity but to
be very much in the forefront but not
too far in the forefront because if I
exceed certain limits then exactly the
same thing will happen to me and my team
of people that has happened to numerous
newspapers and periodicals in China that
have that have pushed the envelope
beyond what it is okay to push within
the constraints political constraints in
that society in other words your paper
will be shut down
right so her core skill is not
journalism per se which is amply
available to well
journalists anywhere such a hook or
skill is in identifying how far that
boundary of tolerances on different
issues right but the very fact that she
exists is a huge change from ten years
ago and she would not have been allowed
to exist
so in some sense things have moved a
fair degree but but but not as far as
they have moved in other parts of the
world certainly not as far as they they
would be in this country in terms of
free free dissemination of information
or to put in a different way yeah I've
been in in in the in the interesting and
fortunate situation of being on a stage
with you know I don't know what a good
example would be with the Deputy Prime
Minister of India debating and
criticizing him in public with thousands
of people standing in front of me
whereas any attempt for me to debate a
public official in China which I have
tried to do has been immediately shut
down physically often by my being
escorted away by my well-wisher saying
this is not in your interest to engage
in this debate right so these are little
vignettes that communicate that there is
a limit to what's allowed now so I want
to encapsulate this in in in a simple
principle also which is that so I'm
thinking of sort of fundamental
constructs that affect the daily the the
daily lives of all sorts of people right
do you think about property rights in
the one hand and you think about
information on the other I would say
that information in China I would
summarize as being noise free but biased
what I mean by that what I mean is that
if you have a point if you have an issue
or a point of view on which different
people have different opinions right the
opinions that you would see expressed in
China on contentious issues will be a
relatively narrower band in other words
noise free there's less variance about
that view but it may not be the whole
story in that sense it's biased away
from some sort of the truth sounds like
a philosophical concept but it's biased
away from the true that
what would actually be the right
representation of that issue and India
you'd have the opposite every point of
view would be represented and you'd see
crazy amounts of chaos and noise but it
would not be systematically biased away
from the truth in some ways so it'd be
up to you to figure it out and it'd be
much messier process it would not be a
biased representation so these two
principles for me kind of about property
rights and information kind of
summarized a lot of what happens in in
in India and can be applied in a variety
of different ways let me pause for a
second anybody want to comment or or
take issue with any of it or or suggest
an alternative interpretation of what
happens feel free to speak up yeah
yep
yeah yeah yeah so remember this is this
is a particular kind of information
about what's represented in stock prices
and you know one shouldn't conclude so
one should include that this is a
representation of all sorts of discourse
in society by any stretch of the
imagination its particular kind of
information I'm trying to use different
examples to so in China if you combine
this with the political story that I'm
telling you with some other stories you
might get some come closer to getting a
feeling for what constitutes reasonable
information exchange in a society now
even in China you know the reality is
much more subtle the reality is that
there are alternative ways in which you
get the information so in the old days
they used to be particular brochures
that the party would put out that were
only accessible to party officials
that's not true anymore you can get
access to that in a variety of different
ways so there are back channels to which
the information is disseminating these
days you know from the web and from
devices and all sorts of techy things
you can get access to information that
you couldn't before so it's a lot more
subtle and nuanced that I'm presenting
it but I'm making a caricature to make a
point yeah Jennifer
yeah so so it turns out that that that
particular issue doesn't matter as much
in in the summary view that I'm
representing and that's you know
adequately explored and in a lot of
googly gook in these papers but we don't
ready to go into it technically correct
but the central point that I'm saying
isn't really isn't really at issue in
that particular thing anyone guess what
this is
sorry it's a voting machine yeah it's
it's basically preparation for the
elections that are going to roll out in
the next month or so because election
season is coming by in India so you know
people often say that India is is one of
the nice things about India's that is a
great democracy and I think certainly
one of the nice things were India is
there's a huge spectacle around the
democracy because you have you know 500
million people I don't know what the
actual number is but a large number of
millions of people coming out to vote
it's an enormous logistical exercise the
Indian Army and the Indian Navy or an
Indian Air Force are involved in getting
the vote out to different people it's
largely free and fair and that's the
good side of it
the bad side of it is that it's a little
bit of a corrupted process I think what
I mean but it's a little bit of
corrupted process in the sense that the
rich have abdicated from the democratic
process in other words we think about
the situation in this country in the
u.s. it's the economically deprived the
social economically disenfranchised that
tend not to vote and we spend a lot of
time NGOs in this country Washington
politicians spend a lot of times trying
to say that let's make sure that the
views of these different communities are
represented in this election but nobody
ever worries about educated people
voting people tend to vote in India it's
the socio-economic lis privilege that
tend not to vote if anything and it's a
poor guy on the street to make sure that
he or she votes because that is the
ultimate weapon that they have to kick
the kick the unperformed politicians out
and there's a culture that's built up
over several decades so in that sense
it's an opposite and I think that's a
very bad feature of any democracy right
which is that people who have the most
to give or much to give to the political
process have tended to stay out and one
of the nice things is happening in India
is that for the first time
I think in my lifetime anyway people who
have had successful careers in different
walks of life voluntarily entering the
Indian political process to try to
improve the quality of governance to
reduce the corruption to make the to
make the government more answerable to
the masses but that is a change it's
just happening now so that's the bad
side of any democracy and the reason
that some pernicious things persist over
time right so so you know another way to
say this is that people who are actually
representing some of the poor guys in
Parliament aren't necessarily
representing their actual interests
they're engaging more in patronage
politics they are engaging in the short
term needs fulfillment of a particular
demographic group or a particular caste
or a particular region but they're not
really interested in building the public
goods that are needed to bring them to
the next level and even over here are
the extent to which there is there is
good development happening it's
happening through the private sector
putting pressure on the government to do
more stuff all through an expanded
notion of the private sector civil
society and being very active and people
from the private sector going into civil
society would then force the government
to do good things
China again is a contrast China one
interesting statistic that I often focus
on is membership in in in the Communist
Party which of course these days is not
communist in anything but but name not
the traditional sense but membership in
the Communist Party anyone have any idea
how many members there are the Communist
Party of China - it
there are 1.3 billion people in China
1.3 billion people in China the
population of China roughly give or take
give or take 100 million here there any
ideas with the membership of the
Commerce for a tournament how many 15 50
million last I checked it's about 83 85
million people and but what's more
interesting about that it's hard to
interpret that number without having a
benchmark so let me give you a time
series benchmark time series benchmark
is that if you had a graph which I
enforce you don't have of time and
membership it would basically go at a
few hundred thousand for a number of
years then a million then if
then we go to five million seven ten
fourteen million for a number of years
and then in the last I would say less
than ten years it's gone from fourteen
million to 80 85 million 90 million
sometimes they showed us 70 million so
you have to ask why do the membership
can go like that right someone's like an
internet startup going up to going up to
80 or 90 million and the answer is that
part of it is a nice answer and part of
it in my view is not such a nice oh and
so the nice answer is that good human
capital does find it useful to be
affiliated with the party not for any
ideological reason it's just one of the
ways to get ahead one of the ways to be
in the flow of things that that that
need to be done a lot of my students
from Harvard Business School are members
of the party they don't always advertise
it but that's that's one of their
affiliations their party affiliation and
so a good human capital like in the
Indian situation where good human
capital is not going into the state and
therefore the state is not functioning
very well in the long run good human
capital is somehow going into into into
the state apparatus and generally trying
to operate in a meritocratic fashion
within the confines of the party the bad
news of course is that there's no way to
engage of the state unless you agree to
do it through the party so there's no
room for completely alternative points
of view as will frequently spill out
into the streets and protest and so on
and so forth right so it's a good
news/bad news type of story so you know
stepping back for a second if you think
about the state in the private sector
the state generally works pretty well in
China the state is efficient the state
works well public goods are invested in
my public goods I include Basic
Education I includes roads power plants
telephones things of that nature India's
the opposite the state is a disaster
what works I think much much better in
India in the aggregate is decentralized
private initiative and I don't just mean
big companies going public I mean just
the act of doing exactly the way you
think of it in this country which is
people getting the information that they
need getting the resources that they
need and starting up and doing something
of interest that works much better in
India than in China and the reason it
works better is that ultimately property
rights are better protected and
information is more freely available
which is there are two pieces that you
need to make make things work people
often asked me you know which one do you
which system do you like better
and that's actually an analytically
impossible question to answer if you if
you accept all the pieces that I that I
offer because it's it's it's you know
good things of different sorts and in in
both places my own my own view is that
in the short run by short run I mean 10
years I I would bet on the Chinese
system it's much more efficient much
better organized better human capital
going into it in the long run I would
bet on the Indian system because I
believe in the decentralized initiative
and I think there are limits to top-down
top-down action with the sort deaths so
I anyone want to comment comment on that
or or or object to it or offer a
different characterization yeah sir
yeah that's fair
yeah but I'm it's a very very good very
good very good
correction thank you I didn't mean to
say that there is go and participate in
the sense of not being active and
bribing and financing politicians and so
of course that happens what I mean is
that they don't participate in the way
that one would think in an in a
democratic processes they would there is
a number unquote voter participation of
educated people is very low in India for
instance yeah that's right I'm talking
about proportions which is normalizing
so that if we look at percentage of off
say the upper 10% of the income spectrum
of India and you say what is their
political participation the
participation rates are much lower than
people lower down the income spectrum
that's just this is a descriptive
statistic that's that's both factually
correct but also the opposite of what
you see in the US so the question is how
do we interpret that one retort would be
it doesn't matter because they're so
small the inconsequential
I agree fundamentally with that with
that statement that they're
inconsequential
because of the numbers and a second
retort would be that maybe it doesn't
matter because they participate in
different ways like behind the scenes
and so on
which i think is factually correct and
what what discussing and thinking about
but I also think it's changing a lot you
know I mean for the first time I'm
seeing just looking at my parochial view
of the world which is through my
students and the companies that I that I
work with and so on seeing a number of
people doing what is actually reasonably
common in in this country in America but
has historically not been common in
India which is if I had a room full of
young executives in India and ten years
ago I would ask so there's maybe 40 or
50 people here I would ask for your 50
people how many of you would advise your
kid so these are all Indians in India
how many of you would advise your kids
to go into politics in India zero hands
would go up right it's just not a
respectable thing to advise advise your
kids to go into today if I ask a room of
50 people in Bangalore
and how many of you would advise your
kids to go into politics out of 50 maybe
three or four people would raise their
hands and say it's certainly something
that they could consider in particular
ways
and to me that's an important that's an
important sort of mental change of what
constitutes relevant things for human
capital to be doing in the interest of
society and a nice change of hope for
change sorry you had yep good
yeah is thinking of that yeah yeah I
think you're right yeah yeah that's
right
yes sorry yes so let me let me let me
restate the question
what he's saying is that my statement
that the poor person could use the vote
as a disciplining device on the
political process is is inaccurate
because the poor person actually is not
informed about anything about the
political process actually that is what
I said what I said is that the the
reason they vote is that they
psychologically so upset with the
government that this is very strong
anti-incumbency effect right but the
question is is the anti-incumbency
effect justified or appropriately
corrected you know are you kicking out
the right kinds of Rascals when you kick
them out and you're absolutely right
which is the reason why the whole
process doesn't work is that ultimately
it's patronage politics at the local
level if you ask a poor person in any
part of India your community or mine it
doesn't matter and you say why do you
vote for this person the typical poor
person will say I voted for them because
he gave me a job or he helped my mother
when they were sick or he's you know
he's he's sort of the person who takes
care of things in the immediate
environment it would not be about some
basic long-run thing like the invested
in some public policy action etc right
so you're absolutely right I agree
actually with this with the sentiment
that you expressing go ahead
sure
yeah okay
yeah yeah
yes that's correct you're actually great
that's fine so you'reyou're embellishing
the point that I'm making and I agree
with you I agree with you that at the
end of the day that you know so let me
let me repeat the basic point basic
point is the state and India does not
function so I said they're there when
people talk about in democracy in the
West they tend to portray it as
something nice and romantic and there is
something nice and romantic about five
hundred million people coming out to
vote that's the good news side the bad
news side is a couple of things I think
one is that the people who have a lot to
contribute to the state are
disenfranchised and refused to
participate I'm including people like me
or people like you who are not
participating in in in in that I mean
people like us not literally you heard
me necessarily and the second that the
people who are participating are not
doing it on the basis of accountability
or information and things of that nature
they're doing it for a variety of other
very parochial concerns so when you have
a society and you step back and you say
well where is all the growth that you've
seen in the last 15 20 years coming from
it's coming almost entirely from
decentralized private action
compensating for the inadequacies of a
missmiss managed government in China
it's the opposite it's the sense that
the government has perforce become the
entrepreneur in the sense the government
agents are doing a number of things that
are in the interest of society however
if you if you had genuine private
enterprise in the sense that people
could say what they want do what they
want get the information that they need
have private property rights in the
sense that we interpreted in the West
that sort of thing is not unfolding
there is entrepreneurship in both
countries just unfolding in very
different ways and different and
different different contours and
strictures on it are are in place let me
see what else is we're talking about we
want one kind of way to restate the same
things that I stayed was to ask ask the
following simple question
how many of you familiar with
microfinance lots of people it's been
popularized by mr. Yunus and his Nobel
Prize a few years ago and the basic idea
is that you find ways to make small
loans to people who are outside the
formal financial system and the hope is
they use it to invest
in some productive asset and build a
livelihood for themselves right so the
question I'd like to pose to you is why
is there no microfinance in China China
has poor people just like many other
parts of the world by latest estimates
250 million people 300 million people
are still in poverty in China it's much
better than in India which is 700
million people in poverty but China has
almost no microfinance now the various
ways to respond to the question one is
that I'm wrong there is a lot of
microfinance which is often a response
that I would get and that response would
be incorrect it would be superficially
correct in the sense there are a lot of
microfinance organizations it's just
that none of them ever scale and anytime
that anybody has tried to scale the
government has basically come down and
prevented it from doing so either
explicitly or by promoting things like
rural banking and so on that are within
the government apparatus that are
mentally the same thing but in practice
don't actually do it I think the answer
is that ultimately it points to a
feature of China that is a huge weakness
which is that there is no alternative to
the existing political fabric right and
any agglomeration of interest that is
perceived to be potentially at odds with
the party structure is treated with
enormous suspicion now whether that's an
agglomeration of interest for social
reasons political reasons religious
reasons it doesn't matter if it exceeds
a critical size then it's treated that
as as being inherently suspicious and
therefore to be contained
now think about microfinance is that
it's something that truly can scale the
biggest microfinance companies in the
world have well the biggest of all is
one in Bangladesh because that's one of
the earlier ones it has about eight or
nine million million women who borrow
from it the ones in India are probably
going to be much because of that in just
two or three years because they're
scaling very very fast but they tend to
be millions and millions of people and
in China if you had an NGO or a social
organization or religious organization
they're aggregated to several millions
of people it would be shut down very
quickly I've done the following
experiment just as a way to just
communicate the same idea what if you
went in front of the
what's an equivalent in America in the
front of the Lincoln Memorial let's see
right in Washington DC open space public
public public memorial lots of tourists
lots of lots of American citizens and
you stood in front of the Lincoln
Memorial early in the morning or late in
the evening and he just stood there and
did nothing except look at it for a
while and five people gathered round and
you all stood and looked at it for a
while and then ten people gathered
around look to it for a while do you
think anybody would care nobody would
care if you went and stood in front of
India's Parliament or the Taj Mahal or
something and you stood and did the same
thing no smart nobody would care right
but I did the following experiment just
to see if my intrinsic intuition was
correct I went and stood in front of
Chinaman Square that you know early in
the morning they unfold the flags and
evening they rolled on the flags and so
on early in the morning when it stood in
Tiananmen Square on my own
Indian obviously out of place and just
stood there it took about 15 minutes
before somebody came and said this is
not a good idea for you to be standing
here you know a police police officer
and I repeated it two three years later
I went with a Chinese Chinese Chinese
student who's from Beijing is a local
and we stood there took a little longer
but 20 minutes after 20 minutes of just
standing there doing nothing and looking
at Tiananmen Square
somebody came and said you know why are
you standing here you should not be
standing here you should be moving on
and doing something else right and maybe
I'm maybe I'm over interpreting and you
can you can sort of see this when you
have tons of people's are showing up in
public spaces if you know there is a
degree of suspicion built into the state
apparatus that comes from there's a good
interpretation to it which is it's a
concern with public order and public
stability and making sure that things
are proceeding exactly the way that
people like to see them proceed and
there's a sinister interpretation to it
which is just an intrinsic suspicion of
any organized interest group legitimate
not legitimate doing constructive things
not doing constructive things that the
state has the capacity to contain and I
think the reason that there is
historically no microfinance in China is
that any time you had an opposition that
scaled and they have been some the
have been contained very quickly and
said that no we don't want you to be the
source of economic goodies so to speak
to large numbers of people in rural
China that would in some implicit sense
the interpretation is threatening to the
Gintama see of the state I'm not sure it
would but they interpret it that way now
interestingly this is changing also I
sit on the board of India's biggest
microfinance company which is why I'm
sure where some of these things and what
was really interesting is that about a
year ago
we received this invitation to come and
work with one of the leading leading
they're called government-affiliated
non-government organizations Gong goes
which is kind of a funny name right
their government but they're not
government and that all that that
acronym itself summarizes the intrinsic
tension is that you cannot be an NGO
unless your government affiliated NGO
right so the Congo it's a Gong go so
there's there is a Gong go in on the
eastern seaboard that is you know within
the scheme of legitimacy seen as
reasonably legitimate and so we are
invited we the indian NGO i'm sorry we
the indian microfinance company which i
think will be the biggest in the world
very shortly has been invited by the
Chinese gong go to come and work with
them technical technical issues find a
joint venture it's such a work it out so
I'm hopeful that's at least in some
spaces the the skepticism is is
declining so just like you know sizing
the journalistic outlet exists and
didn't exist 10 years ago maybe some of
the NGOs would be allowed some greater
space over time but that's a that's a
that's that's a recent development and I
think it's really has to do with
suspicion of anything alternative to the
party so the strength of the party the
strength of the government its ability
to continue to attract good human
capital is what allows the state to
deliver incredible public goods delivery
particularly the hard stuff that you see
when you fly into Shanghai or Beijing or
Guangzhou or dolly are any number of
these cities nice highway is better than
the mass spike in my in my in my
backyard in Boston you know electricity
cellphones the whole nine yards and
that's exactly what's missing in India
because the state is bankrupt yeah
is is fiscally bankrupt almost that's an
overstatement but fiscally compromised
and certainly you know professionally
it's not up to snuff at all in
delivering the delivering the goods and
the opposite I think is true for
untrammeled private enterprise and civil
society in India you can absolutely be
an NGO or be engaged in really public
dissent if you don't agree with what's
going on so there's nothing that stops
me from going to the from going to the
cabinet there's a Freedom of Information
Act it allows you to get information on
some pretty unsavory things if you need
to it's sort of a noisier version of the
United States I think it's the way I
think of it whereas the Chinese system
is organized quite differently in a way
that I am not prepared to say it's
better or worse in the aggregate but is
fundamentally different in the way
things things are working out yeah
in India I think we the reason the
reason so you know there are lot of
microfinance organizations in both China
and India in name in China and none of
them have scaled in India maybe one in
Hyderabad SKS microfinance which is the
one that whose board Aman has has Keo
that is scaling very fast you know I
don't think it's any different from from
Google for instance or or any large
company that scales which is just
standard business processes that good
good attitudes towards getting better
people into the organization and
treating it as treating it as a real
business it's a for-profit company its
profit rates are very healthy it has all
the venture capitalists who would invest
in Google are invested in SKS
microfinance which has been a sea change
for microfinance is an industry I should
say that there was an interesting
precedent in Mexico City there is a
institution called Bangkok important
Mo's which went public
Credit Suisse took it public a few years
ago and it I P owed for you know a few
billion dollars which in the Mexican
exchange was one of the biggest stocks
at the time and there was a massive
backlash against it saying that you're
getting rich off the backs of the poor
so there are two points of view in the
microfinance community one is that you
should only be organized as a pure NGO
you should not be making money from poor
people and using it to enrich the
investors and there's a for-profit wing
which says that actually that's the only
way that we can do it in scale because
if we leave it at the level of the NGOs
then it will remain a smallish
organization whereas if we return
sufficient capital to make it attractive
to mainstream investors they will plough
back more Kaplan to it we can invest and
we can reach out in India for instance
the percentage of poor women because all
the loans are going to women in India
for the most part percentage of poor
women who we estimate would be very
sensible recipients for microfinance
loans that we actually reach as an
industry is maybe one or two percent
right so 98 percent is still left enough
to be done
so I think it's pretty conventional
business practices but there is a there
is a vicious debate in public with unis
on one extreme and the founder of the
company that I was talking about or the
founder of the Mexican company on the
other extreme as to whether for-profit
orientations to doing to a company that
ultimately is in the business of social
good is appropriate or not and it's what
it's worth acknowledging that debate and
saying that there are that there are
that there are people who are
ideologically inclined on both ends of
the spectrum I don't think of myself as
a pragmatist I think that this is the
only way that he can get enough money to
roll out from you know in India from 3
million women to 30 million women to 50
million women over time that absent
getting the money from the investor base
and the public markets
ain't gonna happen and so therefore we
should do it here's my thinking if
somebody gets rich in the process that's
fine human capital attraction to give
you a sense I think there's 10 or 15
thousand people who work as sort of feel
force to go out and you know what this
this is a very intense business in the
sense that the way it works is you make
tiny tiny loans to groups of women in
different remote parts and then every
week somebody goes and visits every
single group of women in remote parts of
the world and so the sheer you know sgna
selling in general administrative
expense is a percentage of sales that
this involves an extraordinary right it
was extraordinary and when you think
about rolling out 2 3 4 5 10 million
possible clients each borrowing $200
$300 things like that you're talking
about a field force of 10,000 20,000
50,000 80,000 people who's out there
that's the challenge it's building the
systems to do that having the act having
actually an IT system that captures the
learning from it and then an experiment
that we are trying to run is trying to
figure out this informational asset that
you build up right over time by reaching
all these end consumers in the deepest
parts of the country is there any
sensible monetization of that
informational asset that can accrue to
the benefit off the of the people
borrowing the money as well as to to the
company itself and so that's a tricky
experiment
that's not different from the
experiments that you were engaged in in
a daily basis with the information that
you tap into in just a different space
yeah
this is a Soha given given that
difficulty of the cost structure that I
just articulated how do you get
investors interested at the end of the
day you know investors will only come in
if the returns are extremely high
you know without revealing numbers I
would say that this is probably amongst
the most profitable financial
institutions in the world bar none
including the investment bank seen
before the current meltdown so before
the current meltdown and so if you run
it like a good business and it scales
the unit costs just go down
asymptotically you can actually make a
killing on it and plow the money back
into into expanding expanding reach to
meet remember at the end of the day it's
literally the difference between
professional life and professional
deaths for the poor women I mean these
two examples up here this is a woman
who's borrowed you know two hundred
twenty seven dollars and that's what's
allowed her to put three three of her
children and three of her daughters
through something productive that guy
out there has borrowed thirty dollars to
buy a fishing net to have a life so this
is the difference between professional
life and professional death for all
these people
so what interestingly you know what it's
just like a business right I mean you
have a cost structure and then you want
to make it's a constructor reduces over
time but you also want to be able to go
out and price your product at a rate
that covers your costs and earns you a
decent return on capital so that you can
reinvest in the business and return some
to the to the investors right the price
over here is the interest rate on the
loan that's the price because you're
providing the loan you're pricing at the
interest rate so the interest rates are
going to be higher than the interest
rates that you and I would pay if we
went to the local bank right why because
the cost structure of serving these
people is incredibly high right but the
trick is that you want to get that
interest rate down there alternative is
a local money letter who is charging the
equivalent of an interest rate of five
hundred six hundred percent a you are
because they returned up is either not
to have a livelihood or a borrow from
the money lender and pay five hundred
six hundred thousand percent and the way
that works is you borrow 50 bucks you
have to pay me back 60 bucks next
weekend so that's 20 percent you know
week so annualized rate of interest is
stratospheric right that's how it works
so if we come in or microfinance company
comes in and says we can lend this money
to you we have a high cost structure but
our interest rate is not going to be
five hundred percent it's going to be
seventy percent that's a windfall for
them
that's a windfall now the better
microfinance companies are able to say
okay let's start with 70% but we put
pressure on ourselves as a well-managed
company to say that if we are more and
more efficient over time and in fact we
can we can capture economies of scale we
ought to be able to reduce this interest
rate over time and in fact for the
company that I'm affiliated with our
interest rate now is down to 20% which
is less than what you pay on your credit
card debt here now you think about that
so despite the high cost structure so we
have investment from Sequoia and all the
major VC firms are invested in it
because they see they see oh a customer
base that's 1% penetrated a model that
spreads to Africa or China everywhere
else well managed processes scaling
return of equity higher than in most
Finnish institutions in the world this
is almost a no-brainer actually as it
turns out so that's that's so really
it's a conventional business it's just
in the business of spreading development
and finding a way to finding a way to do
it I'm making it sound easier than it is
I'm the guy who started is very
incredible entrepreneur also but but
that's that's other others are thoughts
or comments you're at the back
yes
yeah
yeah on on occasion on occasion on
occasion they have but we have not much
is what I would say because the benefits
are so palpable the benefits is so
palpable and there is no stronger group
than a group of women who really want it
done then I would not say okay because
they will steamroll anybody where it has
been a problem has been more where
people have used religious have appeared
religious issues as a weapon against it
saying somehow this doesn't conform to
some old practice and then occasionally
this or political turmoil or sometimes
the pollute the politician is the
moneylender and that that becomes a
problem because a local politician is
basically skimming a lot of money off
the top of the loans and doesn't want a
more efficient alternative in so they
will find a way to sabotage it but they
raise around that so we just very
conventional boring ways of keep at it
keep at it keep at it don't pay the
bribe keep going back and eventually it
breaks down so we haven't been stopped
anywhere and so far this you had your
hand up see also other other comments I
make one one sort of lost ones are lost
big observation which is that I think
there's there's money on the table to
optimize between China and India since
is a talk where China and India for the
simple reason that if you start with the
proposition that what's what's good in
China what's what works in China doesn't
work in India and vice-versa if you can
somehow figure out a business system
that that leverages China for strengths
in China and India for the strengths in
India and use it either to serve those
markets or serve any other markets
there's there's dollars on the table in
in the sense that you can optimize a
cost structure to do it in some ways
everybody's doing it Google does a
Google as labs in China has labs in
India as service centers in India etc so
in a sense that everybody's doing it but
there are but there are companies that
are building their entire processes
around these because of the scale of the
opportunity and the scale of the talent
forces that are available both
trees one nice example that I'd like to
use in this part of the world is you
know if you drive around southwest of
this country or increasingly even on the
eastern coast now to the agricultural
communities right not so much in Iowa
and so on when John Deere is still very
strong it has it has its historical
heartland you will see little tractors
that don't look like the conventional
tractors and those little tractors are
made by Mahindra which is an Indian
company and they're very small
horsepower tractors exactly the kinds of
tractors that work in China where the
farm sizes are small and in India with
the farm sizes are even smaller those
are now being designed in I want to say
in in Nasik maybe in some place in
Eastern Europe nossek is a city in
western India and they are made in the
main facility I think is a city that's
halfway between Guangzhou and Shanghai
so they're designing these two places
they're made there and they're shipped
over here and assembled and sold and
they have gone from essentially a zero
zero market share in in the United
States against the most competitive
tractor market in the world with John
Deere International Harvester Kubota
caterpillar everybody's in that market
but from a standing start they've gotten
a share of twenty thirty percent at the
low end segment in no time and that
whole thing is just a simple example of
saying let's let's piece together the
system for building a small low and
efficient tractor by by doing what's
good in China and what doing what's good
in India there's a great ad that they
use I don't know if I brought it let me
see how here is here okay so this is the
minor attractor right and this is an ad
from I think Scottsdale Arizona and and
it shows shows a young attractive lady
you know sometimes used the term hobby
farmer and that's probably a little bit
unfair but this is a tongue-in-cheek
thing saying Dear John I found someone
new and there's a reference to the Dear
John Dear John letters in the wartime
wartime era in this country for those of
you who might remember that but but that
tractor is has a lot of traction in
Houston Sacramento Harrisburg
Pennsylvania
Atlanta Georgia places like that you
would never thought so
so that symbiosis I think is just
starting and I think that's a piece of
what might might might happen in the
years to come and by the way if you look
at world world world that the entire
world is a system what's happening
between China and India there's a lot of
political tension between the countries
and that isn't going away anytime soon
but the economic opportunity can help to
contain that I think is is what one is
hopeful for but also if you look around
the world what you see is that the
pockets of interconnected economic
activity whether it's in Latin America
or the Middle East and the Caucasus or
in China and India and East Asia the
pockets of activities are intensifying
and growing much more than world then
the world as a whole in other words if
you had what's a good statistic the
statistic would be percentage of world
trade that's intra-regional as opposed
to inter-regional right as a fraction of
total world GDP of world trade has been
rising very steadily so you will see
pockets like this moving up over time so
that's that's sort of the that's sort of
the story they're very different
development paths plusses and minuses
opportunity for combination lots of fun
stuff thanks was great to great chitchat
