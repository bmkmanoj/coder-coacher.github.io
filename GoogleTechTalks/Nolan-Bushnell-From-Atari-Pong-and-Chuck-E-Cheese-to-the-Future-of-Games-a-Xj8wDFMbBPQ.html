introduce Nolan to a man who obviously
needs no introduction I've I have had
the pleasure for a number of years in
pre Google contacts of working with
Nolan and I can assure you that whatever
we do here it will be insightful and
something you will take away and
hopefully will be useful as you're
probably aware no one is infamous or
perhaps famous I'm not sure which as the
founder of Atari and the creator of pong
and a number of other interesting things
in the entertainment vein from Chucky
Cheese to a interesting entry into the
gaming industry through managing
Midway's so now Nolan has I'd leave as
encyclopedic a knowledge of the way
games are enjoyed by people throughout
the world as I had the pleasure to meet
as a brief introduction in the Dell
online game industry which I'm sure will
hear a lot more about it's often under
underappreciated in terms of its reach
in the terms of the number of people and
the breadth of the demographics that
play games today online as well as
offline and one recent statistic that's
often cited to make this point is that
there are more consumer hours invested
in online gaming today than in either
Facebook or other social networks
aggregated together or in the playing of
online video so with that
well you know the when I first agreed to
do this with Google it was with the
whole idea that I was gonna Chum the
Google people to come to my restaurant
in Mountain View so you still have to go
to the restaurant Mountain View I just
you have to understand that I thought I
didn't I thought I'd start by talking
about big ideas and one man's process
and there are a lot of things in the
world that are just kind of little ideas
ideas for a little product little thing
you can't really make a company out of
them and so I tried as always look for
company for ideas and things that have
the potential of being global in scale
and massive in size big ego I don't know
I think that the intersection points of
businesses are really really an
important area as well as economic
discontinuities wherever you have a
discontinuity generally if you can get
rid of that discontinuity you can make a
lot of money and I'll explain that a
little more later and then there are
areas where there is universal
dissatisfaction now that's not just you
know people griping that but if if
there's if this griping has been going
on for a long long time like music on
hold after going through a 340 step you
know autodialing sequence you know there
are a lot of things that you can do so
ways around that all of a sudden you've
got a good opportunity and then I always
think that another good way to figure
things out before the time is that
science fiction has it you just have to
read it as potential history
the intersection points of business if
you look at it on plate techtonics
that's where all the earthquakes and the
volcanoes work and so if you can mash
two businesses together and ask yourself
the question what do you do there what's
happening there and so in some ways I
mashed the computer area era with
pinball's
and came out with a video game because I
worked in amusement park when I was in
college understood the pinball machine
business and understood the amusement
game business I was in electrical
engineering so I was with the big ten
million dollar computers and it became
very obvious to me that if you could
play the games that I was playing at the
university at the amusement park they'd
make nothing but money
but then you'd do 25 cents a play into
you know a million dollar computer the
math doesn't work and so one of the
things you've got to understand is I
didn't invent the video game i
commercialized it and I'll show you a
little bit of the history in a few
minutes I've got a company I'm working
on now the mashes movies and video games
together to create a thing called verse
six and I'll talk a little more about
that and of course food and
entertainment chuck-e-cheese and and and
you Inc because historically part of the
human DNA is to have festivals and
banquets and parties and they always
have food and games and fun and so these
restaurants that I've done are basically
a way to have a party on demand and
that's what we're about economic
discontinued discontinuity it turns out
that with casual games there is a market
to buy casual games for 19 bucks when
you say well okay usually if you
decrease the price you get more turns
out that they sell almost the same
number of ten dollars as they do at
twenty dollars
the only problem is they make half as
much money and the same thing with five
dollars and all the way down to two or
three why
it turns out that once you decide to
make a purchase the amount of money
doesn't matter that much you know it's
only in the bias and that most of the
casual game market like 99 downloads for
one purchase that's the way the business
works so that it's a try before you buy
and then you buy so that is a very
discontinuous marketplace and so it
really is a great opportunity for us to
monetize that casual game through ad
sales and that's with me edge neo edge
the other thing about discontinuity is
the whole problem with with credit cards
credit cards on the internet a really a
bad idea in general anytime there is an
authentication and a password I know as
I type it in that I it can be stolen not
having a safe clear and off and deep
trust relationship with my PC really
screws things up now when I take my cell
phone how many times does it ask me for
a a screen name and password user ID and
password never and yet I have a secure
relationship with my cell provider every
time I pick it up make telephone call
there's an economic transaction going on
I'm going to be billed some way for that
call and yet it doesn't ask me for
authentication why because there's
hardware encryption between this cell
this cell phone and my service provider
that doesn't exist in the PC world to
any great extent and anytime that you
can do a password authentication alone
it's soft it doesn't have a private key
and until we can get that fixed the
economic import to the Internet itself
is a small fraction
so solve that problem and the problems
actually been solved in some ways just
hasn't been turned on the TPM which is
that call the trusted the trusted
platform module is on about 90% of the
motherboards have been shipped in the
last three years and that gives you a
absolute security excuse me the secure
secret they can give an absolute
authenticated relationship one on one
and then kids restaurants and and and
the chuck-e-cheese thing that was a
discontinuity that I solved parents had
a little bit of fun in other places but
the kids had the total amount of fun and
in these other ones anyway
Universal dissatisfaction restaurant
service I focused it on you Inc login
password and I talked about new things
to do I'm also designing a new kind of
school new high school it's called the
snap school working title not a great
thing and casual game purchase for
science fiction I still think Snow Crash
is one of the great ones Ender's Game
another one how many of you've tried
anathan thick read guys it's a great
book but I think but it's it's struggle
it's it's like science fiction meets
warned piece anyway but I recommend of
course the old classic stranger in a
strange land has to be done what's oh
yeah that's great thanks and you may not
know this but The Lost fleet series
great books a lot of fighting a lot of
running around space and in automatic
time it's great so what are we doing
here
I think I'll restart later just for fun
okay just for fun let's take the video
game in the early history this is kind
of the chronology notice 1958 I was
still in high school so and pretty dumb
but this is kind of the way it is this
is Willie Higginbotham this is what I
consider to be the beginning of the
video game business it was on an
oscilloscope they actually had relays
charging and discharging capacitors but
it was a game of tennis and you could
play it and it was people thought it was
fun but they didn't think it was a
business then Steve Russell who was a
student at the MIT Media Lab mighty did
a thing called space war and it was on a
PDP one and this is really the first
time that video screens were really
connected to a computer and and this is
what I played and almost flunked out of
my engineering school one quarter
because in those days you could sneak in
play from about you know 2:00 in the
morning till 5:00 was really bad on
studies but it was really a fun game and
had a blistering hundred thousand
kilohertz
that's wrong 100,000 Hertz big kilohertz
in in speed so and that display was
actually a modified display that was
used for for radar it was XY things were
about this long you know electrostatic
deflection it was cool but not that cool
then we did computer space this was this
is the unit that I built figured out a
new way to do this
this wasn't a computer this wasn't the
von Neumann architecture at all this was
big fancy digital signal generator in
which if you wanted another object on
the screen you added eight flip-flops
fact that actually 16 and the this was
our first brochure this was a stripper
from down the block and she agreed to be
part of be a model for us and she was
cutie too this was the early team there
were two innovations there
one was the pong machine the other one
was the spotted shirt polka dot shirt
did not catch on but the pong game this
is a lalcorn he's the technical this is
the guy that was stealing money he was
our first CFO he really was anyway this
is my head of manufacturing at the time
and I'm not going to tell that story
when we're doing it all this is a
magnetic Odyssey game this was actually
sort of the first consumer gain that it
was analog a lot of people don't realize
that a lot of people thought that analog
computers were going to be really big
they weren't with the with unerring
fashion sense I went from polka dot
shirts to this kind of weird sweater
that didn't work either but the little
pong game sold about two and a half
million units when we got to tell you
the innovation isn't easy this is one of
the most successful consumer products up
to that point when we took it to the Toy
Fair in New York
we sold zero and we said how could this
be you know we know that our our
neighbors want to get one and we think
it's really cool and everything well it
turned out that toy stores at the time
we went to the Toy Fair we thought okay
toys this is a toy the the most
expensive toy that they were selling at
that time was twenty nine dollars and we
wanted almost a hundred dollars for this
and so they said not us jack so we went
to the the television market place it's
called brown goods in in retail parlance
and they said now people want to do a
finance on it so we couldn't sell them
there we said now we've got a great
product here what's the channel well
thank God there was a guy who heard
about us we didn't hear about him and he
was running the sporting goods
department at Sears and Sears in the
winter in those days turned into ping
pong tables and pool tables for the
recreation room and so he thought we'll
pong coin-op is in the bars
cool tables are in the bars maybe we can
sell this so he came over and said how
many can you build well we really hadn't
thought of that
so um I talked to my head of
manufacturing he says we probably do
25,000 so I said 75,000 and and then not
to do B one better he came back with an
order for 150,000 because he wanted an
exclusive and so all of a sudden
challenged with the thought of what
might be possible we said about to build
150,000 of them as possible but we
didn't have any money which is kind of a
problem and so I called him up and I
says we can't take the order for 150,000
we don't have enough cash to build it he
says not to worry I'll introduce you to
Sears Bank and so we had a bonded
warehouse when the units fell off the
edge or dropped off the edge of our
production line we got proof we got
advanced eighty percent of the price
that we're selling for so it kept us in
positive cash flow incidentally Atari
was funded with 250 dollars and that's
the bad news the good news is is that
that's how much money I had and so so I
was able to get the company started and
how we were able to go forward is by
getting our vendors to ship us parts and
being able to turn them into saleable
product before we had the bills come to
and it's called just-in-time inventory
and it works like a charm until all of a
sudden you design in a single source
part and you can't get it for four
months at which time you almost go out
of business which we almost did I mean
people always remember success stories
but they don't realize that one
we had three or four sheriff's on the
door every day to attach assets to
lawsuits that we lost in fact people are
calling me and they said Nolan I'm gonna
miss payroll next week and I said well
how many how many lawsuits have you lost
for vendors that are trying to collect
they say well I'm done and I say well
you've got months I mean at one time we
had nine checking accounts because you
know when the sheriff comes in first of
all you you buy you know fifty thousand
dollars worth of stuff from vendor a and
the vendor a sues you and you know that
you owe it so you don't even put up a
defense and so if you want to put up the
defense you can probably stall them
another three months but without a
defense take some four months to to get
a judgment against you maybe five and
then they get to attach your assets but
what they really want is cash they don't
want your desks and furniture and stuff
they just want your cash and so if you
have a whole bunch of bank accounts and
you deftly move the cash from bank
accounts bank account they can't get it
because they get a court order and it
says you know bank account
Wells Fargo two four seven seven six
five they go in they present it the bank
says no money and then because now
you've you're paying the bills that you
need to pay to keep the lights on with a
new bank account and they see it and
they say ah then they go through it
again no money so you can keep those
things going for a really long time and
then you start shipping again and slowly
you get better and and that's in the
days when you're when you don't get
venture capital like venture capital and
me have never been strong friends
because they said the game business that
can't be a serious business I said well
I think it is
and they said nah and besides that we
all know that
operated game businesses is run by the
Mafia so we you know I wanted to raise
venture capital they just wouldn't do it
and then imagine what it's like to go
and say now get the picture a really
really big pizza parlor lots of games
and wait there's more we're gonna have
talking animals can you imagine VCS
thinking that was a cool idea I can
assure you they did not anyway then we
did the Atari 2600 the first really
programmable game hugely successful and
this is the point where I sold it to
Warner who thought that it was a record
player and they thought that that the
2600 was a forever product and that all
they had to do is sell software and so
the day we shipped our first one I told
Warner I said you know this product is
obsolete they said well we just bought
the company I said yeah but by the time
we get it get the next one designed this
will be gone they didn't get it they
just didn't get it and so and I said you
know the 2600 we have square balls on
the gain on the on the games not because
we think square balls are cool it's
because the technology is really crappy
you know we had 128 bytes of memory why
I mean hundred 28 bytes of RAM and the
thing ran was really expensive and they
were to hit our price points we had
nothing and by the time we shipped
Ram had dropped in price that we would
at least doubled that remember that the
cartridges were 2,000 bytes
you guys are really spoiled did you know
that the Atari cartridges also had to
keep track in software of the horizontal
and vertical blanking and trace amounts
it was really tough sledding it was on
machine code so you guys are bikers you
know back in my day we had to go uphill
in snowdrifts both ways anyway these are
a few other things bubble year for the
twenty six hunters 1983 Warner basically
wanted to ship the 2800 2,600 2,600 we
calculated was end of life in 1979 and
if they'd have turned it over like they
do now Atari would have still been the
dominant player in the world they really
screwed up my company I'm really pissed
about that but oh well when you sell
them you forget them these are some of
the games that we did then we did
Chuckie Cheese had a lot of fun with
that you can't imagine the weird things
that people do from inside of the
Chuckie Cheese costume
the other thing that you don't know is
the weird things that employees do in
the chuck-e-cheese changing room closet
lock door small space anyway you can
also from sort of the inside you can't
imagine what is in the bottom of the
ball crawl after a week of kids use and
you don't really want to go there I did
a thing called and robot this was the
first time I really did what I call a
technological faceplant this was say I
mean everybody knows that robots are
gonna be part of the future and this is
so fun and we were but the technology
was just not ready yet and it was all
about noise immunity you know when you
have a blue screen of death on Microsoft
it's a-you know you reset it and you go
on with your life when a robot crashes
all hell breaks loose all your collision
avoidance everything shuts down and
sometimes your motors happen to be going
lickety-split in a particular ugly
direction we used to call this the mo
the baby mode which which was kind of a
problem in and what would happen is when
the robot would be going over carpet it
pick up static electricity in this and
the discharge between the bearings or
between that and other things would
reset the computer and we put put them
in Gaussian enclosures we did all kinds
of isolation technology and we couldn't
get it to the 99% kind of reliability
that we needed for then give the company
call DTAC
attack now is I sold it to to Rupert
Murdoch and News Corp and and a lot of
the the core assets map assets that
you're using in Google may happen
everything off from tell Atlas is based
on the attack database you know that he
had all kinds of deck 750s doing this
can tell you how long ago it was I mean
that the amount of heat those things
that throw off was just amazing comp our
Mike company invented the switching
power supply I just wished I'd have kept
a nickel for every switching power
supply there is in the world by video
this was sort of the core technology in
fact Amazon bought a lot of the tech the
patents that we had on on home shop on
shopping this is on a kiosk used a big
laser disc was that crappy technology
Magna microwave this was about Street
hopping and networks wireless networks
this was I sold this axle on I did a toy
company a little robotic cats and dogs
and bears that talked sold it to Hasbro
that was kind of a lame company to then
I've done you Inc which is a restaurant
we has touchscreens at every table you
dress it up for the various fun times
this is our location in Woodland Hills
this is our location actually in in
Mountain View this is on Castro Street
and we have entertainment and fun this
is the Mountain View location it's good
for a girls night out
just have to throw that in keep your
make sure you're awake
you sit down and swipe your credit card
you can then order your food and drinks
this is guaranteed quickest time between
sitting down and having a martini in
your hands I think that's real progress
and the reason is the touchscreen order
you don't have to wait for a
waitress/waiter
and the person who's building it does it
immediately we have all kinds of fun
stuff truth or dare what kind of game is
that
it's a game in which you're you couldn't
have a lot of fun we made a mistake
early on by letting some of the cocktail
waitresses do the dares we almost lost
our liquor license if you can imagine
the combination of alcohol late at night
and a prompted game one of the questions
was occurred the dares was exchange a
piece of clothing with the person on
your right that can get out of hand when
we built you ink we decided we wanted it
to be aimed at women 21 to 35 under the
theory that every woman that's older
than 35 kind of wants to be and thinks
of themselves 35 every woman that's
younger than 21 kind of wants to be 21
and that all the men of all ages want
that demographic so if we can get the
women 21 to 35 we thought we've got it
pretty much knocked then we have group
games in which the whole restaurant can
play against each other and it's not
just all trivia we have this one called
you ink scene investigation where as
you've shown a picture and then you're
asked questions about it and we
regularly have an 8 year old or a 10
year old that we
that one they're actually better than
the adults this is our food menu good
burgers appetizers what have you you can
make modifications and it actually
happens because the kitchen gets it most
of the time that you make a modification
to your food and it gets messed up it's
always your waiter so it's so you can
feel good at not tipping again things
alcohol games and it's not just games we
have comedy stuff weird things explore
where you can have views of various
places it's pretty fun this is our six
player game you say why six player well
people come in twos and fours what we
want to do is have people mix around
these tables that should got an
electronic foosball which is actually
more fun than the regular one I think
wine tasting so you can order three
glasses of numbered numbered glasses and
it asks you names about it and we can
teach you in about 20 bucks how to be a
wine snob so that's a pretty good deal
and you get the wine I'm been on the the
chairman the board of neo edge networks
and Neil edge does some very interesting
things it basically ad enables game play
and this is one thus under the
characteristic of a discontinuity and
it's a huge discontinuity people play
seven point six hours of games per week
and they watch twenty six hours of TV so
theoretically ad enabled games on a
purity basis should be worth about three
hundred million dollars because TV ad
revenue cable and everything is about
100 million
some people say sixty to eighty but I
think it's more like about a hundred
million bucks in TV ad sales so it
should be three hundred million bucks
for 4-game revenue
I mean game revenue current currently is
less than 300 million but it should be
26 billion that's a discontinuity why is
it different well because a lot of the
gameplay is is not ad enabled and neo
age can do that and I believe that
through the technology of making the
games more ad friendly making the games
more accessible to other lifestyle
things that 26 billion is there and so
if you're in a business that's going to
grow by at least two orders of magnitude
that that seems to me to be a big thing
to do they and and right now there's
some socialization but not a lot and so
we can put games back into the network
and you play you know there's a little
font problem here puzzles and let's see
if we can do a gen what I bet this isn't
gonna work cuz we moved over let's see
I had an embedded little movie in here
nope No
oh maybe it is no okay
tonight okay there we go so what this
does is shows you how that's not quite
right
there's actually some other stuff it's a
little better but this shows you how you
can take a regular casual game playing
along the Goodyear blimp is actually not
part of the game
we don't have to worry with SDKs or
anything like that and we can put the
Goodyear blimp in we can do a lot of
stuff but most games lock you up and you
can't do other things we've got a bility
to pull yourself out of the game so that
it becomes integrated into your regular
experience the game is now on pause
you're doing your little Starbucks
thingy
you're gonna be able to climb over and
get a Google map or MSN map I don't know
maybe you you're not allowed to say that
in this room and why it's but notice
there's we can also put Budweiser on the
on the kegs over there
you thought it was grog but it's not and
we can pull them information out of the
game to give scores so this is all
generated this is synthetic stuff that
we have and I don't like that little
girl but you know how certain kids just
just you know I've got eight kids and
some of their friends you really don't
like very much
actually some of your own children you
don't like very much for a certain stage
there was a lot of story that the space
program was actually designed to put so
that we could have a place to put
children until they become twenty-one I
don't know if that's true
Swiffer sponge mop that's kind of a
dirty old mop for that but anyway that's
kind of a look at what we're doing here
back here okay I'm also on the board of
a company called wave and wave is a
software company that that enables the
TPM which is trusted platform module
that's on about 90% of all the laptops
and the difference between hardware and
software encryption is that hardware is
really really hard to break I mean
really hard and in your cell phone you
actually have hardware encryption in a
video game you know that that is selling
you various cartridges that you can't
crack those are Hardware encrypted
things you need a private secret that is
embedded in silicon and until you get
that you all bets are off and so
password is really soft and until we get
rid of that a lot of the economic
opportunity of the of the Internet is
going to actually fail so I just say add
trust of the relationship say you know
to user name and password
every time you have a user name and
password it's wrong just think that if
it has a user name and password it is
wrong because it really fails to do what
it's promising to do
because if I can put in a username and
password any idiot who wants to steal my
stuff can do it as well whereas if I
have a secure relationship they have to
steal my whole damn computer that's a
harder thing and I know it's gone that's
the more important thing when somebody
steals my computer it's gone and so you
want to have a virtual private network
between your new your computer and
anything else what you're dealing with
and wonderful things start to happen I
want to have the same relationship with
myself that I have with my cellphone
with my computer but I also want to have
that same relationship with my garage
door because I want it Hardware
encrypted as well and I don't want to
have to stand on a stepladder and put in
three three five five and I would like
to have a hardware encrypted
relationship with my Bluetooth and I
would like to have my Hardware encrypted
relationship between my car and my home
computer my home network all of these
things are possible under the network
under the encryption and the hardware is
there you just have to turn it on and if
Google really wanted to be instrumental
in tomorrow's ecosystem of of the
internet and changed the economics
significantly they could do a lot to
spearhead some of these initiatives in
the entertainment market there's a
company called verse 6 that I'm working
with and it is basically a mash-up
between a movie and a video game now
what do we know about the video game
business right now yeah that physicality
is becoming increasingly important the
we rock band you know Dance Dance
Revolution it's more fun than pushing
buttons and so we rent 4,000 square feet
in a mall near you and we give you
on terra experience what you don't
realize is that the mall that you can
donate you can volunteer to become part
of the rescue party that will get the
non-tariff Spacelab back online you
probably didn't even know what was
offline but it is the non-tariff
Spacelab had a virus introduced just
last week and all the robots on the on
the spacelab are down that's a problem
because the damn Stemmons are out there
trying to get us now we're blind in that
whole section of the galaxy so what to
do about it
eight trusted intrepid people coming
into the end of the mall crossing the
palm with $12 I will transport them into
space where they will have a problem
first problem they have to get through a
laser beam web to reactivate the
security locks once they're through the
security locks they have to sneak
stealthily past the material handling
corridor where the whole floor is alive
and changing and if you don't do it the
right way you die and then once you make
it past because actually we're pretty
forgiving you not many will die and it's
not because we don't want to kill them
it's just our legal liability is too
much it's purely mercenary then you need
to load the reactor and you put together
you know dilithium crystals and put them
on a on a belt and then you start up the
reactor and then you find that there's a
real problem turns out that it's made
for a robotic crew so the reactor isn't
shielded so when you grow so when you
start it up
you get irradiated you basically nuke
yourself
the transporter in order to get back
down requires the nuclear the the power
from the nuclear the reactor so you're
really in trouble but we've provided a
way out you can actually steal enough
antimatter out of space on a eight
player game that if you get it fast
enough before the reactor actually
starts up you can save your ass
and so with that you've spent an hour
$12 of good money and you've had some
fun anyway so that's verse six and then
right behind that we've got a sort of an
Indiana Jones thing where you sneak
through steal the the red the golden
goblet and various things anyway
the hardware war so I was just going to
mention that I think that the PC will be
it that set-top boxes game consoles
TiVo's will all go away this is the I'm
going to predict that this is the last
iteration of the consoles that we're so
close to photorealism on in terms of
even the xbox 360 the ps3 that there is
not going to be a definitive reason to
upgrade and the cost benefit isn't there
and that most of the power of the future
game market will actually be in the
network and not not in the hardware and
so the only thing that the game console
has provided is an ecosystem based on
subsidizing hardware cost with software
sales so you know the Xbox 360 cost a
little more to build them they're
selling for and they make it back on the
software well the media PC with the
hardware encryption will be able to
create synthetic ecosystems for that and
that will be the next model in my
estimation
so that's kind of what nolan bushnell is
up to these days and i think that that
the business of entertainment and fun
and google is doing some great stuff I
mean I believe that I've spent as much
time lately on Google Maps just running
around the world looking at crazy stuff
because I have playing games and that
that's saying something but I believe
that there's so much more wonderful
things you guys can do and let's not
take ourselves too seriously that's the
first step in the road to oblivion one
of one of my dad's favorite comments
that I tell my kids is just about the
time that you think that the Sun shines
out of your ass all you have is an
illuminated landing area thanks ok any
questions
especially the gaming sector you don't
see pirated ps3 360 and Wii games
anymore because the networking aspect is
so key that part of the game is
connected experience worth of the PC
even with you know a hardware long
system under actual computer
the distribution networks become unless
you have a unified distribution system
for your software it still becomes kind
of sketchy
I just agree with that
I really think that the hardware
encryption gets rid of the sketchiness
and and it will turn into a marketing
program no question about it but these
virtual you know think of think of of
the ps3 and the Xbox 360 turning into
Virtual Private Network enclaves but
using the PC as the delivery mechanism
and some of the games won't go unless
you have an Nvidia blocka blocka blocka
but at the same time there is not the
economics of doing a new hardware
platform aren't they're horrible and and
you know Sony is probably going to be
looking down the shotgun barrels of a
two billion dollar write-off and in you
know most of the guys inside the
business right now say that the PS the
ps3 is over just because they haven't
hit critical mass for the software the
sony has always been a very very
difficult platform to program for and so
why why spend five times as much time
programming for a console that has 1/10
as many users so the math doesn't work
and and of course everybody's scratching
their head over the Wii you know still
sold out you know two years later with a
with a a processing you know number of
polygons it's not much better than it
was five years ago and yet gone and so
what it really says is this the game
stupid it's it's the fun it's the
innovation and entertainment is all
about innovation
I remember while growing up in India
Atari game systems to me
I used to stay at home not only need
but my question is regarding the worst
extent the game the game lobby system
that you share verse six so try to
understand so these are actual yeah I
lied to you you really don't put you up
into space every once in a while people
wake up and realize that having a
million friends online in the dark in
your underwear isn't rewarding and when
they wake up to that the first place
they go is to a movie after they've sort
of done the movie thing then they think
well maybe the mall and once you do the
mall you're looking for other things and
people are always look when
entertainment a lot of times is about
fighting boredom and so anytime you
offer something new you can generally
get people to pay for it and if they
walk out of the experience saying that
was a really good time you might be able
to get them to come back and at the very
least and get them to tell other friends
that what what I found is that the
public space is absolutely as important
as as the private space you just got to
have both and that and the the thing
that I like about the vs. project
is that it's really an ability to also
showcase new pieces of technology it's
like did you know that next year 3d
cameras are going to be really big and
these are XYZ where you can now remember
Tom Cruise in Minority Report all that
stuff that's real next year
these cameras are going to be down under
a hundred bucks and gesture technology
is all about that because now for the
first time the computer can see that my
hand is in front of us I have a unit one
of the 3d cameras that we paid six grand
for I think like that in in you Inc and
we're playing a lot of really really fun
games with that because now you have
that Z component plus or minus you know
plus or minus five centimeters and so
you know all of sudden your mind comes
alive I don't know how many of on
YouTube have seen the living tetris live
tetris games if you've seen the Japanese
one that's fine but you really want to
go to the Italian one because the the
Japanese one has guys in you know jump
suits and helmets the Italian one has
them in you know hot girls in bikinis
which is a lot more pleasant anyway
let's see where was I
distracted but anyway that it's gonna be
a lot of fun and interesting stuff next
year keep changing I think I think
they'll probably last somewhere around
six months maybe a year and then you
swapping out what we've done is we've
created a a core system down that you
just hang stuff off of and so it's very
cheap to change you know it from a I
mean you've got a whole thing with a
nascar thing figured out where you go in
and you learn how to be a pit crew and
change tires and and do all sort of
stuff against the clock get a score if
you do well you know you you can brag
against your friends if you do bad then
you have to sulk but I think physicality
is important and I think it'll be
something that may not be a dominant
factor but if billion-dollar business
here billion-dollar business there it's
worth going after
so maybe for DC advertising becoming a
primary way they can to monetize or to
see advertising sort of augmenting
existing models I think that the
advertising in games will represent
somewhere between the ten and a twenty
five billion dollar market place
annually and and it's you know to me
it's very obvious the the advertising
world looks for accountability being
able to target market I mean a neo edge
we can we can send it to your zip code
we know how old you are we know whether
you're you're you know rich poor what
have you so we can really hit that
target very very directly and we know
that you're doing it because unlike
television where you could be in the
kitchen making a sandwich or the
restroom or or just snoozing or channel
surfing this is this is this is real its
accountable its click-through able it
should be worth on a cost on a CPM basis
three times what a television ad is and
and it's it's a twenty billion dollar
business based on parody just on time so
I think that I think it's possible that
online game ads could be a dominant
revenue source for certain demographics
I believe that
yes this kind of actually continue using
the same same track with the advertising
did you say it's obvious I guess it's
not so obvious to me but essentially you
know you showed that side with 26
billion and a hundred billion right
isn't it I mean you can't Casey made
television it's actually just lately
find and it's being over-represented um
I think that's great question
no I I think well first of all there's
no question that television is the
legacy business and so it will be slower
to fall and the incumbent business is
going to be slower to rise but that's
that's where I like the arbitrage
because I want to be on the right horse
I mean the old story says how do you
want it how do you lead a mob figure out
where it's going get in front of it and
say follow me you know and and and I
believe that's that's what's happening
here
everybody that we have sold advertising
to at neoege likes it a lot and comes
back for more that the number of click
throughs their efficiency how they've
been able to target I mean we can target
a single area code next to a restaurant
and remember that in a lot of cases ad
agencies are really lazy and the a lot
of the game advertising is very you know
customized bespoke whereas the sort of
the the the thing that is normal is the
30-second spot we can run the 30-second
spots in interstitially on games without
access to their SDK so we become very
very much like a television network but
with all the advantages of
of the internet and you know if it's not
25 billion it's 10 billion but it ain't
1 billion it's going to be a lot bigger
than that and and it's going to be the
right the right demographic form of
content fundamentally I guess the
traditional advertising you're watching
a show - the actual content that you're
consuming so fundamentally how do you
resolve you know it seems that that's
well would you would you say that that
you know seeing an AGM ad on CSI Miami
is orthogonal or directed it's a
commercial right but and and but it is
not like I was thinking that what you
were saying is that if I'm view if
there's an ad over here where my phobia
is here then that would be orthogonal
but if you have a game and then it
breaks to a ad and then it goes back to
the game I would see that as linear and
what you're saying is that you consider
orthogonal to be that I'm thinking about
pirate ships and now all of a sudden I'm
want you to think about parrell okay
that is that isn't
that google search has no question about
it but if I have a pirate game and I'm
selling grog that should work
but at the same time the typical ad
model of anything has to be somewhat
disjointed just because of the nature
that we would love to have as as much of
that we're not going to we're not going
to sell a lot of things to teenagers
with Google search you know we you know
it's just not gonna happen but we can
get to young adults and young women who
are not necessarily searching for car
insurance and what-have-you
that's it's gonna be a big enough market
for us no question about it yes
one of two ways one of the I believe
that ultimately it's a network that
there is a data storage on premises in
your home it's gonna be the you know
relatively small
I believe that all screens like this
you'll just hang them on the wall and
with hard with firm encryption you know
it will be available speakers will be
separate hang those on the wall and it
becomes totally distributed Wi-Fi
throughout the house and that that Wi-Fi
net includes your automobiles in your
garage you know out in front once that
happens everything becomes virtual I
believe that all physical media go away
I don't believe that we will have
anything other than then our hard drives
and those will move within another three
years probably also out state where the
movie
to watch ones as well as music for me I
have felt for a long time that
microtransactions are the answer to the
problems in the movie imperative the
music business because most people have
a price at which they're willing to be
thieving bastards or honest and that
Christ for various people is a different
number I think most people who are a fan
of Pink Floyd or have a fan of REM would
be willing to when they download the
piece of music that they did to give
them an applause 25 cents 50 cents for
that music and you know this is no DRM
no you know in fact I think if he said
it's just get rid of the art and and by
making it simple and easy to give 50
cents to any band as an applause I
believe that they would make more money
than they did when they were selling
overpriced CDs and all of a sudden we've
got the business back again but because
I don't have a good relationship with my
computer inspirational because you know
as much as I love some of these guys I'm
not going to put in my credit card
number in my password and all that other
stuff is too much friction get rid of
the friction and all of a sudden the
world will become rationalized because
it's about efficiency
and these we're always most of us want
to do the right thing
so you're predicting the demise of video
game consoles where pcs will take over
so one of the benefits of consoles is
you have a special special-purpose piece
of hardware that's just dedicated to
gaming and you know that everyone has
that same exact platform right so you
have consistent experience across gamers
so how do you see that being replaced
with the desktop where you have a much
more heterogeneous set of computing
hardware I believe that that everything
becomes software and that software will
take care of most of the issues and that
the network becomes the dominant factor
and and I think that a lot of the
hurdles that we've been jumping over
with the hardware slowly go away I mean
think about how much better USD was than
serial points I can remember spending a
Saturday afternoon setting interrupt
keys on a plug in serial card you know
you know that was a real big pain you
know I ain't used to ask myself what
happens to people who don't have an
electrical engineer in the house you
know even though I was a very good one
you know so it slowly gets easier it
slowly gets easier I think once we get
gold deep encryption just being able to
wave your your computer next to a your
device and have it mate
it's to be very very easy and slowly and
all those things go away and then what
you're dealing with is total virtual
world in which there will be businesses
that are VPNs to that better
today's xbox360 and which they will sell
a bunch of user interfaces and software
to go along with it but I think the
reason and the whole marketing of the
hardware and order to get to have that
VPN relationship no longer makes some
more of an open question when you have
an idea I'm wondering what's your
process to kind of evaluate how
successful it will be and more so it's
not about like when you have a good idea
and you strongly believe into it but
also to walk away from an idea what kind
of maybe experiments you do to give it
to your friends your family would you
bounce it off
one of the things I try to do is I write
things down and like I probably have 20
business plans they're either aging or
festering not sure which is the right
word and it's amazing how much how much
things change with the process of time
for example I've been working on and off
on my school project almost 5 years I
think I've got salt but I've been doing
a lot of research on that and say you
want to get instances you know that's
not an oxygen mom but I actually think
that there's the video games and
deliberate community
education properly and in the mode kids
one I have eight children and and my
youngest is 14 and I can see how he
likes to learn and he's not getting that
at this and in school and
interesting will work that you're going
on people in California every high
school student has nine thousand dollars
spend on the average class size is
thirty-five now if you take a quick what
I call shock for analysis of nine
thousand dollars honey singh sachin
ninety nine dollars times 35 you end up
with over three hundred thousand dollars
being spent on that one classroom if you
look at the cost of bringing and
equivalent space at commercial rates you
have on dishes things it gets down to
the point where you're still getting a
quarter million dollars spent on them
and we don't believe generally that the
teacher is being spent that way where'd
all the money go and money really went
to waste inefficiency bureaucracy and
 and so until you fix that you
cannot fix school system you just can't
do it you can't throw enough money and
so you have to pull the baby out with
the bathwater
or the young children out that water and
pick them up dry them off but but to be
more clear on another part of the
question I really tried to make sure
that things that I work on have Headroom
and I like them I like my vote in a
rocketship
I don't want to work on something that I
don't think can be like half a billion
dollars you know close your eyes and
imagine doing it on business then I can
work on that and the problem is a lot of
the billion-dollar business
don't look like that from the onset so
it kind of really gotta be optimistic
goodbye and look for businesses that
don't require massive amounts of cash to
get started but there's a lifeboat
scenario we need to sort of figure out
ways in things the other thing I want to
look at is I asked myself do I really
understand this business do I have any
any standing in that world you know the
old story that you know the other guy's
business looks like ease and it's so
true don't know all about all the other
person's problems you got to walk a mile
and the other guys shoes and then your
mile away you buy shoes so
and and then I then I start working and
I'm ready to go
I have five years I absolutely change I
recently watched this YouTube clip from
the 80s with the unit I think they were
talking about how the games could be
potentially dangerous in terms of you
know like violence and whatnot that was
in the 80 something shows called people
were talking and I was wondering what
direction you think games are going in
in terms of learning protect like games
that you could potentially give salty
kids who could learn you know learning
potential and whatnot with first-person
shooters and whatnot what do you think
what direction do you think games will
go in future I believe that games are a
very very powerful engine if you really
look at what makes us like to learn is
we'd like to learn things there in
context to a problem unsolved and if we
can if we can make things real what
games give you is context if you're
trying to solve to save the princess and
you have to get to the mountaintop and
on the way to the mountaintop is a gate
that's run by electricity then it's
broken you know and the only way even
you have killed a box rescue the
princess is to fix the gate you may find
context for you to learn a little bit
about electricity my son in Pokemon knew
the characteristics the names and and
some of the vitals of over
hundred Pokemon characters but that
would have been moss man and poor a part
of the man and variously he could pass
you know sophomore biology okay
so why don't we do that why don't we
create a game structure around the
things that you have to memorize for
biology and all of a sudden you know
make a game of it you know we put funny
little faces on the little you know
three segments of critters and we're off
and running I just think there's a lot
of different ways we can use media to
enhance this education when I was
growing up school was the most
interesting thing happening in town I
mean the alternative was watching the
corn grow on the river flow you know we
had a blocking one of the half channels
television and you say how do you get a
half a channel well it was only on three
hours today so you know school seemed
like a real portal into an interesting
world right now we've got a teacher with
a piece of chalk competing against
advertisements the cost you know for 30
seconds that had a bunch of three and a
half million dollars
those are production values and I think
an immature mind doesn't know the
difference between a bad concept with
great production values and a good
concept piece of China and so that's
what's happening teachers today just
fundamentally outcome and we'll be into
the
until we change and use the media that
we all know and love
