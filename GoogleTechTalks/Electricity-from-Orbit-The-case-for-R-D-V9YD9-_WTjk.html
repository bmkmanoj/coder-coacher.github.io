to introduce Marty quickly Marty Hoffert
is a professor emeritus of physics and
former chair of the Department of
Applied Science at New York University
his diverse academic background includes
degrees in aeronautical engineering and
astronautics as well as work and
sociology and economics his present
efforts focus on energy technologies
that could stabilize climate change
including but not limited to space solar
power he's a member of the American
Geophysical Union the American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics and he
was elected fellow of the American
Association for the Advancement of
science so without further ado professor
Marty Harvard thanks a lot Kevin it's a
pleasure to be here it's a pleasure to
be here one of my favorite premier
institutions on the planet look there's
a lot I could be talking about but time
is limited so let me just say this the
point of this talk and the and there
which is going to have some technical
components to it is is motivated in a
pretty straightforward way you know we
have a civilization on earth with about
six million billion excuse me and
Counting people it's pretty old it goes
back 6,000 years but if we're going to
be able to continue to have a high-tech
civilization on the planet and you
sitting in the audience being exemplars
of that high-tech civilization we are
going to require a rapid revolutionary
transformation of the energy systems
that run the earth the my immediate
problem is global warming there are many
other problems that humankind has
population Reese other resources
depletion clearwater poverty and so
forth inequality in the distribution of
wealth but all of these other problems
that humankind has require stable and
adequate sources of energy on a massive
scale now if we didn't have climate
change we didn't have global warming to
contend with the conventional wisdom
would have been kool we've got oil and
gas and coal of which were created over
high
millions of years and we're using them
up in a few hundred years coal is the
most abundant of course but if we
continue the path that were on now which
is recombinase ation switching our
electric power production from natural
gas to coal and essentially ree
carbonizing the energy supply we have
the capability of transforming the
Earth's climate the back way was 100
million years ago in the middle
cretaceous when both of the polls were d
glaciated and sea level was a hundred
meters higher than it is today i'm not
going to dwell on this scenario global
warming is an interesting and important
problem but the importance of it in this
context is that it puts the need for an
energy transformation away from a global
system that's based on fossil fuel to
the highest priority because if global
warming constrains our use of fossil
fuels and fossil fuels have been the
energy source of our civilization I like
to say we run on fossil fuels the way
the Roman Empire ran on slavery we need
a way to get there now the problem can
be defined in an engineering sense in a
sense of can we keep growing our energy
use of three two percent a year and GDP
growth a three percent a year worldwide
and at the same time phase out all our
fossil fuels by the middle of the
century that puts an enormous constraint
on the energy system and so I would like
to look at the problem although there's
a more general talk that I give and then
I would be delighted to give it out of
the time weird that we discuss a whole
slew of alternatives I would like to say
that where are we going what are what
are the energy systems that might enable
us to continue our high-tech
civilization for hundreds indeed
thousands of years on a planet earth and
they're a very few u-235 is limited as
the as a nuclear fuel u-238 from which
you can make plutonium has very severe
environmental problems coal is limited
although it might be useful as a
transition if we store the cold we
basically have renewable energy that is
terrestrially based solar and wind power
and the wind power in orbit in space and
as a long shot and we have to be honest
that it is a long shot controlled
thermonuclear fusion now one of the
options fusion by the way which is now
funded by the world at twenty billion
dollars to build a test reactor that may
not produce any electricity being built
in France the option i'm talking about
today space solar power has essentially
very little funding or no funding I
don't want to explore the possibility of
getting a program going not only at the
federal level which is very important
but whether there's a role of for
entrepreneurs like yourselves so without
further ado I'm going to going to skip a
couple of slides I do want to say that a
number of agencies of course I don't
believe in arguments from Authority but
I'm going to make them anyway a number
of agencies from the National Academy of
Science to most recently the Pentagon's
national security space office have have
supported the idea of solar power this
is from their recently released report
space-based solar power and they make a
number of recommendations including
government support for space solar power
and encouraging the private sector to
develop it with perhaps the government
backing up the risks associated with
developing this base load source of
electricity space solar power is
primarily worth developing because it's
can supply electricity on a base load
level it isn't intermittent like wind
and terrestrial solar I'll get to that
in a second just a general comment
actually I'm going to skip this comment
just going to zip through this if
humankind continued to grow its energy
consumption rate at two percent a year
the horizontal axis is years from now
the vertical axis is energy that both
logarithmic scales
we would soon within a few hundreds of
years be consuming all the energy that's
incident on the Earth from the Sun which
is 10,000 times more than our present
energy use and eventually much higher
values that's clearly none sustainable
and I won't dwell on it at this point
except to say that we need to be
targeting a solar for one reason
primarily that it's one of the biggest
numbers out there of continuously
available energy and it's more available
in space than it is at the surface of
the earth I'm going to skip this graph
as well just a little bit on climate
because it does referee is important for
the last thousand years for the first
nine hundred of those thousand years
ears temperature has fluctuated but
something very extraordinary happened in
the 20th century particularly around the
middle of the 20th century where global
temperatures began to rise and that is
of course no accident it happened at the
same time that the co2 levels of the
atmosphere were rising and in accordance
with predictions by various scientists
including myself is I started working on
this problem in the 70s when the earth
was still cooling that we're generating
this global greenhouse effect and it is
almost certainly driven by two factors
the use of fossil fuel increasing energy
is per capita and the increasing
population of the earth which is past
six billion recently and Counting now
this the idea of a solar power satellite
which goes back at least to this late
sixties early seventies was proposed by
Peter Glaser the basically there I want
to talk a little bit about the physics
here the the design that was studied by
NASA and the Department of Energy in the
1970s with a very large collector that
would be placed in geostationary orbit
that's 40,000 kilometers above the earth
five kilometers by 10 kilometers and
there would be a transmitting antenna
one kilometer in the
beaming power to a receiver 10 x 13
kilometers in diameter at the surface of
the earth something this big if any of
you watched the star wars franchise on
TV I suspect from this crowd there might
be a few think about the Borg ship this
would be something comparable to the
size of one of the board battle cruisers
why is it so big well the reason it's so
big is a because of a law of physics go
associated with a diffraction the
wavelength of microwave radiation see
there are two windows through the
atmosphere that you can see into space
and you can see from space to the earth
there's a visible window where you can
see obviously we can see the stars we
have are actually because the atmosphere
this transparent that's why I visual
response is in the visible part of the
spectrum and the other part is in the
microwave part of the spectrum which is
why radio astronomers put their
telescopes on the earth and those are
two windows through the atmosphere in
between the atmosphere is pretty opaque
so transmitting the power that you
collected in space at other frequencies
would not be very effective but these
two frequencies are and originally with
space solar power the basic idea was to
to use the microwave part of the
spectrum and a lot of people still want
to use the microwave part of the
spectrum but the microwave wavelengths
which are 12 centimeters are a hundred
thousand times bigger than visible
wavelengths which are under a micron and
because of that the spreading out of a
beam is much lower because the beam will
spread through an angle proportional to
lambda over D the ratio of the
wavelength to the aperture that's the
reason why the original solar power
satellite was so big it didn't itself
had to do with the power once you have
to make the transmitter and the receiver
so big you might as well put a lot of
power through it because it doesn't
there's no point to doing it otherwise
and that forced upon you this humongous
solar array in space which is much
bigger
you know in the original design that all
the solar panels that have already been
manufactured even with Google's generous
help that they're there's still a
tremendous amount that amount of area
involved now now there's another idea
that it isn't normally even included in
space solar power but I want to include
it because I want to make comparisons of
different systems and the idea would be
why don't we just build a power tower
with mirrors that are 40,000 kilometers
up in space I mean after all if you
could reflect solar energy remember the
reason you go into geostationary orbit
is because an object in geostationary
orbit look stationary relative to
somebody on the earth that's why we have
direct broadcast TV and of course Direct
broadcast TV is itself a kind of solar
power satellite because we're collecting
solar energy with photovoltaic cells
beaming it to the earth now the beam
spreads out over a whole hemisphere and
it's only a tiny amount of power that's
received by the one foot diameter dishes
that you might have in your and your on
your roof or something like that but the
principle is the same if you could
connect condense the beam and put it on
a region that you want you would and the
solar power is almost continuously
available in geostationary orbit you're
only in the Earth's shadow with very
small fraction maybe a half an hour a
month but suppose you just put mirrors
in geostationary orbit you just reflect
the energy from there is on to the
surface of the earth on two receivers
that way you would get 24 hours of
sunlight and it would be constant
normally photovoltaics are subject to
the diurnal cycle if you have flat
plates on a roof as you guys have out
your parking lot it's not constant
suppose you could let's say you have an
average flux out there of 200 watts per
meter squared I'm guessing but that's a
probably right in space you would have
1400 watts per meter squared suppose you
could develop a transmitter that you
could have those same photovoltaic
arrays and they would be getting a
thousand
watts per meter squared continuously now
you guys can use it to charge up
hypothetical electric cars but I didn't
see any plugged in before but if they
did exist you could do it but normally
people want the sent the energy at times
associated with the human circadian
rhythm like wanting to put on the lights
at night so so that's the idea now the
space mirrors have their own laws of how
why things have to be big because in a
space mirror the problem is that the Sun
has a diameter of one and a half million
kilometers and it's a hundred and fifty
million kilometers away so elementary
mathematics is that it subtends an angle
of about point O one radians and if
you're forty thousand kilometres up in
space and geostationary orbit the spot
size of the Sun that you're going to
project onto the earth because you
preserve that divergence angle from
Snell's law of reflection is about 400
kilometers that's huge so even though
you might have a lot of area of sunlight
it's going to be distributed over a long
period of time what is being shown in
this interior panel is that the Russians
already did a relevant experiment the
zoom idea satellite which was basically
you had astronauts in the mirror it is
waning days supervising an experiment
we're big plastic a circle reflected
sunlight onto the earth they did two
experiments one of them worked and the
other one didn't deploy but the one that
work that was reported in the world
press as a shining light with about the
intensity of the moon moving across
Europe was seen in many capitals the
reason it only had the intensity of the
moon is the reason I gave you before
there's a great hit that you take on
intensity because of the beam divergence
that doesn't mean we should rule it out
for a planetary scale but it has a big
influence on what to do first in
developing solar power and that's what
I'm really interested in what's an
evolutionary path for getting there I'm
not going to dwell on this but I do want
to say that
there's some people who want to put
things in space for different reasons
associated with global warming than
actually generating power one idea is
that there are various points five of
them that co rotate with the earth as it
goes around the Sun they're called
Lagrangian points and one of those
points l1 the first Lagrangian point
always maintains this is a point where
if you put something it stays there
although you might have to stabilize it
it might be it might not be stable at
that point but it's basically rotating
around so if you had something at l1 it
would stay between the Earth and the Sun
as the earth went around the Sun it
might look like a big sunspot but you
have to make it very big and
calculations have been made including by
my colleague Ken cooled era of Carnegie
global ecology institute who's here
right now that show that if you
compensated for the global warming of
the earth from burning fossil fuel and
mostly fossil fuel to get the twelve
terawatts by a reflector in space that
reflected a comparable amount of
sunlight to the perturbation in the
Earth's radiant of energy balance that
happened because of the global warming
you could neutralize the Global War II
but it would have to be huge and there
was a talk for example given by this guy
Roger Angell we have a cloud of randomly
positioned fliers 10,000 kilometers in
diameter blocking the Sun it's again a
mega project you know comparable to this
battlestar galactica very interesting
intellectually but you know not
something that we're ready to do in
three to five years i'm going to talk
about something that we can do in three
to five years i'm going to skip the all
of these curves which are very
interesting but i don't have enough time
you guys should have asked me to give
you a course but that's another story
the the the question of course comes up
in I mean this is a problem that has all
sorts of considerations from basic
physics to but you know to add to
economics to to the to the site to
psychology to ergonomics
you know to all sorts of things that
come into it but cost is a big factor
and normally people talk about the price
of the solar module how many dollars per
kilowatt installed is one measure and
you can translate that into how many
cents per kilowatt hour and and this is
sort of a log-log curve of the the
dollars per kilowatt installed versus
cumulative production these are cooled
learning-by-doing curves was developed
in n rah the National Renewable Energy
Lab and on this logarithmic scale it
comes down according to some power law
but it's not coming down fast enough to
get to where we want it solar panels are
still around five thousand dollars per
kilowatt or five dollars a watt but it's
not a real wat i mean that's based on
having an intensity of a thousand watts
per meter squared on a solar panel
that's the way it's calibrated when they
tell when when you want to know how much
it costs you never have a thousand watts
per meter squared maybe once a day you
normally have much less and the averages
about 200 watts per meter squared so
solar panels are still pretty expensive
when you compare it with let's say a
coal-fired power plant which is going to
cost you seven hundred dollars a
kilowatt for 70 cents let's say a watt
and we have to get down to that or we
are told by people in market during
market economics market fundamentalists
but that's the way the economics should
work that's another problem I have a lot
of problems with market fundamentalists
I'm not going to talk about that either
yet so terrestrial solar which includes
both wind and PV both have this problem
of intermittency a lot of the things
that I'm talking about actually are sort
of front wine research activities and
people are working on them Christina
archer who's in the audience right now
just did a study of wind energy now wind
is very
it's fluctuating there there there are
our two hour variations in the output in
a given location of a wind turbine and
so there's a question of whether you
have to store the energy to make it a
smooth power source and we're talking
about remember scaling up the renewable
energy option to the point where it can
power the world we're looking at a
different problem that a lot of people
are looking at which is can you make any
money out of solar energy by using net
metering we have the grit to back you up
the question is what if renewables are
the grid what if we really want to have
a steady state sustainable civilization
when we're not going to be using fossil
fuel can we do it with renewables and
that's a totally different question in
the case of seasonal energy use there's
a mismatch in the case of wind because
you normally in the US you have your
peak demand coming in in the summertime
and the minimum of the winds is in also
in the summertime the maximum is in the
wintertime that's because the winds on
earth are driven by something called the
thermal wind equation which controls the
jet stream and it's why it took me an
hour and a half longer to fly here from
New York that the fly back that's
another story you're not going to hear
much about I want to say this that
Denmark which is the world leader in
wind electricity has twenty percent
penetration of their energy market but
they back up their intermittent wins
with pumped storage that's hydropower we
pump it up an impoundment and the reason
they were able to do it is they're
integrated with Norway which is one
hundred percent hydro we don't have that
in the United States so we would need
some kind of storage seasonal or in the
case of solar diurnal or even shorter
for periods where we don't have solar
I'm going to skip this as some very
interesting technologies for the storage
of terrestrial solar and wind the
different talk do want to show this
comparison of terrestrial vs. space
solar the upper panel shows the solar
energy of
elbow at some location this one happens
to be in the united kingdom vs time of
day when watts per meter squared versus
the solar constant thirteen hundred and
seventy watts per square meter
continuously in space so the difference
between the availability is very clear
you can see the seasonal differences
from a junior versus a December average
and the night time average so so you can
see the basic philosophy here is people
say what do we have to go to space
what's wrong with terrestrial solar we
just build a lot of soul around the
earth the masik pointer that has to be
terrestrial solar and we very strongly
advocate them but for baseload power the
challenges for ground solar are many
ways harder than space by power the
total solar energy at a typical site is
much less than it is in space and the
energy varies widely with seasonality
and daily and base load using ground
solar requires a substantial over
capacity and costly large-scale energy
storage or global distribution networks
like the global grid that Buckminster
Fuller had envisioned at some point I'm
going to skip these they're all very
interesting but I'm going to skip them
and go to this to these curves I don't
have a laser pointer so just imagine
that you see a dot moving around that's
red it's a laser we're going to end up
with lasers and and I also what I
apologize for the for the low contrast
between the white writing actually
doesn't even look right here looks like
it's light blue and the green background
that will be corrected in the next
version Marty hofford 2 point 0 or
something we'll have that fixed but I'm
comparing three guys here the three
systems for conveying solar radiation to
the earth in all cases I'm assuming that
the satellite is in geostationary orbit
not low Earth orbit geostationary orbit
40,000 kilometers
and that's their the reason is that
although we have looked at a lot of
systems that use low Earth orbit they
have a lot of advantages because if it's
closer the the beam divergence doesn't
spread the beam as much and there are a
lot of good things about it the bad
thing is that you have to constantly
slew the beam and change its angle and
you take an enormous hit in the
efficiency of the transmission of the
energy so all these are for space so for
collecting the energy in orbit a simple
mirror like the Russian experiment
except that can be multiplied hundreds
of thousands of times in terms of the
area if you wanted to do it that way
would spread its beam so that it would
have 400 kilometers worth between three
and four hundred kilometers leme spot
size on the earth now this might work if
we wanted to power the whole earth with
mirrors because you could work it out
that if you put enough mirrors in space
and they all were focused on this spot
size it could pretty much power the
entire Earth but it takes a huge capital
investment to get there the same thing
in certain sense is true of microwaves
the original space solar power concept
of the 70s which had remember a
one-kilometer transmitting antenna and a
receiver that was showing it here as of
order of 10 kilometers and remember this
is governed by diffraction the upper one
is governed by geometric optics that
governs the spreading for microwaves and
lasers geometric optics governs the
spreading that is that the beam spreads
proportional to the wave length divided
by the aperture size so the microwaves
which have the big wavelengths even if
you have a big aperture this assumes a
one-kilometer aperture in space the spot
size is 10 kilometers but if you do with
lasers the laser has a wavelength of 1
micron or less and even if the
transmitter is small in this case 80
centimeters the spot size is relatively
small if you had an array of PV cells at
the surface of the earth you could
transmit to that array and preexisting
array
and do that pretty efficiently and
actually my son Eric and I have worked
on this problem and we have made a
specific proposal to develop a
geostationary satellite that we go up
into space it would take one payload of
a conventional launcher which exists
when one metric ton payload that's the
size of the satellite and it would
deploy an ultralight photovoltaic array
perhaps an inflatable structure and take
that electricity and beam it through a
100 kilowatt solid-state diode laser and
to be received at the surface of the
earth and that would be a very
interesting demonstration we think we
could do that in a few years the
microwave guys and there are microwave
guys who want to do this experiment and
they were interesting microwave
experiments to do with the International
Space Station and so forth i'm not going
to focus on that now again an oath
enough time but but i'm using this sort
of as a reason for understanding that
whatever we do should take advantage of
and be cognizant of the underlying
physics of the problem because it should
emerge naturally from the physics if it
doesn't it's unlikely to be successful
sometimes the physics helps you
sometimes it hurts you yes I'm sorry to
have kept going please yeah can you get
a smaller I don't think you can beat it
because if you can use you can use a
concave mirror uh it you can do that if
it's in the if it's close by if it's in
the near field you can probably do it
but if you're using you're talking about
the mirror that will help you with the
diffraction problem but it won't really
help you with the spot size problem you
can actually never get rid of the
divergence of the of the Sun angle
between the two sides now that why that
is it's something we could have a long
discussion about it would violate the
second law of thermodynamics because
this but the heat that you would
generate from the sun's rays on a
surface can never be hotter than the sir
the son that amidst an energy and the
Sun is like a black body at 6,000
degrees Kelvin if you could eliminate
that divergence you could focus the
sun's energy optically on a spot that
would be hotter than the surface of the
Sun and that would mean that heat was
flowing from a cold surface to a hot
surface anyway it's a very interesting
question the answer is not obvious and I
get would understand if you didn't
believe it but we should we should
discuss that with wine great question
what was the other question that you
have another question that was it okay
well remember when you're using a lens
you can converge the Rays of the Sun but
your distal distance is peanuts compared
to the you know the other distance so
the lenses are basically
diffraction-limited whereas the mirrors
are limited by geometric optics that
mirror is also are limited by
diffraction but the diffraction is a
much smaller part of the problem than
the beam spreading the base of problem
is that the Sun is an extended luminous
object it's not a point for a start to
become a point it has to become far
enough away that the diffraction effect
would overcome the geometric optics
effect and okay yeah
do you have in the laser okay that's a
good question two lasers were always
going to be very inefficient but
recently probably thanks to a
combination of consumer electronics and
and fiber optics and a tense military
interest we now have diode lasers that
have laboratory measured efficiencies of
fifty percent now normally lasers are
around two or three percent but the way
the diet I mean these are electrically
pumped diode lasers so they're basically
semiconductor sandwiches they're like
light emitting diodes but the light
emitting diode goes into a resident
optical cavity and and not only do we
have those diode lasers at relatively
high efficiency but they can handle
fairly high powers in fact I have a
graph I probably won't get to it because
I'm very time limited that DARPA at
recently had a competition to develop a
hundred kilowatt laser for a battlefield
operation again this gets into the whole
question of why we spend huge amounts of
monies to kill each other but we don't
have enough money to survive as a
civilization on a long-term basis but
but actually that's what's been driving
our civilizations for since world war
two has been all this money that's been
pumped in through the mainly through the
military and that eventually spilled out
into the civil sector so we have these
lasers this anyway I was getting to this
Northrop Grumman just built a factory in
redondo beach california to mass produce
100 kilowatt lasers they did this with
DARPA funding so we think we can get an
existing off-the-shelf laser for an
experiment like this and I'll show you
some pictures later on of ultralight
photovoltaic arrays that could be
deployed in space some of them would be
inflatable we think the technology to do
this experiment was actually pretty
doable in near term
and it would utilize surface
photovoltaic cells that would already
exist and and also the efficiency of
conversion on the other end on the
surface end would be very high because
photovoltaic cell efficiency is limited
by the fact that if the cell has a
single band gap which characterizes the
wavelength at which it absorbs a photon
then the photon of exactly that
wavelength hits it it's a absorbed with
efficiency one if it's less than that
doesn't absorb if it's more than that it
absorbs that way that energy but they
rejects the other energy and that's
where the theoretical peak efficiency of
PV cells with about twenty-five percent
or whatever it is comes from for single
band gap because the solar spectrum
isn't one wet one frequency it's
distributed over a whole spectrum now
with a laser it is monochromatic so you
could set it up so to tune the laser to
transmit at something close to the
frequency of the band gap in the surface
PV array and absorb that fairly
efficiently that combined with the
relatively more efficient PV makes the
laser feasible you're still taking a big
hit in transmitting the energy the set
the most efficient thing might still be
to do it with just simple mirrors in
space except we just can't afford the
bill these 400 kilometer size arrays and
we can do this in the near term and we
might be able to do an experiment where
for example we could beam energy to an
African village which something I'd like
to to demonstrate to you know to run
their light bulbs were to their or their
computers so that you know they could go
on to the Google search engine and
whatever it is to you know that that
that's one of the reasons anyway all
these are really great questions let me
I'm going to try to finish up early
because I have a lot of stuff but it's
all basically variations on this theme
that this is another laser idea in this
particular case the laser beam is
converging now the reason you can do it
is this is not this is
diffraction-limited that's really not
image limited we're using a laser
this idea by the way was developed by a
broad height and lower wood at Lawrence
Livermore these are guys who worked on
laser using lasers as anti-ballistic
defense technologies and of course that
never worked out but we spent hundreds
of billions on it but we did get the
technology from it and in this
particular design you know the foot the
photovoltaic cells would absorb the
photons they would transmit through a
fairly large lens this would be a flat
Fornell lens so would it might be easy
to manufacture it and that could be
beamed that spots on the earth that
would be relatively small again each of
these is a whole story in and of itself
there are experiments that have already
been done at Mount Holly hockey in Maui
and again this was under SDI funding
where people have fired lasers through
telescopic optics at satellites that
were over flying here's an experiment on
the left this was the laser relay mira
experiment where a laser was fired
through telescopic optics it it also had
adaptive optics I won't dwell on that
but that compensates for the turbulence
in the atmosphere and a satellite was
over flying it with a reflector it hit
the reflector and the beam bounced back
to another location on the surface of
the island a few hundred kilometers away
and it continued to track the beam even
as the satellite was moving the idea was
to demonstrate the pointing and tracking
accuracy of laser beams and with this
kind of efficiency we think we can do
something like this for from space from
geostationary orbit which is basically
motionless relative to the earth hear
some more hardware people have built
thin-film structures with solar panels
and printed on them and actually tested
them in space I'm sorry for the
distortion on this
but that try to get your brains around
that if possible the upper panels show
some of the technologies I'm what I'm
basically trying to show is it this is
existing technology and that's why we
want to focus on this for for space of a
power demonstrator this is a group
that's developed a lot of these guys
we're working with the European Space
Agency but this is a available
technology ultra light photovoltaic
arrays in space the metric here is how
many kilowatts of power can you generate
per kilogram and you want that number to
be high so let's say I wanted to
generate three hundred kilowatts just
for the sake of argument and if I could
get one kilowatt per kilogram that would
weigh 300 kilograms and I might still be
able to get something that would be
under one metric ton even if I had a
fifty percent efficiency or less than
that with a with a laser I might be able
to deliver even 50 kilowatts at the
surface of the earth that would be very
very interesting experiment to do I
could probably do that with these arrays
there are still problems to be solved
like inflating them the other question
is when we first proposed this a lot of
people said there is no hundred kilowatt
laser that will do this job but it turns
out that those lasers were being
developed by DARPA and and this is an
information that's available now that
this phase three program the with Rob
Grumman has actually built a factory in
redondo beach to make diode lasers 100
kilowatt diode lasers and these are for
battle field operations eventually
they're going to perhaps it is alleged
replace other kinds of weapons on the
battlefield yes sir CW
100 kilowatts CW well it's a long story
but DARPA is actually known when it
works right for delivering a new
technology CW means continuous wave or
continuous as opposed to pulse okay okay
listen oh they'll probably have
generally in tanks or something you know
yeah I mean these were not designed for
solar power satellites but after what
why is that different than any of the
other technology that we got from the
military I mean we didn't we didn't
really the military did not develop
lasers so so so that we could have CDs
and music record is the military did not
develop supercomputer so we could have
really cool animated movies from
computer graphics it's basically because
the military excites the part of our
brain that triggers the fight-or-flight
response the amygdala this little organ
that's about the size of an almond that
causes us a rationally to fear our
enemies and write checks for a lot of
money for people to do research and then
we take that and divert it to the
peaceful functioning of our society and
that that's basically the way our
society works and that's the big
argument that I always have with
classical market economists because they
think that what happens is that price
signals will come into play and that
will cause people to invent things that
will overcome the price signals but in
fact you could show that almost none of
the important technology that drives our
civilization from commercial aircraft to
lasers to microwave microwaves and and
and solar and and satellite community
telecommunications and the Internet of
course which 30 years was supported by
by DARPA and NSF until the Wall Street
Journal guy to hold of it and said look
at the market system works so well so
that one's
alright okay this has to do with the
spite of costs of space transportation
again this has a lot I want to have some
discussion so I'm going to actually go
through this very fast there are a lot
of advanced technologies that could drop
the course of space transportation the
operative thing is this the the amount
of energy that it takes to get into
low-earth orbit is about 32 mega joules
per kilogram and it's about 60 mega
joules per kilogram for geostationary
orbit that amount of energy is about the
same order of magnitude within a factor
of two the energy that it takes to fly a
kilogram of mass from New York to Los
Angeles on a commercial airliner on the
airliner most of the energy goes to
overcoming drag if for the spacecraft it
mostly comes to supplying the kinetic
energy of the orbit but the costs are
different by factors of thousands or
tens of thousands why is that there's
nothing fundamental about that most
transportation systems eventually
stabilize around three or four times the
cost of the energy to put them into
place and and there are various ways
that this might work though at the end
of that rainbow is something called the
space elevator where you would actually
have a tether that would be very long
that would be actually it would not only
be the length of geostationary orbit but
we'd go out way beyond geostationary
orbit and if you do the dynamical
analysis the forces that it would be
acting on that cable would be pulling
the cable towards the earth below geo
and pulling the cable away from the
earth away from geo but the cable has to
be very strong and it was pure science
fiction until the development of carbon
nanotubes which are 200 times higher in
their strength to weight ratio than
steel there might be problems that these
nanotubes might be attacked by by
atmospheric chemistry and there are a
lot of other issues but if you could do
that I mean there's not there's now a
basis in engineering
where you could build something like
this and the reason I bring it up is I
mean that would tremendously reduce the
cost of getting into space because you
basically ride up to space in an
elevator a kind of skyhook where this
you know this rope like would be coming
down from heaven and you would get on it
and it you would write up in an elevator
it would take you to jail once you're a
Geo as robert hansen Heinlein one of the
great science fiction writers of all
time said geo is halfway to any place in
the universe and you could certainly
build solar power satellites from there
but I'm not saying we should wait for
solar power so for space elevators for
solar power salaries when I am saying is
if we start building an infrastructure
in Gaea where we have lasers or ready
the space elevator concept is based on
having these climbers that move up the
cable and they get their power from
lasers there are laser beams that are
beaming powered to them so that they can
move up and bring construction materials
you could start doing that right away
they wouldn't have to be long enough to
reach the earth they might just be a
couple of kilometers in length but you
would already have the lasers in space
and you could begin to build an
infrastructure in geostationary orbit
that could eventually have a spate via
space elevator at the same time that you
would begin to be building the
infrastructure of space solar power so
my wonderful number one said son eric
said there don't forget the the slide
that has to do with costs because the
people at Google are going to be very
interested in the costs and I'm not sure
that's true but let's say it's true even
today you can do an analysis again I
don't have time to go through and
justify it but there were parameters
that enter the analysis the power per
unit mass you can generate the
efficiency of the transmission through
the atmosphere the efficiency of storing
the energy on the ground if you have a
ground based system the intensity of the
solar energy in space the intensity on
the ground the capital cost of the
photovoltaic cells and dollars
kilowatt in space and on the ground if
you put all of those together and do an
analysis where you say comparing the
cost of ground-based solar with
space-based solar with the space-based
solar costs of the course of lifting
something into orbit plus operating it
there at a higher solar insolation
versus the cost of building it on the
earth but you have to pay for the
storage and it's primarily because solar
PV is so damn expensive now that the
lift lifting costs are a relatively
small part of the whole thing there it's
almost a break-in situation now at
launch courts to $15,000 a kilogram
which you can buy launches to g2g o on
Russian and Chinese launchers right now
now we could go over this in more detail
anyone who's interested I could send you
the talk I could send you a white paper
which elaborates on all of these numbers
but I want to actually end soon I have a
lot of wonderful stuff but this is a
study that was done by a group of the
European Space Agency showing that you
could supply the electrical demand curve
of all of Europe with a solar power
satellite based on lasers and the energy
would be collected in the Sahara Desert
and we're this very little cloudiness
excuse me and it would be conveyed by
high-voltage direct high-voltage DC
power lines to Europe and based on a
number of assumptions that are built
into the systems analysis including
those cost curves the warning by doing
curves how PV costs will will drop over
time the cost of spaceflight all the
parameter costs this turns out to be an
economically viable option the question
is should orthin's or space solar pv
provide Europe's electricity by 2030 and
these are very bold questions and I
agree that this whole concept is very
bold and maybe a lot of these
assumptions are going to fall apart but
we can start working on this right
now I want to shut up because I only
have a few minutes and you guys probably
have all sorts of things you want to
criticize about this but I'm going to
stop now yeah yeah yeah to both Japan
and Europe have small budgets for
looking at at solar power satellites did
you want to address that pool because
Paul is one of the authors by the way
lieutenant colonel who is one of the
authors of the space a strategic the
national strategic space office study on
space-based power which was fairly
positive about solar power and maybe you
would like to answer that question
Space Station demonstrator the Indians
Thanks the the Indian government has has
offered up some money to pursue some
demonstrators the Russians have shown
some interest and in various other
countries so we have indications that
they are that they are interested in it
small amounts of many very small amounts
me this is in the US is it even
investigative smaller map buddy yeah
yeah compared to the other thing on all
right I'm sorry yes
hi so I have a couple questions one is
so what are the the reality reality
problems of heat rejection and stability
control for a laser-based inflatable
solar deployed solution that's one
question and how you deal with those and
the other question is how does this
solution for a geo base solar collector
transmitter compared to something like a
lunar based solar collector those are
great questions first of all I'm not
going to be able to answer the question
in detail but I think the important
thing is to make sure that everyone
understands the issue the maintaining
the stability of the of the lasers after
all lasers are very tricky things and
they have optical cavities and
everything they have these lasers by the
way that North Korea Roman is building
have to be stable under battlefield
conditions with bombs going off and
everything so assuming they can match
their specs that I I think that would be
certainly a step in the right direction
yeah but a large inflatable structures
yeah well now okay that there that I I
never said this was easy and I can't
guarantee it's going to work but i think
that there's enough plausibility to
start working on it the heat rejection
problem is an issue you're gonna have to
build solar radiators that are going to
dissipate the excess heat and there and
there's a lot of room for ingenuity and
engineering design on that i'm sorry you
had another question to the other
question just how do you feel that the
solution of a lunar based power okay
yeah well actually one of the inventors
of that Dave Criswell is a friend of
mine and we've been talking about this
for years the lunar the lunar power
satellite has the advantage this is like
a solar power satellite but you build it
on the moon and you don't have to build
a satellite because the moon is already
there you have to transmitting stations
on the two different limbs of the moon
it's based on microwaves and you use the
materials on the moon because the moon
has silica and you can met you have to
build a manufacturing base to do it on
the moon my attitude about that is I
think it's very imaginative and maybe
it's going to happen someday and I think
we have to continue research when NASA
goes back to the moon I think they
should certainly continue to do the
material science research
even if we don't build a lunar power
sound like with the satellite is 400,000
kilometers away we might want to use
lunar materials I mean author see Clark
back in the 1960s figured out that you
know you only need one sixtieth of the
energy to get something to geostationary
orbit from the moon that you have to get
it from the Earth's gravitational
potential well so why don't you build an
electromagnetic mass launcher and there
and at one point NASA did have research
going on in material science trying to
build photovoltaic cells out of the
materials of the moon it's very
important I tried to focus this talk on
an immediate next step experimentally
this is not the last word but it might
be the first word it might help the
galvanized sufficient interest to
continue the program there are a lot of
ways we talked a lot about how to
jumpstart space solar power is another
idea just to create an X Prize for
wireless power transmission again I
don't have a will of time to lab rate
that I just want to give you guys a
taste of what we are thinking about
sure so they can wait I just wanted to
make a fog
the report air this is from the National
Space National Service base office we
looked at space solar power as strategic
implications of it
we look at some a solar power from the
strategic implications can we enable
space solar power as a way for us to
avoid resource conflicts in the future
and to enable the United States as a
energy exporter instead of em course so
I invite you to take a look at the
report it's on the National so National
Space Society website it's NSS dork you
have to kind of I'm not exactly sure
where the link is but it's it's fairly
prominent on their webpage but it gives
you a fairly good primer on space solar
power it's not nearly is technical is
this but it gives you a very wide base
as two and two of the things that the
report is advocating is that you need to
do continuing studies on this we need to
do demonstrators the right now space
solar power doesn't have a whole it
doesn't fall within the Viennese realm
we just did this as a quick look study
doesn't necessarily fall under doee
Department of Energy
so we are looking for a place for space
solar power to have home and to continue
the efforts thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
