okay um sense of kami um I'm actually a
little bit anxious about you know keep
on talking Google because Google now has
we're famous name so today I will talk
about part of my recent at least working
in school learning image patch
representation for scene recognition
from photos and object tracking a
dynamic football background in traction
in videos so I just give you like how
the problem try to solve fortune I
cannot show you the original photos in
my database such as show you how rich
looks like so on websites indoor around
outside outdoor so people can eat it as
hell but perform a computer point wheel
on accurately the oh I'm sorry the back
corner on the left actually are you know
low local skill immediate scale-space I
see you to confuse with some kind of sky
and on the red side the the red brick
wall actually can also have 18 door so
it's comfy it's kind of confusing for
computers so the next program is seem
different but actually I will later I'll
show you it can be solving the same word
framework so how do you think is they've
gotten out like a like if you're going
to task what kind of like a technique
which I'm try to use to sell the
apartment check the like a human working
in this case I'm not sure its neck you
know I just want to make sure it's not
an IU problem so this video has some
deep body because the lighting
conditions are awesome i canno contrast
knees between foreground background and
also the people you're working so it's
you can now have a fixed template and
you just try to search the face pics
template and also you mean sing okay the
camera is fixed so maybe I can't detect
the background and just with some kind
of nice abstraction we can find form but
actually that too moving up with at
least you know the two people working
and the car moving in the video and also
even this
is because the low construction business
for going back going is no easy job so
on the red side of you and our sequence
it's like a captured by the hand here
the camera so camera now static so you
can I use the background information and
also the two-person have some kind of
illusion so I think the hard part is for
like contribution people my philosophy
to try to solve this problem is based on
two parts first is the shoot boy image
representation and I feel like if we can
find a suitable email invitation the
computer Hanuman can be very simple the
combination of the two seeing the actual
cancel no trivial problems so this is
the real map of my talk I will use the
target we just talked about like what we
sync the problem and what's the idea we
want to solve the problem but not too
much focus on the implement it helps but
handsome in kashien order so why min
patches encounter recent literature in
the last two decades it's a long history
for future flavor candle algorithms so
well most famous paper is famous
features hurts feature which is
basically connor features so find the
local region you will find there too
greedy directions and there will be
we're filming sift features we handle
local FM notion numerius so it's univ
for object recognition objection i kept
its own apical features i will stretch
it very simple just first of all we said
all we ask user to decide what's the
image regional interest then we just cut
them into patches we can order to image
the Idaho I we counted them as a set of
Amida patches so then we're trying to
build a model density model known
precisely over the set oh you mean
patches so it's a intermediary solution
compare is like a direct human master
you track the whole thing you track
image oh you use kar diya mainu features
compared with tech features on the thing
is like a the human unity people use it
so normally this news cerrito guarantee
you can almost funny now features and
you cannot guarantee the sino feature
can across town so you know case we just
sample them so it's always you know it's
flexible we all see how have you doubt
data we have okay so yeah so the Union
modeling apartment like a regional
interest we count them into cut them
into pieces then we can build a density
model this model come in nonparametric
can be parametric can you send
semi-parametric demands okay the first
job I have done like a using image patch
of representation is foreseen
recognition so what scene recognition
given image like one computer to tell
thus indoor/outdoor you can be acting in
some kind of sync category but I was
just you for you know air outdoors so
all these things like its general like a
classification problem is really depends
on what kind of humid it is your place
but this actually might work one was
some are even in the macro cell research
so I did the photo collection work so i
basically clack this photo from 43 I'm
sure photograph I signika you know just
like article like homo you know like
home users it's over five years it's
from 1999-2000 for with jubblies removed
we can be honored working inside it can
be 200 tucson pixel x 27 pixel they can
be 100 pixel x 100 pixel so it can be to
convert your camera can be taken by film
camera than your skin so it's still not
enough data but you know this tool i
think the natural aging class variation
is the most challenging for this proper
I hope like a you know maybe future we
can build a we're compressing and you
database out publicly available so for
the baseline um why I call the two level
approaches huh I personally like a like
texin approach so this is actually a
taksim thing what's tectum so from the
human perception
in 1970s people think when they do the
texture recognition you think I'll
detector we can all see textures
actually a combination I'll feel you
seen your part and you just like a light
you know light is RGB just three
elements right it's kind of like a any
light use a combination their linear
combination on a linear combination of
this to think all these three basic
things so we have unit patches then we
either supervised to a even a pest class
classification our way to a clustering
if we do not have labels so this thing
will be taken an intermediary solution
intermediate representation with Kali
Tecton then the photo will be a 2
tribution overseas tech tones over its
kind of cave key elements I personally
think like a for complex which will
recognition program tech to me the very
good idea because if you think things
directly from the whole photo skill the
thing is aware different you know its
large variation can a lot of them where
well but if you can cut them into local
elements actually I think the property
is more feasible not tractable because
it's some hello any complex thing can be
a converted into a teacher building over
simple elements okay how the in this faq
particular work which shows the
supervisor worship worship voice we
choose supervised working is we also
interested attacked like something with
seminal meaning like a wall of face
enough a scale entry here across some
kind of building so a see EG of the arm
tonight craft you mean regions and i
just saw some random sample from them
it's a purely random so the b.f de th is
randoms in Apaches so you can see this
random patch is actually definitely not
in the same looking so but unique is it
might work I don't know we care about
some kind of their protection or
whatever I just keeps them because you
in should have a density model so I I
just you know keep a thing in this
model is a mixture density model
multi-model so I don't really care about
this so it's also the side the sense
actually is very critical you know our
Commission 25 by 25 but I I do some
errands like a from 15 to 40 doesn't
really matter because this thing is
something you have to determine its like
a witch's skill the perception is the
more uniform ally is either you know
actually the boat between different
classes yes you can see that yes so
given this density model I for any new
imaging scan patches and each Apache
will give me a response I have like a 20
different material classes so each class
will give me a curry level image
actually you know it's not a one to 255
it's a real value so this how it
actually looks like so the lighter denim
is her response and west of us so now
let's talk about our hobby different
features how you can be patchy so this
week and no information color texture
and color protectors it's very natural
way and you may experience I think for
like general recognition case the
current space does not make much
difference i justa to RGB which is the
simplest one and also the technical
texture T Square will be based on fear
bands so this corpse you how the future
times looks like it's actually from the
tectum paper by flow and Molly so
basically there's some kind of cover
filter Indian scalp irritation demon
faces and the teg filter Gaussian filter
so another increases hardik features
hardly future with some local status
computed from pairs or email pics under
some special special configuration so
it's just too popular brands but I
already features not you general use
protection okay so given these features
we the first step we want added validate
our
to see what's a recognition rate if we
just want recognized patches not photos
so the pace line will be I just using
these features using newspapers so I
have some super learning case I cut them
into training set and the testing set so
here you just give you no impression how
the different feature looks like so here
because we have like a trees I
color in the car is just pretty much
same so the color color feature actually
do work worst job but this really depend
on you know our artificial selection all
material classes so in my Akron hardik
future for our color is slightly better
than pure band-pass colors so color even
be in touch help the New York is armed
actually I Deb measure we develop in
nips 2004 which are supervised learning
case to the stupid in case so it's very
simple you just using a linear
discriminant analysis the project this
material the seeming patches according
to the material classes so it's 20
classes project them in the lower to be
no space then you fit a consummate model
within each category within each
material class okay so this how the
thing looks like after you know when
you're done is described in 20 density
model so compared with the last figure i
think the performance change allowed
especially for the when you have like a
mall samples it's like the smooth nice
smooth the density model offer you the
smoothness in the feature space does
help so i should say random travel is
fair percent you need to keep you a tiny
class classification problem so this is
a confusion matrix right okay the before
and after their the
go back previous slide please this way
so you're talking about the features I
didn't understand what the actual thing
that happens after the features we've
got a mixture model for each class still
oh yes we first said projects am using
how da well that's what you have in two
slides from knows that what you're also
doing here now this one is just based on
nearest neighbors after we have a
feature described nur muchachos us leave
our nucleus is new universe as a pigeon
i right so then you have another yeah
experiment where you get done yeah some
sort of a mixture model yes unless
that's not based on the LDA but some
other sort of more you basically be
collect up all the examples you can or
you can class and then treno a mixture
model for each class and need a class
conditional densities class web based on
that yes yes a planetary model by the
ways try to compare the discriminating
on information into the cut because here
we have labels right let's presumably
that boys do something but I'm just
curious to see if we've done an
experiment where you compare what advice
you using a candidate yes yes you can do
more if you go yeah any I believe like
any good comfort any code of mercenary
animal should be a combination of
generative management model and
discrimination Molly's there is an area
which is dragging and go row so i guess
my question was do you are you show an
experiment the comparison yeah like
these two figures show the performance
this figure compared with Miss figure so
it's a very simple comparison for us and
you have a third maybe you don't have it
here but have you done another
experiment where rather than try to do
in an Lda base yeah I've issue or
something else you just likelihood-based
make sure fixed your bidding yes yes yes
so you've done it but do yeah it's open
I was still saying as an open problem i
will show you some examples but nothing
you did a little bit around the all the
technique are connected so I was sure
you let her I idea how I was having kind
of comparison or evaluation on TV
antenna master so given is like you know
we called appropriate necessary response
map like a you know real value like
reliable images right which I come from
somewhere simple moments feature over
them so the first order monitor is just
the weight how much the same exist in
this photo well the first powder will be
the mean position and the second order
would be the what's area so actually you
know we we only use the zero order in
the first order because our photo is
that's not how we structure is you know
can is wear a message structure so the
structure new permit does not have much
we have so after this we have Felicia
photo by our 20 plus study molecular
batteries so six eight dimensional 60
mention signals of 60 a vector a feature
vector of 60 components for each photo
like so here we use our the arcade it's
the same thing but here it's only
difference called aconitine distinct
category then because is it after you
transform the thing equal or communal
subspace now you want to a
classification in terms instead of this
estimation so you can use it like a
network in Kimmy's or cosmic remodel oh
you know this is just very general thing
you can try and somehow I won't try some
very simple thing at her first ok I
think this is a very interesting picture
because LD a bigger here is a see the
class number is to write so Eddie at the
most attention of the most
dimensionality a camp que vos SI minus
wise is here so here every photo no
matter of size no matter what it looks
like the county know when the instinct
alone
so without concern this scaled curves so
this thing actually are the histograms
how this one dimension signal to tribute
either along the way along x-axis so in
this case I just have a very simple way
to determine the Palestine bomber I just
fit them a skill the worsening of
Gaussian function then it's an instant
you know it's a very naive way but it's
you know the general you can try first
you all be not shown something is belong
to a Gaussian function so the
interesting part will be the where the
yellow bars so the little prob will tell
you the DC burning is when this news 1
dimensional space sorry ok need my
question sort of make sense but you're
getting one dimensional feature here is
just like one of the LDA projections is
that what this is right when you get a
one dimensional if you'd uld has like a
basically two steps our pca right so the
last step up is they actually tell you
what's the final dimensions normally we
need to do a selection over the model
second step on how many dimension you
want but the theory of the theoretical
pounder out the Anunnaki will seem
answer to a C minus one is a maximum
substrates dimension you can offer you
so here is C equal to two we have only
two classes so you can only have one
tomato thing though and no further all
so sorry so this is we're talking about
linear just Fisher when you yes yes yes
here so this is successively finding
projections which maximize the linear
separation classes and these classes now
are described by features that are
higher dimensional yes oh yes so the
number of classes is too you're saying
yes called endure our doors okay so
you're just doing one projection is that
yes in this case yes one projection I
just your one part chain you can do
multi projections but motive corrosion
is not don't that don't mean LG you can
offer you know several spaces it's like
we have you can choose a random lda you
know based on bootstrapping and based on
random services so basically like a use
slack
set of training data I'll subset of your
cyberspace is when you to the first pc
pc you know how do is a two-step pc
right all right first maybe we can talk
about your loved one the offline can
tell how to stop line here in pc or two
different beasts yes yes no yes but you
can understand you can become extinct
about LD is a tuesday to CPC your copy
last video two times yeah okay with you
try like at some handle begging we carry
class fares by some randomness so i
won't talk about too much about this
thing that we can talk is offline i
believe they can just kind of local rap
master can give you a multi-model and
you know audi is an optimal for a single
model then density do densities so I
believe this this randomness can offer
you to model not a multi multi
introduction because my work is always
trying to model like a complex density
model so these are the house the random
lda looks like actually in other indoor
case all the random algae is performing
a of the performance is very good I mean
based on level on database so the
posting does not know the packing master
does not give you much improvement over
the our classification rate but I have
some like iron is out i want to show you
here but you know by we go to multiple
sing collaborations this packing master
does help but i won't show you here
because i don't think it's very
important so what can go wrong so that
give you like to imagine I are gonna
make error so I'm rest on left on the
left right on the left side is a human
standing sitting in front
13 but if you have a close where you
will find the Kearney's the middle
artificial leaves so anchoring kind of
based on the color and the khaki
remember you cannot tell there are few
leaves or real lives because you know
you can have red color leaves also on
our website on wrestle is like a you
know we can detect memos and a human
skin but we make a wrong decision over
the back one week we consider some kind
of car copied so copy the show you
considering Union without actually
saying so you're just my impression
about a simple lda where the work so i
get an hour because we are building
blocks over lda so early actually deal
where you fit is simple but it did aware
it affect your work on the future
seduction you know we have like the
emotional over these 20 motocross is so
i already automatically tell you which
class is more important will do our
certain classification task let's see
you know women can be either in other
world or indoors so it's not quite
irrelevant away this window in order
classification but sky water maybe they
make much difference okay yeah
definitely
so yeah I just really like a bush is
wearing a thong to become filled with
trees and the cover is a very difficult
on measurement I mean we even nau in
this like a standard appearance more
than you think the carpet is not a
well-formulated toss obviously like it's
a really called task when you try to
reckon it copied you know for human face
or whatever maybe you know not
structured data not structure the
pattern is easier okay so yeah we can
have this okay so talk about database
there amalfi the three different kind of
database of the canal show you too much
about our database is like for some
reason so and also contacted by a
database is not a public invaluable the
tool works in the Kodiak database I
should mention why is by peacock in
1985's based on block-based semester
it's cut each photo into like a four by
four blocks of five by five blocks it
doesn't really matter so you know the
thing category for the photo right so
you classify this you just treat these
blocks blocks as representation for you
nor plugs auto blocks give a new image
you cut them into blocks and for each
pup you make a new sleeper
classification the reg you will decide
this park is in order then majority
voting will work this image go to neural
coding in due order but the problem is
as state from lost paper this will be
this performance is highly depend on the
duplicates they have actually a lot of
duplicates dislike the image like a one
by one by one an iron another so you
know it's heading dependable and also
happy with the blocks just on the right
way to go because it's still too big to
be model actively and another thing is
like a colorado-based which is widely
used by the cover their bases
it taken by professional photographers
which make a lot of difference all the
image our eight colors sexual routine
and also you have a nice structure of
the photo so i think is either for i
should reach crime i don't know where
that I think it's either big base so so
it's not a very fair comparison because
everyone working on you know counting
everyone working on your own database
they do not share the base publicly so
it's just internal numbers what number
is not that bad it's one of the best I
was I would say but I'm not confident to
say this thing is the best because
there's no comparison you know fair
comparison so yeah I also see this
should be civilized taxable unsuppressed
axle so actually you know forum Alex
papers unsecured by clustering so Justin
are an interesting paper using like a
piercing hair care models to go to this
intermediary plantation which did call
seams which is that comparable to the
text home with much more compact
techniques but I would really want to
try in the future as see this compact
model that's imperor wrecking it or not
so actually the most popular database i
would say is pascal from european
audience and also a mighty they have a
large database live there is a lot of
manual at a notation i still like a pin
you some human augmentation like a
teaching computer by soon and by example
you can use for you cannot just do
purely unsupervised learning case
because you know its trick I think it's
about tricky so of course the country
dog will be somewhere between so it
should we cannot show computer example
casio damn few example then make a
computer have algorithm to generate
these few examples in your cherries them
to over bigger and bigger space so you
initially
okay so this is just three firm frames
of the video issue before I just want to
make sure you you know like a certain
the immune reading in the red rectangles
at the forlorn pickle object so then the
image written in the sign rectangle we
call it back one so you can see actually
you know when Carson image all the
things change dramatically so this you
know you have to change something online
I'll mix them adapt adaptively in the
temporal domain ok so here um it's the
same game so we present the object the
object appearance as a 2-pack Apaches so
we just scan them and throw them into a
bag this bag belong to object this plan
this pack belong to an object it's a
surrounding area over the object so we
just use these you know bakula patches
as a standard training set for binary
classification we determine which is
from football nut bag or no object an
object but we do not have like a hard
decision which as we all medicine was
like continuous so the key issue is how
you go to the multi-tap tail ok this
very easy so you know this job I just
scanned image patches within these
rectangles so for the conversation
illusion I use evidence beta so I also
use the same feature recommendation so
you can really tell what's the
difference I are going out to the future
of implantation not a feature
descriptors so here we go so after is
all mines that does not have any
constraint on the training set an online
training a pen and castrate you can use
whatever you want so we try I personally
try three categories why is the key
which can be considered a nice general
benchmark also some kind commute
reduction because it's a supervised
learning is you have labels it's some
kind of stupid emission reduction
polotsk ad or you can use kasi misra
model as well but here is just simple
case with KDE it does not make much
difference the second the third category
is super we just use XVM support vector
machine now you're gonna have to
anything else like a posting or the
senior trip whatever you know you given
the data Justin Bannan come fare is a
standard machine learning problem the
case is second in our pd recycle for
different data you may wanna play with
different kind of class way fares
because you know every class where has
these other 137 page but does not have
any concern on this class where you can
use whatever you want okay so all these
account for our use I covered them into
a confidence man so you not only a
binary label I do not use the banner I
used to the confidence my account them
into firm excuse them from the earth one
so this is a human religion in 10 t
minus one and then i use the motor up to
here not directly from teammates motor
up to t minus 1 i'm a continuous
temporal adapt to options mod up to t
minus one then apply the them into the
temp t scan the local region the nearby
regions so this is a response man the
red the top right corner and the left
bottom corner yet actually same thing
let me show you instantly match it's
reading you have a certainty surface so
this is actually intensity maps so hair
intensely I mean lacquer intense name is
her response so you are given this a
surface we used to like a standard way
that come in shape which is a gradient
descent algorithm starting from the
location objective of your location at
the team and so on you just do some
healing search and you find the next
nearby mode which contains the hairs to
some of the companies then you get the
new location
volume I'm missing the big picture here
okay you're buying space your phone on
that okay yeah I have assembled pictures
right I sound like an Immie Patrick by
Apache I know where the location it is
right so I to the classification over
these samples packet samples but then I
each example we've cared about
confidence value then I'm remap the
company's map into the image colonies
you look at you cater to these are you
get a you know to determine response man
or straining surface is the same say
it's a gray level image count with
coming swellow's not at its crew battles
and this is over the taking supper so
you've got two frames I just show you
how the two frames but our modeling is
the train up to t minus one it's a you
know integration procedure okay I've
been shooting around your house about
dating I think it's one who seems so
there's some temporal structure here
sort of I didn't get Boone all you're
taking advantage of the prior knowledge
that you've got these objects that are
moving in certain ways and no i don't
know i am i do not your magical and
filter or something you know no no it's
purely personal appearance but it
definitely can eat agree with that one
my work is security based on is a
possible we just learned up here ensuite
on our show magazine I wish you later on
with an example you can have a general
filter but you cannot guarantee care of
it will work you're trying to find new
model each region you're trying to see
where did that region go in the next
frame yes somehow extent yes and you do
you just so you're not making any
assumptions about no I'm some
generalities or translating no sub
shinee and all knows no only assumption
is this is same I wish all rated
solution about we can tell the
difference and I hope computer can tell
the difference as well so this is only
thing i make only a selfie I make
it's a sequential be a surface oh I have
the online I feel the island sounds fair
at each time step because my mother is
temporal evolving so at each time my
mother changes all my training data
changes right I was sure from 0 to t
minus 1 here up to dementia up to from
the beginning to current yes yes yeah I
would say the shout crepes shark lives
so far like a few seconds 10 seconds 20
seconds something like that so you and
you know when you try to really track
something you know feature-length film
issue I believe me you should trip first
have some global structure understanding
and cut them the clips because you
cannot guarantee a face will appear in
every frame in your sequence you know I
think we is it like a cost to find
understanding how to cut them into
pieces then you need pieces we have some
kind of further understanding of further
information one we can get from this
shot clicks does it honorary position so
so this will homework if we not updated
model it's obvious because every single
changing so this is okay this is our
main contribution is kind of weird
writing but I just curios ideas so we
just got back virginal constancy chart
which animals distance distance the
comprehension in the future space
between a feature a amid Patchett
feature to a backlog of yemeni feature
ameerpet features this Euclidean
distance is clean distance computing in
the evening in space ok so what we check
in we check two things when we check
data given model right we want to
integrate the new data from the model so
we will make sure something is not very
bad
linker things into our model we want
even you know sometimes you make a wrong
decision when you're tracking things but
you want to keep the model rigidity
somehow without with with the model
rejection without a rejection procedure
so we have to start so given each image
patches right in the newly sample image
i compute the distance towards the bag
polythene bag and a negative back object
up to your back and an object back right
we have to distance for each patch so if
these students are similar somehow
similar will reject them it's you know
you cannot make a classification you
know it's a lot of ambiguity in the
class factory so we take them as
something we don't know which so we
reject them from model you know it's out
later or something we don't know so we
just anywhere this thing we know in the
model another thing is a it's for like
trying to make some model compaq and
also control the rigidity it's like okay
for all the newly sampled object even
Apaches right we come here its distance
to object class then we source them you
know as a list so we've removed the
thing on top of this and at the bottom
list at the bottom is with the distance
very small we can't we think the odds
already a lot of done information into
me in the email model so i do not really
need is them anarchists on top of the
model they are most likely to be out
layers because if you look at exactly
you know in the one actually some
kind of images in the rectangle is not a
very good recommendation for the
football the county they can contain
something all layers so very simple i do
not even sort them just compute the mean
and the standard deviation up to some
kind of being plus duration the below me
and meditate variation I will you know
cut them out so another thing its
general task here is very simple because
you know our model and data can be
switched because it's just patches
just you know samples are patches so I
checked model given data I smell like I
adapt my model towards the data towards
the color i use but i do not make Lego
with them yuning using a salmon
communist wait I just convert them into
like a sampling rate because I have to
sample some help Apache I cannot just
unique or a new information you've had
internet model without reject anything
with other example something out because
this thing will be usually where be you
want to keep them contract and so yeah
which is easy it's just we cover the
distance in an our way but just you know
for the Forgotten patches in the back
patchy in the back we model the distance
towards the football match in newly
sample so you know we come to the DSN
how likely they collect a compare them
with unity with a new observation if
they much like new observation they have
hair chance to be too so I'll in the
resulting procedure so I other things
missing and also we consider it's
somehow similar with particle filtering
but yeah so I choose fine we'll show you
the other videos I will a lot of video 9
meters not too many now this is a
sequence Tiger tracking a car in the
intersection is affirmed surveillance
camera so this car actually does know
how like a worry big non Richard motions
so this is from lab data I do not make
any you know I download this data from
web site in germany and i think i
believe is more interesting at least
more interesting because i think it's
harder than the former problem i used
the data like a hiring from evidence
paper because i think other than the
paper is one of the best 12 a one of the
two best the start so i compared this a
result i show you is something beyond
his result I don't know his check every
works in this way or not but I can't I
think it's a hard for me maybe wanna see
it again so you know the the car has
ourself rotation and the large you know
making changes and also at the first
part is somehow out looted by the bass
and also this ability
but falling on on Michelle saw
questioned it do you have any examples
that have occlusion in them that have
two objects that overlap or come in
front of each other I do not yeah you
feel like you have exactly's you have to
some hello like a switching models yes
you want to check it like a two objects
with our ocean master model them like a
higher level to see our model is just a
piece on parent which you we can track
you know things with like a challenging
appearance but you can certainly build
something over the over ate a lot of
literature's discuss about and you know
when you try to model multiple object
interacting each other yeah so actually
my other wiser heads like some paper
like in the past with his former student
the hell we're famous paper about
talking about these associated model
yeah but ok so the night of course is so
it's hard for me to interpret the
quality of your results because when I
think of what I've seen years ago using
a generalized Kalman filter approach it
would take simple cases like this and my
impression is what we do just fine no I
don't think so I don't Tara I don't
think so because a carbon filter or
whatever particle filtering you need to
train a dynamical model you know you
need to autonomy tomado beforehand this
means you nutrient something which is
similar to the testing data but it's
generally not available so your strength
here is the idol make any assumption I
just simple non parametric model of
options in maintenance so when will you
give up wait so then what do you give up
that way sorry so you don't your
advantage over say you generalize common
filter is good common filters you need
to originally suppose okay I show you
other I have an eye exam or exactly
answer a question okay yeah i show you i
will show you later okay I you take the
author a person
okay this blah blah I compared with 20
CR I believe its I succeed our paper
similar to our paper they have some like
I think in general that the result is
compared to because tracking kissing is
that can you do not have ground truth
just see your check it or not you know I
would wish it up in some case you can we
can have sound like a you know popping
available with corn choice but it's not
you that you need label things in or a
frame is not over easy job go back to
the part where you agree in the
rejection things okay here oh so the
poor people walking video mm-hmm when
you cross the diagram with grass or
something we're building so when you
have a background changing mm-hmm
progress is rejection because I mean you
think it will take it as out direct oh
you have a hour long we have a long-term
yes but we do not you know is someone
like a wii is here actually it's here is
here it's like a given model killing her
motto you check the data you control the
rich you can or you come to the model
rigidity that's not you know we have we
must link to a new information is a for
sure but we just don't want incur
information too fast or something is the
percentage version right so the see the
unit in the new sample you mean you have
a lot of Records is kind of grown so
we'll make a list will make a distance
list there will be somewhere in the
between so this thing's some some will
guarantee your integration into a model
only reaching is something which you
were unlikely on top of the list or on
the bottom of the list so you can keep
the case I'm thinking about is in the
background your venom in uniform is
slightly textured uh-huh like if you're
crossing a language drink but no
structure no texture is all also our
kind of feature ray it's in the future
it's a 000 democracies no caramel orange
ingredients I mean all this go Master I
cannot guarantee it will work for any
video but I sure sound like I I think
the challenge in videos I cannot
guarantee you know if you have to in the
long term is something like about this
you have to build some detectors you
usually detector inherit
clearly you have to use something
detector we'd have some human knowledge
using the detector to cooperate with
your tracker so you know it's near no
service sir i cannot serve for the
guarantees who will work for any
sequence but i think the video as you is
not trivial I did you know for
complication people i don't know i can
persuade that you or not but it's my
video okay this is a example a closely
or how you know the team color of
tracking is we want our drift drifting
drifting is once you make a wrong
decision you cannot come back park is
this somehow answer a question we have a
nice combination of the long term of the
visionary short term on observation you
know you know even humans very simple
but it's effective so actually you have
a drift this is the only people i found
from these four videos I wish I can't
read more videos from like a highest
paper but hand was something only being
he cannot give me the data now but i can
try later definitely i want to try I
don't apply a ver until the start they
use the computing people think the
widow's you need provide is challenging
so I want you know try on the
challenging videos so then because the
model you have you know long-term
observation you can I know drag them
back so this is how you call it a robust
of tracker so if we you cannot you you
cannot avoid drifting at all no no you
cannot avoid drifting totally isn't you
know but you try to build something with
you drew bus we can drag you back this
next combination your long-term
observation and low thermalization also
i might say it's a nonparametric you can
also actually come to how we teach the
model he is right you can you know you
how you can control the thing you can
actually control it but i do not control
I just use like a 1-1 and how times of
the standard deviation okay I'm not sure
in our example is the same example I
should I talk to them point point to
fire its point 2.5 s no point it's not
for mens rea it's the same piece the
same but we want but this is more like a
comebacker fix
object so karma confuse people always
want to capture people working in one
environment and then try to you try to
 one and put them into an arm drag
one so it's you know typical like
computer animation or whatever you know
you can cover something in the blue
screen then calling them you know where
we you know maybe flying on sky or
something so it's cheaper oh so I was
like actually you want to try to solve
this problem automatically but I won't
your next this is not a i would say i
can tell us your ideas but i cannot
guarantee is like a perfect same thing
is this point you creamy hard you freak
memories is you know for the computer
graphics I compared the cigarette paper
tray cigarette paper you too long for
they have two papers are cutting how you
do this thing from images 1925 we have
to be very cold talking about how to you
tech foot one from a video like working
dynamic or going from a dynamical video
not tell me what you nee our kids the
camera is fixed so mackeage cameras I
follow a person so camera is moving on I
do not make any assumption except
appearance except appearance so okay so
any different that's three dif this is
like how I scour sample images ok before
case I only sample patches over a small
region or something so so you don't make
any assumptions so its appearance don't
you have some assumptions about the rate
at which your models can evolve over
time yes yes listen our sound is not
something you have to you know on I
cannot say my model user parameter fray
it's not permit afraid but I tried I
could i just used like I don't know the
tune them much I just you know when
point huh 11.5 standard deviations my I
just put them there it's booked well I
don't know you know sir equity how we
can you know do this thing better but
you know I single about this apartment
but here just you know it's somehow like
very simple implementation it's probably
including details but I don't think it's
you know a flag with high-level ideas so
this I shall I assemble images so
basically it's somehow attempt to the
income-tax it is so some regions are
very complex and much more textures so I
was some of them mountains Lee probably
this image out oversampled i would say
because you know how you determine how
many impetuous easy enough for your
sample though i cut them into images
segments so and then sample for
immediate segments i guarantee you sign
in mere seconds has recommended
repenting patches then I try like eight
Confederations based on different
matching criteria with some different
feature descriptor with some different
stamps sampling messer like a human in
sampling direct from immediate
difference virtues okay this is a exam
mushroom in the you know where I'm from
Hawking so i had to something with
medicine so this is from surgery
sequence so understand too many images
they're not here is now for trading just
i met the surgical tool in image on top
to the bottom so this is a random color
encoded the car Sankey looks like i'm
making these taking over this random
colors right so the top is I gave the
least I label them how the you know this
infernal it's a binary then agron pen
automatic generator the the bottom thing
the banner image to see to map the
surgical tool firm one for another this
is not tracking yet just imagine just
two down sit right here how you can you
know use the apache model to label image
segments so I went out and took you know
about tracking but it's very similar to
the former case it's only has three
attention the first one to talk about
secondly images into chunko by a fix on
the mega teasing over pixels so the TC
in particular very simple is just an
aggregation procedure over over the
response the company's values from the
humidity patches you sample within each
partition with each
super pixels I just used min and media
the kind of simple operators and also
once you more about on the model
updating procedures appearance mother
updating are we i plug in one thing
which color random partition because i
believe like in this case inside we have
like too many samples my hair like a
solid or even patches over the frame or
frame but uniform okay we have hundreds
we have solid ass audience so we we want
to assemble them we want to kick out the
returning information so we just dragged
random partition algorithm we can talk
about random action in detail later so
there will be some kind of larger
partitioned like party means they have
many many image temples and some kind of
small number small partitions so smart
small perishing they should have her
response resample rate means they have
more chance to live in the back and the
bigger partition means they have a lot
of redundant information so we can kick
out a more percentage of the innovations
so other thing can be done where is very
simple competition no I'm sure that we
do okay I kind of say you know it's
perfect it's definitely not a perfect
also an RC invention because i can type
way me to another so you know tracking
case i don't know Karen I don't you
attract it from tempe men's went to time
T I can jump
I'm sure I have no time this so some of
my own work the first one is like will
be this year SML we have like a general
calcium Messer to solve the intrinsic
ambiguity of subsidy clustering which we
use Lego for a toy case for a video
temptation we do charge segmentation so
this is my point when have I would be
moving to try to find the structure of
the movie cut them into pieces now you
ETP say we do something adaptively so
this is a feature of a characteristic of
the temporal feature temporal signal so
another paper is another type to life
approach for article action recognition
which is but the implication is totally
different ok to answer your question I
choose the example of the 3d face
tracking the first year is this one I
shoot the button but not accuracy
because I I'm really bad like a
visualize this thing I plotted this 3d
model directly already on the on phase
you cannot tell the big appearance
unions by you cassadee for this person
using google even ask him he will tell
you what kind of you know making pizza
hey it was when i was tired of tracking
his faith his record a lot how you know
a lot of like a talking pig the face as
a regional map as a rigid body it's a
definite definition but we try to kick
off the outer layers we consider you
know some kind of features they have
both their posts normal power and the
most unoriginal motion we kick of them
all so here actually i compare this
thing to the particle filtering i'm not
sure you are favorable particle feeling
part very intentional computer computer
you stopping for we have you know single
mode right single market in Tokyo chain
part of everything that you have
multiple mode Baltimore mode but I
referring you have the big problem is
one thing is you in between with a very
similar thing you know it's not general
available
we track we want to track something you
cannot get you can find out where
similar thing you will label them you
tell them how the dynamics looks like
it's no guarantee another thing is in a
Hydra minutes wasted SMS so our working
is actually using ransack not sure your
finger weird and sad that's how we using
turns out to sample hypothesis directly
from the image of observation and fill
them into the particle filtering
framework particle filtering actually
are similar to my mod updating process
it's basically a likelihood evaluation
and resampling so I was like trying the
point I want to make is trying to have
some bottom-up and top-down Messer so
you have some kind of observation if you
can summon something directly from the
observation make use of it so i have a
few slides to tell you how the thing
looks like this is a framework compared
with particle filtering I think they can
be okay so this is the red dots are nice
tempo michael says my hypothesis is
sampled for run a noisy give me data the
leather hood the level value is much
higher than the then the particle
fearing saying paryavaran pizza damning
a model plus a diffusion model I think
mean karma to do you have to have this
downhill model as well so it's the same
thing we attend macmall does not work
well is coming a mess and also it's not
it's not easy for I'm sure it's not you
to change a dynamic model to change any
man make model for an unconditioned
video frames not sure we can totally see
her
in this graphite this is likelihoods on
the y axis and frames on the x axis for
what a nice offering average particle
members well XX x axis in part number
okay yeah always place to summarize okay
we summarize the three top you had tough
I trade the same way so first when I
just use a proposed image patch be
reinforcing recognition then I act
entities the patch education into
temporal domain for tracking with some
kind of simple extensions and the last
case issue is again by adding some kind
of sampling adaptive sampling measure we
can try to solve a word complex a
contribution or color graphics problem
this you have much hair option
complexity so the conversation of xbox
is obviously is very simple it's very
compassionate merci mais non parametric
its uniform parallel computing and the
partition the random partition then you
combine them together this is guarantees
of global team oh so listen and also
okay dokay looking need a better
implementation but fortunately are some
kind of armed paper you need pho some
naive way to implement okay but when you
have like a criminology numbers or
samples or exemplars you have helped to
some use them maybe some tree mail model
you know make it an hierarchical so you
crystal thing conditional competition oh
very efficient ok I would like to thank
my collaborators with my course out of
the paper so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
