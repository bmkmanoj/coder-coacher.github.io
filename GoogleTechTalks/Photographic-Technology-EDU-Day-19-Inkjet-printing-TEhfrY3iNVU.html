little bit more introduction I know some
of you have heard the last time but you
know it's on the web so on the video
that's for the readers outside so the
title is inkjet printing coming to age
it is if you if you look at printing
that these for fine art it is mostly
inkjet printing it's not the only form
of course that it is the main form and
that's what I want to talk about so
brief the program a brief introduction I
start with the challenges of printing
what to do talk a little bit about
printers about inks papers and media
drivers and rips Russell imaging
processes is rip editing out look I may
have no slide for outlook but we can
discuss that maybe that's part of the
discussion and Q&amp;amp;A and at any time so
because this time you know printing is a
little bit difficult to present in a
lecture because you normally need some
printers here but we would be probably
eighty percent of the time would be
spent in feeding paper waiting for print
or something like that so it's very
difficult so it may be a little bit more
dry than to have life presentations so
you're welcome to spice it up with some
interesting and challenging questions
I'm the editor and owner of two websites
one is out back folder which is actually
the central website and out back print
which is just dedicated to printing
which may tell you that I'm very much
into printing into means whenever I take
a photo I only care if it prints well I
for other purposes rarely there except I
photograph it printer too short on my
website that's the only sometimes I do
that and I hate to do it and I'm not
very good at it so it's a magazine about
digital photography we talked about SLR
as we talked a workflow we talk about
fine art printing and that's what we
talk today Photoshop techniques and such
we sell electronic books on different
topics the most appropriate for today is
our book on digital fine art printing
which covers everything we talked today
of course in very much more detail we
can just scratch the surface so now
let's get started printing is very easy
if big if everything works right and
there are three possibilities you are
lucky you hope it was a good print or
you have experience and I think if I
show you the many parameters which are
involved in printing you may get the
idea that you need to understand what
you're doing and even if you understand
you have to be sometimes lucky or let's
say in some cases you are not so lucky
and frustrated to get something bad out
of your printer the only people who
enjoy that are the paper and ink
manufacturers they love it they want you
to do a lot of prints you don't like for
finally getting one you like so what
needs to be right first of all the
printer needs to be right oh that's kind
of an obvious which we will see it's
kind of so many options today that it
that's kind of a given the ink has to be
right the paper or media have to be
right drivers and the rasta imaging
processor settings have to be right the
color management has to be very very
right and this is actually the main
calls for bad prints in most cases is
color management bad profiles and of
course the image editing if you just
think you take a file out of your camera
and print and Ansel Adams
the thing twice and then and that's what
we don't cover today is print handling
and presentation makes it then into a
completely different thing you know
probably many of you have experienced
that you have a print which looks nice
once you've met and frame it it looks
just a class better so a nice print can
be looked good and a good print can be
looked great but you know that's not
what we are talking today so all has to
match and that's was where I started
everything has to match to work the
printer ink paper or media driver rip
settings color management what mean
match they have to all work together for
that kind of paper that kind of ink that
kind of driver that kind of color
management there's not the oh I have a
wonderful profile for a glossy paper and
that's a good idea to use it on a matte
paper not a good idea won't work you
know you get a print and the print the
content is all there but you don't get a
great print what are the main printing
challenges one is kind of the obvious is
color gamut what kind of color colors
can you represent we talked about that a
little bit later the other thing which
is very important is the maximum density
you get what is the deepest black you
can print because from there and the
paper why you define the dynamic range
you can get onto on a print if you have
a very light black if it's not a deep
black you cannot have a high contrast
and you cannot print at least not with
today's printers you cannot print whiter
than the paper because no none of the
printers I know or I use their there is
a white ink could you
we get to that that's optical
brighteners in a and that's a good
that's a trick yeah and it fades that's
it we get to up you the question was you
can use brighteners and believe me it's
overused in many cases not underutilized
and actually it's not really why it it's
actually blew that you know whatever you
call white it's it gives the impression
to the I it's very white but it's it's
one of the tricks in the book to improve
thats nothing really wrong with it
except for certain reasons so color
gamut is just defined what range of
colors you can present and some
photographers are care a lot about color
gamut we belong to the photographer who
don't care that much because we like
more muted colors more subtle colors but
you know it started I think with what
was a film colors which got always more
and more and more in velvia and yeah so
which means we get easily into the area
where we need strong and stronger colors
but then there are some real things in
the nature for example some Reds which
you want to represent and it may be a
challenge to represent it and if this /
this special red is very important for
that image it may be a problem so this
is one thing which the manufacturers of
printers and mainly inks have to face
how to get a wide gamut and we will see
it would be easy if there would not easy
it would be easier if there would not be
the challenge of longevity
longevity it's kind of interesting we
are kind of in the moment in the first
time in not in first time again in color
at least in color photography yeah the
first time that in the recent years
longevity of prints increased or let's
say the projection of longevity because
no one had for 100 years in dark storage
the inkjet printer looked at it that you
know there are testing methods for
example william research to do
accelerated testing and anticipate how
long things may last but before it was
kind of the opposite the kodak normally
kodak photo paper they faded in no time
so there were these in famous wedding
photos of the 50s or 60s which i think
they were already gone in the 17th I
think ektachrome slides of the 70s and I
have to take a close look at mine are in
heavily in decline kodachrome didn't
have that problem because it's actually
inherently a black-and-white process so
kodachrome slides last a little bit
longer but on the printing side yeah
quite a bit longer I think on the
printing side in in the 90s there were
introduced some papers like Fuji crystal
archive paper which got ratings at about
60 years but later they were reduced
downgraded I think to 40 years and there
may be even issues with the chemistry
residues which may cause shorter lasting
imprints so the strongest influence in
the moment on fine art printing is
longevity that's kind of an overriding
criteria for making printers and
especially inks and you know honestly
when my parents died they had for 25
years cibachrome print at the wall and
was pretty good
it and that's what we want we want that
pictures last because we don't know how
much it means to a person to have that
print and failing prints are not fun
when I think was what was it I think in
the middle 70s they change the
black-and-white world to RC papers they
fade it sometimes in two month you've
got some some bad artifacts and then the
the old black-and-white by Rick papers
came back of course resolution is is an
issue you want to have we don't want to
see the dots we want to see a photo we
want to see it as one image in this
place up mainly actually a role when we
have very smooth areas in the image when
we have smooth gradations they we don't
want to see just a dot pattern and
especially your challenge is black and
white black and white is because you
know you don't get sidetracked by color
you see all the flaws if your printer
cannot deliver on it but on the other
side it's also you know when you you are
exhibiting some photos and you
immediately know who's a photographer
and who's not there are some people who
look at the pictures and then there are
some people who have a loop so in some
ways it doesn't matter for looking at a
real pic picture the picture has a
viewing distance but then that said I'm
not really sure to determine that
sometimes you see something on the
picture although you don't see the dogs
it just looks different when it's kind
of very smooth it may more appeal to you
then it doesn't look like it although
you don't see the dots but it may be
related by a bad dot pattern by not
enough resolution be it from the printer
be it from the photograph you took
yourself
the good news is all the main printers
today have at least very reasonable
resolution so they don't have really
they don't suffer from not having enough
resolution yeah inks is kind of the core
to everything not because it's called
inkjet but you know it sounds easy you
you have a couple of eggs mix them and
you're done but you know these inks have
again to last they have to mix a well to
new colors so which kind of inks you
have is very important in the meantime I
think it's easily a billion-dollar
market so it's really a main profit for
many many companies I think ten years
ago the big the chemistry companies they
just laughed about inkjet now it's a big
income for them so which means they
research on going on new ink formulas on
you encapsulation of ings on you
delusional rings on you pigments and
such their two main types of inks one is
died and one is pigment inks I get to
that in a minute everyone who does
inkjet printing knows that inks are very
expensive and you know that's why the
company's love you I think they could
easily give you the printer for free and
be happy and that's why they also
prevent third-party inks in it they do
all the tricks in the books to prevent
that on the other side I I hardly ever
use third-party inks because I would
need to do the research whether it's
good it lasts or so it's very difficult
whether it's consistent whether I even
get it tomorrow so yeah but on the other
side you pay a lot of money
our the main inkjet printers are now
getting from eight to twelve they
started kind of six inks and Counting
and quite a bit it has to do with gamut
and the other thing has to do with black
and white that's why we get more ink but
don't just think that if you have more
inks it has to be better you have also
new problems because you have to handle
12 inks you have to mix 12 eggs for the
optimum quality so it doesn't really
make the life easier for the software
but more gray inks in the system I love
it so the main systems i use i have
about the three or four black inks and
that's very important if you do black
and white some would argue you need at
least six to seven just black inks and
the other areas where they add now red
green blue to get more to some of the
the more difficult colors actually it
doesn't always mean you get those colors
and it's kind of there are 12 ink
printers which shine in one area of the
gamut and there are eight color printers
with shine in a different area of the
gamut so it's it it's not trivial here
dye inks dying's have much smaller
particles so they are much easier to
handle from any print head they are have
can be easily eat more easy produced to
produce a higher gamut but and this is a
big but they fade in open air so I from
some dye printers I actually could print
on a matte paper put it out three days I
would have a close to white sheet would
be reusable not quite so but it's really
you couldn't see any image anymore
impure sunlight and this is because
is the party glad that small so that's
exactly the opposite because they they
have a big surface compared to their
volume and they are all the things like
ozone UV everything works up there
oxidation and such there's one cure for
it in some case which called swellable
media where actually the media sucks in
the dye ink and encapsulate it it makes
it longer lasting but this has a
disadvantage that only very few kind of
glossy RC papers can be used HP made
nice printers doing that which produce
beautiful quality that you were limited
to a certain type of papers which means
today none of the major manufacturers
actually offers dye-based printers for
the fine art market they don't claim
it's fine art it's something for
longevity so they have all now agreed to
compete on pigment inks and that's good
because they can challenge each other
each other which hopefully gets us even
better prints of the future so pigmented
inks on the other side have much larger
particles this results in much longer
longevity the challenge is to make
pigmented inks which have a wider gamut
that's more challenging than doing it
with dye inks and and this is a big end
they cause clogging because you know
because the products are bigger and they
are very hard to keep in solution
because they sink to the bottom and you
know that's why if you enter new contras
you shake a little bit so it's it's
tricky and they also like heads they
like to clog it up and the clog head
results in bending or one color not
present or whatever so that's the
problem I said this is now the main ink
for finite printers probably in 10 years
will change some say
solvent inks maybe the next wave I don't
know we have to say that after the first
company you made a big investment and a
big work on printing with pigmented inks
and the competition didn't really care
so which resulted that absent owned this
market I say owned because last year
kenan and HP made at least inroads into
this market and but you know edison has
a long experience in working with it
there are now i think in the third or
fourth generation of pigmented inks but
you know the other companies did their
research too so we have now at least the
three major players in that market and
i'm talking about the market of of not
the highest end you know they are the
role and printers and such which may be
the better printers that they are kind
of not not mainstream high-end let's say
I consider the apps in the HP high-end
but they are not maybe not as
sophisticated as Roland's it doesn't
understand they even use epson or
actually seiko heads so the heads are
the same as for example of epson
printers
the main issue with pigmented inks and
that's all about what currently was
going on with the printers is that all
the manufacturers have to face the
issues with these pigmented inks one is
me Tamara's metamerism is that you look
at two different lights and especially
neutrals can switch from green to
magenta or it doesn't look neutral it
looks different on different light
another thing which is kind of
problematic because on pigment pigment
is interesting the inks it's actually on
top of the paper and because it sits on
top of the paper you you see the
difference between the gloss of the ink
and the gloss of the paper called loss
differential and that can be more or
less distracting mostly in an angle so
it's kind of interesting if you put it
behind glass it doesn't really matter
that you know you look at the print this
way it matters if the question was is
there a reason that it's more issue with
metamerism is more an issue with pigment
that was died honestly I don't know I
just know it is a big issue with a Wars
at least metamerism is not as big issue
anymore but the first generation the
p2000 from epson metamerism was quite a
bit an issue but it also to do with not
having enough gray inks in there was
just one black bronzing bronzing is
again you know if you print and there's
a white spotted it you don't print
there's no ink put on and if you look at
an angle you see kind of interesting
effects which is called bronzing which
looks bad you know you move it around
the print again behind closet doesn't
matter and you need to have kind of
different blacks
for math paper and photo paper the
reason is for for a glossy kind of paper
the reason is a clause eat the glossy
paper for inkjet has to have what is
called microporous it has to be a rough
surface which is kind of a contradiction
glossy and rough which means it has to
be so fine rough micropores that the the
ink can't sit on it if you have now
matte black which has caused a gray
across er structures it would kind of
sit and not really fit it would kind of
be really on top so you have two
different inks for met papers on for the
photo papers and in the absent it's you
have to switch and that's kind of a in
some printers it's really a major hassle
and major investment on the 3800 it is
still you should think about twice when
you switch because some dollars are gone
that on a 4800 close to 80 to 100
dollars are gone plus a lot of work but
you know they fix it soon yes but you
have to have a switch mode it cleans off
the lines so it sit in it has it's it's
just up this what I'm talking was inked
waste yeah so because they need actually
a ninth the head in there in the head as
a knight's color should be in there in
the 3800 they have it kind of in the Hat
switching in very short line so they
they get away with a couple of dollars
loss why is it
because it's it is related to the DMX to
the maximum black you get don't get a
good maximum black out of a photo black
which is final course yeah and it's just
about the DMX printers they actually two
major differences in heads one our
thermal heads we're being gets heated
and then spit out and the piezo had
which is kind of a electric mechanism to
spit out eggs if I know HP and can it
have different thermal heads but what is
the difference exactly I you know I
don't really care but epson has a piezo
heads and these are in the end very
major differences with all their
advantages and not advantages but that's
what that's a problem of the
manufacturers and then sometimes it may
be a problem of stability of printers
the piezo heads are have a good record
of being very stable unfortunately they
have also very good record and clogging
but i think the at least in the old days
the PN's we had were always the more
precise whether it's still true I don't
really think so very much because in the
indie Prince you get from the HP's and
the canon you see they are also very
good so you have consumer printers which
are just lettuce I sprinters a3 and
large format printers here on top this
is a typical representative of a desktop
printer in a three and this is my 44
inch printer so which is a monstrous
thing you have to calibrate your printer
which sets the ink limits so what is the
maximum of ink you can't put above a
certain kind you have put on a certain
paper you have to linearize so that the
printer has a nose up
to produce fine gradations so that
linearize is on the colors and there's a
big difference between the absence and
the others the absent actually are kind
of factoring calibrated and are known to
have a good stability of a long time the
others are user calibrated which means
they may have not that much stability
over long time but on the other side you
can create the stability at any time and
point you you want at every point of
time you want so it both have advantages
yeah and you need to profile these
printers we get to that in more detail
you you cannot believe how much problem
single sheet feeding can be the only
printer I have currently which is really
pleasant to use on single sheet feeding
maybe the HP 90 180 it's very easy it's
flat feeding it the epson on the large
format are also easy to feed but single
sheet feeding is is this one kind of
problem the rolls are in most cases
working fine that rolls has other desks
disadvantage we get to them later and
said nozzle clogging you know all these
printers have some sort of clogging but
these days the cannon and the HP they
have kind of outer check so they
actually can find out that it's clogged
even during printing so they can do a
second pass if they realize some nozzles
clock it did seem to work of course
nozzle checks cost ink cost time and
they can be some types of surprise you
know you just see open if that looks
strange you know in its in the worst
scenario is when it looks strange and
you experiment so in you think the sauce
is something
be different but then you realize one
colors are is not really working at 100
sent in one of the effect suspending
banning is of course you know you little
striped looks acne you know you have
micro pending which is hardly visible
and then there's my banding which is
into your face but you know overall they
work very well in that domain today but
a couple of years was was not always
that fund if you have to do adjustment
it had alignments and all that today
they had alignment of all these tools
all these printers is done most of the
time automatically you can't do manual
alignment in many cases but the
automatic actually in my book does the
trick I don't know what they do but you
know in principle for example in HP had
is a chip they produce it completely in
a tab that's the advantage for example
HP can produce new types of hats in no
time because it's all chip design it's
nothing manual have done any more to
that head it is I don't but don't ask me
how they do the detection but they can't
have logic directly at the Hat it very
close I bet you know I never counted no
I actually did a the HP I haven't seen
clogging so hey I have seen it slow down
because it probably has clogging but it
corrected it yeah
yeah that's what I but I do yeah yeah
also under the 90 180 you never power it
down so they on the absent I would power
down depending which printer you have
because otherwise it CLE may clean too
much to your taste no no that's not true
that's not true for the pigment printers
they have separate heads from the ink
that's old that's history but they have
replaceable you user replaceable he
heads and for example the HP have one
head for twinks costs about sixty
seventy dollars so it's reasonable on an
canon 12 inc ipf 5000 they have two
heads with six eggs each and i think one
costs six hundred dollars and the epson
heads are also not cheap and not you
cannot actually it's not user
replaceable or its leaves not thought to
be okay inks is key but the other even
more imp not not even more but as
important part is the paper a that's
actually the key of a combination
printer ink paper we have today so many
papers you can probably try to know it's
endless the main papers are met papers
find out papers with math papers I mean
more these simple papers they are which
are not for gallery or use or something
like that you have satin and glossy
papers and of course then there are all
shades on the planet in between but the
main is actually is this matte surface
or a glossy surface I have a strange
relation to our see papers if you would
just look at the print at what you see
it's beautiful what they produce
wonderful print beautiful but then you
see the plastic paper and the from the
aesthetical side you you think it's so
plastic
behind glass you don't see anything of
that yeah so it's kind of more like you
know we are use its kind of you know
it's a tactile feeling with it on the
other side I could get to you in a
moment on the other side and Matt find
out cotton paper looks beautiful with
all print you know just look at the
paper it's so beautiful smooth the
surface yeah that doesn't really matter
for the photo i don't know you don't get
to gam it like on the aussie paper yeah
you're Christian which which printer did
you use which printer to use yeah yeah
yeah you use dye inks dye-based inks on
pigment it's not the case there are some
issues which I will cover but this is
dying yes yes yeah but it has nothing to
do with the plastic paper it has to do
with the dying yeah it because it
probably sinks into the paper so you
have either wood pub or cotton rag
expensive and beautiful in math papers
have lowered emic sorry you added resin
coated so it's paper coated you know I
call a plastic okay resin coated paper
and then believe me or not there are
many other media you can print on
aluminum you print on textile extry
textile is a big market so there are
companies who are specialized to make
roster imaging processes for print on
textiles or would you ever think that
someone prints on snowboards maybe not
but they do and they care believe it or
not that they have five machines which
are completely in sync and color
management I don't know why they bother
about the back you know they do they
want once no bar to be exactly has the
same they are more probably more picky
than photographers
yeah yeah of course you know it's a type
you know it but yeah and you know
although they want to surf with it your
put a white bots is that you know it's
not I know it's lifestyle yeah yeah oh
yeah that's camera exactly that's what
you do like ours are not for photography
you know they think alike oh that's a
good good reminder that a shot minder
thank you for reminding me if I the case
the important part is that paper itself
doesn't really work well with inkjet
printing you need to be coated it has to
have its a coating on the surface
otherwise you get exactly that what we
see here that it spreads into the paper
it's not precise it you don't get a good
image so you want that it is either
sitting on top or somewhere it sinks
into it but not spreading into the paper
so you need to have a coating and that's
interesting sometimes you have a paper
manufacturer who doesn't have the
patterns for the coatings and vice versa
so it's a lot of mixtures but both has
to be good and both have to last and you
know that I don't know enough about the
coatings where they may be the weak
point in something in how long they
print loss issues with papers we have
optical brighteners you mention that
that's of course you know we wanted wide
white a white which means actually they
we have papers which be in the blue have
110% brightness which is interesting so
they they get more like back then you
put in because it reflects the UV light
as visible light but in the end I think
it looks so aggressively wide that
actually doesn't look good so that's
that's my take and the brightness fade
in a different rate than the rest of the
image so it would then yellow so called
yellow and the most dangerous thing is
to put the paper was brightener aside of
a natural paper then everyone said oh
this is yellow no the other one is blue
but the our eyes tell it's yellow and
because you compare you don't like the
yellow if you see it by itself you say
wonderful print beautiful natural all
that put a white sheet of paper reside
is that why are you printing on such a
yellow paper pigmented prints on glossy
media they have all the effects I told
with Gloucester fringe and such and they
have sometimes what is called down there
outgassing it's actually because they're
still moisture coming out and if you
would frame them too early it could even
fog your frame it's it's I have never
seen it but it's there and then under
nice cotton papers they is wonderful
fine cotton dust which has nice side
effect first of all you print on the
dust the dust goes away then your voice
spot not nice the second is it has dust
and clogs you had yeah so it's very
often if you use one of these smaller
consumer printers put in beautiful
cotton paper you have more clogging
problems or one thing I learned recently
some printers have the cutter very close
to the head it's a great idea to cut
cotton paper in the printer near they
had because it will all the dust will
assemble at the heads and you will have
all sorts of problem so try to avoid
that I forex for myself print nearly
exclusively on on sheep pay per person
for other reasons too will get there the
one thing I'm currently fighting a
little bit is that you know some paper
manufacturers don't have the Polish
control they should have for example
some dark gray spots in the middle of
the paper three sheets in a row or
something like that it's that's not fun
and you pay four to five dollars per
sheet yeah so it I hope but will be
sorted out
a brief going through color management
I'm you know it's it's not time for
color management you had talks about
color management but printing with all
color management you know actually works
it will take you a lot of paper and not
of ink so and not talking about time you
can you can use for soft proofing your
printer and try and dial in some new
colors and a little bit more red and
said you can do that not a good idea so
the key to color management is the
knowledge that in RGB well you does not
define a color that's for some shocking
it just sells a percentage of what red
green and blue is used on one device so
if you have a percentage of red green
and blue on one device it will create a
certain color let's assume it would be
stable so color management is complex
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do
the best you can do and believe me you
don't need to be know all the ins and
outs of color management to be
successful was printing so what you
actually have you need to have a color
space which defines a device in that
context the RGB well you has a very well
meaning of a really well defined color
and that's the trick you define an RGB
value in a cupboard space which is kind
of an abstract device think of an
abstract divides this is an absolute
color and now you get to the following
situation you have an image which has
the color space where so every RGB value
has inside with the color space in
actual meaning and now you translate the
color to the other devices which means
the RGB values will be changed because
they the devices may need a different
way to describe the same color if they
can yeah so the same is important for
the monitor for the
leave out the camera because that's the
other way from and not for today the
color gamut is most very often described
in a two-dimensional e is the
three-dimensional thing we don't want to
bother that much but it it's interesting
how different color spaces are this is
srgb this is Adobe RGB this is proflow
to RGB which is the monstrous space and
these in the middle are profiles for
concrete printers this was for papers
the matte paper and the other one out
there is for more glossy paper just get
an idea how these things look like but
as a color management is soft proofing
you know why do we do soft proofing
because we want to spend as little time
doing multiple prints because that's a
waste Edison's waste of ink paper time
money but then I hear you know someone
says I have now the perfect match from
screen to print I have problem with that
because you know in that paper you
cannot see on a glossy screen however
would you do that how would the glossy
screen look like a matte paper it's not
possible so what you can get you can get
a close impression to reduce the amount
of proofs you need to print but the real
proof is always a print I sometimes not
that picky so what I do is I see on the
monitor the picture which makes you
confident that I what I print looks good
because I'm the jack that I like it so
there's no one else to decide if no one
will tell me when I show in a print oh
this doesn't miss you met your screen
mm-hmm because I don't deliver my
screens with my prince that's not the
case
I mentioned it very early on printer
profiles are the most important part and
you don't believe what it can go wrong
with it it can show less detail because
it has a tone curve it the color are off
the the mapping of out of gamut of two
saturated colors may be bad and so you
cannot distinguish colors and one thing
is important one profile is for a single
combination of printer paper imprint
calibration driver driver setting
viewing light so if you change one of
the parameters you need a different
profile yeah so restrict don't have 50
papers to use don't have 99 viewing
light conditions to be used yeah and try
to settle down to something which works
but as I said change one of the
parameters your profile is invalid
sometimes it may be working good enough
for your purpose that you decide yeah
but for example on a glossy a profiler
glossy paper doesn't normally work on a
matte paper because it would not use
photo blanket would use maplin for
example the main thing to watch for is
how we have over saturated colors in
mapping how neutral are neutrals because
that's where our is very sensitive if
you have a black and white print you see
it immediately your color cast if a
normal color photos you may not see it
but in neutrals you see it the rendering
intent just briefly is how you deal with
out of gamut colors it's the right thing
the tone curve is very important how
linear is the print and unfortunately
viewing light plays also roll I try to
make it kind of that it's in average
light it works fine because you know I
don't want to say if you buy my print
you need to have this kind of color
temperature in your viewing condition
this is what people who are strictly for
galleries they do that
creating printer profiles you need a
spectrophotometer this is we use most of
the time I one is one of the most
popular or for example the HP wide
format printers have built-in
spectrophotometers actually also an i
won we recently released the test image
and that's kind of instancing I was not
a fan of these images honestly it now I
release one which is actually based
mainly on Bill Atkinson's color patches
which are in there but I we found that
you can see a lot what this printer does
by just printing this image although you
may not care of any element but you see
for example if the if the strawberries
look inviting it's a good chance the
print is pretty good if the Aspen bark
is has fine detail it's all to something
which tells you about it yeah there we
have a whole article on the website
which explains what to look there for
printing so you save actually time
because if this print looks bad don't
try others yeah if this is good it may
not be that your print looks bad but
then you can tweak it but you know the
printer is correct
paper to instead highlight on the screen
those parts of the print that are out of
gamma core that violate total range
variation so that you know kind of a
zebra striking you get in a video yeah
they you have out of gamut warning and
forth photoshop for example so that's
that's an important part I don't think
they you know that's actually why where
these things are so that you can see how
far the black is really printed you know
once the highlights i printed well with
the profile and once the shadows are
printed well you the tonal range is ok
it doesn't mean it's linear but the
profile makes a normally quite linear so
I think if you see this is more a visual
clue and you know you have also the gray
ramp here I think you have all the
elements you need yes black and white
printing is a whole world by its own in
its as complicated as color it doesn't
have the out of gamut problem but you
know black and white lives by June elegy
that's the only thing you do yeah so it
it was kind of interesting in the
beginning a couple of years ago the man
who said you know who wants to make a
printer which does black and white
nobody really cares yeah now they have
mostly nearly all three blacks because
they found out that it that people care
and you know it's always the more you
have colors the more you the people like
black and white said get rid of that
color you know and it is really those
are different art forms and both have
the life and so we are now at a at a new
way where you can do on the same printer
excellent black color images and get
also very good like and wipe the prints
in the moment the interesting thing and
I just published recently again it was
actually I repeated that how you can
soft fruit black and white on your
monitor
it's it's not as trivial as you think if
you use the specialized black and white
molds of your printers it's kind of
interesting they deliver you that but
they have no means to profile it I'm
going to give you a little bit time for
questions so printing software you know
it's kind of interesting you you say oh
that's the driver for the printer it's
kind of you know well you know that
plays with my printer that you're
talking about quite a complex piece of
software because it has do I have a
slight I think I should yeah it should
it has to do what is for this paper the
right height how's the drying time in
stopping between what is the speed what
are the ink limits how do I get detail
in deterring how do I smooth mouth
gradients how do I map 12 colors
exercise where this afternoon make 12
color mappings for write your own driver
this afternoon just kidding so it is a
really major piece of software that's
why sometimes some printers may work
better with the rip well from companies
who are dedicated to just writing
printing software and black and white
gives a different kind of challenges
then you have the printing host
applications the most loan is Photoshop
we have currently the discussion of 16
to 18 bit so that you have also a 16-bit
pipeline to the printer whether it's
matter or not but likely it will matter
soon because you can do more with more
information can do smooth gradients and
such on on the print some help by
getting a photoshop plugins so that you
directly print from a plug-in because
the printing process is from this
application sometimes very error-prone
you have to select the printer the paper
size the application print dialog the
printer driver dialogue and they all
again have to match it these are
sometimes three or four dialogues you
have to go through and if you decide one
wrong
gone is the paper five dollars 15
minutes and ink yeah so a application I
Lightroom do it a little bit better yeah
and this is easier from from a rip from
a rasta imaging processor
post-processing drying is very important
if you have from roll you have to decode
their devices where you can decal paper
and so on I skip ribs a little bit they
are kind of dedicated application which
do nothing else than printing in the
productive environment you have to have
a rep because otherwise you don't get
the productivity multiple photos on one
sheet and all different color manage and
such but also sometimes you get the
optimal quality through ribs all the
space to have good photo editing because
the old dark room is now the light room
I wrote it this way not to confuse with
the product that you know the product
has his name from it so what you do in
Photoshop is actually our light zone is
actually preparing the print what you
did in the classic darkroom and that's
where most of the time your time is once
you have figured out how the printer
gets it it that's done nearly on time
question announcer please
what what's your
you mean neutral I think the main
printers which have about three gray
inks and if you use their black and
white mode they they get a very good
neutral I even get it in color mode from
some printers today I think they get it
you get pretty good neutrals today it's
not too difficult anymore oh the
interesting part is that I don't
actually want neutral prints I mostly
tone prints yet it's split toning
shadows and highlights different toned
yeah which also helps you around this
problem because it neutral to one looks
to coal to the other two warm so it's
never in the classic dark room that you
really wanted you to a print that you
didn't want the cameras you don't want
to look at greenish that's for sure you
didn't want to have yeah one more the
inkjet printers already win against
light yet it like she's are very good
gettin get me right yeah but the problem
with was lighted first of all you you
cannot put it into your room a light yet
which think of that iteration yeah so
you would need to soft proof on an
inkjet printer anyway to get to the
light yet yeah and I know very good
financial drivers at Ansel Adams gallery
they print of a print from most other
prints on inkjet in some time they go on
like shit if they cannot handle the
sizes because if you handling 40 x 50
print is is a not by itself yeah I I
wouldn't know how to do that so
