diffusion thank you and i would like to
thnkx organizers and including myself
and golfers and that talk include the
video in trailer alejandra and syriac
news for NASA from NASA and Mark dyckman
from Michigan State University and what
we like to do is to describe a very
simple problem with some conclusions
which were not expected this problem is
not meant to be immediately
generalizable however the conclusions
perhaps will be what we'd like to do is
to start with the kimbo zurich mechanism
in quantum annealing something that
Anatolia polkovnik of a think made it
available to quantum annealing community
in 2005 and it really is a simple thing
if you have a system with the quantum
critical point and then you drive the
system through that point use varying a
parameter for example transverse field
if you're talking a linear chain of
spins and what happens the energy gap
separating the ground state from excited
states in limit of infinite system size
go through the singular behavior and
this is a typical example and just
leaving all the details completely out
of this talk I just wanted to say what
is important then this Delta this energy
gap is some function of a difference
between the value of G this parameter
that you're using can a critical value
with some exponents which are called
critical exponents and at the same time
as you get closer and closer to the
phase transition your your correlation
length grows so there is a civil
exponents explaining how this
correlation length grows as a function
to the closest of that
decision and how the gap shrinks down
now what is important however there
isn't another parameter another another
feature in that dynamics that plays a
role because as you get closer to their
to the critical point and your gear
shrinks down at some point if you move
with the constant rate the the rate
he'll the gap shrinks down you no longer
be able to support adiabatic behavior
and the condition for that is really
very simple a logarithmic all derivative
of the gap as a function of time needs
to be comparable to the gap itself
that's a condition where the idea but
icity breaks down well if you have that
condition and if you assume that your
transverse field is changing linearly or
parameter is changing linearly in time
and you have relations between the gap
and correlation length and transverse
field through the critical exponents you
can solve these equations and the end
result of that solution would be that
you can determine the point where the
idea but icity breaks down and the point
for a given rate with which you pass
through the critical point so that point
where the debate icity breaks down you
can compute the correlation legs or
people say density of defects and the
quantum annealing you can compute number
of excitations that you still left with
by the time the debate icity broke down
and that number of excitations can be
connected to the rate with which you
pass through the particular point and
some critical exponents that meant to be
universal the net result of that
analysis specifically for examples
linear chainable it spins in a
transverse field izing spins and
transverse field is very simple and
recognizable all critical exponents are
equal one in this case and then you have
one simple result as you pass through
the critical point the number of defects
that you have scales as a square root of
the velocity with which you move and
this is a very simple correspondence
with the law that we are lady
know that the time that it takes for
adiabatic evolution skills as the
inverse of the gap those two things are
connected with each other however in
this talk we will not be interested in
finding a ground state of a system we
will be able we will be interested in
that paradigm as we are moving with some
velocity we are going through the
bottleneck and we are interested what is
the approximate solution that we are
left with after we pass through that
critical region or something like that
so in that regime this behavior and
proportional square root of V it's a
very good starting point what you like
to do today is to describe an extremely
simple example however again it's a
linear chain it's an Isaan chain of
spins in a transverse field with no
disorder what you like to do however we
would like to examine how that simple
prescription given by the keyboards
auric mechanism is changing when you add
coupling to environment what you're
going to do we're going to add coupling
to environments through the spin flip
process essentially coupling to Sigma X
at every spin Sigma X paola matrix will
be coupled to its own bath thermal baths
through the operator XJ and it's a
thermal base you can call them bosons
they will consider bosonic base now what
is important the death process
corresponds to a simple classical spin
flip process in a globe or dynamic
that's a counterpart now what is
important also that closer to the end of
quantum annealing when the transfer when
the transverse field is relatively small
and ZEB basis become essentially more
native basis for evolution whatever
sigma z noise losses is significance in
terms of making transitions between the
state have ever sigma x two wives so
that noise become important as we gonna
show later exactly in the in the range
of quantum annealing wear something
interesting can happens if you if you
have that noise so just to set up the
stage
like to say that the linear chain i just
described could be described in terms of
the free fer me on gas it's a non
interacting fermions in an absence of
kaplan to environment once you had
environment they can of course started
directing to each other but what in the
absence of coupling to environments as a
free fermion guess what i can do i can
enumerate every firm you on with the
momentum after doing certain
transformations Wigner jordan etc every
fermi one has a momentum K and K varies
from a negative to positive well with a
very small step inversely proportional
to the number of spins and then it can
write down the Hamiltonian and there is
an energy for each Fermi on in fact what
what what we plotted here are energies
of fermions with different k with the
two fermion for Fermi 16 fermion etc
described by different colors so every
every fermion go through the minimum gap
with its own that the gap determines
determine its own value determined by
the value of K but its own momentum so
that's the kind of dynamics you have a
you have a the whole system is
essentially represented by the
independent fermions and every firm ion
has its own minimum gibbeh that's a
system and what is important here that
what we typically that dynamics is
described by this bag a loop of angles
that essentially determine the overlap
between this pair of her my own states
and the states with no fermions in each
sector of its own momentum that sounds
complicated but there are really two
questions which we could ask for that
kind of quantum annealing there are two
strategies one of them what if you try
to stay in a ground state and try to
move as fast as possible maybe in this
case we can move so fast that we will be
able to avoid problems with the with
dissipation because dissipation takes
finite time and on the other hand maybe
we don't have to do it instead we move
slow enough and will let the dissipation
to build an instant
tenias equilibrium distribution in a
current Hamiltonian and maybe as we do
that we will be able at the end to bring
the system to the ground state because
they get become large and the
temperature is not changing so those two
different strategies what we would like
to do is to examine the first one can
you actually do get a meaningful speed
up if you just try to move as fast as
possible but of course being fast have
certain limitations to it because if you
move extremely fast you're Landau's
inner mechanism will generate you
defects as we talked to Vinny Kimball
zurich mechanism right that's what the
origin is however if you move too slow
then thermal excitation will get excited
and in this approach what we are really
doing we are moving just fast enough to
create a sweet spot right where we could
be minimized both quantities at the same
time and in fact you can convince
yourself that there is a the total
probability to be in a ground state at
the end in certain regime is 1 minus
probability to get excited through the
landau-zener with all these pheromones
to get excited and the total probability
of excitation coming from the ground
state due to the thermal baths and again
there is a regime when you move just
fast enough so that simple approach
actually is accurate one then all you
need to do just to include the
probability of excitation up without
worrying about going down well if you
cure for the computer on those inner
transitions and the total probability of
excitations as you go through the
critical point you have the probability
to be in a ground state is inversely is
exponent to the minus n and is a number
of spins that has two terms in it one of
these terms response to knowledge about
Yolanda under transitions and
recognizably is proportional to the
square root of the velocity with which
you move another term again an exponent
is inversely proportional to the red
with which you move that corresponds to
the effects of noise and excitation
environment i should say excitation from
the ground state those two dependents
and some velocity goes in opposite
direction so you can optimize this and
if you optimize you actually get some
sir and you get the answer that
exponential it depends on a number of
spins but it does have a temperature to
this power four thirds so what does it
tell you tell us it's in this yellow box
and essentially said the following that
for the temperature that are still
larger than the minimum gap please know
that the gap is one over N so if I have
a temperature that are still in fact
much larger than the minimum gap that
means that I allow excitations to cure
it is possible to achieve the level of
performance of adiabatic evolution
without noise so you're moving with
sufficiently high temperature but you
are moving fast enough and that is their
conclusion well that conclusion is not
particularly scalable because you need
your temperature to scale smaller than
one over N to the power three quarters
that rarely happens maybe in some range
of n is possible but that's a conclusion
what we like now to do is to create to
consider a different approach what
happens if we actually move sufficiently
slow but again I want to emphasize we
are never going to move with any
velocity that scales inversely to the
system size we're going to move with a
constant velocity now with velocity that
does not depend on a system size and we
would like to ask can we move with that
velocity and still maintain quasi
equilibrium distribution perhaps or
whatever we get it there then still find
a solution or approximate solution with
some accuracy so to do that we write
down the spin bazan interaction and
again in this picture with Momentum's
those p q r fermion operators
corresponding to momentum q and xq are
corresponding bosonic modes of the
environment that now also required a
momentum you can write down the
interaction between the fermions and
bosons in this case and bosons look like
phonons because I have momentum and this
interaction Hamiltonian is very
interesting it is different from what
you would have in a typical transmen
situation because in a transman
situation you're in a rotating frame and
therefore you conserve the number of
particles here the number of particles
is not
served and you have three possible
processes one process is a fermion boson
scattering when you basically take a
fermion with momentum you change it and
another in you emit or absorb the bo's'n
another process is a boson fermion
Furman wasn't generation what happens
out of the vacuum you generate two
fermions and you absorb the bottom and
then there is a third process in verse
it's a tuba zone to Fermi own
annihilation it's when you have two
fermions they approach each other and a
sufficiently small distance all their
wave functions overlap and there is a
process of their annihilation and those
three processes work in a different way
first of all you can compute the
transition rates for those processes and
they will depend on this bag a loop of
angle meaning they are sensitive to
where you are relative to the critical
point you can compute transition rates
for the scattering and also for
recombination and generation and what is
really important that in the in the
vicinity of the critical point the
fermions have a typical energy
corresponding to the temperature so
their Momentum's are actually relatively
fast because temperature the thermal
Momentum's in this system are much much
bigger than any typical Momentum's
corresponding to this to the rates that
happens with the spatial and homogeneity
or a scattering crazy those are
proportional to the coupling to
environment thermal Momentum's are fast
so if you do that then you can convince
yourself that as you pass through the
critical point trying to maintain a
quasi equilibrium you can actually be
successful with that and you can do it
relatively fast the trouble happens in
fact as you move into the semi-classical
region where the gap this value of the
gap is actually bigger than the
temperature this is where the problem
occurs is right there and in fact what
happens in this region is something
fairly simple at the beginning you have
effective mass H fermion because you
have a parabolic band has effective mass
and that effective mass actually grows
as you move away from the critical point
and the first obvious observe
station is that as your gap grows from
the ground state from no fermionic state
as you move away from the critical point
it becomes harder and harder to generate
fermions so the the equilibrium
concentration of fermions as you move
through that point is getting depleted
so there will be fewer and fewer
fermions there and that has a
consequence because for fermions to a
mere late they have to come close to
each other so basically if you if you
have a nail Asian process it will be
proportional to the product of the
concentration it's it's quadratic in the
concentration of fermions because the
recombination required two fermions so
it's quadratic but if the concentration
of fermions goes down so we'll be
recombination process that means that in
that area and people in semiconductor
physics know this very well the intra
band processes the scattering within
fermions from each other the scattering
confirman and a boson and changing its
momentum are very fast much faster than
the process of recombination and
generation and you can actually solve
that equations for the fur muon
scattering can obtain the momentum
relaxation and the momentum relaxation
is a very fast process in fact it
accelerates with time as the fermion
mass increases now because of that it is
possible to separate you can actually
assume the thermal scatter its momentum
so fast that essentially you create a
distribution you can just you can be
interested in one number which is a
number of fermions in a band and then if
you do that then you have a very simple
equation you don't really care how this
formula moves in space they move fairly
fast so you just have a number and total
number of pheromones and then what you
do you can write a simple equation well
you have to write it through the summit
america manipulation with a quantum
kinetic equation of that i'm just giving
you an answer it's a simple equation of
the bimolecular reaction where if the
concentration of fermions is decreasing
with recombination rate and is
proportional to the square of that
concentration itself so
when you can analyze these dynamics it's
a very different dynamics from the
equilibrium one because the system
becomes substantially nonequilibrium
what happens however because as you keep
recombining those fermions the distance
between fermions become large and when
the distance between thermals become
larger and larger these firms become
having a hard time reaching each other
what also happens in this situation
because if you look microscopically how
actually Fermi on moves it's a very
archetypical simple picture described I
think in 1946 by Chandrasekhar because
you have a particle whose momentum
undergoes Brownian motion and as a
result the coordinate of the particle
undergoes diffusive motion so it's a
simple diffusive coefficient that you
can describe so these fermions there
like a classical particles but the
coefficient of diffusion knows about
quantum mechanics because the motion of
the fermion is really remember the
fermion is a glorified king it's a
domain wall it's not exactly the main
ball but it's not to think of that but
their domain wall has a width which is
proportional to the mean free path it's
a coherent lengths so in a way a large
groups of spins get reconfigured and as
the fermion moves so it's a multi spin
collective motion so for this diffuser
diffusion coefficient has a quantum
origin and in fact it's really getting
large and large as you approach critical
point and what's worse it becomes small
but as you go away from the critical
point your diffusion coefficient becomes
smaller and smaller and the firm you now
have a problem to reach each other if
they have a problem to reach each other
they cannot recombine and a very simple
illustration of that and then once that
happens the system goes in a strongly
nonequilibrium highly highly correlated
regime and its again known in chemistry
but I would like to emphasize this
simple picture describes what is going
on in a simple example so what happens
you know suppose I'm sitting in one of
these blue dots and I'm trying it's my
fermion and I'm trying to reach another
firm yan
two things happens at the same time on
one hand fermions in average recombine
so their concentration decreases and the
in fact because it's a bar Molecular
equation the concentration tend to
decrease inversely proportional on time
that means the distance between fermions
an average grows linearly in time
however the Fermi on tries to diffuse
and as we know if I compute how much
distance it travels over the time T it's
a square root so the square root at the
beginning wins but eventually loses then
linear distance and when it loses then
the pheromones no longer can have time
to approach each other and the situation
is essentially scale-free because what
happens whatever they were close to each
other they recombine with each other and
they create a hole so the whole system
creates a hierarchy of these holes and
you can analyze this but the bottom line
that the process of recombination the
process of annealing slows down
significantly at that point and you can
just take the concentration the
crossover concentration when this
happened and you can assume this is
where your solution for quantum
annealing is and you can analyze and in
fact that crossover concentration is a
non-monotonic function of quantum
annealing grade and it in fact the
optimum is fairly close to quiet two
critical point it's still far away
you're in the semi-classical region but
it's inversely proportional to the
temperature so it's fairly close the net
result I would like to emphasize is here
and unfortunately there is a there is a
blog with my name that I don't need here
because it really prohibits me to show
let me do this or wait a minute what
happened ok so what we did is a very
simple comparison just to give you a
main message if I would be moving with
no coupling to environment at all we
will have a Kimble Zurich we would have
as a promise before the number of
excitations you create which is a square
root of velocity what we're going to do
now we're going to play this game let's
remember that number of excitations ok
and let's actually consider what would
be a rate of noise driven this
nonequilibrium diffusion cuanto
Manny link to reach the same density of
defects and now we're going to pay the
ratio of this rate optimal rate of
quantum annealing the terminated
crossover point / Kimbo zurich rate to
reach the same density of the facts and
in fact that ratio beta is an inverse
temperature it's extremely large betta
is very large alpha it's Copeland to
environment it's very small and there is
a logarithm sitting there so what is
important the lower is the temperature
and the smaller the coupling to
environment the more the mechanism
driven by the by the quantum diffusion
mediated by environment become faster
than the kimball Zurich mechanism this
is an interesting finding that you can
actually find an approximate solution
better with environment and resulted but
we did use this specific Kaplan to
environment which is a global process
anyway I'm finished and I think question
so I have a question about this
condensed matter point of view of
quantum annealing so to talk about cute
Erick and scalings and divergences and
things like this the the firm dynamic
limit has to be well-defined and i
noticed i think this goes back to the to
the very first works by anatoliy that
the way this is done is that the the
chair chaise have to be scaled with
square root of n no otherwise the energy
density in the firm dynamic limit your
eric has to be large enough yes and it's
and you have to scale the chase with
square root of n square what did the JS
the interactions in the in the spin
glass the tray a chase in this problem
you don't need to scale J with them it's
1d in this problem you don't need at all
ok there is a very simple thing your
gear so this is only valid for one
didn't we heard you can generalize it to
2d and this notion of the diffusion
limited regime will still be there in 3d
will be more generic diffusion that all
this will we can talk about this
separately but the bottom line is this
at the critical point your gap scales
inversely as a polynomial event as long
as your temperature is much bigger than
that then as you go through the critical
point the motion is essentially
macroscopic which you involve a lot of
levels so that that that description
become correct as long as you have a lot
of levels under your temperature ok
let's thank buddy once more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
