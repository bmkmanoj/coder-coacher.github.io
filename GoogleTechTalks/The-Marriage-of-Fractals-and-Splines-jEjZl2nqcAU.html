speak and then after that they go on The
Colbert Report and I'm John Stewart I
don't know if I'll have that that option
but it's nice to be here all right so
I'm gonna talk about fractals and spline
so I kind of assume that you've heard
the word fractal before and we're gonna
see many pictures of fractals swine
spline is just a synonym for polynomials
so if you don't like the words flying
swine means a lot of polynomials
polynomials strung together but I think
for today's purpose we'll just talk
about polynomials to be simpler so
you've all heard of polynomials so now
you know we're talking about polynomials
and fractals and I'm not intending today
to teach you anything useful this is
gonna be entertainment but there is a
philosophical point to today's talk and
that is that fractals which you may
think of rather as complicated objects
maybe you didn't see them till you got
to university and polynomials which you
probably heard about in high school
these are really the same thing okay
that's sort of the broad philosophy of
this talk and that's what the marriage
here is about so I'm going to show you
that ways we generate fractals can be
used to generate polynomials and ways we
use generate polynomials can be used to
generate fractals so we'll see how that
goes so here's a collection of fractals
you've probably seen some of them before
some of them look very abstract like
there's a Penske gasket or the Koch
snowflake and some of them may look more
organic like a tree or a leaf but these
are all fractals and there's certain
things I want to point out about them
that are useful to know yeah so this
sierpinski gasket you can see is made up
of several smaller copies of itself so
it's self-similar that means it's it's
made up of pieces which are the same but
scaled down versions of the same thing
and this is often true with fractals I
mean you can see it a little bit with
the snowflake and certainly with the
bush in the tree another thing you can
see is that in the in the gasket you
know the white and the black sort of
interpenetrate for simple curves you can
see the plan will see this for example
with polynomials you know see the white
and then and you see the blue here and
they don't end up penetrate at all but
for fractals they often in Japan
trait and this has something to do with
the dimension of the fractal we'll come
to that in a minute the other thing you
can see with fractals is like with a
snowflake for example this is an example
of a curve which is continuous
everywhere there are no breaks in the
curve but it's not differentiable
anywhere so every point on the curve is
a peak in some sense it's like every
point looks like the absolute value at
the origin so these are often considered
very strange objects okay so these are a
collection of stay on the track tiles
and see more of these later on the other
hand yeah sure so the question is these
fractals are self-similar are there
fractals that not are not self-similar
yes but i'm today the talk will be
restricted to fractals are self-similar
i mean if you think about say Julia sets
or the Mandelbrot set it's not so clear
that they're self similar in the way I'm
talking about today but the kind of
fractals I'll talk about today and I'll
be more specific about what kind I'm
talking about today in a little while
are all self similar in this sense okay
yeah feel free to stop me at any point
by the way not many of you here I don't
know who's out there but feel free to
stop me and ask questions okay okay so
these are fractals they look a little
bit complicated but we'll talk about I
generate them in a bit and here are
polynomials so these are fairly simple
objects so here we have a parabola and
you might say well the parabola maybe
it's self similar pretty much any piece
of the parabola looks like any other
piece of parabola so maybe maybe it
shares that property refract owes maybe
not but here we have some cubic curves
he has a curve with an inflection point
here's a curve with a self intersection
point here here's a curve with a cusp so
for example this this this is just a
cubic polynomial but it's not made up of
smaller things that have self
intersection points there's only one
self intersection point so you might
think well these are definitely not
fractals in the sense I just talked
about but I'll try to convince you
otherwise in a little while
so these are our players the fractals
and the polynomials okay so some some
comparisons the fractals I'll talk about
ourselves
or the polynomial self-similar maybe yes
maybe no the fractals typically have
dimension greater than one that's this
in interpenetration between the fractal
and the boundary where some parts look
kind of grey and that you know you can
actually compute these dimensions and
often these fractals have dimension
that's greater than one and the
polynomial certainly have dimension that
that's one whatever dimension means it's
clear that simple polynomials are
one-dimensional we saw that you can have
fractals that are continuous everywhere
but differentiable nowhere well of
course polynomials you can certainly
differentiate everywhere they're
infinitely differentiable polynomials
have parameterizations
and that's how I'm going to generate
these polynomials the fractals have
parameterizations I'm gonna argue yes in
a little while and there are other
characteristic properties we'll talk
about in a little while that may be
shared maybe not shared and I want to
talk about those as well so I'm gonna
start initially talking about
polynomials and the way I'm gonna
represent polynomials are as Bezier
curves people know that Bezier curves a
few okay so I'll explain to you what a
busy just the polynomial just another
nerve name for a polynomial but let's
let's look at pictures so here's a
picture two points if you have two
points you want to make a curve you make
a straight line but if you have three
points so I have three points well you
can make a polynomial that interpolates
the points we can move the points around
you can generate a polynomial
interpolating the coins it's a parabola
not difficult no if we continue with
interpolation here's four points I can
make a polynomial that interpolates four
points looks a little bit odd because if
there's a bit of overshoot here this
goes a little higher than maybe it
should but I can move the points around
and yeah I can get a polynomial to
interpolate those points no problem
it's called Lagrange interpolation by
the way just polynomial interpolation
here have a lot of points they're all in
straight lines so if I want to
interpolate them I'll get a straight
line but here's what happens though I
move this point off the line that you
see happening is you get well of course
the curve follows goes through all the
points they get these oscillations these
kind of wild oscillations in the curve
there are no such oscillations in the
data right
data may be as flat and goes up and
comes down but there's these extra
oscillations in the curve that sort of
forced by this constraint of
interpolation so typically we don't
insist on interpolation when we do say
geometric modeling we give up
interpolation to get the shape right the
shape is not right these isolations are
not in the data so instead of doing
what's called the grunge interpolation
which I've just been showing you we do
what's called bezzie a approximation so
here's three points again so again we
get a parabola but the parabola doesn't
go through this point but if we move
this point the curve sort of follows
along these these blue lines are tangent
to the curve and go through this point
we can move the points will still get a
parabola we've just given up for now
we've given up interpolation you
interpolate these two points when all
the middle point we can do four points
there's four points again we interpolate
the endpoints but not the two middle
points to move them points around and
again the curve sort of follows along it
doesn't interpolate but it sort of
follows along so the idea is to
interpret to approximate shape rather
than to interpolate the data so here are
those all those points again aligned in
a straight line now with what happens if
we move the middle point so we don't see
that those wild oscillations the curve
does not interpolate all the points but
it sort of gives the right shape I mean
the data is flat and it goes up and it
comes down that's what the curve does so
it was a Bezier curves they're actually
polynomials so let me say a word about
formulas for them how we actually write
them down so we start with a collection
of polynomials these are called basis
function so usually you write a
polynomial you think I'll write it in
terms of 1t t squared t cubed we're just
gonna use a different basis so the basis
are given by you what are called the
Bernstein basis functions and here they
are I've just written them down for a
degree N and you've probably seen these
before in another course name in the
course on probability theory but we're
gonna use them in approximation theories
so these are the Bernstein basis
functions and maybe one property that
might be useful today is that they
actually sum to one so if you add them
up these up then if you expand this
formula by the binomial theorem
you get this and of course that sums to
one only fact you need to know all right
so now we take these basis functions and
we take some points P sub K and we
multiply them and add and that generates
a curve okay so it's a function of T T
varies we're gonna get a curve at the
point speak a line in the plane then
we'll get a curve in the plane so this
is shorthand for two equations as an
equation for the x coordinate so PK is
two coordinates X K and YK here's our
equation for X here's our equation for y
as T varies x and y vary and we get a
new curve in the plane that's called the
Bezier curve it's just the polynomial of
the different bases but it has these
nice properties here's a picture again
so here we see the curve and here we see
the control points I've connected them
with straight lines that's called the
control polygon controls the shape of
the curve you saw when I move the points
the curve kind of moves along with it
lots of nice properties for Bezier
curves of course they're polynomials
they have all these nice properties the
one I showed you today was the variation
diminishing property which meant there's
a theorem that one can prove that says
they won't the curves won't ever
oscillate more than the data so unlike
interpolation we have this nice property
that things don't isolate too much and
that's why we've gone too busy occurs
I'm not going to dwell on this today
just mention that it's a property I'm
glad what I'm gonna dwell on today or
some algorithm so there's a number of
algorithms associated with Bezier curves
to evaluate to differentiate to
subdivide in particular I'm gonna look
at subdivision so let me say a word
about this so here's another way of
evaluating a point on a Bezier curve we
had this formula down here for
evaluating points on a curve you plug in
dies of T and outcome points in the XY
plane but you can also do it this way
take your control points and put them
down here so I'm gonna do this for
cubics but this works for any degree and
then do linear interpolation that is
take this point and multiply by 1 minus
T take this point and multiply it by T
and put the results here and do the same
here and the same here so this is linear
interpolation straight lines basically
now do it again take these lines and
apply linear interpolation to them
multiply this one by 1 minus T this one
by T put the results here same thing
here and then do it one more time
and what comes out at the top as depends
on the parameter t and on the input
these control points turns out to be
exactly the same as this formula so
you're gonna take this on faith today B
it's easy to work out and this works for
any degree again I've Illustrated for
cubics if you had more control points
than instead of going up three levels
you've got four levels or five levels or
whatever numbers have levels so now we
have two alternative ways of evaluating
polynomials - to plug into the formula
one is run the algorithm now this
particular reason I've shown you this
algorithm I mean I'm not just interested
in alternate ways of doing things I want
to show you another algorithm that's
really fundamental to polynomials and to
the analysis of Bezier curves here's the
picture again so here's a point on
Bezier curve with parameter R and what
I'm gonna do is try to split the curve
into two pieces so here's the point two
parameter R this is a polynomial the
black curve is a polynomial it's
actually a piece of a polynomial
cuz I'm look and I look at a Bezier
curve I only look at a piece of the
polynomial but any piece of a polynomial
is a Bezier curve so if I say well I
only want the piece from here to here
right that's a piece of a polynomial it
should have control points so there
should be some cues that represent this
piece of the polynomial and similarly
there should be some R's
some new control points that represent
that piece of the polynomial so it's
called subdivision I'm splitting the
Bezier curve into two pieces why do I
want to do this well even from the
picture you can see that the to control
polygons new ones that God are closer to
the curve than the original one and if I
ate this these control polygons actually
converge to the curves it's one way of
rendering the curve is just by doing
subdivision and then displaying the
control polygons and everything I have
to worry about evaluating polynomials
okay that but I have to have a good
algorithm that given the peas will
generate the Q's in the arse and it
turns out I have such a good algorithm
it's the same algorithm I just showed
you before I take the same algorithm I
showed you before and I suppose I want
to subdivide at the parameter R I run
the algorithm and off of this side
magically you get the Q the Q control
points for the left side of the curve or
off the other side you get the arse for
the right side
the curve and this works for any
parameter R but well between zero and
one okay so here's the picture again
here's what I wanted to do here
subdivision I want to get the Q's and
the RS given the peas and here's the
algorithm just run this evaluation
algorithm and read off the Q's in the
artist from the algorithm so it's very
simple and then you can iterate this
process and I'll show you that in a
second and what I use this process for
is for rendering so you know if the
control polygons are good approximation
I render them otherwise I subdivide and
I render the pieces and I continue to do
this until it looks good I can also use
this varnish section if I had to Bezier
curves if I could approximate them with
straight lines I can intersect them
otherwise I subdivide if I subdivide
enough each each piece will look like a
straight line then you respect the
straight line so it's a way of getting
piecewise linear approximations to
polynomials and linear things we can do
very quickly so some pictures so okay
let's look at this so suppose I want to
render this doing subdivision so you can
see the curve here I'm gonna subdivide
the control polygon and get to control
polygons you can see it's already closed
that's one subdivision two subdivisions
three subdivisions you can't tell the
difference between the curve and the
control polygons here's another example
one round one round of subdivision yeah
two rounds three rounds you can see
pretty quickly that the control polygon
converges to the curve you can do this
with any Bezier curve here's just the
simple parabola one round of subdivision
two rounds three rounds you're there so
it's a very quick way of rendering I
don't have to do any polynomial
valuation all I have to do this is the
simple sub division algorithm iterate
iterate iterate and I'm there okay so
that's polynomial so having the
introduction to polynomials that's how
I'm gonna think about polynomials Bezier
curves and I can generate them very
quickly by subdivision what about
splines so I need to tell you how I'm
going to generate splines now I want to
show you it's the same thing
that's the argument today though
fractals rather yeah I'm gonna show you
fractals algorithms for generating
fractals then I'll argue polynomials
fractals the same thing another
Mathematica notebook so give me a minute
to pull this up so let's look first at
say there's sierpinski gasket Sowinski
triangle and see how we can generate
that it was a miniature to run Oh while
we're doing that I should show you one
more thing by the way about subdivision
four four four Bezier curve so here
another example and you know I was doing
subdivision I was always about
subdividing at the parameter yeah was
converging nicely to the curve but I can
change that parameter I can subdivide
say it you know maybe a third the
changes like the initial subdivision but
if you iterate that subdivision it's
still converges so I can move that
initial parameter instead of subdividing
and a half I have a lot of freedom on
where I can subdivide it really doesn't
matter it's independent of that
parameter okay
fractals so complicated how do i
generate that that gasket well the
easiest way I know is to start with the
outer triangle so go back just to the
outer triangle and what I'm going to do
is I'm gonna scale this triangle by a
half from the vertices of the triangle
from here in here here so if I scale by
a half the triangle three times I'm
gonna get three triangles there they are
ignore the upside-down triangle in the
middle just take these three corner
triangles and now we're gonna iterate
that process as I'm going to take the
same three scaling transformations and
apply them to these three triangles if I
do that I'll get nine triangles
then 27 triangles and you know you
iterate this you can pretty quickly see
that it's gonna converge to the
sierpinski gasket so it's a pretty
simple pretty simple process now if you
go back to my bezier curve
I do subdivision on it if I move a
control point or the control polygon I
change the curve I can run rerun
subdivision and of course it will
converge the new curve so the the Bezier
curve depends on the control polygon so
what about the fractal about the fractal
so we can think of the control polygon
for this fractal we think of it as the
triangle so what if we start with a
different control polygon and run the
same algorithm that is I'm gonna still
scale by 1/2 from the corners of the
triangle but I'm gonna start with
something else for example square okay
so I'll start with a square run the same
algorithm what's going to happen so I
have three transformations I apply them
to the square I'm gonna get three
squares there they are running again
nine squares 27 squared 81 squares big
number of squares and if you haven't
seen this before it's kind of startling
that it didn't really matter but the
bezier curve it mattered and mattered
why your control polygon was if you
change the control polygon you change
the shape of the curve but here a dent
it's an attractor you can start with a
single point here's a single point run
the same algorithm so you have these
three transformations you're going to
apply to the single point so you get
three points get nine points 27 points
but doesn't really matter what point
every point is converging to the entire
fractal this is a property of the
fractals I'm talking about today that
there are tractors so it doesn't matter
what you start with you're gonna wind up
with with this now you can ask yourself
well I'm always gonna wind up with that
what if I wanted to wind up with that
I'm gonna do that because remember the
algorithm using always winds up with the
same thing I want to somehow I want to
warp it now my argument today is gonna
be well this is just the Bezier curve so
how is that a Bezier curve well you have
to hang around find out all right
other things just to show you this
wasn't just a property of the
the sierpinski gasket here's a
triangular bump right and what we're
gonna do is replace every line on this
little triangular bump is triangular
pulse by a little scaled-down triangular
pulse so we'll have four transformations
each transformation replacing a line by
a pulse we do that it's something like
this this is the curve a piece of a
 snowflake and this is a curve
that's continuous everywhere and
differentiable no where in the limit and
again this doesn't really matter what
you start with as long as you use the
same transformations so I've changed
what I start with but I haven't changed
the four transformations and if you were
to write again let's see okay looks a
little crazy to begin with but it's all
gonna straighten out in the end
it's an attractor it doesn't matter what
you start with lots of curves like this
I'll show you one or two more here's the
C curve looks complicated but in fact
it's very much like the curve all
you do is you start with a straight line
there a straight line yeah a straight
line and you replace the line by two
lines like this two lines and now every
line is replaced by two lines so we have
to be patient with this one but if you
keep doing this I'm doing this this
guy's gonna appear again a little while
if you do this for a while replacing
every line by two lines and then finally
in the limit after you do a lot of
iterations that magically that C curve
will emerge okay and doesn't matter what
you start with instead of starting with
a straight line we can start really
triangle and it kind of looked a little
crazy to begin with but if you persevere
since these things are attractors then
no matter what you start with and no
matter how crazy it looks like in sort
of intermediate steps if you're
perseverant enough eventually you'll get
to the C curve so it's beginning to
emerge you can see it here it is so
start with straight lines start with
triangles but if you like now why is
this important well suppose I have
something where I don't know what to
start with
so with the sierpinski gasket I kind of
knew to start with the triangle
motherhood didn't really matter and with
the curve I had that triangular
pulse but suppose I give you something
like this it's not so clear what I
should start with but remember it
doesn't really matter as long as I know
the transformations so what are the
transformations well they're the
self-similar parts so here you see a
part that's just a scaled-down version
of the whole so if I scale by 1/2 from
this corner I'll map the whole fractal
into this piece that's one of the
transformations here's another piece so
if I scale from this corner and then
translate over here that's the second
transformation and here's a third piece
so again I have to do some rotation and
translation to map this into that those
are the three transformations and once I
know that it doesn't matter what I start
with so I'll start with a straight line
and I'll apply those transformations and
we'll get fractal so here's a straight
line and if you have faith that I got
the right transformations and you know
you have three lines and nine lines
they'll go on for a while but eventually
I wind up doesn't look like much but if
you persevere it'll show up and that's
just the nature of the beast that's how
fractal these kind of fractals work but
again you might say well that's
interesting whatever you start with you
get this suppose I want some kind of
warped version of it like that how am I
gonna get that whatever I start with I
got the other one
I want to get this so again my argument
is this this is a Bezier curve we'll
come back to that
well okay back to some notes here just
refresh your memory how I did this but
I'm really looking at our fixed point
theorem so what's a fixed point of a
transformation is just that you apply
some transformation to a point you get
back the point okay and I'm gonna look
at maps that bring things closer
together those are called contractive
maps and then there's a famous theorem
that says if you have contractive maps
on a complete space complete means every
because she's sequence converges don't
worry
anyway if you apply contractive maps on
a nice space and you iterate them that's
what we were doing we're iterating some
transformations then
literation will always converge always
converge and always converge to the same
thing that's what we saw it didn't
matter what I started with with the
fractal is it always converged and
always converge to the same thing now
that's what's behind this we could talk
about the details but not really go into
the details the objects we're looking at
our compact sets the distance formulas
house-dog metric the space is complete
you iterate you have a collection of
transformations thinking there's a
Penske gasket I had three
transformations at the corners I apply
these transformations to some set and
doesn't matter what I picked
I either ate their transformations
converges for the fractal that's what I
was showing you okay
so again just to reiterate we have these
properties of fractals they're self
similar these transformations are
applied get generate self similar parts
that fractional dimensions are the
properties the property are most
interested in is their attractors it
doesn't matter what I start with
they're attractors here are the
properties the Bezier curves they have
control points
unlike fractals and that
parameterizations unlike fractals here's
the comparison side-by-side so if I want
to show you these are the same thing so
the first thing I want to convince you
of is that these Bezier curves these
polynomials are actually attractive so
here we have attractors on the fractal
side where I'll show you that poem is
the same thing they better be attractors
so let's look at that I'm gonna show you
polynomials are actually attractive that
you know before I said well they
depended on the control points but maybe
that was a lie here's a nice control
polygon for a Bezier curve will run
subdivision and sure it generates the
Bezier curve we're not surprised
but let's start with something else
sorry the straight line I claim there's
an algorithm that will generate two
lines and four lines and eight lines and
then you'll get the Bezier curve it's an
attractor it doesn't matter what you
start with I'll explain why in a minute
you can even start with a single point
run this algorithm which I'll show you
in a minute and you'll get more points
and if you are perseverant enough you'll
get the Bezier curve it doesn't matter
what you start with you start moving
take more
complicated control polygon so you get a
little bit Wilder subdivision algorithm
and so the subdivision of course
converges to this nice curve with a self
intersection it's a well that's not self
similar but what the hell let's start
with something different that's not the
same control polygon that's the control
polygon for the other curve but we'll
apply our algorithm and we get this
crazy-looking control polygon right but
we'll iterate and my claim is will
converge to this new nice new curve with
the self intersection point so it's in
Traktor bezier curves that retract is
just like fractals start with a single
point you get two points four points and
if you're persistent you get lots of
points and you'll get back the curve
just like in fractal so how am i doing
this you know how does this work I'll
say worried about that what's the magic
behind splines or polynomials being
attractors so here's subdivision here's
here's the picture again I start with
some curve and I'm just split it into
two parts here's the algorithm so the
queues in the are is somehow depend on
the peas you can see that just from the
diagram is some formula for getting the
Q's and the artists from the peas and
can write that in that formula
explicitly in terms of matrices so I've
written down these two matrices here and
the Q's well you take LS left matrix
times the P and R is the right matrix
times the P you can you know check the
details but it's clear the some matrix
and I've you can believe me these are
the right matrices okay so now I have
these matrices and if you apply them you
get subdivision that's how the
subdivision works
gets you from the piece and the Q's than
they ours now I want to generate
contract of maps that are going to be
attractors and here's how you do it you
take the that will depend of course on
the control points because I always want
to get the same curve independent of
what I start with so I'm gonna write
down these two transformations so here's
one transformation here's the second one
and the game is okay so you have the
elves and the R as those of the matrices
P's of the matrix of control points
the inverse of that and I have two
transformations now you might worry
about the inverse but we'll come back to
that in a minute now if you apply if you
multiply say the left matrix by P and
you run through it the P and P inverse
cancel and what you get is L applied to
P which you know is Q that's how we
started that's we defined L to be the
thing that if you multiply by P you get
Q the same thing with our so if you
multiply P by our you're gonna get har
and now you iterate this and you're
gonna do exactly sub division which
means you're gonna converge to the curve
but remember that with these kind of
transformations if they're contractive
it doesn't matter what you start with so
the control points are already built in
the peas and the P the the matrix of
control points is built in to L P and R
P so it doesn't matter what you start
with you know if you start with control
points you'll converge to the curve and
usually start with anything because it's
fractal like you'll conventionally curve
same thing the only problem is of course
P is not an invertible matrix because P
is you know the control points consist
of say points in the plane so you have
an X into y so the columns it's maybe
two columns but you can have lots of
control points so it's sort of an N by 2
matrix so maybe I cheated by saying I
could invert P but there are ways around
that so if P has three control points so
I'll just add a column of ones so if you
know graphics is just homogeneous
coordinates if you have four control
points you add two new columns five
control points you have three new
columns the thing you can show is that
when I add coms these matrices are
always invertible
as long as say three of the points are
not collinear so now you have invertible
matrices and you can run your algorithm
so now you're running your algorithm in
higher dimension alright because I've
added coordinates in the control points
that doesn't really matter you run your
algorithm the higher dimension and then
when you want to look at the curve you
just project down to two dimensions
because the algorithm works on each
coordinate independently and that's what
you're looking at so you're looking at
the projection of a higher dimensional
fractal that's what I showed you that's
one way to do it the other way is
there's actually only one Bezier curve
it's a Bezier curve in high dimension
school
the normal curve and it's the curve with
these control points so each control
point has has a 1 in one position a zero
everywhere else and when you multiply
those control points by the Bernstein
polynomials you get this curve so this
curve has one of these basis functions
in each coordinate it's called the
normal curve and an arbitrary bezier
curve just takes this normal curve and
multiplies it by the control points you
multiply this B of T this is this curve
by the transpose of the control points
and what you get is exactly formally the
Bezier curve so we're going to do is
subdivide the normal curve using our
left and right subdivision matrices now
we have the right dimension and then
we'll project when we want to see the
ordinary Bezier curve that's what we do
so these two matrices which I showed you
give me subdivision that's my those are
the transformations I apply to the
normal curve in this high dimensional
space and what I want to look at the bed
ordinary Bezier curve I project to two
dimensions by multiplying by the control
points and again you can see that that's
the fractal nature of the curve okay
so what I've shown you so far is that
bezzie occurs in some sense behave like
fractals as they're self-similar I have
these transformations I iterate them and
will converge to the bezier curve and
these are attractors independent of what
I start with but that's kind of
interesting but I think it's more
interesting to show you that fractals
that's that I've shown you the fractal
nature of splines I wanted to show you
the spline nature of fractals that is I
want to show you that fractals really
have control points I mean the point
about Bezier curves is you can
manipulate them you can change their
shape in a natural way by moving these
control points around and they have nice
parameterization so you can run through
the curve point by point and if fractals
are this if splines and fractals are the
same thing that not only should splines
have a fractal nature but fractals
should have a spline nature and that's
the last thing I want to show you today
so fractals with control points how does
that work so this all started cuz my
wife gave me a book for my birthday on
complex numbers she knows what I like to
read it was a history of complex numbers
starting from middle ages and sort of
winding up in nineteen
century because too much going on now
and it's very interesting I decided well
you know maybe should be able to apply
complex numbers to I don't to graphics
or something might be interesting to do
that so okay so let's go to the complex
numbers and see what we can do so let's
go back to Bezier curves so the Bezier
curve is just the function say from the
real numbers or some subset of the real
numbers into the plain we'll just look
at planar Bezier curves so you have an X
component Y component they're both
polynomials I've written it down here
and now so the control plane has an X
component and of course a point in the
plane I can represent by a complex
number nothing new here really just
representing the points by complex
numbers fine and I still have you know
the algorithms I had before but you know
let's get more complex this you know if
you have an identity that works for the
reals a polynomial identity is true for
reals I real identity that's true for
every real it's also going to be true
for every complex number it's an
appalling identity if it's true for
enough points you know one more than the
degree or something that's true for
everything real or complex so I'll just
use that idea you know that if it worked
for the reals it's going to work for the
complexes so I'm gonna extend Bezier
curves instead of having functions from
some subset of the reals into the
complex numbers into the plane let's
have let's see what I get so I'll
rewrite my Bernstein polynomials with a
complex variable so instead of T being
real Z is complex right and here's my
formula for quote Bezier curves these
complex points now double use those are
also complex let's try it out okay and
now well I don't know what the subject
is but we could try our subdivision
algorithm and see what happens to it so
let's do that so what happens if we
subdivide a Bezier curve not a real
number like a half or two thirds or
something but not a complex number so
1/2 plus 1/2 I what's gonna happen I
don't know it try it out it will
converge what does the limit curve look
like is it related at all
complex bezier Bernstein thing I defined
on the previous page how is that related
to it that's what I want to look at so
here's my ID casio evaluation algorithm
again here's my subdivision algorithm
our was real before well what if our was
complex just around the algorithm right
so you gonna get the cues and get to get
the RS I mean you can run this algorithm
it computes something let's just see
what happens so here's a straight line
it's a Bezier curve if we subdivide it
you still divided into two straight
lines and then to four straight lines
and you can continue and get lots of
straight lines no the point is that a
straight line is like a fractal itself
similar I can divide it up into equal
parts that's not a big surprise but now
let's add a complex component to our
subdivision parameter so I'm going to
increase my complex component here and
suddenly something emerges off of the
straight line it looks like that if you
don't recognize that I'll just run a
little more subdivision on it and it's a
curve we've seen before it's the C curve
it's a fractal all I've done is I
subdivide not at a half but a half plus
a half I have these control points these
control points you know just my my
fractal at least the position now that I
could have more control points let's
start with that three control points
after all the C curve you replace a line
by two lines so let's start with that we
can do so if we do substitution and
reals we get this parabola if now if I
introduce this complex component again
you see that I do some more submission
okay got a version of the C curve but if
you look at this C curve this side here
is curved it's curved if you look at the
original C curve it's straight it's flat
right so we've introduced some curviness
into the C curve and that's what these
control points do alright I can move
these control points around change the
position and shape of the curve but it's
always gonna be some warping of the C
curve
good there it is now we can do this
pretty much raining the fractals I
showed you before let's see what's this
one no again if I do straight lines
nothing too interesting but if I give
introduce a complex component on this
one so what's happening here is I'm
drawing a Concord so here
remember the cough curve we had for
transformations so instead of relying a
Bezier curve into two pieces I'm gonna
split it into four so split into two is
splitting into two again and iterate
that and if you do that you can generate
the card here it is move it around but
again it's more exciting if you put more
control points in so this might be more
natural control points for the cough
curve if I don't have a complex
component and I do subdivision then I
just get you know some polynomial curve
but now if I introduce a complex
component you can see that cough curve
just popping out and now I can
manipulate the control points and just
like with a spline a Bezier curve you
know it follows the shape so I have a
way of controlling the shape and the
same way I controlled polynomials I can
control these these fractals here's the
sierpinski gasket with two control
points but more exciting you know I
could have more control points and
remember I showed you this warps of
Prince key Gaskin that's how I got it
this is a Bezier curve three control
points subdivision in the complex domain
I can pull out on these control points
and it'll change the shape in some way
okay and finally that hangmen fractal
here's two control points but here's the
with more control points and worked so
let me say a word about how this works
and why this works well here is our
here's what happening with our algorithm
so when we do when R is real when I
subdivided a real parameter I'm just
going to look at at the straight line
now just the two points so I'm gonna
generate a point on the line so the
point I generate is that yeah let's just
do the subdivision algorithm for two
points so here's the Q that I generate
when mice are and are here it is and you
see that's just this point and that
points on the line joining p0 and p1 a
distance R along that line but if I
introduce a complex component so now
instead of subdividing in a real point R
I subdivided a complex point written in
polar coordinates ar e to the I theta
what does this do when I write it out I
get this so I have my initial control
point w0 and now I have this times this
vector that's the vector joining w0 and
w1 I scale it by our just as before but
now I multiply by e to the I theta
multiplication by e to the I theta is a
rotation it's rotation by theta degrees
in the complex plane so I'm rotating off
of the line the picture is here so
here's the real picture when I have two
points I generate a point along the wine
but here's the complex picture I start
with these two points in the complex
plane and I'm gonna rotate off the line
by this by this by this angle that's
what he said with the C curve you know
when when I had two points and I
subdivided with the reals
I stayed on the line but as soon as I
introduced a complex parameter I came
off the line and I got some interesting
fractals so theorems they're actually
theorems here it says every fraktur you
can generate by these transformations
like the sierpinski gasket or collar
Bernie the Train any any fractal I can
generate in that format using only
translations rotations in the uniform
scaling so I restrict my transformation
just to that composites of those I can
generate with subdivision with bezzie a
subdivision using complex parameters and
there's an algorithm for doing that that
is if you give me the matrices that are
generating your fractal I can tell you
what what complex numbers to subdivide
that it's automatic so you don't have to
think about it just write down the South
the Congress is forced by the way you
get new fractals this way but of course
we saw we can warp the sierpinski gasket
into something that doesn't have
straight lines as edges so as long as we
have degree bigger than one we're gonna
get new
and not only that but the new things are
interesting and related to the old
things so they're conformal so let me
show you what that means so go back to
our pictures if you look at the original
fractal I had here before I warped it
the lines are all perpendicular to each
other you look at you sleep
perpendicular lines until they are the
new one they're still perpendicular to
each other okay things are curving now
but all the lines are still
perpendicular to each other so the
transformations are conformal in the
sense that they don't change angles
they'll change shape but they'll change
size maybe they won't change angles so
all these transformations are conformal
why do they converge well in the real
case my subdivision convergent parameter
are my substitution parameter was
between zero and one and that was just
because I needed to be somewhere on this
line between p0 and p1 so this portion
of line had be a scaled-down version of
the whole line and so did this portion
for a complex parameter again I have two
conditions the scaling scaling part of
epi theta has to be between 0 and 1 and
also have to satisfy this constraint and
what that constraint says is that both
of these lines this one and this one
have to be smaller than the original
line so it's contractive transformation
once I have that I'm going to get
convergence they're questions so the
question is I'm not allowing inversions
when I do this and the answer is in this
talk I'm not because in this talk I'm
talking about polynomial curves but if I
talked about rational Bezier curves then
I could allow inversion so all this can
be generalized to the rational setting
and I can get things like 1 over Z and
then I could get inversions I didn't do
that for this talk but it's clear that
you could do that so yeah you can get
you can get inversions as well that okay
that's right
ok other questions I haven't been
looking up so maybe you've accumulated
questions while I was looking down at my
notes
okay good all right so we have
convergence and what do we converge to
well remember that that complex does the
a function I wrote down what we're
converging to is well Z of T is what you
get if you have only two control points
so back here so for this curve here Z of
T that's what you get if you subdivide
and have only two control points if some
parameters and now what you converge to
what is this that's that's the image of
T so that says well it's take your your
Bezier curve you're busy a function in
the complex domain evaluated your
Bernstein functions at Z of T that's a
curve and the new curve you'll get will
be a warping of that and since these are
polynomials that's why you get conformal
transformations you you have conformal
transformations of the complex plane
polynomials are known to be conformal
okay I said I'll give you a
parameterization for fractals as well so
here's the parameterization I'm gonna do
subdivision and show you how to
parameterize any curve when I do
subdivision whether the subdivision is
real complex you start with a control
polygon that's what P is you're gonna
subdivide it into two pieces I don't
care if you subdivide it real numbers or
complex numbers you subdivide into two
pieces so called one of the pieces p0
and one of them p1 and now you're an
iterate so p0 will divide subdivide into
two pieces and p1 will subdivide into
two pieces and you keep iterating so
when I go left I'll put a 0 and when I
go right I'll put a 1 now you can think
of these indices as as binary numbers
binary fractions put a decimal point in
front of them so for example this is
what 1/2 this is 3/4 this is 1/4 so you
think of all these indices now as binary
numbers between 0 &amp;amp; 1
now if you start here and you take a
path through the these control polygons
what's happening these control polygon
is shrinking down they're getting
smaller and smaller they're converging
to a point on the curve to what point on
the curve are they converging well if
you are doing real numbers what they
would converge to is the point on the
curve at this parameter B what is B it's
the limit of these indices so as you go
down here you look at the indices
right on the on the peas you get some
binary numbers and these are converging
and they're converging to some binary
number and these control polygons were
they converging - they're converging to
the point on the curve at the parameter
value with this binary number and that's
true whether you subdivided at real
numbers of complex numbers so that's the
parametrization you want to know the
parameter of some point on the curve run
through your control polygons right
there converging to a point on the curve
and the parameter is exactly the limit
of the indices of the control polygons
that's your parameterization so fractals
have parameterizations oh I talked I
didn't say anything about I just talked
about polynomials but for those of you
who are fans of B splines I'll just tell
you what the theorems are that basically
the same theorems work for piecewise
polynomials that work for polynomials if
you know about B splines and not
insertion everything I said for
polynomials goes over to B splines
piecewise polynomials and you replace
subdivision by not insertion I'm not
going to go to the details of that if
you know it fine if you don't well you
know it for polynomials okay so I'm not
gonna go through details of those
theorems okay so finally just to end
this in the agony what did I tell you
the main insight here was that every
polynomial algorithm or identity for the
real numbers is going to extend the
complex numbers that's really the main
insight here I think and so what I
showed you is that I can apply
subdivision algorithms not only for real
numbers for Bezier curves but also for
complex numbers I why not all right
everything that works for the reals
works for the complexes and when I do
this I can do not insertion the same way
do it over the complex numbers and when
I do this I can show you that for
reasonable restrictions on these complex
parameters the algorithm will converge
and I can show you how to converge to
it's going to converge to some nice
fractal and I can predict to predict
what that fractal is so I can tell you
when it'll converge on I can tell you
when I'll get something smooth or
etiquettes it's something fractal so the
conclusion is well the original thing I
showed you is that splines a fractal
nature that is there self-similar you
can generate them as attractors which
are self-similar and what I think was
more interesting is that
actors are splines that is that
parameterization is just like
polynomials do and I have control points
just like polynomials do so you can
manipulate them just the way you
manipulate polynomial change their shape
moving them around in a natural way with
the control structure finally what comes
in the future well this is fun
but is it useful I don't know
it certainly doesn't have anything to
what I usually do which is geometric
modeling and so if I wanted to use these
to make cars or tables or chairs it's a
little fractal chair it's got a lot
holes in it but not quite fractal but
you know I don't know what it's good for
so maybe I need to think more about you
know what this is actually good for one
idea occurred to me is that you know I
can generate you have the Bernstein
basis functions were used for generating
polynomials for Bezier curves and the
night one of the nice properties is they
sum to one and that's actually important
for the scheme to be independent of the
coordinate system so that's called
affine invariance it doesn't matter what
the coordinate system is I'm gonna
control points they'll do that you have
to have schemes with a funding function
sum to one now those funny functions are
polynomial but sometimes you might want
to use trigonometric blending functions
but it's hard to get those things to sum
to one on the other hand we have a
formula des da the principal way
something man whether you evaluate them
in a real point or a complex point so
what if you evaluate them at e to the I
theta well there's still some to one but
you know when you substitute e to the I
theta you get nice trigonometric
functions so maybe you could apply these
trigonometric functions get affine
invariance schemes now based not on
polynomials but on trigonometric
functions I play with that a little
where we'll we'll see where this goes
I'm not sure other things you can do you
could study instead of restricting
yourself to the complex domain you could
look at things in the quaternion domain
well we really needed here was some kind
of multiplication so quaternions are
nice because you represent rotations in
three dimensions but you want curves
that represent rotations in three
dimensions so we can do quaternion
curves this way what about surfaces the
problem with the scheme I show you today
is work
for the complex numbers so it's gonna
work for curves in the plane what about
surfaces in 3-space so I don't have the
complex numbers to to guide me but turns
out you can still do much the same
tricks work in progress and finally what
about other kinds of fractals like
Mandelbrot sets and Julia sets can I
have control points for them well in
some sense I can do things like
inversion or translation rotation things
like that I can buy these two
Mandelbrot's and Julia sets and again
this is work in progress so you know
maybe someday we'll also have control
points for the Mandelbrot set and Julia
sets we'll see so those are the kinds of
things I'm looking at right now it's
entertainment whether it actually be you
know useful in practice to build things
who knows but it's fun so thanks for
your attention I'll be happy to take
questions your turn yeah
ah no the point is not in situ the point
is in Si the question is when I
introduce complex parameters and complex
control points and I used my bezzie a
scheme in the complex setting then I'm
actually having points not in C but in C
2 but in fact that's not right the
points are actually in C you see if I
can go back to the formula yeah I mean
if you look at this formula here where's
everything wind up in Z is a complex
number W is a complex number I'm
multiplying I'm getting a complex number
just one complex number for each Z I get
a complex number not in c2 but and C so
this is all going on and C not in c2
it's a map from C to C I mean what are
you really think what I'm really doing
here is I'm taking these Bezier curves
or these fractals or however you want to
think about them and I'm warping them
I'm just mapping from C to C it's a warp
of C so I'm taking things that are sort
of flat and C and I'm warping them
everything is going on and C naught in
secrecy okay it's it's much simpler than
you're thinking about it just you have
to think even simpler right it's really
just very simple just very very simple
okay
simplify simplify
okay other questions
okay another question here in sp oh
hello
okay yeah so I was just wondering if
this buys you something above in Vienna
like does this make something possible
that you couldn't get by just generating
your fractal and then running it through
a conformal warp
yeah well that's a good question
so I'm a getting something that I
couldn't get by generating a fractal in
the old way by using some inner age
function system and then warping it by
applying some polynomial scheme applying
some transformation because the answer
is no but I think it's simpler to do it
this way and it does buy me control
points and the other way yeah I could
take some fractal and apply some
transformation to it and warp it but
here I have some what I think are rather
natural composure control points in the
same way that Bezier curves have natural
control points and that I wouldn't get
if I just applied some arbitrary no
conformal transformation so I think I do
get something for this namely these
control points thank you okay good
question anything else from the audience
are from God above never know who's
listening good okay so I think that's it
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
