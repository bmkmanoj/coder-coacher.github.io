to take thank the organizers for
allowing me the opportunity to speak
here and so this is a work in progress
actually and nothing on the archive yet
it's about basically similar in one in
some ways to what Steven Jordan was just
talking about which is if whether or not
you can classically model tunneling but
not via I guess simulated simulating the
quantum process per se but I guess
simpler algorithms and this is joint
work we tell me may all bosch my
colleague at USC and also Peter young at
UC Santa Cruz so what is the motivation
for this topic so the motivation is
actually that right now we don't have
any quantum annealing speedups ever
unfortunately and there are no examples
if you look at quantum annealer as
optimizers as solvers for optimization
problems then we have no proof
whatsoever and that that they work and
let me let me I tell you why I guess
some people might disagree with that so
for example you could come up and say
look where we have you no idea but it
growver quadratic speed up etc and
variants and I will say no that's not
really true because the adiabatic Grover
is an oracular problem and so in a sense
the complexity potentially being swept
under the rug and you know you need to
have an exponential number of terms in
your Hamiltonian and the Oracle you know
doing something exponential so when you
take everything under consideration then
then we can't really say that it's a
true algorithm that provides a quantum
speed-up so you could also come up to me
and say well but we have you know this
polynomial equivalence with a gate model
due to our own overall
then I will say well that might be true
but then it requires non-diagonal
problem Hamiltonians and I think Peter
love talked about it with the clock
States so we basically irrelevant to
optimization problems when you think
about it so then you can say well we had
us all these numerical experiments that
showed you know polynomial I guess
increase with size for certain
subproblems but then when you go to
higher sizes that you always have
crossover to exponential so even these
numerical endeavors have all led to
failures and then you can tell me well
you have all these beautiful experiments
you know with the d-wave device and
whatnot and if you look at them one by
one you realize that none of them really
show conclusive results as to speed up
to put it mildly so no no real basically
a quantum annealing speed up so far and
even the optimistic results that if
we've been hearing about lately about
observed advantages numerical or
experimental and there is a quite long
list about that they are other
non-existent on that or they have been
demonstrated with respect to only poorly
chosen classical competitors and this is
something that has bothered me for quite
some time and and and then you can ask
yourself well and I guess Stephen asked
this same question a few minutes ago is
tunneling is really a resource we know
is we do we know the time we talk about
tunneling we know that quantum annealing
you know tunnels but is it really a
computational resource and I we know
that there is no you know rigorous
mathematical answer to this but but it's
unclear from the evidence so far if it's
you know it's even out there without the
the proof and so I want to focus on this
picture which I gave it the name the
everybody
favorite picture because last year's
like you see that it was on every talk
but I haven't seen it in this year stock
but I I wasn't able to attend all the
talk so maybe it was but I clearly it
hasn't shown up I guess with the same
frequency as last year but anyway this
this picture tells you that you know
quantum annealer tunnel through barriers
and and whereas thermal anneal ears jump
over barriers and and and vinh bandham
actually pointed out a very good point
yesterday about the fact that even for
quantum tunneling the height matters and
so this is one aspect of it but there's
another aspect of jumping over versus
tunneling which is if you consider
tunneling as quantum annealer is
allowing the system to be in classically
forbidden States then maybe thermal
inators like real thermal anneal errs do
not allow this or I guess unless you
have temperature then classical solvers
if you look at an algorithm then they
they can allow this I mean classical
solvers in the digital computer will
allow you in a sense to tunnel with they
will allow you to being classically
forbidden quote-unquote States and so
you ask yourself so what are they is
tunneling a true resource what are the
true resources and again I I thank
Stephen Jordan for reminding us that you
know we know that interference is a
resource we know that entanglement is a
resource or at least it's some people
think that discord is a resource etc and
clearly we have massive parallelism and
but but nothing that we know of that
says the tunneling is a resource so if
those things interference and
entanglement come into play in quantum
annealing then of course we need to
study this but tunneling per se I am no
longer sure about even though it's the
you know the buzz word around
quantum annealing and so in that sense I
want to say something really quickly but
in a way they aggressive but but it to
me was interesting to find out which is
if you go to density functional theory
that talks about electronic structures
and you know in electrons in metal etc
it has nothing to do with quantum
annealing and you think about the basic
theorems of DFT he tells you that if you
consider electrons running in a
potential of ions or atoms it tells you
that no two potentials lead to the same
electronic ground state and also no two
ground States lead to the same charge
density and it tells you sort of that
the potential says what the charge
density is the judge NCD tells you
everything about the potential and it
basically the charge density of an
electronic wave function tells you
everything that you need to know about
everything the entire spectrum of the
Hamiltonian and you can apply DFT to
adiabatic quantum computing and if you
consider adiabatic quantum computing
going over the ground stages tracking
the instantaneous ground state then you
can say ok the potential is sort of the
problem Hamiltonian and you can figure
out that no two problem hamiltonians
lead to the same ground state and also
that no two ground state lead to the
same probability distribution in in the
computational basis in the basis of the
potential so it still basically means
that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the problem
Hamiltonian and the probability
distribution so in a sense this is like
a hand wavy argument that sort of says
that it's it's a game of probabilities
rather than of wave function amplitudes
and we know from quantum mechanics that
if it's a game of probabilities and not
you know interference of the the
amplitudes then then maybe there's
something missing there but I know this
is sort of hand wavy but this is sort of
some
thing interesting about ground state
computation so then you can ask you know
can you classically model tunneling and
and Steven showed you know quantum Monte
Carlo or quantum inspired algorithms
that show in sam says tunneling and and
i will do the same but with much i guess
simpler well i guess with in terms of
success they are not as successful as
what we've seen so far but much simpler
algorithms that sort of in a way show
you tunneling and i will explain in a
minute what I I mean by that so i can
ask myself well is there a classical
stochastic process if it's a game of
probabilities is there a classical
stochastic process that sort of
generates the same probability
distributions that quantum annealing
generates along the evolution and i say
that the DFT argument in a way tells us
that yes you can under some conditions
actually generate the probabilities that
quantum annealing generates and it means
that and i'm not talking about the
complexity of of how it can be done but
but at least if it's a game of probably
probability then there is a nonlinear
stochastic type thing that that you can
run and it gives you the quantum
annealing evolution even though it's a
one it's a classical algorithm and to
simplify matters i want to consider just
simulated annealing process so not i'm
not simulating quantum mechanics or
quantum evolution or quantum Monte Carlo
none of that I'm just saying let us
consider so normally people consider
simulated annealing and you flip one bit
and you something happens you flip
another bit and then you go down in
energy and if you have temperature you
jump over barriers let's let's consider
a simulated annealing process where you
are allowed to flip I spins and not just
one and you decide whether how many
spins to flip with basically with
probability of 1 over I won over the
number of spins that you are to flip so
flipping one spin is is more probable
than flipping two screens etc and then
you flip I spins and then you accept the
the flip with the metropolis probability
so this is one type of algorithm you can
think of and now you can sort of compare
a quantum annealing and standard
simulated annealing and also this clever
and it's of course I'm reluctant to call
it a clever it is a different simulated
annealing algorithm but i will show you
in a minute why i want to call it a
clever algorithm that allows you
multi-bit flips and then you can
consider even a clever clever squared
simulated annealing where you're allowed
I bit flips to flip in every move and
then follow it by some stupid descent
move this is due to Ted Tamim Albus it's
a nice algorithm but anyway you can sort
of try these algorithms and track the
sort of the distance the solution of
configurations of these algorithms and
what they do as they approach the
simulation and as they approach the
solution of the of the problem and we
looked at several different problems
despite problem and the what we like to
call the Brady Van Dam problems that
we've and um talked about yesterday i
think it was and also another problem
which we call Van Dam mosca was irani
from yes 15 years ago which I'll explain
what it is I don't have much time but
let me this is for example the spike
problem where we have this is the ground
state and the spike and if you look for
example at a quantum annealer so
at first you see that you know if you
look at all the configurations of the
classical the computational basis
probabilities that at first they are
binomial II centered around and over to
distance from the solution and when you
run this simulation then what happens
you see the blob of probabilities
tunneled through the spike and reach the
solution and it's very nice and if you
do the same thing with simulated
annealing one bit flip simulated
annealing well it gets stuck but we knew
that already but look at what happens if
you do a clever a simulated annealing so
you see te tunnels so basically what I'm
trying to say is that quantum annealing
classical algorithms that are more than
one bit flip or there there's properly
constructed can tunnel or at least in
this sense and we have other RM I guess
examples I can go through all of them
but we can look at the Brady Van Dam
potential with alpha equals one-half
eventually tunnels and they simulated
annealing does so but in a poor way and
in a clever simulated annealing many
tunnels beautifully so so in a sense you
see that these class simple very simple
classical algorithms do do tunnel and
this is the van damme moscas irani
problem where you have a ground state
here and a very close by local minimum
but everything points to the local
minimum and when you run a quantum
annealer well it fails it gets stuck
over there and it never appears on the
other side okay i will stop it right
there and when you do simulated
annealing same thing happens but when
you do the clever quote-unquote
simulated annealing so what happens with
tunnels the tunnels and bits in one
fell swoop so in a sense you can do
tunneling you know it's even sort of for
this problem it's better than quantum
annealing and since I don't have much
time I wanted to show you some scaling
results i will just sum them all up so
for some of these problems qi is
polynomial and si is exponential but
clever SI is also polynomial and i'll
forget about the braid even done for now
but for the van damme mosca Vizier any
problem we have an interesting thing
that you a NSA both scale exponentially
and clever simulated annealing scale
tunnels better if you don't mind me
saying that and yes gives us even
polynomial scaling so just to conclude
I'm just saying that it's unclear
whether quantum monitors are
qualitatively advantages too smart
classical algorithms we it's unclear at
least to me the tunneling is a resource
I don't think that at this point we have
reasons to be you know super optimistic
but clearly quantum has pal ilysm
interference and tangle man these are
the resources that probably we should
focus on and I I would like to I guess
join Steven Jordan and others by saying
that maybe the answer lies in this
stochastic versus non stochastic
question so that's it thank you very
much
do we have questions for you tight hi so
I like to say a couple of things one is
you said at the beginning that in the
experiments the alternatives were poorly
chosen yes and I disagree not your
experiment but others oh no I'm just
kidding yeah thought so so maybe you
know I would like to try to explain to
you why which is that computed don't
know no I our algorithm I honestly
didn't target you specifically but there
was but this paper as long as you
brought it up I mean I understand that
so the paper wasn't about speed up in a
way but I also think that it didn't show
tunneling in in a sense and and so of
course there I know that the paper
itself also says mentions other
algorithms that are better than the
quantum thing so so that's what i meant
that if you really look at a suite of
algorithms and not just you know you
build the problem with clusters so you
know that one bit flip simulated
annealing will fail on it and then you
run it with you know d wave and say well
it beats simulated annealing and sort of
i mean i think you know to be fair you
have to do sort of more but if you want
to say T wave is not a one bit flip
simulated an inner then of course that
what it says but but clearly there are
other algorithms that can tunnel so my
point is that you have classical
algorithm I think your paper in a way
says tunneling is a computational
resource is a quantum computational
resource that is how I interpret it
maybe I was wrong but what I'm saying is
that maybe that's true but it's not only
a quantum resource it's also a classical
resource well other than one to Monte
Carlo I think you know there are grams
liking helmets paper they are known to
fail for interaction graphs which are
sufficiently dense you know like the HFS
algorithm sure
or even though I shouldn't get to move
because the percolation person will
become very long as the interaction
graph increases intensity we are
simulated annealing on quantum Monte
Carlo generic they are pretty blind you
know right they reacted energy landscape
but not with interaction but but I think
both of these we do it that way but
anyway my question was if you actually
have try your you know clever simulated
annealing on those problems I I honestly
have not but because I thought you will
fail so that's well I will okay I guess
Tamim can check this in the next 30
minutes there was a brilliant talk I
really loved it I loved the animations
and I was very impressed with clever too
and clever and so I wonder you say
tunneling is not a resource but how
about I'm not saying that I'm asking
that ok so it's i'm not saying how about
fake tunneling like the type of
simulated tunneling that you have in
clever too that's a resource and that
your slopes got better well that's the
thing it's so the question I think the
question is is tunneling a uniquely
quantum resource and I say not
necessarily or at least I have sort of
classical algorithms that in a way
tunnel I don't know you may say well
it's not really tunneling but then what
is I mean to me to be in a classically
forbidden state is tunneling because
that's what I you know when I was second
year graduate student that yeah yeah
yeah it did that's yeah maybe two unique
classical research just a short comment
the problems you consider or humming
victim yes that's true if you think
about sprinklers problems that device
not finding the direction of tunneling
is I quite lately completely completely
agree and this is why every every time I
said clever i said clever and this is
because I don't think it's a really you
know the best clever I'm just saying
that we came up with this and people
think well spike problems quantum
annealing beats email no it doesn't be
simulated annealing if you just consider
two-bit flips and that's what sort of
rubbed me the
wrong way that that simulated annealing
is not a 1-bit cliff simulated annealing
it's it's a family of algorithms and I'm
not saying it's the best just saying
it's better for these problems for
compared to one bit flip that's there's
a long one last question it I am we
actually asked ourselves is the very
same question actually we call it in a
group algorithmic tunneling where you
sort of affect these group moves and we
study that actually quite extensively
and we found for example for sub
problems which I would recommend to
throw in earlier and later and because
his spike problems are nice to do some
analytical work but they are highly
misleading for a typical optimization
problem and I think you already agreed
to this and then we found that for sub
problems for example if you do it
exhaustively you take every five group
of spins and you try whether the flip is
beneficial then maybe not surprisingly
you find you get to lower residual
energies or you get to the ground state
faster if you includes these group moves
but so absolutely you can classically
emulate tunneling but as sasha was
alluding to on a highly connected graph
our argument even though we haven't
shown this conclusively and this may be
a wrong conjecture but I would expect
that on a highly connected graph there
are so many different groups you can
meaningfully form that it would be too
expensive while sort of a physical anila
will just sort of feel which direction
to go I completely agree with you except
for sorry I think in the like last
year's like you see shoved you in your
talk show the pretty picture of like a
parabola with many spikes in it do you
remember one another what I caused a
foggy abode yeah okay okay so all of
those was like one bit flip spikes and
when I saw this I told myself look if
you do just to bit flip simulated
annealing you will pass through it and
actually it's your figure that generated
this algorithm in a way because I don't
think this
Pike's that you go I guess some of you
imagine as the tour de force of quantum
annealing are the right way to go but if
you you know widen up the spikes then
then definitely then definitely there's
more to talk about I certainly agree
with you alright so in the interest of
time let's thank eat I again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
