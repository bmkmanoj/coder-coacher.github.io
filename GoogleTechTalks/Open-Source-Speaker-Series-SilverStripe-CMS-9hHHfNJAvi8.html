is Leslie Hawthorne and I'm a program
manager with Google's open source
programs office and were privileged to
have here with us today to founding
members of the silver stripe content
management system project siggy Magnuson
and his colleagues Sam mini who will be
joining us later for the QA and Ziggy is
going to talk to us today a little bit
about the silver stripe content
management system their participation in
google Summer of Code program as well as
anything else new zealand and new
zealand already is he thank you all
right what I'm going to start this off
by just saying thank you very much to
Leslie and also Chris DiBona who you
know we haven't done a whole lot of
things together but when if there has
been anything that we've done to give it
might be an email might be dinner it's
always very fun and it's always very
productive so thank you for that all
right so I'm going to talk a wee bit as
Lisa mentioned about New Zealand and
some of the software that has come out
of the country I'm also going to talk a
wee bit about I don't know if I Leslie
circulator but they'll talk about some a
lot of a ring stuff what's he going to
mention some of the mistakes that we've
made that you don't need to make but
also some mistakes that you should make
and yes Leslie mentioned we've had a
fantastic run of google summer of code
so i just wanted to share some of our
experiences with that so you're going to
feel for what has been produced and also
again to some of the lessons that we've
learned so new zealand how we've got
four million people and about 100 square
miles so i was just up an oz car last
week and it's quite a similar match
unfortunately i couldn't find anything
to relate it to in terms of California
or San Francisco but hopefully you've
been to oregon so no that's all about
unlike america which supposedly was
settled tens of thousands of years ago
we were found very very recently which
is quite nice because when people find a
country like generally start killing
everything and devastating it so we've
had a really short period of time in
which to destroy our own country so it's
still quite pristine it's quite nice the
European discovery was even more recent
and so from 1630 for us when white
people started to
clamber over the place and it basically
led up to 18 40 in which the treaty
between indigenous people d'marie signed
and basically pass over their authority
to the Queen of England and that's
basically when mass emigration began you
know too well mess to it to a
four-million point the ever-increasing
you think about New Zealand's we
actually have real coffee there I think
you know despite all of these wonderful
attributes of civilization I think
America's still has an order to learn
they're interesting as well we also have
a female Prime Minister and before I go
off and say that you should vote for
Hillary or anything like that I think it
has helped actually I think it's quite
nicely but quite liberal politics and it
does it does does make for quite a nice
place to live as you can imagine given
that we're 10,000 miles away from
everywhere the economy is very reliant
on export and traditionally because we
were founded out of England in terms of
the party high race it basically just
meant that we should fall about goods to
England and that's really supported our
economy now that there's a much more
ferocious world economy we've had to
think about smarter and so things that
had typically been funding us from
England have now been reduced and so
we're now until things like software
movies lot of rings we were in Seattle
last week and we noticed that it was New
Zealand wine for sale things like that
so we actually obviously getting up
there and as you know you know it's a
lovely place of business I expect all of
you to come to New Zealand after this
presentation so some of the things that
New Zealand has gone well it's quite a
short talk so I conveyors basically just
explain you know one example in
different kind of areas so for instance
Jada's than the larger kind of
educational enterprise final area and
has been running for a decade or more I
guess more in the kind of
entrepreneurial side of it would be a
guy called rod drury made a lot of money
with after males so after Enron I
believe does legislation that meant that
all emails had to be saved and preserved
so you can just delete them
and kind of arrays you know your history
and so after mailstore of your email so
that when it was a discovery process and
the courts they could go through all the
emails and find you to be you know
guilty of some crime stuff like that so
he meant a lot of money after the hole
in one thing and that then when turn 20
so he's now doing a start-up where he is
producing a software-as-a-service
application for small businesses to run
their accounting so it's desam pretty
cool stuff on a completely different
tangent there's an academic called Peter
Goodman and he's been working in the PGP
world he's been essentially helping
refugees escape the countries and water
on conflicts is quite neat really he's
been able basically to save people's
lives because people are saying well I
need a little one day viewpoint the army
is going to kill me kind of thing where
should we meet and obviously you don't
want anyone to sit there so PGP has been
used there so that's quite cool he also
wrote the longest suicide note in
history well not so he he described
Microsoft CRM as the longest suicide
note on history so if you google that
phrase will come up with a very long
article that was on slashdot probably
about six months ago so that was quite
cool i denti gained enough of completely
area is planet secure they share our
office back in wellington in new zealand
and that's another software as a service
application that's very quickly making
progress and that's for small startups
to be able to share information of the
staff the directors the VCS the
investors and so on about what the
company is doing and so on because often
with business plan to sign will get
created and then just kind of thrown
away and no one knew what was going on
so it's sort of like a base camp for
some of your own business you know that
kind of idea and again is a company and
one it's been called catalyst and that's
probably along with us one of the major
open-source organizations in new zealand
and they really contribute to large open
source projects like moodle which is a
learning system and perl and Mahara
which is interesting as a one that's
actually been created in new zealand
rather than say moodle and pearl which
basically new zealand examples of us
contributing allowed to wider more
global projects
so my often last you know what is a
really nice example of how open sources
used in New Zealand so quite proud to
say that the democratic process is
actually run an open source so pearl
says Mason in terms of the front end and
a programming language it's a web-based
thing basically ties in with postgres
and so all of the people who are
eligible to vote in new zealand that's
all stored in the system and so that
this is really really cool and in in
terms of devoting there are lots of
elements open source software used here
as well so that's really really nice and
then finally there's also another couple
of people know about and lets us and so
silverstripe that's our company with 18
people and we make our money from
building websites you've done that since
2000 but we spend about twenty percent
of our time actually on the open-source
off room and I guess just to give you a
little bit of context I will just spend
you know just once but a couple slides
on what the product that is before
launching into I guess more general
information it will help you so of my
children only one of them is a web-based
open source product and it's still the
strap as you can see it's got you know
quite a variation and tombs ID actual
design that it can do and it's got out
of a box seeing it so it's kind of 38
second overview is the fact that it's
bigger than a blog that does more than
something that Nick know like WordPress
might do but it still retains some of
the things like being on to just get it
up and going you don't have to construct
the system itself at the same time you
don't have to sort of betch around for
so long you know as you might work
larger and more heavyweight open source
and close those programs to kind of get
it going so it's a little bit like you
know one of the guys that as Khan was
talking about how a lot of projects
ended up kind of being like a big small
car truck and we kind of see that you
know a lot of the pawns of a CMU space
islet that just trying to do too much
and so we're trying to focus on us this
in-between space where people live just
haven't really focused on and done very
well another big differentiator and this
is
I'm going to tie into about how do you
run an open source project is that we
have focused on the usability for the
site manager you know a lot of other
systems out there tied too much the
development person and a slight content
manager together and so you had an
interface that wasn't really good for
either and as I mentioned yeah it's a
system that both worked out on a box but
it's really easy to customize all right
so that gives you a little bit of
context for the rest of my chap so now I
can move on to destroying the ring so I
did promise to talk about some of the
little rings things and essentially all
of New Zealand participated little rings
if you weren't riding a horse in front
of the camera you were at least feeding
the horse or making a costume for the
horse or something like that pretty much
everyone was either directly involves or
had a friend who was or something like
that it was pretty cool they had a very
strict policy that you were not allowed
to make cameras on to the set so what I
did was just run home before to make up
on me and just take a photo of me at
home so that seemed to work all right um
so yeah so I mean essentially Sam and I
who have both actually extras on the
Lord of the Rings starred in this whole
sequence twice one making billions of
dollars and in secondly with our own
product I mean because one of the major
themes all of Lord of the Rings was this
whole notion that if you have too much
power then basically human race doesn't
know exactly how to deal with it you
know the greed kind of overwhelms you
and you really just you know you just
you just abuse it really right and so it
was interesting when they're asked on
there was this nice debate between
Oracle in alfresco who you'll know you
know Oracle's due to open source stuff
there they were basically talking about
you know one being very controlling
making a lot of money and one being far
more open and and you know providing a
lot more Liberty and yeah so we
destroyed the ring we we decided that we
didn't want to have you know all of this
greed and power and so on that was it
was just going to kill us we actually
just wanted to destroy the ring
and the open source so I was just going
to explain you know especially from a
new zealand perspective because some of
these things seems a lot different than
what was being mentioned that i was gone
as to why we would open source our
product so one of the key things about
being a new zealand's do very far away
from anywhere and it's quite hard to get
the rest of the world to learn about you
but it's also incredibly crucial because
you quickly saturate the market place
right it's it's the same size as an
American city so you know one of the key
things that we established about a year
ago it was the fact that well we needed
to advertise and get a whole lot of
people on board that was what we wanted
to do so if we actually advertise I
guess with the product itself rather
than trying to bash even over the head
with a baseball bat in terms of some
promotions and billboards then that's
going to be really really positive it's
going to be a lot cheaper people are
actually going to like what we've
produced innately rather than just enjoy
our marketing campaign and yeah so it
just really made sense that I guess as a
channel to market that we should open
source the whole product another part to
it is that you know the whole tool set
that we created was the result of our
everyday work we didn't go off and
decide to come up with some imaginary
problem and in trying to solve it in
market that we've produced a couple
hundred websites and every time we build
a site we would kind of stubble toe on
some problem would be kind of too
complex to make a design in this way or
too much time to create a database in
this way or something like that and so
over time we made a toolkit and so I
guess you know what we had a few years
ago was not worlds apart from what we
have today and you know so in back in
2004 Tim the CEO of civil strife and
myself we went around knocking on doors
ok I've built this beautiful toolkit
with my 100 sites in it you should buy
an office and the feedback was very very
positive as we've got very excited and
come home from you know from where it
can be very excited at all this positive
buzz people wanted to use a product they
wanted to learn all about it but they
basically didn't want to give us any
money for it
that caused us a problem and it really
confused us because people would be
saying looking us in the eyes and saying
that they love the product but they
wouldn't give you all about it now it
just completely contradicting themselves
and so the problem was not so much the
product samples and the spark that was
what was around them and specifically
for silverstripe it was the problem
about the licensing structure and the
cost so the cost you know if you're
making websites or web developers we've
developers are generally very shrewd
they don't want a part of a lot of money
they used to a whole lot of free tools
being available so they didn't see the
reason to spend money on at all even if
it was a lot better than the free ones
out there secondly they also we use to
the freedom there are open source
provides in terms of things like PHP and
HTML and JavaScript you can always just
look at what everyone else has built in
terms of the sites you can rip it apart
you can just have a field day and so for
us to try and make money offers and kind
of lock it down and also just didn't
work with them another aspect of you
know why we decided to kind of destroyed
us this whole grain was you know we were
indeed so i've been using open source
software since i buy more than 10 years
ago I tried to keep quite pointing on my
4x6 so I could track people and everyone
else had pentium so it was fine for them
but I my Microsoft box just didn't
didn't play well so and trying to get
quite running on my machine idea for had
to learn anything about linux I already
knew how to do some programming and
already loves you internet and stuff
like that so I now had you know
experience and internet and and Linux
and you know so it's all just kind of
gel together it just naturally was a
really nice a key set of tools for us to
found the company and to put our
experience than to and after several
years of using all of this software we
really felt that we were just you know
taking all of this food away from the
suit picture and they're not kind of
giving anything back to community so
silverstripe was a nice way of giving
back another aspect of it was this whole
notion of Ireland so I went on this it's
quite cool road trip with my dad and
their knows way too much about violent
so one of the interesting things was as
wonderful analogy that we formulated
between violin making and open source
software and basically up to about
eighteen hundreds all the violins being
created we're doing were basically
created out of a guild kind of system so
and have a master and a princess BB
working very collaboratively but the
same time competing for commissions
right after the 1800s there was
ferocious you know it became very very
popular and so there was a very very
strong desires for the companies and so
on to produce these and it has
commoditized and so the quality vent
really we're down because they were
competing completely rather than
collaborating and so if you ask a lot of
the you know major violin itself today
now most of them are trying to still get
instruments pre 1800 it's only more
recently that people have been beginning
to collaborate again after realizing
that the commoditization on the violin
destroyed it so yeah it's a nice
reminder to us in a softer world if we
go for 150 years just competing too much
will basically have this kind of nuclear
cold winds real software so I've already
talked a bit about the freedom so some
of the surprises well we didn't buy Liv
Tyler and all of this but we did get
some very satisfied staff I think that
was one of the really nice things I mean
you'll appreciate this a google as well
you know when we were just making
websites for people it was difficult for
the junior staff for most staff to
really get lots of nice little bits of
praise now that we're open source people
can just make patches that's very clear
what people are doing and for instance
we've got a guy who's soldiers in as
University he spread most of the
tutorials for silver stripe and everyone
that has downloaded Silver's fight goes
through his tutorials and so he gets
lots of praise and so that's a really
really nice situation to be in as I
mentioned you know just not a lot of
open source stuff going on in New
Zealand and so it was quite novel and so
we've got a lot of TV radio newspaper
advertising basically you know promotion
and so that tight greatly until our a
whole desire for open source to work
with us and actually promote the company
and yeah I mean we've been invited to
ask Karl and here today you know
it's been really really cool all right
so i'll talk a wee bit about some of the
things that we've learned in terms of
managing people on an open source
project firstly one of the things i
seriously recommend to everyone that's
involved an open source is this Bible
speical vola understand it actually
Leslie was parading him around here just
quite recently but I basically read his
book online which was producing OSS com
in about 24 hours it was fantastic there
was nothing I disagreed with it was all
just beautiful so I hope that he
continues to keep it updated you know as
years go by it's it's really really
great okay so one of the big challenges
we had was that we didn't have a
definitive roadmap right a lot of open
source projects are like this you have
some ideas and desires if a big to-do
list but you don't have you know kind of
course a one quarter to quarter 3
roadmap explaining intimately what's
going to be done each time so one of the
things that we would found worked really
really well was basically just
publishing some guiding principles so
what I mean by that is there were things
that we already felt were very true but
we just hadn't for whatever reason
articulated them and as the other
developers and contributors found out
these things that worked very well so
for instance someone a google Summer of
Code students started introducing fairly
technical fields and ideas into the CMS
in terms of the interface and so I put a
place to now for and saying okay well
one of the big things we wanted to do
with this emius let's make it very
simple for a communications and
marketing person not a developer to use
a CMS and so some of these sorts of
guiding principles very useful to
publish their in lieu of a roadmap and
so they should be the differentiators of
your project they should be basically
two reasons that your product is in
existence right as why as white as your
point different why is it solving a
business paying you and so you don't
need to be incredibly detailed and spell
every tile it will detail out for
you know people contributing on the
project if you kind of give them these
major kind of guidelines as to where to
be and a point you know like these
things should exist already you
shouldn't just go ah ok well what will
these be like you should already have
aspects about your project that are
already the reason that people are
choosing that right so you really just
articulate and stuff that already exists
another big thing as giving recognition
and in general I'm talking about doing
it in public you know if I say to you
hey look you've done a really really
good job just to you personally and
confided in you you know you might smile
and that might be great but if I say to
a whole group of people will put on a
mailing list or something like that that
this person has done a fantastic job
then he realizes that I kind of just
said that to everyone else and then it's
actually quite a real treat then that i
actually do appreciate it and things
like that and so that's a really really
nice reward for contributing and helping
someone along it's also can be used as a
motivator right but you do need to be
specific about what the praise are so
involved and just saying hey look you
know thanks to Hayden you know you
should say specifically kind of what the
work wise and why it was useful and
things like that so people kind of know
what it was what they can replicate and
get more praise or let's say you know
very dear to our heart of google Summer
of Code you might have a bunch of people
who are working fantastically and then
you could have a couple people who just
kind of need to be pushed along and so
if you've got some specific praise and
you're giving recognition to a bunch of
people then the people who are not
really you know contributing as much as
they should be kind of look over there
and go all right well I can see exactly
what these people have done I can see
exactly what they've been praised for I
just needs em like that and then I'm
going to be in that hole tight as well
and I guess just another point there is
you know just just make sure you're
balanced all right it's kind of like
raising kids you know you don't want to
say you know great you've done a good
job everything because in it dilutes it
but at the same time you do need to say
it enough otherwise they just get the
priests that i just leave and they ever
sir
another point and this is this is quite
specific google summer of code as well
it's just how we delegate at work so
this was just a balance between saying
hey let you guys go off and just build
us something cool vs. my kids
micromanagement and coming up with this
really detailed plan and in every day
being to evolve so what worked for us
really well was that I specifically
created a one-page overview of what the
project should be like and I did that in
collaboration with the students so that
I didn't just go here go this is what
you're doing so it was still a a
collective activity but the point is is
that it fitted on a page that's about
the amount of detail that was in this
what sort of a to three-month project
the other s bit there is that because
it's an open source project you can't
rely on one person answering these
questions so that the students are going
to always have lots of questions
especially at the start switch it end
and it's too much to ask of one person
to answer all the data that question so
we tried to throw it out to the
community set up a forum or some kind of
activities so that all of these
questions get funneled to a group of
people who can then respond and so on
and so it might mean that the answer is
not absolutely accurate or you know that
kind of thing straight away but as an
average it's going to work far better
than let's say saying well if all Horace
wants to go to this one person and that
person is busy for a week then you know
what happens you know and as I mentioned
you know like there was just one page
but then if we kind of add some of these
guiding principles such as you know the
product is designed so that the you know
the CMS is only really their full site
manager it's not really there for the
developer you know if you have some of
those kind of bullet points that are
global so the whole project then people
when they're doing their code they kind
of know what the parameters are that
they were trying to work within so yeah
Leslie likes to talk about hurting a lot
so I thought I could have a little
mental hurting slide again one of the
things that we really tried to do is
just take the work often right so like
try and get them to do
you know the smallest amount but the
greatest amount that they can so if
there's someone that just knows a
fantastic amount about databases will
doing great so like if you've got a
database abstraction layer or something
you're trying to create well then these
people should be married together but
try and get you know the very tough
challenging questions to rector that's
mentor and then just everything else try
and spread that out because this person
as mentor is going to be very important
to the organization that they're working
for whatever they can have a very small
amount of time so if they are doing any
mentoring you want to make sure that
they are completely and one hundred
percent the most suitable person for
answering that question and they're just
you know they're not just answering
silly questions like setting up email or
anything like that all that stuff is to
be pushed off them another point about
the mentoring is that you know try and
actually get them to have a lot of fun
right so I tried to make sure that the
mentors we're working on projects that
they were interested in so that when the
project's finished they would go great
well I made this really cool thing and
it's dear to my heart and it also just
meant that it was easy to give praise
because they were interested in it and
dip thought I'd be doing a whole lot of
cool stuff and you know so it just made
this life synergy so it's important not
just to concentrate on students having a
good time but also that mean to us all
right so a little bit about mistakes
so the mistakes and I'm really kind of
talking about relate to the design
process of our application so you know
the biggest thing for us was that we
were building sites we knew of a problem
and we are trying to fix that so we knew
one of the issues were we weren't really
trying to go out on a limb and just
trying to fix issues that didn't exist
you know it all ties back to pull grabs
ya fix problems people have or whatever
letters you know so the other the big
thing for us was that we would spend a
lot of time carefully going well how
should we implement this feature how
should we make it reusable how should we
make it fast or whatever the parameters
were and too soon degree you certainly
do need to think those through but you
also have to expect that after a couple
of years all of these great decisions
you've made in aggregate will still end
you up with a system that is a bit of a
throwaway right just because software
moves so quickly there's always new ways
of doing things and so while day-to-day
always making really really smart
decisions over the course of several
years you will have made a product that
basically has reached the end of its
lifetime and you need to start again but
importantly you have actually
accumulated a wealth of information so
for us back in two thousand five after
five years of making a sort of first
toolkit we had an immense amount of
information so that we would produce a
second version of it and when we also
looked at the other mistakes and issues
and things that were out in the
marketplace we could produce a much much
better system
alright well i thought i would show you
some of the stuff that has gone into
google Summer of Code
alright so the first guy was going to
talk about was lux and pereira he is
from Sri Lanka he's been doing the whole
inner cool stuff of mashups and so at
the start of his project we talked about
making it really nice and easy for
things like Flickr and YouTube and
technorati all those kind of web
services try to get that content playing
around and into the system and so about
half way through the whole project so
well I can show you things that are now
currently working so at the moment you
can easily add a gallery of flickr
photos your site you can download this
code so debt is showing the riley oz
cotton stuff you can do the same thing
for technorati and so in the second half
the project that's more a case of doing
the same thing with youtube and then
just tighten up and boxing it up
together properly so you can download
the source code and have this stuff
playing on at the moment but it's still
a little bit more work to get it to a
one point I kind of status another point
about you know our project is the fact
that we listened very hard to what
people want so one of the bigger
surprises we had something that we
didn't really have on our road map was
internationalisation right but it was
definitely the most concentrated single
request so you know like it wasn't
necessarily the majority of requests but
if we kind of tallied all the pieces
together that would be the biggest lump
and so it was clear to us that we need
to get someone working on this so we've
now got silver straight running and
Spanish there so the
internationalisation stuff is
interesting because one you have to make
it update all the labels and that kind
of stuff but then you also need a system
to manage it so let's say you know like
one of the other projects is going to
add a new feature to rotate images so
let's say that we've translated six
languages but didn't add this extra
feature we now have to go back through
the languages and actually add rotate
image and successful languages so you
need a nice system to be able to handle
there and you want preferably assistant
a technical person isn't utilizing that
someone that just knows these languages
so yeah we've got the google Summer of
Code student working on by for those
we've also got some quite cool stuff
happening with usability we had Elijah
from Alabama we actually meet up with
him and Portland which was really great
because we'd never met any of these
people and you know we've come up some
some quite nice ideas here and I think
you know a lot of these sorts of things
you know I really want to openly share
because I'd like to see some of these
things incorporate into other
applications so one of the things we've
got here is you know drag and drop file
manipulation so by the way silver
stripes all under the bsd license so you
can download this stuff and copy it and
use it you know we want the whole
Webster to be bitter so different do
that and then we've also got the whole
kind of notion that see how it's red
background on the buttons so like if
you're about to do an action that could
potentially be a little dangerous tin
sort of leaving the user note softly and
it's the same kind of way up like you
know if you're getting a a cup of coffee
out of a microwave it's steaming right
so you know that maybe you should sort
of exercise a little bit of caution
about touching the object you're not
going to be kind of prompted to go do
you really want to touch the coffee is
hot you know so try to provide subtle
cues so that you don't add obstacles but
just kind of insight into the actions
I'm sure leaves you like this one this
one's all about google adwords and
sitemaps so this is a guy who we also
met will stop from seattle and so
basically we were just integrating the
system so that you can type a frazen in
to go into silver stripe and it just
integrates very nicely so the page that
you're editing will be featured as a
google adword and just just kind of
simplified the process so that you don't
have to be in one application India
Hawaii and back and forth no try and get
it in the same place we also had an
interesting project web google maps and
so i really wanted to know what the
community of silver stripe look like and
I thought that does would be something
that
it's communities what also like to know
so if you've got a forum you want the
people who are signing up to the forum
to indicate where they are and then you
see a geographical representation of
them fortunately I've actually got the
open ID screenshots showing that there
another approach that we were doing was
all about p do which was silverstripe
work with my sequel but we wanted to get
to work with all our other different
things with different databases slope
post grades like microsoft sequel server
and stuff like that and so Philippe was
working for the last six weeks basically
evaluating all the different database
abstraction frameworks out there that
are available to PHP and so we chose the
PHP data objects and in the second half
of the project he's actually cutting it
up so that's really awesome to see
another part of the system and this
again as you know what you should be
doing I feel you know the bane of
usability with open source projects is
the usability generally right there's
the problem now the whole Linux desktop
has suffered and in manipulating our own
site I found that I was often having to
manipulate a photo outside of the
application I wanted to be a ting crop
within the application and so as part of
streamlining some of the general use
cases on substrate we've got mateus from
Poland to do that and then choose
something you know like one of the great
conversations I had were Mateus was the
fact that you know the four and a half
grand that he got for that actually was
equivalent to a whole year's salary in
Poland you know it was still is very
marvelous
so then we had another American that was
Quinn he was doing on reporting stuff so
we were using a bunch of non flash or
image compositing components to produce
a whole lot of nice graphical reporting
systems and silver strap because
basically we wanted to make it so that
if you had some data in a system you
know you basically a forum in you and
your website and you wanted to know how
much the membership was growing or
something like that you wanted to be
able to just we'll have a couple of
lines of code to actually produce a
graph you just want to test a wall up
here's a here's a single query or here's
some objects or you know something like
that and so that's what Quinn's up to we
also appreciate the fact that Apple has
come out of a new browser as Pasiphae
version 3 because it fixed up a lot of
JavaScript and HTML and CSS problems and
so silver strike was fundamentally we're
now working with Safari 3 as it now does
with a lot of other you know we have
applications that are quite rich and
Ajax and things like that so we've got
Meg here just working through holidays
HTML CSS JavaScript issues that remain
and so at the end of her project at all
now work in IE and firefox and safari
and if we're lucky you perhaps even
opera alright so we've got markers from
italy and he's been working on open ID
and this is something which i'm really
really excited about Ashley because one
of the ponds we had was the fact that we
would be trying to log in and administer
hundreds of websites you know on behalf
of our clients and so if we had
usernames and passwords that we've
manually set up well then sometimes
that'd be different with a new staff
member came on or left they suddenly had
access just to way too much or you know
other sites and so on so with open ID we
can basically say all of you sites
there's a single log on for
administrative access all of those and
if one of our staff members leave then
we can just change the password of our
open I the account and so the existing
staff can now login and celeb exes what
the person is left now
longer does and it can also be applied
to several different layers of exit so
you might have an open ID for
administrative or just normal site
content management so as of now you can
log into the administrating system with
open ID and by the end of the project
you will be able to use open ID to
silence or a forum and stuff like that
using silver stripes so if you have a
silicone powered forum you don't have to
mindlessly type in all of your usernames
and passwords on your date of birth
whatever else that the site owner wants
user pass over you can just say hey I've
got an open ID account just suck all
that information and to an account and
that's really good because I must have
over 100 places where i've typed in and
signed up and register four fingers and
so I'm looking forward over the next 12
months to a world with a lot more sites
are using open ID so I don't have to
keep on providing that information who
hosts what alright so open idea is a
distributed against authentication
system and so basically there are two
things there are providers or I guess
kind of like directories of usernames
and passwords I guess if you want to
think of it like that and then you have
a whole lot of sites or systems that
want you know I guess want permission
from users to gain access and so in this
example here I've got my open ID com so
there are free places where you can just
sign up for an account and then
basically you type in your URL so
another like an email address right like
the front bit says well this is my
username in the last but essentially
kind of sale where should I go off and
authenticate and I guess it could be a
little bit like you know with with
Google you have the Google accounts so I
could say that I've got an ebay store
and so long as you know if I'm logging
into ebay so long as I can kind of get
it to authenticate into the google
account then i'm allowed into ebay it's
the same thing except they're the
provider of the authentication mechanism
is completely open
alright and so those are actually 13
projects that we've been working on some
of the lessons that we've learned so far
I think we've been pretty lucky with the
students that we put but I think one of
the main reasons that that's true is I
had a very soon the requirement that
they all had to give me code and that
the code they gave me all had to fulfill
the same request so basically I asked
them to make a browser poll you know
what's your favorite browser so i had to
basically ask some questions in HTML
ahead to have a little bit of JavaScript
validation and there had to be an HTML
and CSS that was compliant I had to be
in PHP it had to you know tell the
person to put the information to my
sequel database so it was kind of late
you know ID 100 different things you
wanted to know about this developer and
I just asked a very trivial question
about all of them so that I could for
instance see well this guy has just made
beautiful of your own to php5 code but
the design is appalling okay well let's
get him to do something in the back end
or this guy you know say like Quinn had
like just blew me away of all of these
graphs so I was just totally taken aback
well we just have to get them to do
something with graphing this is just
incredible so it really just kind of
solicited the strengths and weaknesses
so I could match them up with a good
project and ultimately let you know
indicate where a lot they should be in
the program at all and so that's kind of
we have a good projects thing so trying
to match skills and stuff like that one
of the things that is quite challenging
the moment for us as the problem with
interdependencies so if she got you know
like we've got a guy who was working on
google maps and i'll open ID and stuff
so if we wanted to even kind of start
getting these things to work together
these are interdependency problems i
think in general you try and keep them
separate so that if someone doesn't you
know participate properly or slow
something it's not gonna have an adverse
effect on anyone else point that you
know liz is my time time again it's all
about you know just starting the coding
early and I think you know for the
opportunity to dust again then you know
we're going to make that very very clear
because you can always sort of slack off
but it's very hard to kind of catch
and I think you know on that note you
know one of the good things we've done
you know like probably about fifty
percent of the projects which I'm
showing you've got half of them they've
actually got quite available for
download now and so we made a fairly
kind of arbitrary choice about which one
was in or not but basically wanted to
get some of it out the door so that we
could find out some of the problems
straightaway it would have been
unmanageable if we tried to release
everything and sort of 0.1 release
straight away but at the same time it
would have been really bad to try and
get everything so called kind of rock
solid and then release it because then
we wouldn't have learnt on a problem so
for instance we needed to make some code
available so that a module Penta ticket
of another module exists that kind of
thing so they're all internal technical
things that kind of popped up through
door releasing the code early and you
know so it was quite healthy to do that
yeah and lastly you know it was just
really really exciting those reels
really really cool to have all of these
people just completely transform our
project and just make it twice as good
as it's what it was so yeah if you've
got questions it has to stay away from
our sports because I don't know that
other than the fact that when I am flew
over on the plane you know it's watching
a movie and every kind of 30 minutes the
pilot would pause all the communications
and everything like that and it's a hey
look you know the school is like five
million taevon know a game was on but I
definitely need to gain was I'll after
my movie was interrupted six times so we
didn't win a rugby game recently I don't
know even know what it was but yeah the
other questions about the kiss fact new
zealand about silver strife about
managing open-source teams or code and
stuff like that he's the bills now that
you've open source the product all right
so who pays our bills well as I her
mentioned initially what we were doing
up to about a year ago we were closed
source and so we were building websites
or people right and so even today that
you know to this day that's still true
but is it gets two categories there are
people who are downloading our free tool
and maybe one able to support orbit
just wanting a whole site being built or
that kind of thing and then you know
there are more local customers back in
Wellington who want websites right so
one instance the capital city so you
have small business large business and
in you have government so you've got a
nice diversity of people who don't know
anything about websites but need
websites so that's that's paying our
bills dignity in the short term one of
the big things we wanted to do with open
sourcing the product was get a lot more
people using it and that really opened
the door for us to cover of
complementary products and services you
know so we're looking into ways of you
know for instance without free ecommerce
module looking at ways I've seen well as
in ways that we can have Commission's or
can we kind of Hostess and doing things
like that where you need to part with
money anyway as the person using the
system so given that we've given the
code to you is there a way that's fair
and equitable for you to give us some of
that finally you know we're also looking
at in our other complementary products
that we can produce you know possibly in
a sess model and things like that so the
first stage for us really was just
trying to get people to learn about us
and to love our product yeah
haiyan so how widespread your customers
in the game come on Smith how yeah you
mentioned a lot of local customers yer
open source you're on the Internet do
you get customers that are outside your
time zone ok well ok so the question is
you know do we have customers
geographically dispersed so for the most
part no because for the service based
business of do really building a website
for people who say so technical it's
quite difficult to work in different
time zones and cost countries when you
can't meet face-to-face but there is
changing in terms of the developer
community so we're getting lots of
inquiries like I was just answering the
phone useless some guy down the Florida
was ringing up as I look I've seen your
whole tool i want you know you said kind
of be a partnership of me so that you
know i can kind of fire you the
difficult questions and so on right
there other than America there's not a
lot of interest and I think that's just
sort of representative of you know I
guess the American economy in terms of
you know like this a lot of it IT
industry is and stuff I there but I mean
we've had you know over 15,000 downloads
and lots of people actually being
self-sufficient than using at all I said
it's probably my tears more of a nice
positive comment on the documentation
and stuff like they're in the forum and
IRC and things yeah but I mean I think
one of the points are so it's still
fairly early days right because it's
very was when we made the state will
release so that's what six months as
it's the first of all this now so yeah
so I mean you know I think that it's
definitely growing but people wanting to
use it and play around with a lot more
and I mean we've had steady growth to
the traffic and stuff like that so it's
definitely working here easily
same time up you can you can you can
join us for the QA hi everyone for
seeking delay and now I'm on so so Sam
is the CTO still straight he is the
brainchild behind a little code so while
I actually showed him the PHP language
just on its cus from three to four it
doesn't take many years for him to
completely supersede my abilities and
stuff like that so I've had so kind of
bowel downs as his godlike stay true and
that regard for the introduction we've
got any perhaps technical questions
about I don't know I mean Sam Center to
talk it asked on on ending rails envy
and php5 so I don't know if there's
anyone out there wants to to know about
that but we've stopped all right so
another thing that I'm involved in in
New Zealand is an outfit called web sock
so there are about five or six of us who
have spearheaded this whole web
standards movement in New Zealand and we
put on a conference about two years ago
and there's another one coming early
next year in New Zealand and the focus
is very much on web standards about
making elegantly engineered websites so
yeah we brought a whole other people
like Doug Bowman and calico so and
things like that to our country and
basically created the first major web
conference in New Zealand and it was a
lot of fun I was very motivating very
inspirational for everyone that turns up
and I basically kind of encourage anyone
that's in a position to bring I guess
inspiration and ideas and so on to your
community to do so you know because
there was nothing really happening like
that in New Zealand so it's very very
good for us to basically say hell up
well instead of just looking at blogs
and so on and reading books about how to
make better web sites that are
accessible or you know that kind of
stuff let's actually get you in the same
room
you know the experts and soft like that
one of the interesting things about
working on this kind of stuff in New
Zealand is the development communities
is pretty small and tight-knit and so if
you start something it's quite easy to
really get everybody you know in say you
know Wellington or New Zealand excited
about it and get everybody really on
board and so rather than just being yet
another conference it's like the
conference this year and debt that does
have a lot of benefits yeah yeah yeah we
got we got feedback from kc sierra about
about the fact that we actually made a
different size of girls and stuff like
that so i think there's a question at
the back
of all the can't provide relevant so we
reset traffic Parliament or you love to
act as their sights on YouTube yes
officials about New Zealand recently
passed some laws about the fact that you
can 0 knots terrorize government I
haven't really followed it too closely
but my understanding is the fact that
what the law has actually done has kind
of opened it I think they were even more
draconian rules that basically existed
before the internet was around and now
the internet exists the Lord sort of
became a bit dysfunctional and so I said
well this is a bit silly let's let's try
and make this a bit more sane i I don't
know i mean the law was more targeted
producers rather than consumers of
content so i believe yeah if it was
produced in New Zealand and hosted
offshore I'm not sure nothing about the
details but you know it's not China yeah
I think I think I think in general
effect that as a country and as an
economy we we don't really care too much
about that so you would have to be quite
slanderous and probably quite
unjustified and and really kind of gets
cause deformation for probably to really
be invoked I don't think just making a
bit of a mockery been a politician which
happens if we split second would really
really close too much alone thanks
well we'd love to be part of the program
again next year has been really great
I'd say that we're looking really to
grow the CMS into more of a framework
more of a platform for a wider variety
of projects and so in the nine months
between the end of the the one session
and the beginning of the next we'll
probably be looking at ways of how can
we get everyone you know kill it
collaborating on a platform rather than
adding more and more features to CMS
tool that what if we did that become
increasingly bloated so it'll probably
be more about getting lots and people
involved in developing various add-on
modules for the system because frankly
you know the number of add-on modules we
have compared to other CMS's we could
stand to improve their so that'll
probably be our phone yeah I think I
think in general as well we would be
looking at whatever is tappable at the
moment you know so at the moment open
ideas I think which i think is really
fantastic there'll be things happening
at six or nine months that will be just
fantastic to do that really haven't been
conceived yet so it'll be a case of
seeing we know we're weird a product has
gone and where people you know what
people want because we definitely want
to make sure that you know what we're
doing some people relevant at that time
and to what people desire yeah this new
zealand get advantage being sort of the
first country on the new day I think New
Zealand does give an advantage being the
first country in a day we definitely a
lot of tourism at the start of the year
I think everyone flopped to to New
Zealand renewals a new millennium except
i think it was cloudy the the timezone
differences you have been companies who
have tried to effectively work while the
rest of the economic ohne me sleeping
and then deliver stuff complete when
they wake up the next morning and that
had seen some success obviously you know
it's queer
or whether the disadvantages of the time
zone difference don't outweigh that but
you know people explore the
opportunities given to them in
interesting ways all right thanks for
