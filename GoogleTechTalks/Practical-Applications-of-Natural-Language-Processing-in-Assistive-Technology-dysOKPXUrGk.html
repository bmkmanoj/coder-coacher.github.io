Stevie darman and I'm happy to have Cara
thing I'm here today ken is running a
very interesting little company called
amazed ability and the good their goal
and he will articulate this much better
during a stock is to create a seamless
user experience for a large population
of users including users who cannot see
by using speech and natural language
technologies the goal is to not make
this thing look like a computer built
for geeks used by geeks but rather
something that you can just open up talk
to and use it's a very interesting idea
and I think it puts a whole new
dimension on the world of accessibility
which for a very long time has sort of
gotten sandboxed into a very small
capsule are defined by screen readers
running on windows and the type of work
Ken's doing is very exciting because it
really opens up the box and asks the
question what does real usability mean
for the end user so with that take it
away ken thank you I'm going to begin by
expressing my appreciation to TV Raman
and his colleagues for inviting me here
today and I must say I left this morning
to come to Google to do this talk
interesting as you see absolutely the
wrong kind of clothing one of the
disadvantages of being blind of course
is you don't get to see the lovely
scenery around this area and you don't
get to see what people wear or i should
say don't wear in any event yeah what
I'm going to try to do today is tell you
about where we came from what our
motivation was in designing the product
that we're showing today and also show
you what we hope to do with in the
future is that first slide up
okay why don't we move to the next slide
just to characterize the challenge that
we took on as some of you may know the
kind approach to technology is latude
assistive technology is largely to adapt
windows and mac and other types of
screens so that the blind can track
what's going on as they move the cursor
about the screen in effect one emulates
the screen shots and at a very low level
of the connection to the visual screen
trap what's happening in speaking the
difficulties are numerous however with
this approach while it's been wonderful
in the lifesaver for many it's only
addressed a very small part of the need
approximately 100,000 screen readers are
currently installed animal will get to
what size the real target is but that's
a very small percentage in addition
screen readers and adaptive technology
general generally our complex you have
to learn how to use the screen reader
then you have to go on and learn all the
applications you want to use through it
it's difficult to use in the sense that
it's slow there's a productivity hit
because you have to move around and hunt
and then lastly it's expensive the
current workhorse screen reader on the
market today is nine hundred dollars
then you have to go buy yourself a
computer with windows and everything
else on it to be useful to make it all
useful what we've done with our product
the depth one is to not adapt but in
fact to create a new form of assistive
technology which is easier to learn it's
faster and it's a good deal less
expensive and above all we're aiming it
at people who
have little to no computer or technical
experience the vast majority of people
out there in fact could I have the next
slide this gives you a sense of how big
the target really is in the United
States there are slightly over 10
million people who are visually impaired
the American Foundation for the blind
goes on record by saying this 1.3
million who are totally blind or have no
useful vision I've heard numbers 1.6 and
somewhat higher we took the larger
number and took away all of the older
folks not for any reason other than just
to be conservative we took away all the
children again not because they aren't a
good target for what we're trying to do
with again to be conservative and just
focused on those who were in the
employability range then we cut that
number substantially and came up with a
4 million figure of people who we think
could benefit from the approach we're
taking there are 45 million or so other
disabled in this country people with a
whole range of disabilities we're
manipulating print and other media
physically is a difficult task worldwide
there are 45 million people who are
totally blind and 135 million who are
visually impaired so the the challenge
is huge and if you think of only a
hundred thousand screen reader
installations out there it's just
touching the tip of the iceberg may I
have the next slide
what we're trying to do is make it
possible for these folks to read
anything they might want to read doesn't
matter what it is or where it comes from
we want to be able to commit people to
easily write anything from letters
school papers email whatever it might be
and thirdly we'd like to help people to
in fact get on the web you and access
all of the various online services that
the general cited folks can easily
access with their windows machines and
whatever they may have with that in mind
as we move the Adept one forward we're
looking to address the needs of people
who read a lot such as for example the
725,000 National Library Service of the
blind readers we'd like to go after the
1.5 million folks who currently use
computers or need to use computers who
are blind or severely visually impaired
and then the four million others in our
first list beyond that and hopefully
within the next year we hope to go after
other disabled and beyond that to the
general public we firmly believe that
while the long play record the telephone
a typewriter even the tape recorder were
designed with disabilities in mind to
help people with disabilities that if we
can find ways in which what we are doing
will become generally useful to the
general public we will find the best way
to move forward what we're doing and
address the wider need out there they
have the next slide
what we did when we started amazed
ability is we looked for support this is
a small market there isn't much desire
in the part of the venture capital
community to put money into it at the
time we did all of this in 2002 the
dot-com crash was well in effect and it
just wasn't any funding we were very
fortunate to go ahead and receive
federal grants in the United States
Department of Education and what we did
in the first phase of this grant
procedure a process was to look at the
question if we created simple reading
and writing applications that were not
you know screen analogues but in fact
totally different and hopefully designed
to be very easy could the visually
impaired quickly learn and use them
secondly could they use them using voice
recognition and that's been our key
howdy said theme all the way along here
what we did is we gathered a group of
we'vewe've course prepared the machine
and then we gathered a group of blind
subjects and put them through a rigorous
series of tests long scripts of testing
various command scenarios and non
spontaneous utterances and got some good
measures on what was possible in effect
we found that we could raise school is
from the 70s level for successful
commands up into the low 90s and with
corrections to the language models for
speech recognition even go higher we
also tried tricks like you know many of
you have seen the so-called command line
where you can type commands and look at
them and correct them and so forth we
try to review procedure again in voice
where people could attempt to command if
they got it wrong or if they didn't
complete it they could then complete it
in a kind of voice editing procedure and
then we satisfied tell the Deaf wanted
to go and execute the command and again
we we got good metrics on all that
what we did find out is that in doing
that and it worked well if you were
skilled and competent happen you know
content with technology which many of
our first group were but it also was
difficult particularly we had no idea of
why we were doing what we were doing so
we attempted in our second grant
application which we received from the
United States Department of Education to
look at their natural language
processing now that means a lot of
things to a lot of people it might mean
to some that you just talked in a
natural voice and the Machine figures
out what you're saying it does something
but it also implies in our sense that
the machine also understands a little
bit of what you're saying sorry so what
we did was in fact to working with
Carnegie Mellon University's the folks
at the speech consortium also working on
natural language dialogue engines was
too in fact build a dialogue engine on
the DEP one one way you could talk give
a command and if he didn't complete it
after a period of time in the voice
recognition process you it would then
ask you what would you like to do
knowing the nature of the command based
on what you had already said you could
then fill in the missing words or terms
and finally it would ask you to sanction
it's during the command so it was a true
dialogue process one in which we tried
to use the librarian the reference
librarian model where the you know the
machine came back and asked you a
question that you know listed it a sink
a simple answer and you went on from
there and the trigger cause was to do it
in very few iterations so that was
really efficient and that turned out to
be quite successful nobody despite some
recognition errors as you might expect
nobody had trouble with getting a
complete correct command on in a
reasonable period of time and
this group that we used of subjects were
people who were retired older people
younger people arranged where we could
test how would be for people who were
not again as I said technical who had
not been as we did in the first group
have been technology experts teachers of
assistive technology and the like well
at the point we came in 2006 we came to
the point we said well we now have to
get this product out the door we feel
it's eminently valuable and useful so
let's go so we effectively stop raising
grant money and and really focused on
with our small group producing the
product and we're getting close now to
what we're calling a beta release and
you know with all the hope and
expectations of the gamble we're taking
may have the next slide well I'm sorry
we're on the guidelines and the point of
this slide is that after all of the
feasibility studies we did in focus
groups we elaborated the following
criteria shown in that slide the first
is that we needed to define a complete
set of voice terms for controlling all
of the applications and we had in mind
not only our base set of applications
which are you know editing or word
processing web access
addressbook email reference work access
and so forth and library access but we
also went beyond that and did the design
user interface design for openoffice for
example to have complete compatibility
with vendor word processors book
scanning with a the document scanning
and OCR appointment book and calendar
home accounting a whole series of
applications and that allowed us to
created a command set which is unique
and mnemonic and we hope easy to learn
and use we then require that those voice
commands map into keyboard commands that
were very simple to type in the natural
language mode you could type full
English sentences and commands but of
course most people who use machines of
this sort don't like to do that we like
to use shorthand commands so for example
open email become Zoe open web becomes 0
W and things of that sort so they're
typically the first letters of the
spoken commands and again hopefully easy
to learn and use we then wanted to have
all the commands have the same centrally
the same or do the same actions and for
the most part through all these
different applications most of the same
commands do the same actions so that if
you learned how to do simple word
processing you could then move on to web
web access navigation learning only a
few more things above what you already
were comfortable with we also moved
ahead to make sure that the commands had
very few strokes to happen again our
target ultimately is all the folks who
are older middle-aged older your mom and
dad for example who want to do what the
kids are doing but have never really
been computer users and in that sense we
didn't want contortions of having to hit
two or three keys at once to make
something happen so we largely
restricted
although the commands to be alphanumeric
characters and punctuation there I think
only for control characters that are
used in the entire set of applications
including the future ones and these are
ctrl-c to cancel control p to define
page text you instead of paragraph
control a to go into a full matter for
speech tailoring and control left to
open up frames in web pages and and you
know applications like Open Office so we
hope that will make it easy for people
who've only really done typing all their
lives to go very quickly into learning
how to use the DEP one other things that
we did were to look at our applications
for example email can be done entirely
by menuing until of course you open up a
meal in email temporary and you want to
in fact produce your message then of
course it's free form dictation and or
typing and by the way you can type and
talk at the same time on the DEP one but
in any event we realize that again from
our focus groups and whatnot that it'd
be nicer if you could just tell at a
single command verbal or typed and have
it do a whole bunch of stuff at once
some of the same approach i think that
TV Raman put into Emacs speak with tools
as he calls them i think and here you
could for example say open email
messages from the head upon prompt at a
wall startup email run off to your ISP
get your email bring it into the inbox
and open it up or start opening up for
you you can delete an email message from
anywhere any one of the menus in the
email system or in while reading an
email message just to get rid of it and
commands of that sort we then went on to
other issues for example we wanted to be
sure that the depth one didn't speak
anything that it didn't have to that was
you know crash if you are using a screen
reader on a web page for example there's
an awful lot of cruft you have to listen
to what we tried very hard to do was to
filter all that out so that what you get
from the most part is a reasonably clean
you know text format and the only funny
word you hear is the word link that
tells you that here in this part of the
text doesn't link you can you know
execute other than that we don't you
know we could clean these things out
pretty thoroughly we also wanted to be
sure that in the end what we do is
extract the knowledge the information
that people want and so we've tried very
hard to explore structure in the web
page for example we pull out what's
important and reject all of the stuff
that isn't useful or is background or
whatever and allow the user to access
forms directly access images if they can
be interpreted other objects and so on
as you'll see later when i get to the
web browser again all of this in the
context that what we want to be able to
do is have people ultimately talk in a
convenient friendly wage as though the
Adept one were another person and have
it respond and sensible useful ways and
one of the things we found that happened
with other voice recognition systems
that the visually impaired have used is
that they have found okay what if the
command doesn't respond what if you know
the sign is it broken I was it going off
and doing something you didn't mean it
to do or what so what we've done is
implemented methodologies here where you
can ask it any time where are you in the
process even during dictation you can do
that to find out your context and that
makes it a lot less
a difficulty to use this type of
technology may have the next slide in
and to begin with our version one which
we're preparing for release is one in
which as I indicated earlier you you get
the depth one on a low-cost laptop or
desktop award or whatever it'll run on
any reasonable machine and when you
start it up you'll be in the depth one
main application it'll ask you what you
want to do and after that you can for
example open the address book and put in
entries you could open the email and
navigate get your email create emails
forward them whatever you want to do you
can open the library which allows you to
access an online library of books on my
machine here I have some 20,000 books
that is complete books text Doc's PDFs
audio various flavors and whatnot and I
can read them find them in the library
catalog open them and read them and I'll
show you a bit of that a little in a few
moments you can do of course navigating
through the file system raw and look at
all the various files you can have a
user full-strength file manipulation set
of procedures to delete move files copy
them and all the rest again all invoice
you can also do web access as I
indicated earlier and lastly open up a
list of reference works dictionaries
glossary is technical glossary zand the
rest and easily look up words and get
spelling or meanings that what have you
again from any context
I'm the next file next item and this is
the reading writing etc or reading
process when you go through the library
what you hear are the titles of books
and the author or articles or movies or
whatever they might be and you open them
and we don't care what they are all
sizes fit all as the expression goes and
if it's audio of various flavors will
open it cue it up for listening and so
on if it's text fine we'll clean it up
and make it presentable if it's a dot
doc or PDF or whatever will convert it
and make it listenable if it's a daisy
book and I'll come to that and the next
slide or so it'll again open that queue
if for listening and reading and so on
so pretty much any format you'll find
out there we support and can continue in
terms of extending the procedure we can
continue to support and expand this list
when you do access a file or a book in
the library you open up what's called an
edit temporary and you can open up a
second one in what's called an other
temporary and you can flip between these
so that for example you can open up one
item read it open up another and take
notes about it and save it as a file or
send it as email whatever you might want
to do and you can do high files that is
to say save documents or pieces of
documents or you can define a high foul
that is itself a document and read it
into an existing one you're working on
so the flexibility is enormous here and
lastly when you're working on your
document a school paper you can format
it for whatever format you might want
centering lines block and denting
putting in headings of all sorts
collimating tables and all the rest of
it and then tell the depth one to format
it for printing and actually printed or
you can tell it to convert it into
Braille grade 2 or technical Braille and
get a real copy if you're lucky enough
to have
braille embosser attached so there's a
lot of capability built into this could
I have the next slide and we come to
what's called the daisy book if on one
in sync with the slide I hope and
basically what you have here to those
who are unfamiliar with the daisy
technology-rich is dottie oh I'm sorry
digital audio system and there are other
definitions I've heard but what the idea
is is that you get a book in the form of
many XML SML and other files navigation
file in a package file and all the rest
and when you open it it provides if it's
a full a fully elaborated daisy book
you'll get the digital version opened up
and you'll get an audio version such as
is recorded by an actor or whoever a
volunteer reader cued up to listen to
and you get a table of contents in terms
of the text version you can navigate
through it reading a line at a time
character at a time if you wanted to
word sentence paragraph or whole block
so just continue to listen to it ad
infinitum to the end of the book if
you'd like if it's a an audiobook you
can navigate it using the arrow keys by
section which you can set as to the
level of the section or by element
meaning an increment of time or by
phrases or what have you if the art if
the recognition is good enough to detect
those and if you're in the table of
contents you can navigate the table of
contents to any section you might want
you can use bookmarks you can open up
book objects which are sidebars and
reference notes and all sorts of other
goodies that are part of our good
complex book and you can go immediately
to them and read them and there's
another command that you can issue which
will allow you to tell it to skip those
while it's reading the book if you wish
to or read them in line as you are
reading the book so it's a very flexible
approach
to packaging a book particularly those
that have lots of components and parts
and and and that can be addressed and
worked on singly actually the American
Publishers Association among others has
adopted this is a standard for their
ongoing future work they have the next
slide as I said in the navigating to
read you can read sentence word line etc
at a time or groups of those two right
all we do is we prepend the navigating
commands with appropriate editing
commands such as C for change defo
delete be for exchange for exchange
actions insert before the text unit and
append after so with these very simple
extensions to the command language
you're able to do all the editing you
might want to do on a document and when
you through of course save the document
and or print it or send it to the
Braille the next slide
we're now on the web browser as we call
it when you start it up it opens up a
web page or downloads a web page a
default you set up in my case I default
the New York Times Associated Press news
bulletins and you can skim down it you
can open up a function which allows you
to tell it to search for headings or in
fact for Google results items and we're
adding more of that sort of thing to the
intelligence of the page you can also
open up a web link list of all the links
on the page you can do that for web
objects such as JavaScript images of
what have you and if they are accessible
or can be made accessible we will do
that similarly you can open up the web
forms and get a list of all the forms
open whichever one you like fill in the
data submit them and so forth web frames
and web URLs to put in new URLs web
history even web tables where you're
able to extract a table on the web page
and structure to be read a cell at a
time in fact that's a feature of the
main a dep one word processor we can do
three-dimensional tables where you can
move around into across and up and down
columns of a three-dimensional array of
elements it's a lot of fun actually but
yeah so that's the web browser and again
I hope to show that to you if everything
works well the next slide
this is I believe the architecture slide
oh sorry it's a trouble with having some
its livestock the new applications these
are the short-term version to version 3
over the next year or two that we hope
to put in that we've already done the
specifications for they include a full
professional address book I'm sorry
appointment book and calendar book
scanner a describer which allows it to
look at structured pages such as web
pages and describe to you what's on them
giving you an overview and allowing you
to look into sections and explore them
in more detail a query language which
should allow you to explore the content
of such things as well as your online
library of you know I'm teen thousand
books and also functions like GPS one
day home accounting games and so on so
we've actually plotted through quite a
ways into the future to make this as
useful as possible to as wide a group of
people as we can and now we come to the
architecture I believe and just to give
you a simple you know ankle bone to the
shin bone etc picture you have a headset
with a microphone and our keyboard and
you input with these the data goes into
for example the voice recognition
through the low level recognizer
decoders to what we call a doc control
and this is a middleware fairly
sophisticated piece of middleware which
knows what to do with the language
coming in adds more filtering on it to
make sure it's right for the right
context and then it passes it on to
either the application directly to a dot
format which is our middleware speech
for matter
for to the natural language dialogue
engine for which with which the Adept
one can dialogue with you if it needs to
so there are all these possibilities for
the input but ultimately it gets to the
application and the application responds
through a dot format which can do all
sorts of things with the speech it can
change languages it can change the speed
the switch from the Latin alphabet to
the international alphabet if you're
unsure about pronunciation of spelling
that can speed it up slow it down do all
sorts of fun things to make the speech
exactly what you want there's a
capability for example to turn on and
off any characters other than
alphanumerics and punctuate I'm sorry
alphanumerics you can turn off
parentheses brackets any punctuation
insert variable delays between each and
then set them as permanent defaults if
you wish in my case I tend to listen to
all the punctuation because I do a lot
of technical work but when you're
reading a book we opened it up in what
we call narrative mode and shut all
those things off so radar format can be
informed by your commands from the
console or can be informed by the
application and made to do what it's
supposed to do from there the output
goes to of course the text-to-speech
engines of whatever flavor and then to
your headset or to a speaker and in
between in the center there with a
natural language processor there are
other functions such as search engine
others which we know how to put in there
and which our future work for us to do
and we do hope that we'll be able to do
a lot of this with you folks at Google
we really want to Google eyes yeah if
you wish in both ways of spelling that
phrase the Adept one we think you guys
are doing a wonderful piece of work with
what you have going on here
I'm going to well I'm going to hold off
on the future versions and get to the
demo
now this is always quite problematical
because we're in an open room ambient
noise even the Adept one itself talking
fortunates a little less dangerous than
in other places I've been and where the
speakers have been right over my head
basically and that pretty problematical
I'm really going to try the command and
control for a number of things and I'm
not going to try the dictation although
we are testing that and it's getting
better every day and in a quiet
situation and I try that but not not
here the first thing I will do is find
out where things are then I'm going to
log in as the tutorial client I can
login as myself or as a support person
and get downloads and new upgrades from
amazed ability but i'm going to log in
this tutorial where we have a complete
online set of tutorials for all the
functions of the deaf one telling you
how to do editing how to format
documents for print and Braille how to
use in catalog the library the web
browser dot dot and similarly we have a
folder full of all the manuals which go
into detail lab nauseam there are also
online help pages context-sensitive
summaries and command lists as well as a
full web style set of help pages for you
to navigate through you really want to
do online reading of that sort so it's a
fairly complete I think we hope robust
package for the folks were aiming at so
I'm going to as I said log in and then
I'm going to navigate to the library
open library rather navigate the catalog
a little bit and I'm going to open up a
couple of books I'm going to open up
then through the file system file
management going to open up an audio
file stopped and started in play games
of that sort one thing I can say
about all of the menus no matter where
they are or what they are you can open a
menu go to the top or bottom you can
skip any number of entries in a menu you
might wish and this of course includes
file folders and the like you can search
all menus so you can indicate a search
and look for something more quickly than
simply navigating around and it's so
moving around in menus list of things
that get can get pretty fast of again as
I said with your tation I'm not going to
attempt that in this room what am I the
microphone is off you are not marked and
I'm sorry what all right what am I the
microphone is off you are not logged and
hold up one hello this is the Adept one
tutorial tutorial password lessons
amazed ability hello tutorial what do
you want to do open library please open
library library catalog alphabetical

goodbye tutorial well that gives you a
flavor of hobby no edited file open i
hit the keyboard with a headset that
gives you a sense of how it works I very
freely and other people we tested it
very rarely have errors when it's not a
big room like this with sound coming
back it's particularly vulnerable when
we are playing an audio file because of
course we can control it to avoid
listening while it's speaking but we
can't do that of course when it's
playing streaming audio but in any event
moving on just to the slides to complete
that set we have I think the future
versions up okay and basically what we
look to do in the short term is to
improve our full dictation voice
recognition and expand the natural
language dialogue adult dialogue and
procedure next we look to extend what
we've already started to do with email
into what we call transaction NLP or
natural language processing where you
can define using the command line
procedures here
or we you know as the supply as the
vendor here could do more elaborate ones
that is to say provide transaction level
things that can be done for example you
could ask a DEP one what books do you
have on physical chemistry or what do
you have by charles dickens and the
depth one would proceed to look through
its library and tell you what it might
have you could command it to go on the
web and find what it could find on that
using for example Google services and
even go beyond that to downloading the
book if it were available anywhere you
could also we hope do transactions on
the web such as buying items at Amazon
or what have you we would go through as
much of the process in a secure mode as
possible again aimed at allowing the
average person who doesn't want to go
through all that screen flipping and you
know clicking and whatnot to accomplish
something we're trying to get as close
to the ideal as one can get where you're
talking to another person who is an
intelligent cited viewer with a screen
who is doing all of these things without
telling you about them and saving you
the the you know trouble of having to
hear all of this separate steps we then
wish to do new applications and then to
provide a multi-platform version which
will run on most everybody's machine and
then lastly miniaturize so that we can
have portables that can be carried about
or put into the kitchen and used while
you're cooking dinner or used in a
library or wherever you might want to
use such a device again talking to it as
appropriate or when necessary typing on
the keyboard or using the touchpad to
input data if you have to
and the summary page again our goal is
to provide assistive technology in the
general sense that provides easy to use
applications for people to perform job
and school tasks and we're doing that by
providing the strongest practical
natural language processing capability
we can that would allow people to be as
natural as they can be using such
services so other any questions or
Oh
in this in the demo you're here when we
could
at a point wars
yes Emily was sighted person because
they see all these events occurring on
screen yes the screen right now on that
laptop provides a fairly simple dialogue
picture what's going back and forth so
you would see everything if you were
looking at it yeah but again we're not
doing in or trying to do a screen reader
so we're not projecting the page we can
do that for example we could display
full web pages and things of that sort
especially in future versions where that
may be necessary for partially sighted
and beyond but we're really trying to
approach the analog of talking to
somebody line anyone else
well thank you
you
