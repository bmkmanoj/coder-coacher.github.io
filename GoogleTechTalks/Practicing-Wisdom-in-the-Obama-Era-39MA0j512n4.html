I'm the jolly good fellow of Google I'm
delighted today to introduce a friend a
jolly good lawyer with a heart a man who
is distinguished wise and compassionate
Charlie helping charlie is a public
interest entrepreneur and innovator in
professional education and a pioneer in
the public interest law movement he was
a founding dean of the City University
of New York law school and previously he
was a professor at stanford and
georgetown law schools and a senior
fellow at the year law school he is
currently scholar-in-residence and
lecturer at UC Berkeley and in his free
time Charlie co-founded the center for
law and social policy the mental health
law project the council for public
interest law and the center for
contemplative my in society he also
served as a founding president of the
Nathan Cummings foundation and in his
other free time when he's not founding
stuff Charlie teachers meditation with a
man nicknamed the Zen a bit of Google
Norman Fischer and my friends let's
welcome dr. Charlie happened
it's a very nice for me to be here can
can you hear me all right at the back
let me know if if I'm if I talking too
softly it's a pleasure to be at Google
mang has become a very good friend of
mine and I'm so much admire what he's
done here thank you I admire what he's
been able to accomplish here and I
admire the fact that Google has taken
such a lead in bringing the
contemplative dimension into the
corporate workplace as you'll see from
my comments this is a development which
I very much believe in and I don't know
of any place that has gone so far or so
imaginatively as Google in bringing
mindfulness forward into the work
environment I'm familiar with the search
inside yourself program which some of
you have undoubtedly participated in and
I think the materials are really a model
of what of how the search inside
yourself philosophy integrates with and
enriches the work in the work in the
world and it would be a wonderful thing
for the country if Google's innovation
in search inside yourself bringing
mindfulness into the workplace was
picked up in more public and private
institutions 15 years ago when we were
starting the Center for contemplative
mind in society no such development like
this existed nor was it really
imaginable the extent to which
mindfulness and a consciousness of the
importance of that kind of inner work is
a very new phenomenon and it's one which
google is taking the lead in
I was very interested in this because
I'm a transplanted New Yorker and I
still get a lot of my information from
this magazine The New Yorker and this
week's new yorker is all about
innovation that's this cover here is
supposed to suggest innovation and I
thought it interesting that there are
two particularly relevant cartoons in
The New Yorker The New Yorker is very
important to me in general but
particularly for its cartoons which I
think tell you as much as the text so
this is this is the first cartoon I want
to draw to your attention it shows two
monastic men kneeling down in front of a
small altar with a little incense
wafting up from the altar and one of
them turns to the other and says when I
was making money I made the most money
and now that I'm spiritual I'm the most
spiritual and the other cartoon shows a
middle-aged couple sitting on a sofa
looking at a flat-screen television you
see the back of the television and you
hear the voice coming from the
television it says this week on the
amazing race to enlightenment can Jim
and Susie achieve right mindfulness and
will bar band candy be eliminated for
relentless clinging to the self so this
is these two cartoons are significant in
a couple of ways to me first of all they
imply a whole lot of cultural knowledge
and understanding of what mindfulness is
the relationship of making money and
pursuing the spiritual life and the
irony of bringing a type-a attitude to
both kinds of activity and so that's
interesting and suggests how far we've
come this these cartoons could not have
appeared two decades ago in The New
Yorker they would have simply been
incomprehensible the other thing is that
this is an
about innovation and there's is there is
a recognition that in an issue about
innovation an understanding of these
ancient mindfulness practices is
something that is important that the
highest levels of creativity can come
from the silence and stillness of
searching inside oneself and of
practicing mindfulness and of course
Google whose name has become synonymous
with innovation is also the place where
this ancient wisdom is being tapped and
taught within its programs so about a
year and a half ago I published my first
book I think my only book making waves
and riding the currents activism and the
practice of wisdom and what I was trying
to do in this book among other things
was to revive an interest in the subject
of wisdom as some of you may have
noticed over the last close to a hundred
years the idea of wisdom has sunk from
view in American culture you're hardly
hear the word in places of higher
education where you would think what you
would think would be repositories of
interest in wisdom and engagement with
wisdom you in fact find virtually that
it's kind of slipped off the curricular
agenda I teach in a law school at the
University of California in Berkeley
where you would think that wisdom would
be a central part of the curriculum
there was a time in recent memory when
wisdom was thought to be the most
important quality that a lawyer could
possess and yet wisdom is virtually it's
not discussed it's not taught it's not
engaged in that setting so in writing
this book and choosing as my subtitle
activism and the practice of wisdom
was trying to bring that wisdom concept
forward and also to suggest that the I
use the phrase the practice of wisdom
that wisdom is something that can be
practiced it isn't something that one is
born with but wisdom is something that
can be developed and it can be improved
and enhanced just as we practice the
piano or we practice tennis if we want
to improve our skills and those spheres
we can improve our wisdom by working at
it by effort by practice so that's that
was a core theme of my book needless to
say the emphasis on wisdom is not
something that I grew up with I was
educated at elite East Coast
university's first in college and then
in law school and the idea of practicing
wisdom was not part of what I was doing
and I entered a profession and a kind of
professional training that is especially
notable for its focus on the outside
world lawyers regrettably are not
encouraged to search inside themselves
to find their own wisdom rather they the
emphasis is all on the outside and
really there's a shocking lack of
attention to what goes on inside the law
student and the lawyer and that was that
was the way I was trained and I grew up
in the home where my father was a lawyer
and then a judge and so that I said
legal education was something that I
absorbed around the dinner table as a
small child so I had I had some remedial
education to do when I entered the world
of law practice in order to do the kind
of search inside myself work which I
came to recognize as critically
important Megan his introduction
mentioned the fact that I had started a
public interest law firm named the
center for law and social policy
and that was a place where we started
out doing at the beginning our main
successes were in the environmental
field we took on some very large
environmental law suits and for example
got an injunction against the
construction of the trans-alaska
pipeline which oddly enough permitted
the oil companies that wanted to build
this pipeline to take the time to
actually consider what the environmental
consequences might be and to design a
better pipeline one that they that was
reasonably compatible with environmental
protection so that was the kind of work
we were doing in that firm needless to
say high-stress work high stakes and a
lot of a tendency for us to work
unlimited hours and to put in the most
concentrated and focused effort we could
on winning our cases very little
inwardness we were doing this work at
the center in washington DC and an
office just north of dupont circle and
right across right across sixteenth
street from our office was ralph nader's
office Nader's Nader's operations and
nader himself our was almost wholly
focused on kind of a single-minded
attention just to getting the results
they wanted on particular cases or
particular legislation and nader was
someone who did not believe in looking
inward or trying to live a balanced life
he actually thought a balanced life was
assigned people were insufficiently
devoted to their work and insufficiently
high-minded in their commitment to
serving their goals traits of Nader's
which I'm afraid to say were reflected
in his later political career as a
presidential candidate that lack of
balance the lack of introspective
awareness led him into what
I consider some major mistakes after in
his early years making enormous
contributions to the public but we had
so we had our public interest law firm
on one side of sixteenth Street and
Nader's was on the other side and we
could really decide if we wanted to make
that our model or if we wanted to try to
build a different model which would
build more balance into our lives and at
a fairly early point I began to sense
that this balance groundedness a balance
of the inner and the outer the heart and
the head was what would make for the
most effective and the most sustainable
kind of public interest law practice and
in my book I talk about some of the
tensions that arose between Ralph and me
and between their public interest law
firm and ours so at a fairly early point
when I was functioning as a public
interest lawyer I began to explore
various ways of searching inside myself
such as yoga quiet and individual time
in nature vision quests meditation and
all of these things many of which I
introduced into our into the center for
law and social policy started to give me
an intimation of how we could find a
balance between the good work in the
world and the inner work which would
make that more effective and more
sustainable fast forward at a certain
point I had the opportunity to become
president of a new foundation in New
York City called the Nathan Cummings
foundation what a wonderful opportunity
to be able to have somebody else make a
huge amount of money and then I had the
opportunity to give it away in a way
which I thought would lead to a better
world what a great chance opportunity
that was
and fortunately I turn to advice for
some of the people who have been passing
through google and will be passing
through google later this week one of my
earliest advisors was daniel goleman
who's speaking here on thursday a
wonderful presenter and I hope some of
you will be there to listen to him too
and Jon kabat-zinn who has come through
here and has really brought mindfulness
practice into the mainstream of the
practice of medicine in this country a
remarkable achievement again one that
would have been unimaginable 20 years
ago so with with their advice we set up
among our other grants programs a
commitment to contemplate of mind we
supported John Kevin sins work at the
University of Massachusetts we supported
Bill Moyers remarkable series healing
and the mind in which he featured
people's work like Jon kabat-zinn and
Andrew Weil and Michael Lerner all of
whom draw heavily on mindfulness in
their approach to health and perhaps the
most significant thing we did in those
days was to set up a new nonprofit
called the Center for contemplative mind
in society this was the niche we carved
out for ourselves contemplative mind in
society to think about how contemplative
practices which had developed over
millennia in cloistered religious
settings for the most part could be
brought forward how the essence of
mindfulness practice for example could
be brought forward into the institutions
of society which we thought had a very
good chance of significantly improving
the state of the world and it was this
work that brought me into contact with
Norman Fischer whom many of you know I'm
sure from search inside yourself where
he's been one of the founding teachers
and one of the spiritual leaders of that
program along with mang
and the work I've been doing most
recently with Norman has been bringing
mindfulness practice into the legal
profession now to some people that
sounds like the beginning of another
lawyer joke how many mindful lawyers
does it take to change a light bulb that
kind of thing and in fact we've at this
point we've we've gone past that point
that there is now a considerable
community of lawyers around the country
who have come to believe that
mindfulness practice is something which
is important to their successful pursuit
of their lives as lawyers that they will
be better and more effective lawyers
that the cause of justice will benefit
from more of their work more if they are
grounded in mindfulness so that's been
an important project for me we had at
our last meditation retreat for lawyers
at spirit rock in Marin County we had
over 70 lawyers judges law professors
students all participating in in this
program again something would have been
unimaginable 15 years ago and I took
that one step further during the last
four months when I undertook to teach
the first-ever law and meditation course
at the bold hall law school at the
University of California the Dean told
me I could offer the course he thought
it might be useful that we didn't know
exactly why but he warned me that if we
didn't have 10 people sign up we
couldn't do the course fine I said that
seems reasonable we had in and I had no
idea how much interest we would get it
was a first time course I'm not a
regular member of the faculty I'm a
lecturer so if we got ten I thought we'd
be doing well we had 40 people sign up
and we chose 20 and that's how the
course was run as a seminar through this
last semester I would say about
two-thirds of them had never practiced
meditation before and had no clear sense
of what mindfulness was they signed up
for this course because they had some
vague feeling that this would help them
to stay grounded in the in the very
demanding pressures of legal education
or the start of a legal career and it
would help them they seem they had they
had a vague sense that it would help
them to stay in touch with their
original motivation for becoming lawyers
which had something to do with building
a more just and equitable world and that
much of legal education is designed not
only without attention to that dimension
of the lawyers motivation the lawyers
work but but really with a kind of a
hostility to that kind of an approach so
I've started to think a lot about the
subject of empathy in recent years which
I know is is the subject of session six
in the course that's offered here by meg
and his colleagues in searching within
inside yourself empathy and Barack Obama
has often spoken of our country is
suffering from an empathy deficit which
he has suggested is as urgent a concern
as the trade deficit or the budget
deficit he says the empathy deficit is
something that we ought to be concerned
about I'm and in law school of course
the amp the idea of empathy in the law
school is is a foreign concept
said to say empathy is often treated as
a kind of a naive luxury in the legal
community so one of the things that we
were doing in our law and mindfulness
seminar was to hold up empathy and to
bring that back and that after all is
one of the reasons why many of these
students had come to law school was an
empathic connection to the people who
didn't have adequate access to the
courts who were because of poverty or
ignorance or language difficulties
didn't really understand how to demand
justice for themselves they had come to
law school because that was what they
wanted to do and they thought that
making that connection through empathy
was going to be something that they
would build a career on what my course
has been doing is to suggest there are
ways to do that and that's what has
resonated for many of these students so
of the 20 students who went through this
unusual course with me by the way the
first assignment they have is to
meditate every day just as in si y
meditate every day and keep a journal of
that and then every two weeks I would
get a summary of their journal entries
they would do a 400 page summary and
turn that in every two weeks and when I
got this first one after two weeks into
this course I was just stunned I was
stunned by the depth into which they had
gone into this work and the budding
wisdom that I could see in this in this
work and there was a and the sense of
gratitude for our offering this course
and giving them an opportunity to look
inward and to bring out the deepest
connection they have with justice and
fairness in the world and and the
importance of that in their decision to
have a career in law it's been a
beautiful experience the last exercise I
gave them was the
each of them had had to draw on their
experiences in meditation practice and
the readings I had given them tick not
hon Jon kabat-zinn and others to draw on
all of this and to write their own code
of personal and professional
responsibilities so that they would have
a document that came out of their
deepest selves that they could refer
back to as they were going through law
school and entering their legal careers
and they could modify it and rewrite it
as it went forward it was a the document
that came of that were truly
extraordinary and moving now I want to
take a few minutes to talk about that
american lawyer who most fully embodies
mindfulness and the virtues that are
connected with contemplative practice
and that is Barack Obama a brilliant
lawyer as you all know president of the
Harvard Law Review which means he's not
just another smart guy he has incredible
analytic abilities and a kind of an
intellectual rigor that is very rare to
find and what you may not know is that
being president of the Harvard Law
Review gives you a ticket to the the
most influential the highest paying jobs
that are open to lawyers in america it's
it is it is a blank check a license to
print money and ninety-eight percent of
people who have that had that credential
net experience have used it that way
Obama however showed one of his other
qualities by not taking the taking those
opportunities but graduated from Harvard
then returning to chicago to participate
in a small civil rights law firm
representing steel workers who had been
displaced by plant closings victims of
discrimination of various kinds the
intellectual acuity is commonplace
enough among say elite law schools they
all have the equivalent of the
presidents of their law reviews but
these other qualities are so rare and so
unusual in particular for lawyers who
have gone through this process of
winnowing and and it's where some of
their skills and personal qualities have
been held up their intellectual and
analytic abilities and other of their
personal qualities and skills have been
rather disregarded or disrespected so
that that is what Obama means to me I
met him first about 11 years ago I was
president of this foundation in New York
City that I mentioned to you and I was
working on a plan to start a new think
tank which would try to develop new
ideas for the 21st century it was going
to was going to try to put put away some
of the partisan battles of the last
century and come come forward with a new
set of ideas which might command a wider
assent and which might also be
sufficient to meet new realities of the
21st century that this was a time when
the significance of globalization was
starting to be understood the great the
great successes of the Chinese economic
experiment things of that kind the risks
of pandemics so there was a there was a
whole lot of new stuff that we had to
think about for the 21st century we
started applet we had a plan for a think
tank which would be oriented toward
those problems it's now is now called
demo's a network for ideas an action and
it has offices in five cities and is
doing wonderful things a friend of mine
and so I was trying to put money
together for it no that's something
Foundation presidents do they can put up
some money but they
put up all the money for a major project
so we become fundraisers ourselves with
other foundations I called a friend of
mine in a foundation in Chicago I
thought would be interested in this and
she said well we'll do what we can which
turned out to be nothing but she did
suggest that there was a young state
legislature in Illinois that I ought to
try to meet the next time I was in
Chicago well I was trying to put
together a board of trustees and you
know I was thinking about who or who are
people be major reputations who will
help this fledgling institution seem
solid and substantial so I wasn't
exactly looking for state legislators in
their mid-30s she said trust me you want
to meet this guy when you're out here
next so I took her advice and I arranged
a long breakfast with Barack Obama of
course I had never heard of he brought a
copy of his book dreams for my father I
had never heard of and he autographed it
very graciously for me it was not it was
not the major bestseller then that it is
now but it was a beautifully written
book I was later to discover and and so
deeply introspective this was a person
who had known from the earliest years
what it means to search inside yourself
and to cultivate the wisdom that goes
the grows from that inner search so he
SAT together for a couple of hours over
breakfast and I was extremely impressed
with this young man for the obvious
reasons you know the analytic brilliance
so articulate so eloquent in his speech
but what struck me more than that was
the quality of his presence and the way
he listened and what occurred to me at
that time in our first meeting Obama and
I was that I had seen that quality of
listening
presence and attention once before it
wasn't it wasn't my brilliant professors
at Harvard and Yale far from it it was
the Dalai Lama whom I had met in 1991
and one of the stunning things about him
is this quality of presence and a kind
of an end and Obama shared something
else with him there's a wonderful sense
of humor and a kind of modesty about
himself you know sometimes when you're
in the presence of a great person you
have a sense that they know they're
great people and one of the things
they're doing is giving you the
opportunity to sit with a great person
you've all had that experience I'm sure
but there was none of that either with
Obama than in his third mid 30s or with
the Dalai Lama so I I so we invited him
to join our board and he agreed to do so
and we served together on that
non-profit board for a period of time
until it became clear that his career
was going to take him in a different
direction shall we say he was interested
in politics he was teaching part-time in
Chicago and it was very it was very hard
for him to participate fully in our
program but at that point I I had the I
had this feeling that there's something
so special about this person and as his
career in the Senate unfolded the
brilliant speech he offered at the
Democratic convention and then his
campaign for the presidency and his
first year in office is for the
beginning of his first year in office I
have seen the qualities that I so
admired when we met in Chicago a few
times and we met and we worked together
during that brief period I saw how they
had unfolded and matured and
I would say that the qualities I
described in my book as characteristic
of the practice of wisdom and the
benefits of practicing wisdom are
embodied by no figure in public life
today in this country or elsewhere as
fully as they are embodied in Barack
Obama what an extraordinary thing this
is a master politician a brilliant
analyst who also has the qualities of
being a deeply mindful person what a
great piece of good fortune this is for
us as we confront the challenges of the
21st century which of course turn out to
be very much larger and more complicated
and more difficult than I had
anticipated they would be in the 90s who
could have imagined we could imagine
pandemics but we couldn't imagine
airplanes flying into the World Trade
Center that was beyond what we were
thinking about as and who could imagine
to what a global economic meltdown would
look like these are things which I had a
vague intimation would demand something
beyond mere analytics skill and kind of
instrumental capacity to move concepts
and institutions what they call for is
wisdom for their solution and we have a
president who is devoted to the practice
of wisdom now in my book I've suggested
30 and I don't want to focus too much on
Obama some of you may have voted for
john mccain but i do want to focus on
the qualities that obama embodies and to
pose for you and for us the question of
what we can do to take advantage of our
good fortune and having a person who is
so deeply mindful in the White House as
my I kind of nightmare scenario is that
we have a mindful president in position
for four years or eight years
and then he leaves the presidency and we
go back to business as it had always
been how can we undertake to assure that
we take full advantage of this inspiring
presence and make sure that the
qualities that he so richly embodies are
embedded in our political processes at
every level and are embedded in our
institutions and are embedded in our
lives take for example the subject of
empathy during his campaign candidate
Obama stated that in appointing federal
judges he would use as one of his
central criteria the quality of empathy
someone who's not schooled in the law
might say well of course he's going to
look for people with empathy what else
would you look for in a judge or that
would certainly be one of the qualities
you look for in a judge but in fact it
was quite a radical suggestion no no
other president had ever articulated it
and as I've described this process of
legal education empathy is something
that's viewed with suspicion but he said
that during his campaigns there was
there was a little flap at the time a
week ago ten days ago Justice David
Souter announces that he's going to
leave the bench and Obama comes forward
and he talks about the usual criteria
for selecting a judge a commitment to
the rule of law a deep understanding of
the role of judges and supporting
constitutional values analytic ability
all these things he enumerates and then
he says an empathy he says we need
judges who have the empathy to
understand what it's like to be a
teenage girl who finds she's pregnant or
to be part of a marginalized group like
the elderly or the or racial minorities
or poor people we're looking for a judge
who has that quality
very heartening to me and to people who
have been through a search inside
yourself they understand that empathy is
a core quality to be cultivated and not
one that is overwhelms reason and makes
you just kind of a victim of your own
bleeding heart that's that what empathy
is about as as he understands and we
understand well it's interesting that
empathy and the anti empathy position
has become a rallying cry for the
conservatives who want to contest really
whatever name he comes up with to go on
the Supreme Court but the thing that
they've gotten onto was empathy so that
orrin hatch the ranking Republican on
the Senate Judiciary Committee says well
we know it empathy is empathy is a code
word for judicial activism and we're
opposed to judicial activists so if so
Obama should back off this but Obama is
not going to back off this empathy is at
the core of who he is who else could we
say that about in modern-day Washington
I'm looking for other people and there
are lots of people who are rich and
empathy but nobody who gives it the
pride of place that he gives it and
saying that empathy is going to be at
the at the front of his agenda in his
search for a Supreme Court justice and
if you look at his decisions in foreign
policy these are decisions that are
being moved by empathy he is somebody
who understands he doesn't call it
collateral damage when civilians are
killed by American bombs and American
drones he has empathy for the people
that were bombing does that mean that
he's not great a bomb no it doesn't some
people have suggested that well Obama is
really unique he's our present now but
we really you know there's no one like
him and in certain respects he is quite
unique I mean it's it's it's a
remarkable upbringing he had
he went to it he went to a school a
Muslim school in Indonesia for me that
is people were saying well he doesn't
have enough experience to become
president my reaction that was if the
experience he's had is what the
president needs today if he had so he
had been in the Senate for another six
years would that have made him a better
presidential candidate not in my opinion
I lived in Washington too long was too
close to the Senate to think that that
he's had enough of that kind of
experience but the experience of having
gone to school in Jakarta with Muslims
that's the experience we need for the
21st century that's what's going to give
him a breadth of empathy empathy doesn't
mean loving your children it means
loving all children so the people who
say well he's unique he had this
experience it's true he is unique and
he's had this experience which is really
quite extraordinary but those of us who
have taken men's courses and or have
been deep into mindfulness over a period
of time recognize that these qualities
he has are the qualities of a fully
mindful person and that these are
qualities that we can all study and we
can all learn and we can all perfect
with his inspiration and with this
example so we don't have to talk anymore
about well this is what a month this is
what mindfulness would look like in
society in the position of leadership we
can say that's what it looks like and
then we can take the next step and say
well when we're choosing congressional
candidates in 2010 we want to see a
different kind of candidate coming
forward and we want to see people who
who were deep into mindfulness and who
probably wouldn't have thought about a
political career because it seemed like
such a hostile environment for
mindfulness to thrive we hope those
people will take heart from Obama's
experience and will start to come
forward and give us a start to
re-energize
a political process that is infused with
mindfulness and for those of us who are
swimming against the stream in a law
school for example trying to bring
mindfulness into the curriculum by which
lawyers are trained we can take heart
and we can say to our students there are
several models for being lawyers being a
tough hard-nosed litigator is certainly
one way lawyers can go and and just
turning off all of their empathetic
impulses that's one way to be a lawyer
and then there are other ways to be
lawyers too and you can be as effective
or more effective if you have the skills
of careful analysis and vigor analysis
and vigorous advocacy and you also have
the larger skills that flow from
mindfulness so this is what I the title
I chose for this talk is practicing
wisdom in the Obama era in my book I
speak of practicing wisdom is having
several aspects three of them that are
most important is one looking inward
assuring that you preserve time in your
life for deep reflection for doing
things in the world and then coming back
in and touching into your deepest wisdom
and evaluating and going forward from
that place second doing work that you
believe in I believe if I had continued
my career as a corporate lawyer which is
the direction i started in i would never
have been alive to the wisdom
possibility and in fact i don't think
anybody who's doing work that they think
really isn't serving their their their
highest selves as a possibility of
cultivating wisdom so that's a second
thing doing work that you believe in the
third thing is living a life in balance
if you are living entirely out of your
head and not in your heart if you're
living entirely in order to serve your
employer and not serve a larger vision
of the good you're not going to have
the possibility that's that's
inconsistent with practicing wisdom and
if you do practice wisdom there are
there are benefits there are things that
you can harvest from wisdom practice
some of you have probably already found
this from from the work you've done in
cultivating mindfulness clarity of
vision seeing the interconnection of all
people what is for Obama empathy isn't a
tactic he develops to solve a problem or
to attract voters empathy cut grows out
of his sense of connection among all
people and we can cultivate that too
through our mindfulness and lastly the
thing that Obama has so effectively
cultivated and we can cultivate too it's
a kind of a humility as we go forward or
dealing with these intractable problems
that we face in our personal lives and
that we collectively face in our lives
as global citizens so I think that I'm
delighted to be alive during a time when
we have our first african-american
president and I'm delighted to be alive
in a time when we have our first mindful
president so deeply committed to the
cultivation of wisdom and bringing his
deepest wisdom and best self forward in
his leadership in the country and I I
for one want to take up the challenge
and opportunity that comes from our
having such a present and that is to
think about what i can do personally in
my life and institutions in my life as a
teacher to assure that these qualities
of mindfulness which you at Google have
taken the lead among corporations in
bringing forward and which Obama has
brought into the center of our politics
how we
can assure that these will thrive and
take root in all the institutions of our
society thank you
I was listening to a show this morning I
was a local show I don't know if you
know it called the forum on KQED oh yeah
and Ted Koppel was one of the gusts on
this show and they were talking about
this torture business and Coppell was
suggesting well you should if a person
is an interrogator and they're going on
they should know that if they're they're
considering doing something that's
illegal that they should you know they
should know they may get prosecuted for
it on the other hand there's sort of
these fantasy I think for the most part
scenarios you know in spite of the fact
that the record on torture says pretty
much there's been no useful information
ever gotten out of it nevertheless he's
saying if the person does torture
somebody and then happens to get some
information that does actually happen to
save a life then well you know the
president could pardon the person or in
if if it's it'll s you know extreme
circumstance or local you a jury could
exercise like jury nullification and I'm
thinking this is coming up to the
question of how do you balance empathy
with the rule of law because I could
imagine I moved here from Texas and you
know there's been horrible things
happened all over the world but I could
think of some pretty horrible things
that happened that state while I lived
there i lived there for 23 years and
that there are some areas there where
people have empathy for a different kind
of thing that most of us might think of
as good so and and so there's this how
do you balance empathy and people's
specific points of view and the rule of
law to achieve what you're pointing out
there seems to be a lot of difficulties
in that
it would not does every everyone hurt
here heard the question with everyone
everyone has heard the question good
should be set some news of the mic
hopefully they are ya ok good well
that's a very it's a very good question
and a very rich inquiry let me take it
in two steps the first question is how
do you and I'm going to take them in
reverse order a first question is how
you balance empathy with the rule of law
and for me there's no inconsistency
there to have an empathetic judge means
that as she looks around the clout the
courtroom the judge really makes a
connection with the various litigants
and sees what and tries to understand
what the importance of this case is to
them and makes an empathetic connection
to the lawyers and what this case is is
to them these and so these people become
human beings to the judge and then and
and then the judge conducts the trial
and because he is grounded in
mindfulness he conducts the trial with
total presence able to take in what
people are saying and really to to
listen deeply to the witnesses in front
of him to the arguments of the lawyers
and then she makes a judgment based on
the rule of law the rule of law will
often leave inter species that have to
be filled in you know it's a it may be a
vague standard that the judge is
applying what is due process of law mean
as this person been deprived of Liberty
without due process of law or not well
the judge has has taken all of this in
and then makes a judgment about whether
there was a deprivation of due process
or not and it might depend on how he
understands the litigant before him does
is this a litigant who is a who was
president the harvard law review or is
it a person who has a third grade
education an IQ of 45
and and so the judge having made this
connection then is able to apply legal
principles with a real depth of
understanding whereas the judge who
doesn't have this mindfulness grounding
and there are still some of though there
will be some of them around for years to
come some of them on the Supreme Court
for example might have a much more
mechanistic way of responding to the to
the legal issues and more mechanistic
would mean less grounded in basic human
understanding so that's that's then the
second the first issue you raised which
I've held off is the question of how
mindfulness helps us to see torture and
what you've described as Coples position
sounds like a very interesting one to me
to have a clear statement that torture
is unlawful that is which which happens
to be the state of law in the United
States and the state of international
law this is unkind illegal
unconstitutional and they're also
statutes that that require that and and
I think that's a very good idea and then
bringing full mindfulness to each
individual situation is the effective
way not to create a new general rule
that certain kinds of torture are all
right that well waterboarding is all
right but we'll look case-by-case and if
there is actually a case where there's a
ticking time bomb in the New York subway
system and Grand Central Station well
then maybe some people who are who are
interrogating a suspect with actual
knowledge of that bomb might violate the
law and we have enough we have again
enough interspecies enough vagueness in
our law and doctrine or specifically the
presidential pardon power so that we can
handle that situation still keep our
clear statement of legal principle and
rely on
our sense of appropriateness and empathy
in deciding whether a particular case of
a particular case a torturer should be
punished and what I like about this is
that in in the response to both your
questions is we are radically better off
if we have people in the system who are
grounded in mind from us who are
practicing wisdom yeah it seems like
what I gather from your answer is that
you're never going to be able to write
enough laws to make things black and
white every situation and we don't write
laws that way anyway and i forgot the
second point I was go back so I left
I'll leave it okay thank you
okay if they are no other questions I
have the last question so my question is
do you have any insight into how barack
obama became den mindful well I don't
have any first-hand knowledge I I do
have a little first-hand knowledge that
he is that mindful how he became that
way it's there's enough in the public
record to suggest some of the answers to
that question and I've suggested some
already one is this unusual growing up
he had which forced him to look inside
himself forced him to develop all the
resources he could find because it was
said it was a very difficult situation
being the only you know one of five
black kids in his high school in Hawaii
being confronted with the situation that
he faced in Indonesia he had to do this
in her work in order to survive and
thrive as he did so that is part of it
then I think the choices he made have
helped him to cultivate wisdom like that
like his choice to go into a civil
rights law practice in Chicago making
enormous sacrifices in terms of finances
I think too that he helped to put
himself further along the wisdom path by
the choices he made in leading a life in
balance one of the things that I find
very moving is to see the way he is with
his wife and children this is and I I
think this is this is deep and sincere
and I'm very touched by the fact that
during this unbelievable marathon
campaign that he ran for two years he
was able to really show up for his kids
and that that was extremely important to
him those choices are both a product of
wisdom and also help promote and develop
wisdom whether he has an actual sitting
mindful prac- practice I don't know a
one one other point and that is his
understanding of his religion
is at once very Christian and very
deeply grounded in mindfulness he gave a
wonderful interview to a Chicago
newspaper about six years ago when he
was first running for the Senate in
which he talks about his religion and he
has a sense of looking inward and having
a kind of dialogue with his inner wisdom
who which he calls God that you would
find very familiar because it is so much
the kind of deep dialogue that you have
embedded in your your course search
inside yourself so the evidence is there
that he both has connected with a deep
wisdom and that his connection and his
continuing choices continue to deepen it
