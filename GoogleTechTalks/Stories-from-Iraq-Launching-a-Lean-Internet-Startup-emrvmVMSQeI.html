for inviting us and being interested in
what we have to discuss here a little
background information I myself am NOT
from Iraq even if it might look like
that but I worked for the German
Development Corporation as an external
consultant and we basically started a
project in Iraq which was supposed to
help develop the Iraqi private sector
which is very weak after the war there
were no private businesses really so we
work in different segments like
automotive IT and so on and my colleague
mohammed el samurai and i we work
specifically in IT so our job was kind
of like to do an assessment to see
where's Iraq right now regarding IT
where can it go is there potential is
there interest and at the end basically
our conclusion was after three months ok
the sector is still quite weak it's
still quite young but there's a lot of
potential so what we decided on together
with the German government to set a
program which focuses on facilitating
entrepreneurship that's where I'm at
Ibrahim for example with initiatives
such as the Startup Weekend or also the
innovation competition which we
conducted so when we actually started
this innovation competition one of the
major issues that we saw is people or
students were just lacking this mindset
of going out there doing your own
business starting your own projects and
just pushing your ideas forward so we
actually decided on getting a couple of
trainers from Germany that would show
them a little bit ok what let's say
state of the art methods are there from
Silicon Valley or so that you could use
to facilitate creativity to capture your
ideas and basically to turn this into
business and one of the biggest issues
there when we trained them was that we
talked about Facebook we obviously
talked a lot about Google too but people
couldn't really relate to that they're
like okay this is Iraq man we really
this is too far away so we actually
thought about its what could we do to to
ease this transition and that's when we
sat together like Ralph Magnus from
Berlin Christophe Muhammad and myself
and to others is that okay there's
actually a really large demand growing
in in food delivery meaning a lot of
people are certain cultures
developing towards ordering a lot of
food from outside but the main issue is
right now the way it works is someone
would call okay listen I live around
between that hotel this pharmacy and
that's kind of how it works and they
keep calling you and takes you on
average like an hour or two to get your
food and it's cold so that's a real big
pain point for the people there and at
the same time I think the brahim already
said it we operate in the north of Iraq
which is also considered the Kurdistan
Region of Iraq and it's a little
different from the South currently it's
a lot more stable the security situation
is a lot more let's say stable also and
better so things such as internet
penetration up there are a lot higher
than they are in the south so we're
talking about forty percent in Krita
stun quit a sudden Iraq just some
background information Iraq has about 33
million inhabitants in the Kurdish area
we have about five point five so the
this brings me more or less to our
elevator pitch easy bytes is more or
less an internet startup which focuses
on providing location-based delivery
services to the local community at start
or at first now we're focusing on the
let's say the Cordish part of Iraq
simply because that's like our test
market it's secure it's more stable I
myself am allowed to travel everywhere
that just make think makes things a lot
easier the mid to long term objective is
obviously to scale this business model
take it to Baghdad I mean Baghdad has a
large potential itself it has sorry
Mohammed seven million inhabitants and a
lot of the problems that we're actually
solving here meaning not finding
addresses or not not being able to
choose your food and so on have a
totally different meaning in Baghdad
like Baghdad obviously you see the news
there a lot of explosions every day so
people were telling us hey you know what
this for aback that this has a totally
different meaning this actually means I
could stay at home and I don't have to
expose myself to the threat of bombs and
I would get the food to my house so
we're totally talking about it totally
let's say different value proposition
that we're working on there so regarding
the just we don't really want to engage
into an hour presentation and bore all
of you so our idea is to highlight some
business acts aspects of how we operate
what our idea was what we've gone
through then go a little bit into
techie part ruff will cover that and
after that just scoop into discussion
that's okay with all of you so business
aspects I know most of you probably know
Eric Eric Ries work the Lean Startup
maybe you've heard of it you've not
heard of it it basically if you want to
summarize it for us it has a fundamental
meaning because the idea is basically
just that you say okay startups are
totally different from established
enterprises or companies because you
don't know the market you don't know if
the product is going to work and so on
so basically all you have is a
conglomerate or a long list of
assumptions and your goal should not be
to to make money right away well it
should be but you should actually focus
on generating a lot of learnings you
want to try to turn all of these
assumptions that you have into learnings
because only then you know okay now I
can scale my business model now I can
invest all my millions or billions into
marketing and I would actually have an
effect so the principle is like that
where we were guided by most of all I
would say is this thing that Eric Ries
proposes it's like a cycle a scientific
cycle meaning you have an idea let's say
for us for example it was a food
delivery service
so you would build something that people
could actually understand the idea so
for us that would be we call it a
Minimum Viable Product meaning it could
be a video it could be a cartoon where
somebody just gets the business idea
what exactly is this about and after
that you try to measure okay and how far
is this interesting to people so what we
did we basically pasted place this this
digital MVP in a video on a website and
told people hey you know what if you're
interested pre-register for free beta
and they kind of gave it us the feedback
is this actually something the local
community wants or not after that
obviously going back to this build
measure learn you would you would then
see okay this actually makes sense and
then you start building around it and
then you go into the next phase you
actually have a tangible product and
meaning you try everything on a smaller
scale and then you kind of scale it
after that let's see from a development
standpoint of view or what Ralph will
also be emphasizing later we really try
to focus on small batches
like we didn't have this large super
master plan which we started
implementing and at the end everything
was great it was actually more like we
had an idea and we try to keep really
let's say timewise really small
iterations started delivering very small
components first I think Ralph will give
you some insights for example we don't
have addresses in Iraq right so how do
we work around that so what we did is we
did like a tagging competition we
basically said hey first first winner is
gonna get like a galaxy or so so people
were all like typed and we said all you
got to do is we programmed this little
app you just go to hotels to restaurants
and so on it checks your location like
Google Maps and you just create tags
meaning for example hotel or whatever
you been up with the benefit for us is
we're aggregating a lot of data which is
currently not not there and this data
can then be used subsequently in
delivery processes to see ok the
delivery guy doesn't have to call the
customer and be an inconvenience he
actually sees straightaway ok this is
where the guy lives makes it a lot
easier yeah basically most of the
principles you see here are agile
guidelines like deliver and ship early
and continuously one very important
aspect I would say is also simplicity
like Iraq or developing countries in
general are just have really large
challenges with that we wouldn't find
here like for example physical addresses
for example also dealing with people
that are just like for this is actually
a very good example most Iraqis that I
that I've met they know how to use
Facebook and they know how to use Google
but just to find Facebook so meaning
they basically use the Google search
engine bar to type in Facebook and then
they click it if you ask them to use it
in any other context well it's kind of
overwhelming so talking about apps all
they know is the Facebook app so in the
start we try to come up with a really
intuitive own app and we realize this is
not working out so at this stage you'll
probably recognize a lot of similarities
between our design because their
interface design and Facebook's just
simply because we got to work with
something they know and they feel
comfortable with and they want to engage
in right well that's why simplicity
right even if a lot of other things that
we've been working
for us we're a lot more intuitive but
there's that I'm gonna skip to a little
bit about this product market fit now
one of the lean startup let's say
fundamentals is also that you you don't
use you can use business plans at some
point but it basically tries to capture
everything about your business on one
sheet like this is what you'll see later
it's very small so I think I'll have to
read out a lot the fundamental part of
this is that the Lean Startup method or
model basically suggests that okay you
have an idea and in this idea this value
proposition fits a certain customer
segment like for example maybe the pain
points or the pain that some Iraqis have
regarding delivery services might not be
the same as people have here in Europe
so you're trying to achieve this thing
called product market fit it's always
building something getting the feedback
from the users and adapting and this is
a cycle which is ongoing and something
that we just try to highlight here in a
timeline for example at the beginning I
explained we did this this MVP this
digital cartoon that we put online to
get some feedback another part was the
tagging campaign where we basically saw
okay our people actually interested in
the product itself and how far are they
willing and able to engage with such an
app another point was the what we
realized with restaurants especially
that in what it doesn't make sense just
to for them to define a delivery radius
around their location like if we take a
look at the city of Erbil or Baghdad or
Sulaymaniyah
there are just places that are a lot
easier to access than others that's for
example a hard infrastructure that kind
of let's say impedes making things a lot
more easy and flexible for you so what
we have to come up with at that point
where at some point was then okay
people don't just define a delivery rate
is down around their restaurant but they
can actually define different points
around the city which are a lot more
let's say accessible which obviously for
them also means that they now can define
okay when is something economically
feasible or profitable for me and we're
not because you
she would just say I'm gonna deliver
around the whole city well your delivery
guy might be gone for two days so yeah
just guiding around going through this
timeline obviously uh other issues that
we had and I talked about this is that
we had an interface at the beginning in
UI which was for most Europeans because
we test it with Europeans a lot at the
beginning was totally intuitive but the
Iraqis they kind of like we measure it
through Google Analytics and so on where
people would actually bounce off and we
realize okay they actually bounce off on
the first stage of the order of powered
so we redesigned everything aligned it
towards Facebook and that just really
blew our mind because after that we had
really a bounce off rate of maybe 10%
and it was about 90 before so we're kind
of like turning the whole story around
what we're working with now like this is
I think very interesting for you to know
we only started in December and it is
March now we launched the actual app in
February and the tagging campaign in
January so we're very young we're still
learning a lot and issues such as the
absence of physical addresses are still
continuously impediments to for us to
actually improve the service to make it
better to make it more feasible for the
restaurants to deliver and so on but for
example our first stage was to work with
these reference locations meaning the
hotels so the delivery guy sees on the
map okay listen this is where the hotel
is is where our customers in the second
stage
most of you probably know a TripAdvisor
where you have this compass and it kind
of like shows you the direction or gate
four hundred meters and kind of shows
you the direction where you have to go
we're working on an implementation of
that it's second step mmm and it's in a
third step what we're actually doing
with the local government about 15 years
back since then every house was given a
unique code and this code basically had
the first three digits which which were
more or less a sector the men there
another sorry Mohammed two digits for
the street and the rest is for the house
number the funny part is nobody's really
using that I can't explain why the only
thing I've heard that ten years ago
people
she got their magazines that way if you
look at the Postal Service today well
it's just one building and you go there
once in a while to see if there's a
package or something which is highly
inefficient obviously so we are still in
definitely learning a lot in this regard
and I think in that direction with this
code in the future we'll be able to
achieve a lot I'm just gonna briefly
explain the business model now obviously
what we do is we go out there and we
talk to restaurants we talk to
restaurants typically those that would
have already established in the delivery
service right now because that's just
the easiest you don't want to convince
them might take some time and one of the
biggest issues that they obviously have
because in Iraq aside from restaurants
you don't really have a lot there are no
nightclubs bars okay there are some bars
but it's just a food culture so it's all
about food so a lot of restaurants are
obviously reached their capacity limit
meaning they have a certain amount of
seats and they're just booked so they
actually see the delivery service as an
opportunity of scaling their business of
growing their business without having to
make a substantial investment into new
physical infrastructure and that's where
we basically come and come into place
and we convinced them that okay listen
this is something that you could use
test it for free so at this stage we are
operating an area of Scilly and we have
around seven restaurants in each city
what we're growing there for the users
what we're basically offering is a
location-based service very obvious they
turn on their smartphone they see which
restaurant is in there delivery at
radius they browse through the menus
place their orders and get their food do
you think it's very straightforward what
might be interesting for you is like
more like the revenue model how exactly
are we making money on this there - we
had to learn a lot like in Europe
obviously Commission is something very
common first time I walked into a
restaurant I told the guy hey listen
let's work this with Commission he's
like are you crazy you don't ask that
here so he was totally offended so after
that I was like okay what's your
proposal he's like okay we can agree on
a fixed fee per order so right now we
are we charging
like $1 per order and everyone's happy
and everyone's it's just a difference a
cultural difference basically localizing
the business - what exactly is suitable
to the region okay yes the thing can
actually show you this on average
restaurants have around a hundred like
the larger restaurants have 150 to 200
orders a day so we would say right now
we have in each city we have out one
large restaurant then we have about
three medium-sized restaurants and the
rest is small/medium is anything between
50 and 100 orders small is anything
between zero and let's say fifty zero
wouldn't make too much sense obviously
but if you if you think about it
it's basically something it's not going
to be anything that in this Cordes town
region you would be making a lot of
money per order it's actually that it's
a volume based business to be totally
honest and if you aggregate it up right
now we are already so yeah got it okay
where maybe ad per day you would get
with the restaurants we have you could
probably achieve Iran mm maybe three
thousand orders and we are only covering
14 restaurants that's a question of
scaling that right there are a lot more
restaurants a question is also taking a
look at large cities as for example
Baghdad I think the potential is is
there but it's a volume based business
you're not going to make a couple of
let's say 1020 hundred dollars on every
transaction
right now we're covering Erbil and
Sulaymaniyah we're planning or we had
people approaches from Baghdad
especially from Basra - and some other
cities like like Mosul and and Kirkuk
and such yes
so generally we we we kind of like
calculated the total available market
which obviously means this is the whole
pie just in cordis done right now which
we estimate annually to be about seven
seven point eight million a year yeah
the way we calculate we'll probably try
to send around the slides if that's
possible through ibrahim biggest issue
in iraq is there's no real data meaning
i'll give you an example like a week ago
i was trying to find out okay what
exactly is the internet penetration in
kurdistan and this what you got to know
whether there's really monopoly
regarding the provision of internet
services so for example in Krita
Stander's one company called naruse
telecom and a CEO made a really really
contradictory statement was something
like okay so in an entire iraq we have
an internet penetration I think of five
percent but that is only due to CUDA
Stan and Kurdistan has only an internet
penetration of eight percent and we here
in Baghdad have two percent basically
the numbers don't add up at all because
I I reversed basically a
reverse-engineer the numbers and I came
up with well based on what he was saying
they at least need an internet
penetration of 50 percent and could have
done based on a population right so
that's that's what we're working with
right we know one thing for a fact and
that's that's very interesting for our
business especially is that the
government actually measures its
internet penetration right now by the
number of Facebook registrations in the
country which is totally it's funny at
the same time it's kind of creative
because you have no other method of
doing that right especially because the
large corporations they're not really
published I think a lot of data because
because of tax reasons and Sonya I think
you get the picture
so the question there is we still have a
really large growing market regarding
the internet penetration what we also
have and this is comparing it to Germany
a real plus for us take a look at the
demographics like nearly 50 percent of
no sorry nearly 70 percent of the Iraqi
population is between 0 and 34 which is
which is a lot which is really a lot
meaning we have a lot of potential
actually that is
be coming up here in the next couple of
years if you combine that with let's say
the internet penetration which is also
growing like crazy
I think our potential market target
market is growing in total so I would
like to and thus over the to Ralph we'll
give you some technical insights and how
we try to involve some locals - yeah
thank you very much can you okay so I
think Oliver has said so much so there's
nothing left any questions no okay
start talking I want just to come back
to to this slide we always have to have
in mind that we're talking about
delivery delivery about two months from
the first idea when I met Ollie first in
Ariel then we go to implement the first
prototype only for the taking campaign
and then we extend it in each increment
application so for us it was a good
experience this project to test our
agile approaches so we really
implemented only the same only the
features that are necessary for each
increment of our application so the
change that is always there software
engineering project vision comes from
serial sources in our project the first
thing is that we already always had
running several instances of our
application we had demo instance for
testing all new features we have a
staging system for our partners to get
trained to work with our system then we
have the live system and we see on the
Left we do all the automatic testing and
so on and we get so the necessary
feedback from our test Suites
what we have to adapt to have a
functional system to have all
features implemented in the right way
then we had big feedback from our
observations or from our local staff in
Erbil and Sulaymaniyah that face to face
with our partners the restaurants they
installed the system and explained his
system how to use it and this gives us
very valuable feedback for us it was I
think one of the most important channel
team and the third channel was the
social Channel so mainly it's a Facebook
where we had all our campaigns and gets
a user feedback and all these we had to
handle on the level of our application
so we had to react very fast to involve
also the people at the place so if we
get feedback so they saw that the
feedback is taken seriously that we
adapt to futures their ideas recommends
so in January was able to adapt and
implement features and requests and so
on within one day to maximum 14 days
well 14 days was never I would say one
day - when we were able to implement all
changes that happened in these two and a
half months just some examples that
small changes and small learnings that
we have done in this time for example in
the beginning in the beginning there was
a big issue with some kind of operating
system in a very special version that
brings for us
YouTube's problem when we saw or one of
our test suite and test environments
made this visible that in this version
if you create a full-screen home link of
this application that gear location is
not
it's only triggered once and if you
start to happen then it's not working
anymore
so saying got it figured out this in the
beginning before the user started to use
our application because if they want to
go around and to take and to take and
for us these tags are very useful and we
want to have them there for you to value
for us it would have been disaster if
they wouldn't be able to take yeah
because we have measured that nearly
nineteen ninety percent are using iPhone
this time was at version of the
operating system so we were able to
handle this in a way that we have some
operating system detection that detects
a version that allows to create a home
link or not second thing that comes from
the observation from our partners Oliver
already has mentioned this was that in
the beginning we had the prototype
developed like each restaurant can
define a specific radius for the
delivery but we well first saw that this
is not sufficient for our partners so
they needs a possibility to create civil
independent service zones with different
charging and so on so this was a very
important observation from our partners
that we also can or could implement very
fast and the observation that comes from
social channels as well as from Google
Analytics where we observed the flow of
the visitors was that we simply had to
simplify the ordering and delivery
process as much as possible so that it's
really straightforward just three clicks
to get your food and not options here
and at pepperoni here and so on just a
basic menu and left out everything so we
had implemented everything we would be
able to do all this but we had to leave
it out maybe later next year or whenever
the users can adaptors
so or what I have said is also reflected
in the way we deployed our application
we had similar branches and instances
running on the Left we have development
branch where Christopher and me are
putting all our new ideas and whatever
seems to make sense goes into a demo
server where the local stuff can test it
and can give us feedback and in the same
time we had the localization branch
where we had the local stuff the local
is about stuff that is directly involved
in translating everything in time so
that each new feature before it comes to
the live system is completely localized
we included this localization directly
in the application so it could be done
in app and here's a version 0.2 we had a
staging server where we trained all the
restaurants before they go in life that
they we can ensure that they are able to
handle the system that they know what to
do if there's a delivery dressed and so
on from the current version there's
training models integrated in the life
server where we can switch restaurant
from training models to live models so
no need anymore to me great restaurants
from staging to life just switching you
know you can see wherever this is a
triangle there was automatic test
execution of our test suite so whenever
we committed a feature it has to pass a
test suite so beside that we have this
very short period of time
we always took care about quality and
try to follow test-driven development
here yeah
let's pose a deployment Christophe will
give some additional information
regarding the quality assurance and
architecture that we have chosen to
implement the system can you view me
like this okay
so just I will do it very quick so you
already told us that we try to develop
the application very fast and quickly
changing payments and that's why we push
me testing you see a small screenshot of
our tests test in coverage and from the
beginning on we try to to have a good
coverage of course but due to the time
constraints and to the very limited
manpower we have we are not yet at 100%
and each controlling that we trying to
achieve
okay so that's screenshot from PHP unit
then you have a mobile application and I
just want to say a few words about the
special aspects we have to cover there
this is a simplified overview of our
vacation architecture what you see is
that we have we use a symphony back-end
on the server which delivers mainly
html5 code for Cameron HTML but we also
use a we can also deliver JSON data in
certain circumstances where it's very
important that we have a good that we
have small data that we can get a good
performance then we used a lot of
JavaScript libraries so standard library
javascript and to have unique or a
constant consistent look and feel mobile
look and feel on every platform we use
Java prairie jQuery Mobile and of course
we used Google Maps a lot and a few
others then we wrote a lot of JavaScript
custom JavaScript code on our own and to
have a glue of other thing of everything
so everything fits together we use
require as body location so this is a
lot of content and we try to keep it
keep the size of data it needs to be
transferred very small so we use we use
separation of the content to static and
dynamic content and use cookie-less
domain for the static content and we try
to compress everything and deliver it to
the browsers that support support
compression of content and next is some
creatures waited for it
on the right side you see on the the
text it was the only one to talk about
texted we were collected by the our
users
that's Superman your city and we try to
use these checks
wherever we're up wherever possible on
the left side or the middle screenshot
you can see with one example of this
where we use it in the screen where dude
restaurant administrator can create
service loans for restaurant and this is
mainly for orientation but also for
creating the service zones to get you
nowhere and we reuse these texts in one
of other places when you own the fusion
then for the deliverer and on the left
Mouse screenshot you see one of their
our restaurant partners that's the
restaurant and menu and what you can see
here is also that mainly is the use
mobile here too because we have a lot of
information to show on small screens so
we use their for example collapsibles or
you see so you can click on the food
category and then it opens up all the
food there and then you click on it and
the day you can add different food items
and everything is in one screen you
don't have to switch around pages
something so everything's on one thing
and it fits really good at you into a
smart phone yeah so I've already
mentioned the task of localization and
of providing the whole application also
an Arabic language so in the beginning
we started or if you want to do that
wanted to do the tagging campaign we
really had only two and a half a week to
start to implement application to make
the users able to go around the city and
take important places so it was a short
time so there for the localization we
simply have the text file that we sent
to our colleagues in Kurdistan and then
we get it back so but obviously this is
not managed to build for from
application it grows and grows and has
to meet a lot of changes so we decided
to have a localization back-end and the
screenshot is just depicting this fact
so we see the application in English and
then the Arabic and you can also use
application on the desktop for example
here for do the localization so the
process of localization is totally
embedded in the application you can log
in as translator and during the
deployment all the localization or
translatable strings I extracted and
provided in this interface that
automatically saves as you type all the
necessary translations so this is just
one example how we integrate the
workflow with the local stuff and
as in Berlin so and from this
translation all translations are pulled
from git repositories to all different
branches so that we have a consistent
environment at least regarding the
translation and localization just to
give a little Outlook what will happen
within the next weeks and months and
let's have a look at works so already
all Oliver Oliver already mentioned that
we want to implement something like a
compass why we want to do this because
the easy texts are very good to overcome
in the beginning the situation with lack
of physical addresses but they are not
so accurate so for the first it's good
to come near to the user or to the
customer who is all that our food but so
the last meter so the last 100 meters
and important to find the customer and
you want to implement such a compass
whereas delivery-boy can see which
direction he has to go to find the
customer and it should be very easy
without maps without street names just
too during driving you should be able to
look there and not to read there and
drive in this direction against the wall
you should be able to have a quick look
where to go and there we also want to
reuse the text that we have collected so
that not only the user is displayed or
not only the customers displayed but
also texts that are nearby that can help
delivery boy to orient to get an
orientation of ways where he has to go
so right off Kenyan hotel for now then
one other thing is of course we want to
allow the restaurants to customize the
menus to give it a unique look and feel
and maybe later to run independent
instances of easy
and but one of our main focuses is
really to extend the work with the text
to extend to overcome the absence of
physical addresses to find different
approaches to provide good orientation
and we have many ideas and we're
currently working on this we're doing
research on this in cooperation with the
government and so on
so there will come a lot of new changes
in the next week's for us and what we
are looking forward for the changes
because we are prepared with our
architecture and with the application
design so this is I think the most
important things that we will do in the
next weeks month we have collected some
facts maybe where we can talk about it
sums up everything a little bit which
technologies we have used what we have
integrated which services we are using
and so all I think that's all that you
want to say short introduction I think
everything else we can do yeah it wasn't
that short sorry about that
obviously we couldn't give you guys a
the whole picture like there's a lot
missing like we have a feedback system
where you rate your order but it's all
very basic and but uh anyone have any
questions
oh can we hand this around or how do you
want to do it okay
okay so the question was whether we have
a sense of what devices mobile devices
are currently being used and if also the
application is accessed via desktop
computers remember right at the
beginning I told you something about
this MVP where we place it on the
website this cartoon when people signed
up we asked them to they could choose
like four different categories are using
Android I using iOS I using Windows
Mobile and so on so there we aggregated
a lot of data and back then our question
was are we going native
or are we not going native and I know
Ralph had said something about the
iPhone being very let's say present but
that was the first impression after like
we had that running for like two or
three weeks we saw there was a balance
between Android and iPhone and once in a
while you had Windows Mobile and
Blackberry slip in there so I'd say
right now right now we have about 40%
iPhone 40% Android and 10:10 windows and
Blackberry regarding desktop it's
actually funny that you're asking
because we have measured over the last
two weeks that basically when the system
cannot position you we had a fallback
meaning because where it's where's it
supposed to deliver the things to we
realized that a lot of people weren't
using this fallback meaning a lot of
people were getting this message that
they couldn't be located so we tracked
this back and people were using it to
their desktop which was also part of it
but the issue was that with the desktop
computers we kind of used wireless LAN
to position them and the problem with
with Google Chrome but also with other
browsers obviously that you got like a
little pop up to allow it and people
don't really read it so they're just
stuck there and so they close their
browser at some time and just order by a
phone so that's something that we need
to work on too but that's definitely
those two channels are the restaurant
has its own view I think you sub parts
of it it basically most of them use a
point of sales and in Iraq I
like 95% run on Windows so but it
doesn't really matter for us we open up
a little browser window next to it and I
don't know if Roth can simulate it
they basically whenever an order comes
in they get this really really annoying
sound which keeps going until you read
the order so that's how it works on
their end okay no it's not integrated to
the point-of-sale because it's just so
heterogeneous people are using own
systems and so on that's not not
feasible for us so they basically have a
manager interface and they have an
approver interface the approver is
basically the cashier that sees the
orders and so on the manager has the
option of editing the menu and so on and
it's all on the app and ya know they
basically open it up on a desktop
computer and yeah I think ruff can just
show you while I'm talking yeah I'll
just keep talking so ya you you're they
open up on their computer have a little
screen and they have the same view as
here just that they have a lot more
options of editing the menu deleting
orders setting delivery radiuses and so
on you could say it you could say like
that yes
but the issue is like the way they
operate right now is someone approves
the order and then they print out a
sheet of paper on that sheet of paper we
have like a zoomed in view of the
location where it's going to and a
zoomed out view so you see the tags that
are exactly next to the location and
some that like you know in a in a
different perspective because some
restaurants let's say maybe 80% of them
are like okay I'm not gonna give my
delivery guy a phone no way he's gonna
be gone so they're like okay what can
you offer us um you're like okay we can
work with this sheet of paper and that's
basically what we develop with them
together so they have a printer they
print out the thing the customer signs
it at the bottom and that's it
well if you think about the restaurants
oh sorry about that
so the question was is it an issue that
a lot of restaurant owners don't have
any computers right now the restaurants
we're targeting most of like really all
of them have a point of sales okay the
only issue is maybe the internet but
there's a thing called high max which is
basically something like 3G here for us
and they buy this little adapter pay $10
a month and that's it and it doesn't
take a lot of convincing on that side
and strategically for us and this is a
very important point for us this whole
thing has a large network effect like
two groups the users and the restaurants
like there are two or three restaurants
if you have them on board like a lot of
people join and a lot of restaurants
join and the restaurants joined if a lot
of people join and you know it's kind of
like a cycle and I think like about two
weeks ago we really broke that cycle
because there's a restaurant called b2b
which is in Erbil really everyone order
say they have like 200 or 300 deliveries
today meaning you tell another
restaurant a b2b is on it oh really okay
I'm in it too so that's basically how it
works and I think we got to that point
now also assisted the restaurants with
well the issue is also that and that was
training our sales team like the people
that go out we had limited resources so
you're gonna probably laugh if I tell
you that what we did is we got some
students that really liked the idea and
told them hey listen go around and start
asking restaurants hey why you're not
using this and basically go to the
restaurants and if you if you seal the
contract we'll give you 50% of all
revenue for the next six months which is
achieved through that and that's kind of
working wonders because we have really
limited capacity regarding our resources
it's working around it and one of the
main things training them and so maybe
also a cultural aspect is that we don't
even show the people to manager
interface we go there first and even
while they're using it we just show them
the
over interface the first putting in the
menu of the first time we do it because
they're just going to be so offer
overwhelmed by the complexity no I don't
know so right now it's like three
buttons we tell them hey listen exactly
three clicks and you got your order and
they're all totally happy then they come
after us that's that's actually what has
been happening they come to asking us
hey is there something to edit the menu
and we're like yeah there's this and
this all really and there's reporting
too great so that's basically it it
comes from their side and at their pace
and that makes it a lot easier for us to
go along
okay so I'm gonna well first thing
cash-on-delivery
the question was do we have cash and are
we doing cash on delivery yeah there are
no mobile payments for whatever reason a
lot of conspiracy theories there but uh
let's not go into that the second
question was whether there's a trust
issue within the local community I think
I was there since July and monitoring
what's been happening in Erbil and
slowly especially regarding the
engagement of technology in day to day
life they're really opening up towards
that and like I said a lot of people are
already using the phone to order a food
and that the amount of those people is
actually increasing and if if we take a
look at our really our primary customer
segments at the beginning it was really
focused on students well obviously you
like to engage with new technologies but
at this stage now it's it's a lot of
private sector employees like companies
like big telecom telco providers like
correc or so where they're just sitting
in their cubicles and the order their
lunch and for them it's just amazing
it's their highlight of the day just
using the app to order something you
know because the right yeah they're
already using a via phone and they're
really annoyed by that process so within
our marketing campaign and that that
really I think that's the feedback we
got it was a really important factor is
we put like at the beginning made on
Germany everywhere and and they're like
okay yeah which Germany sounds good we
trust Germany all right so that kind of
made a big difference too yeah so it's a
quite a question of how you position
yourself in the market I think it's very
sensitive to this yes
how do we handle the quality
expectations now like I said we couldn't
show you the whole picture what
basically happens after you're done
ordering and I hope I don't know if it's
actually working okay
and the delivery guy went back to his
restaurant I say okay the the order was
delivered you would get like like a
pop-up screen next time you log in and
you have to rate the delivery service
regarding time regarding food quality
and service quality this feedback always
goes back to let's see to us first but
also to the restaurants on a regular
basis for numerous reasons we believe
that it's a point we have definitely
considered that bad service regarding
the restaurant will reflect negative
upon us so we have a responsibility of
engaging there I'll just give you one
example of how we would engage like a
lot of restaurants at the beginning
we're like you know what I'm gonna take
entire Erbil as delivery radius and I'm
like for me with my car and let's say
not rush hour I would it would still
take me over an hour to get there and
food will be cold and so on so what we
try to do is we actually issue
recommendations then if we see that the
delivery time is let's say really a lot
more than average we would go there and
tell them hey listen the way you define
your service owns it's just not working
out and I think we have the leverage
there to be honest yes of course yeah
it's a mix like two interactive
components that we have the first thing
is on every order you place as a
customer you can put in notes which are
retrieved by the restaurant okay and the
restaurant obviously can reject your
order approve your order but it always
has the option of let's say responding
it's kind of like integrated chat if you
want okay that's one interact component
where you have some human components if
you want so the second part is we do
display the restaurant telephone number
yeah the third point is also that what
we try to monitor very closely is how
many orders have failed what were the
reasons why they filled we also try to
monitor very closely this this dialogue
between the people like if her order was
rejected why was it rejected but these
are obviously issues that really become
very let's say critical when we scale
when we grow and yes we haven't reached
that point yet and I hope we do reach it
at some point because that would be good
one addition to this is that we also
track if the restaurants are using the
application when they are intended to
use it so they can set up constraints of
opening hours and we can monitor if
they're really having opened this site
on the Left where you see the incoming
orders here if they are offline when
they should be open Oliver and Kristoff
and moment will get on email and moment
has to call them and say hello switch on
your computer you guys should work
actually you're laughing it actually
happens and they're like how do you know
well you hacked them to my computer or
something no so yeah we we are putting
and it's it's an evolving process like
we didn't have all of this from the
start it actually happened I ordered one
day and then nothing happened and he's
like okay let's implement this
cultural terms I guess I don't want to
offend anyone so I gotta be careful how
I say it
okay if we take a look let's say the
average order volume okay like the
minimum order value of most let's say
restaurants is about 10 to 12 dollars
okay and for them it's obviously I think
it's an economic motive they basically
see okay
no matter what we do we are providing
the same service so why would why would
we get be getting more money if
someone's ordering more that's that's
their perspective I think it's cultural
at the same time it's also practical
because if you take a look at it
culturally usually it's families family
it's the normal household size would be
about five to six people right so it
wouldn't just be one person ordering it
would be a person ordering for five
people so we're talking of orders of 50
or $60 so for them they're basically
saying okay so you're not doing a lot
more when some one person is ordering or
five person people are ordering so I
just want to stick with this fixed fee
of the minimum amount which is let's say
on average one dollar exactly yeah you
want to run another competition with us
that's cool even sponsor like Nexus ones
or so no so what was his design of the
competition well obviously what we did
is people didn't even know what tagging
was so we invested a lot of time in
educating people in that regard
Facebook is a very popular channel it's
probably one of the only channels that
you can use to target the audience that
we were trying to target so what we did
during the set up we said we're going to
focus on Suleymaniye and Erbil because
there's no use in just
tagging and not validating the data so
we had a couple of students who are kind
of like freelancers who are looking into
the tag saying does this make sense is
this realistic and they would then
approve the tags okay because that was
also an adjustment that we had the first
couple of tags we had like the first day
one person who did like I think 150 tags
so I'm like oh this is going like crazy
and then we realized she was tagging
everything from our house so and so we
were kind of like really adjusting that
and he fixed basically fixed that you
can tag things in a certain radius and
so on so it's an evolving
blitzie process in total we ran the
campaign I think about five weeks in
total we have accumulated in Sully about
350 tags I think and ever be a little
less or 200 and they're little wide
scattered so we're kind of lucky there
what's up until now like if you guys
have used for it sure I'm saying that
but we invested some money into it so I
think we're open-minded but right now it
is private but again if there's use
definitely we're open for discussions
we're not we have data on mobile phone
penetration I'll give you that first and
it's gonna stun you because it's 90% in
whole Iraq but then you have to look at
and this is again this is more like a
qualitative assessment that I can give
you going around and tell you what I've
seen is that especially in the target
segment that we're focusing on let's say
18 to 35 year olds all the people are
using smartphones yeah especially in the
Kurdish region and we also have people
let's say that come from Baghdad that
see Baghdad and I hardly like anyone
that has like a cheap old Nokia phone in
that age group always has his iPhone
along and this culture is basically all
about logging into Facebook at every
location that you go to it's it's cool
but it's different from here right so
what we can say on that
right now is we have no hard data on
that but we basically it's more based on
our qualitative assumptions that along
with the internet penetration a lot of
it is mobile and I think a next step for
us to narrow that down would also be to
see in how far the internet penetration
which is already measured through
Facebook is to see and how far is it
also being used mobile I'll give that to
my right now we sit there and pray all
the day now we're running some
monitoring services of course at
notifying us when something happens so
we have several instances running of
this service but only one is enough for
the live system result for testing and
for localization for now we have no
redundancy but this will change if there
will be some money and we have the
ability to invest a little bit more on
the infrastructure but for now it's
working well and we can react very fast
because so we have chance to maybe rate
within some minutes well up until now we
had a couple of local companies - that
showed interest in sponsoring this and
so on we're still bootstrapping because
like I said for us
ERG is our pilot market our goal is
actually to expand to Baghdad and so on
but if there are any options of let's
say acquiring funds in another way we
probably would do it but we haven't
gotten to the stage where we're actively
seeking seed funding or anything - let's
say to push this or boost the business
it's also we still feel that we're
really learning a lot like regarding the
changes just taking a look at the last
month's we're not at I mean you reach
the point where your learnings obviously
at the beginning of learning curve is
very steep at some point kind of
flattens and we have not completely
reached that point yet when we do and we
get let's our internal responsibilities
and all settled I think that's what at
the stage when we would start seeking
external funding totally we are used
currently one of the biggest issues from
the rest of from the restaurants point
of view was okay so this is internet and
people are ordering and couldn't people
just fake order and stuff so what we did
is when you register you have to give
your phone number and you get a code now
you're gonna laugh but we actually took
this from Eric least Lean Startup idea
we did it really manually we have
someone sitting there sending out text
messages your activation code so at some
point yes that's definitely something we
have to look into or want to look into
okay I think that when we start
integrating like SMS gateways and so on
that would be something that we could
approach them to obviously okay like I
said we had let's say platform we were
conducting these startup trainings and a
lot of things let's see in that
community our word-of-mouth is really
really really really big right so what
we did is in one of the trainings we did
like a test user acceptance test we
basically showed a video we have it here
too but which basically should explain
the idea of easy by it's kind of like
that Dropbox video you might have seen
it and we told people hey okay you know
what we're gonna post it on our face
book page if you like it sign up and
share it and that's how the whole thing
got started actually and the next stage
then was to build a website where we put
this MVP on and I think up until today
like for some Facebook and flyer
campaigns we spent maybe like thousand
five hundred dollars that was more like
from our own pockets like here and there
thank you maybe just I can just chose
this small use case I don't know I can't
remember why I wanted to show but maybe
it's interesting here on the left side
this is also enrolled has come up from
observations that but everything has to
be done by a privilege as we have just
one guy sitting there that the proofs
deliveries
can't hear Beth has very limited
possibilities and this button is also
one observation we have to have the
ability to switch off delivery
immediately if maybe the delivery guy
leaves for lunch or something unplanned
happens so this overrides the schedule
of opening hours so so what happens if I
place my put my position now to have you
in a location where we have delivery I
choose my category of desire and I
choose to order from this restaurant
what I get here is a menu where my son
loves pizza so I order some pizza let's
try chicken he like also one so and he
can give some information here you can
comment on this like because the
complexity of the whole process gets
more complicated if we have a shopping
cart so we kept it in this very easy
straightforward design where you see at
the bottom here you can just you just
have a listing of what you have and you
can cancel it out the cost is obviously
it's not as flexible but it keeps it in
a very very streamlined straight process
so now it's a customer orders it comes
off this nice sound and you see the
overview here of orders to cancel this
you have to go to the order and you get
overview including the customer notes
and telephone number to call the
customer something is out or do you want
to change something you can edit them if
something should be changed on request
of the user so then we had after one
month of implementing we had the list of
seven seven states that the delivery can
have it was very detailed and very cool
you can follow each statement this
totally failed because nobody is able to
handle this now we come up with two
States in progress are rejected so 30
minutes so the customer also has here
some information so submit it and the
customer here should automatically get
an updated information that it's in
progress so here we use our JSON
interface to pour status of the delivery
the cashier get something to print for
the delivery guy route and screenshot or
position very close the screen of the
position of the customer where you see
okay is close to this Texas this one
also takes it has been submitted by our
customers users and then he can sell it
to deliver it and the user now is
blocked for a new order until he has
rated the order so on this way we get a
feed bags as delivery has taken place
and we have to get our dollar from the
so as to gives this our observation is
that this actually is done when the user
wants to order new food three days later
yeah so it's never done immediately only
we have to wait three days and then it's
completed continue this process was
basically the way we changed he said we
had like a seven step process
it was really complex and just speaking
to the restaurant owners they're like I
don't get it and my cashier definitely
won't get it so what can you do to
reduce this and then we came up with
okay you know what it's just in progress
rejected and then after that you print
it out and it's delivered or delivered
failed and that has really served us a
lot because it has really reduced the
complexity of the whole application
because you can explain it to anyone and
in like five seconds and they get the
idea so maybe just two closes because it
was a question just take the role of the
manager of this restaurant that all that
right now and yeah the manager has a
possibility to maintain the whole menu
can reign to menu the categories the
options of different sizes he can define
for pizza and for dreams and so
everything can be done directly in the
application I think that's all in this
short time that we can present
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
