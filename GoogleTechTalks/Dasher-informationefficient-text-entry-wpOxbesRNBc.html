which is a piece of software for writing
efficiently it's based on information
theory and I'd like to start by just
describing to you how the dasher concept
was born I was sitting on the bus to
Denver Airport with my friend Michael
wiki ten years ago now and I got at my
PDA my scion which I still use its 14
years old man and he looked at this
thing in disgust and he said gee that
thing is so damn big and that set of
thinking okay why is this so damn big
well it's pretty clear it's partly
because of the size of the QWERTY
keyboard that it has so that set of
thinking how can we get rid of keyboards
how could we make a small writing system
where the hardware that you interact
with in order to write is perhaps just
the size of a button on your lapel so we
were imagining how would that work if
all you could do is touch something this
big how could you still write
efficiently and then we brainstormed a
bit more and we said well what if you
didn't even have one touch object to
touch what if all you had was a
head-mounted display and maybe the
display could track where you were
looking then how could writing work what
would be a new way of doing the problem
of writing with just a head-mounted
display before I describe this solution
we came up with I'd like to review some
alternative approaches to this problem
of communicating on miniature handheld
computers there's essentially two
metaphors for what writing is that
people tend to use when they do things
with computers one metaphor about
writing is a two-hundred-year-old
metaphor that says writing is pressing
buttons so if you want to miniature
writing device well you just reduce the
number of buttons and come up with some
new new system that still involves
pressing buttons or perhaps you press
multiple buttons at the same time
another metaphor for what writing is is
a ten-thousand-year-old metaphor that
says writing is scribbling with a stick
and so obviously if you want to screw on
a small computer you scribble in a small
way using graffiti or unit strokes and
there are other sensible ideas like word
completion and disambiguation but these
are all sticking with old ways of doing
things
and I'm a bit of a fundamentalist at
heart and my attitude is let's throw out
the old ways of doing things and let's
get back to basics and try and come up
with a completely new solution and as a
fundamentalist I say what's wrong with
keyboards why are they a bad idea from
the point of view of information theory
well keyboards are an efficient I'd say
for two reasons first keyboards don't
take advantage of the predictability of
normal writing if you're writing English
say Shannon's estimated that the actual
information content of English if you're
generating it is about one bit per
character in contrast if you've got a 64
key keyboard like this one here and you
press one of those 64 keys each time you
choose a key you could have been
conveying six bits of information
because 2 to the power 6 is 64 so
there's a factor of six in efficiency
there because keyboards don't do
language modeling of course they were
invented 200 years ago before we had
such things as language models the
second reason why keyboards are
inefficient is these things on the ends
of my hands we call them digits but
they're not actually digital devices
their analogues I've got 10 analogs each
one of them capable of high-precision
motor gestures and with a lot of fine
control and keyboards throw all that
away they all you can do is detect
whether a finger is up or down and
that's a big waste again have
information content it's been estimated
that just a single finger can generate
information at a rate of 14 bits per
second so here is the sort of fantasy
the theoretical motivation for what
we're doing in the dasher project let's
imagine solving both these problems were
somehow going to have a language model
in there so that the bits that a human
generates are turned into characters
efficiently and we're going to get as
many bits as possible out of a single
muscle maybe just one finger and if we
could plug one finger generating bits at
a rate of 14 bits per second into a
language model with the conversion rate
of one bit per character you would then
be writing at 14 characters per second
which would correspond to 170 words per
minute with just one finger so that's
the sort of the goal the ultimate
benchmark we like to achieve in this
project
and how do we go about this well we
steal from the best and in information
theory they already know how to do text
compression and text compression is sort
of an inverse process to writing in text
compression you put in text and out
comes a bit string and if it's a good
compressor the bit string is short
writing you make some sort of gesture
and outcomes text and an efficient
writing system is a system where you
make a brief gesture and outcomes lots
of text so there's a sort of analogy
here that writing is perhaps a bit like
back to front test compression so let's
steal from the very best and the very
best text compression method is an idea
called arithmetic coding in arithmetic
coding you put in text and a
probabilistic model for the language
that you're writing in and out comes a
binary string with a point in front of
it a binary point and you think of this
binary string is defining a real number
somewhere between zero and one and the
more bits get added the higher the
precision to which the real number has
been defined and alphabetic coding if
you don't know about it I can recommend
a text book that describes it is
available free online and probably by
the end of this talk you'll understand
dharmic arithmetic coding anyway because
dasha is just back to front arithmetic
coding you put in a gesture which is a
real value gesture that's defining a
real number to greater and greater
precision you use exactly the same
probabilistic model as is used in
state-of-the-art text compressors and
outcomes text so let me show you Dasher
right now and I'll write some sentences
for you and you maybe won't understand
what's going on then I'll explain and
you'll understand can everyone see these
characters okay would it be good if I
made them a bit bigger they okay great
good okay so let me write a sentence for
you I'll write anything can be written
and I'm doing this with one finger here
just moving the mass around
can be all right we'll be right I want
Russian yeah okay so there by moving my
mouse on my touchpad which is just this
big same size as a lapel I wrote a
sentence so what was going on here well
here's a new metaphor for what writing
is instead of writing is pressing
buttons or writing with scribbling with
a stick writing is navigating navigating
in the library of all possible books and
here on a single one dimensional shelf
from A to Z are all conceivable works
not just all books but all possible
books arranged in alphabetical order so
if i want to write hello there i can
navigate into the library of all
possible books and find the book that
contains exactly hello there and by
identifying that book by navigating i am
racking so to write hello there we go
into the h section of the library within
which are all the books from a che
through HD in alphabetical order but
what you'll notice the smart thing we're
doing is we're using a language model to
allocate more shelf space to the
probable characters after an H hahe hih
Oh are the most probable things that I'd
be wanting to write there is an HB
section HD an HD in between the h.a and
80 locations on the shelf but they're
small because it's improbable that I
would want to write something like HB I
go into the AG section you may notice we
have HEA through a cheesy this wide area
here this is the space character we put
that at the end of our alphabet by
convention in there sure so these are
the books that begin he he said he was
and so forth we want to write hello we
go into the atl section within which is
a very big HT ll section which we've now
entered these are the books that begin
with the word hell and a space but we
want to write hello and there's a nice
large o which we can zoom into and we
can then get space after that Oh
instantly in passing the next most
probable character after space in this
context hello is w because our language
model has heard of yellow and it thinks
well maybe hello yellow maybe there is a
word hello that's the sort of thing
that's going on in our in our language
models imagination so we write th e now
I don't want hello the so I don't want
to end up inside this white box I want
to go into the our section and that's
how we write hello there ok so how am i
doing this steering how am i moving
around in this this world this is the
tree of all books if you like well it's
just like driving a car we want it to be
very simple for people to learn and the
idea is you point where you want to go
so if i want to write is I point towards
is the distance from the center of the
screen is determining the speed at which
I'm moving if I want to go up I point up
if I want to go down I point down so
let's write easy to order right and
moving the mouse back into the center of
the screen slows everything down again
if I want to back up out of the library
I can point left and that's a way of
undoing what I've recently written and
then I can go in and write it again it's
just like driving a car when you drive a
car you point where you want to go your
instructor may have taught you to hold
the steering wheel like this but we
don't really hold it like this and that
when you will go left do you point left
and we want to go write your point right
ok so it's just like driving a car now
some people say oh hang on aren't you
clicking on things and dragging you know
isn't that the way we move things around
on computers you have to well it's just
like driving a car do you drive a car
like this click and click drag click
drag no moving things on a computer
doesn't have to involve clicking and
dragging and in-dash emphatically
there's no clicking or dragging you just
point and wherever you're pointing if
data is running then you're going in
that direction ok now some people say oh
hang on all this motion I don't like it
it's making me queasy again it's just
like driving a car if you go for a ride
with Ralf Schumacher and you're the
passenger he's the driver who gets sick
the passengers right and Ralph is fine
because he's the driver and he can
anticipate the motions and things that
are going to happen because he's in
control and the same is true here I'm
the driver you're the passengers you're
throwing up but don't worry about me I'm
fine and a fortunate feature of writing
is normally
so solar activity you don't take other
people along for right so the fact that
passengers don't but like it very much
doesn't actually matter so I'll go slow
for you I'm going at two bits per second
max and then here I can normally go at
four bits per second so you're getting a
factor of two compensation why is this a
good idea let me hyper why Dasher is a
great idea and and then I'll back it up
with some science experiments if you
want the first reason data is a good
idea is we're getting many characters
with a single gesture sometimes in
contrast to a regular keyboard where
every character requires you to make at
least one gesture if you're using a
standard keyboard sometimes you may need
to make two gestures for an uppercase
character for example in contrasting
Dasha if you've just written object then
with a little bit of swoosh you can get
objection or objective or object
oriented programming now when people see
Dasher they sometimes say well this is
just a word completion system what's the
big deal we've seen word completion
systems for ages you can get them on
pocket pcs and so on yes it looks like a
word completion system but there's an
important difference if you've got a
pocket pc and your pecking on the
miniature keyboard and you decide i am
going to use the word completion system
you have to make that decision you have
to stop pecking on the little keyboard
you have to make a change of cognitive
activity and go and look in the word
completion area and interact with the
device in a different way now you have
to search for the word that you want
with which is organized in a different
way from the way a keyboard works if
it's not there you know I've said dammit
make the change mode where did I get up
to in the word okay let's keep on going
and those changes of mode have a
cognitive cost in Dasha there are no
modes there is just using Dasha which is
interacting with the word completion
system and writing with data all at the
same time if the word completion system
that is data is doing a good job you'll
be writing fast if it's not doing a good
job if the predictions are poor for what
you are actually trying to do you still
write in exactly the same way it's still
writing with dasha you don't have to
make any change of mode you'll just be
going a bit slower a final reason why
dash
is a neat idea is inaccurate gestures
can be compensated by later gestures is
just like when we navigate if you
navigate from A to B you're making a
sequence of motor gestures to try and
get you from A to B and maybe one of the
motor gestures you make isn't quite the
motor gesture you exactly planned what
do you do then do you have to press some
backspace key and undo that gesture know
when we're navigating you just keep on
going and you modify your future motor
gestures to make up for the error that
you made a moment before so you're
perpetually correcting your errors and
adding in more gestures to keep you on
track to where you want to go and this
is true in dasha to that if i right
watch we right that's right in Dasha and
let's lose the D off the top of the
screen whoa come back let's lose data
off the bottom come back so just by a
little bit of extreme steering I can
make up for inaccurate earlier staring
ok here's another benefit of the dasher
attitude having said we're going to Bay
something in information theory we
instantly get a writing solution for
every language on the planet in contrast
to something like graffiti where you
have to invent how do you an A and Ruby
have you do see ok let's do Russian okay
how do we do or well as the Russian that
doesn't doesn't scale nicely dascha
straight away we can use it in any
language here is the hiragana alphabet
the phonetic alphabet of Japanese which
goes at you ok coo coo coo coo and so on
and I get back Dasher I can tell it i
want to write in hiragana and now i can
write how's your men rush today which
means hello there by going into ha angie
mae mushy which would be mushy tart up
here but i want my day which can
laughter so there's hajimemashita and
the only niggle in this particular demo
is this particular issue of ubuntu isn't
correctly combining the she character
with this diacritical mark here to give
us a she and hopefully that will be
fixed and they
next release of ubuntu another reason
why Dasher is a nice way of doing things
is it doesn't require any special
learning i didn't have to learn what
suggestion for an a what suggested for a
big and so on i didn't have to go
through a training period all i have to
do is navigate though it does help to
know the alphabetical order of the
language that you're writing in so
Japanese I can't write with handwriting
at all I definitely couldn't do as a
keyboard because I can't actually
remember the whole alphabet but because
I know the order they go in khaki kook
echo and so on I can actually write
Japanese okay in Dasha going back
hastily to english let me illustrate how
knowing the alphabetical order is
sometimes essential i'm going to write
for your cream of mushroom soup which i
happen to though is not perfectly
predicted by the language model so again
to the sea r e a and let's slow hold on
a moment i'm trying to write queen
where's my cream CR e a big inner often
makes a mistake here and said i can't
find cream any sort of puts the foot on
the gas since hunts for cream by driving
really fast waiting for the Queen pride
and that's not the way to do it there is
only one destination on this screen
where you have written cream and to get
there you must identify where it is and
drive there keeping on going is a really
bad idea beginners should be encouraged
to slow down and we can figure out where
they want to go another beginners
mistake is to say well I wonder am I can
see the a so let's sort of wave the
mouse near the a and then find a name on
the screen nem okay oh there's one that
hit quick let's go there but if we do
that what are we doing we're going into
the crime section of the library because
this is where you write CR IM the only
way to write cream is you're going to
see our e a and inside that a box you
must find the letter m and now i need to
know alphabetical order I can see the
tea it's offering me create creation
creature I want something before tea
because I know alphabetical order so
I'll go above the tea I can tear across
teal and to get there and here's cream
cream of mushroom
soup okay
here's a final benefit of the the dasher
attitude we can add extra characters to
the alphabet and we don't have to learn
any new skills at all so you might have
noticed so far I've just been using
lowercase English any matter you can't
do general application of course a camp
no problem we just change alphabet so
here's an alphabet that includes every
character on a qwerty keyboard and then
some has got a bunch of other unicode
characters in there as well and we put
all the uppercase characters in a yellow
box so now let's write hello there I go
into the h and then it's the e what
you'll notice now is the way the screen
looks is just like the way it looked
when I was writing a note in lowercase
English only so I'm in the middle of a
word and all you can really see coming
up are lowercase characters so the fact
that I've got three times as many
characters available to me a whole load
of punctuation characters and up case
characters it isn't slowing me down so
I've got three times as many options in
the tree but the language model is
highlighting all the prom all characters
which are the lower case characters so
we can add more characters and it
doesn't slow us down if I right hello
there and terminate the sentence with a
full stop then what we find well now we
get a nice big white box saying space
expected after the full stop the period
and a big yellow box saying uppercase
characters are highly predicted in this
context so that's great it's making it
very easy to begin the next sentence
with an uppercase character if however I
don't want to start the next one with an
uppercase character I can go into the
space and go and find lower case
characters and maybe the next thing i
want to write i don't know why i would
want to do this is microsoft so I go and
I got the lowercase M and i right
Microsoft which takes a long time to
write because it's an improbable string
it's never seen this before and what
you'll notice is when I have put in that
extra effort to get that difficult to
find lowercase M this smart software
gives me the word microsoft with a
lowercase M it doesn't convert it back
to application and my feeling is that's
the way that smart software or two
how are we doing the predictions we're
using as I said the state of the art in
general purpose text compresses it's a
model called ppm prediction by partial
match it's embarrassingly simple how
this works it just looks at the last
five characters that have been written
and uses that as a context to predict
the next character so it's based
entirely on the sixth gram statistics of
the language ppm can compress English
down to about two bits per character so
in principle if we could make a better
language model with all human knowledge
built into it and if Shannon's right
that English is really about one bit the
character Dasher should be able to go
twice as fast and that's something we're
still working on trying to make better
language models we chose ppm because
it's fast is adaptive and it works with
any language and it can learn all the
time so everything that we're writing
here is being learned and you can train
it on your own writing style this
screenshot here shows what happens if
you train it on just one hundred
favorite phrases let's say you're a
severely disabled personal what you want
to be able to say are just things like
please turn up the music or please give
me some water here I've trained it on
those hundred favorite sentences and you
can see now it looks like it's just the
tree of all my favorite sentences and
that's happening even though we're using
this language model that only knows
about six grams it ends up emulating the
tree of sentences pretty well okay so
I've hyped it up let me know give you a
bit of data on how well Dasha works
these experiments were done by David
Ward with volunteers from the
astrophysics group in the University of
Cambridge he gave them dictation from
Jane Austen's Emma having trained the
language model in the style of Jane
Austen's Emma by training it on ninety
percent of Jane Austen's Emma and then
testing on parts from the other fragment
and they learnt to use Dasher over a
period of one hour in 12 five minute
sessions and these sessions were mixed
up with keyboard dictation sessions to
check that it wasn't just that they're
getting good at taking dictation and
David measured their writing speed and
the word error rate the writing speed is
shown here bottom of the class started
out at about five words per minute and
after an
hour of practice were still bottom of
the class and going at about ten words
per minute top of the class started
immediately in the first five minutes
going at 12 words per minute I was up
above 25 words a minute after one hour
of practice so this is a very steep
learning curve we were not aware of any
writing system that has a learning curve
steeper than this meanwhile on the
keyboard they were all going along at
something like 50 words per minute this
was something they'd already been doing
for perhaps 18 years of their their life
the error rate I'd love to be able to
say that the error rate with dash had
dropped to zero that's what I really
believe is the case when ordinary people
use data to write their own writing the
problem here was that many of these
astrophysics unfortunately didn't know
how to spell Jane Austen's flowery prose
and so there were spelling errors coming
through for some of them here at the end
meanwhile on the keyboard as we know
your favorite key is the backspace key
because people do make a lot of spelling
mistakes by mistyping if they're trying
to write fast now this point people
might say I don't like Dasher because it
requires visual attention I like to be
able to look at other things while I'm
time okay I'm not trying to force
everyone to use Dasher and this is the
way that a predictive system has to be
if it's a pretty good system we've
somehow got to get the predictions over
how language model into your head and
that's going to be either auditory or
visual and we're using the visual
channel so yes we require visual
attention it's just like driving a car
oh I hate driving a car I have to look
at the road all the time I'd much rather
not look at the road and just like with
a car we can actually turn this to our
advantage because with a car you're
looking where you're going all the time
so actually you don't need the steering
wheel you can just look where you want
to go and we can have a gaze tracker
take you there and we can do exactly the
same with dash and it works even better
than that car idea so here's a gaze
track that we bought from a company in
Arizona infrared camera two infrared
lights gets an image like this figures
out where your eyes looking puts the
mouse on the screen in that location and
here's a movie of me taking some
dictation using this I tech system and
the dictator says no
section was raised on the father's side
this is the image of my eye and this is
me writing at about 3.7 bits per second
completely hands-free and it's a lot of
fun it's just like it's just like
navigating you just look where you want
to go and you go there the young man was
treated liberally
okay so David Ward and I published these
results a while back now and we compared
using data with a gaze tracker with the
cruelest form of torture known to man
which is the on-screen keyboard which is
the standard thing that people using
gaze trackers are forced to use if they
want to write so it on-screen keyboard
you stare at the keys one at a time and
have to stare and for the right duration
so it goes blip but not too long so you
get to blitz and you can have word
completions if you want you can have a
word completion area so you lip then you
look in the word completion area but you
had better look really quick to try and
find your work because if you look too
slowly you'll select a word you didn't
actually want it's it's hell using an
on-screen keyboards the fastest that you
can go is about 15 words a minute and
that's for expert people very familiar
with qwerty keyboards and the error rate
you'd be making at that sort of speed is
quite likely one-fifth of the word words
misspelled meanwhile with dasha expert
users of Dasher already familiar with
that I started out at 10 or 15 words per
minute and we're up at about 25 words
per minute after an hour of practice and
the error rate was essentially zero for
the expert users we've since modified
dascha to work especially well with gays
trackers the previous results were just
using our off-the-shelf dash are
designed for use with the maps we made
an eye tracking mode and the speed is
now up almost 2 30 words per minute and
this is in use by real people here as a
chap called John law who's got motor
neuron disease he's using the same piece
of hardware with dasha and I found this
photo on the internet and you might want
to hang on how starting and stopping
working I told you I'm not clicking I'm
not dragging but I am pressing a button
at the moment to start and stop dascha
well there are other ways of starting
and stopping one idea is to have a
central circle which you look at to make
a start or stop event happen and that's
something we were shipping in the
current version of Dasha and I'll show
you that with the next demo which is a
cheaper option for hands-free writing at
the moment gaze trackers cost twenty
thousand dollars but a much cheaper
device
can get is a head tracker so you can get
one from natural point or from origin
instruments the head mouse extreme and
I'm going to use the shiny dot hat of
natural point which has a shiny dot on
the front like a bicycle reflector and
I'm going to use it with the head masuk
stream which works with any USB port and
you can see I'm now able to move the
mouse up and down on the screen with my
head ok so let's get the mouse circle
option available and let's start a fresh
sentence all right I'm happy to take
suggestions for what to write ok good
one oops
I am feeling lucky
okay and I'll stop by going and looking
in the circle like that okay so that's
starting and stopping without pressing
any buttons at all and something you may
have noticed was I wasn't pointing very
accurately there even though Dasher has
very small objects on the screen people
might say oh I can't possibly use that I
can't point that accurately you don't
need to point accurately I was wobbling
all over the place but nevertheless I
got to my destination just like a wobbly
car driver and so high precision is not
required by data in contrast to some
other software I've come across that has
icons about this big that you're
expected to click on to get things to
happen and those are very difficult for
disabled users to use now maybe the
proof of the pudding is to actually do a
study on ER on a real user and mcdonough
GaN at the a center and oxford made a
study of a young man called paul who has
cerebral palsy has been in a wheelchair
all his life has great difficulty
controlling his muscles can't talk and
who has been using until make introduced
him to data he was using an on-screen
keyboard with a head mouse for all his
communication and here's a video of Paul
using dasha after I think a month or so
of of trying it out so this is Paul's
head here moving around and you can see
the rate at which he's moving in data is
very similar to the rate I've been
demonstrating it to you today and make
interviewed Paul and asked him what he
thought about data and he said in
contrast to the on-screen keyboard which
requires tiring head movements it
requires movements over quite a large
range and the movements have to be quite
precise and held for a particular
duration data needs less head movement
over smaller part of the screen and
there isn't any need to click or dwell
at particular times and he thinks you
can write about four times quicker with
data and finally he makes fewer spelling
mistakes and the last piece of good news
was he used a sure to write his final
thesis at aston university and graduated
in 2004 with a bachelor's degree the
dasher concept is very versatile it
doesn't just work with mouse and a head
tracker it works beautifully with
touchscreens his amoo
movie of David Ward writing on a pocket
pc this is something he did in 2001 he's
left-handed so his hand doesn't get in
the way of the stuff coming in from the
right we're working on a version for
right handed people at the moment so one
of our mottos in the dasher project is
right with any muscle and so far I've
shown you mouse gaze tracker touchscreen
and head mouse and next just to
illustrate this philosophy I want to
demonstrate to you my breath maps which
ryan adams and i made okay so now if I
breathe in and out the mouse is going up
and down on the screen that's a
one-dimensional muscle if you like I one
dimensional control so how can we steer
how can we navigate how can we drive a
car with just one dimension up till now
I've been using two dimensions to to
steer dasha well we don't need two
dimensions because we can map this one
dimension around this red clock if you
like so breathing out takes me down or
undo me on this side and then going
around the clock I can go forwards or I
can go back in the other direction so
let's show you that right now I'll
switch over to one-dimensional mode okay
I think we're ready to roll so let's
write thank you for inviting me to
google
okay so I'm not sure if this is a
serious option for any real user but it
does illustrate the philosophy but if
you can move any muscle we can get a
piece of hardware and we can have that
one muscle drive dascha and make
efficient use of the gestures that you
can make with that muscle
and the writing speed with this
particular piece of hardware are some
beginners struggled and started out at
two words per minute and got up to that
six words per minute and meanwhile an
expert no prizes for guessing who
started out at 11 words per minute and
got up to 15 verse per minute after an
hour of practice with this new device
and this one dimensional control I think
would be absolutely beautiful for
handheld devices I've been trying to
persuade samsung and nokia that they
should have a phone with a tilt control
way you use this one degree of freedom
to write your text messages and this
would be great for cool people who like
to write one-handed text and it would be
great for disabled people who can't use
mobile phones at present many of them I
think it would go nicely we say with the
Nokia lipstick phone which just has a a
continuous 11 dimensional controller on
it and no keypad we have various other
ways of using dasher for people with
different abilities and what about
people who can't actually control one
muscle in a continuous fashion going
back to buttons if someone really can
only press one or two or three or four
buttons what can we do for them well
again we can use information theory we
can say what's the best way to get
information content out of the ability
to press two buttons and if all you can
do is choose between two buttons a very
sensible thing to do is to say well
let's not label those buttons with
letters of the alphabet let's have them
correspond to navigation actions so it
can have a button for up and a button
for down and that's the optimal way to
use two buttons if you can press each of
them with equal ease in the same amount
of time I'll skip over the demo of that
and move on to another way of using two
buttons this is assuming that what
you're doing is choosing between two
buttons if you can actually choose when
to press one of those two buttons
there's additional information content
in the timing of the pressing not only
the choice but the timing and we've made
a version of dash that we call dynamic
to button mode that exploits this in we
think the best way that is is possible
this was an idea of Radford Neil's and
the idea is that the car drive steadily
forward and you press a button to
indicate when your destination is
falling off the screen to the left or to
the right or over up or down and which
button you're pressing indicates which
side of the screen you want to recenter
the view on so let's get do button
dynamic mode and now i can write another
sentence for you any suggestions ok
there are no suggestions I'll write that
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
that was 13 presses of a switch and how
many characters are written there I
think more than 13 so we're getting a
very good conversion rate of gestures
into characters and was I having to
press really fast like Morse code to
write at that speed no I was only
pressing about once per second I think
so i think this could be great again for
mobile phones one-handed entry using
just two buttons like this very
comfortable rather than having your
thumb going in awkward angles just two
buttons on a mobile phone I'd love to
persuade a manufacturer to to get this
software onto a phone and it would be
great for disabled people again because
someone who can press just two switches
with their head would have an option of
writing text messages on a mobile okay
I'll skip over the results 20 words per
minute is the sort of speed that you can
get up to with just two two buttons so
who is dasha for well the dasher program
that's available at the moment I think
it we're especially focusing on the
group of people with special needs we
think it would be great for people with
miniature computers as well it's working
on the Pocket PC and on this nokia
internet tablet we think there's a lot
of potential there for the people with
portable computers also people who want
to write in languages that are not
supported by the keyboard they are
sitting at so here's a screenshot of
international phonetic alphabet being
written maybe Dasher could be useful in
education and in language learning also
I'd like to close by showing you a few
directions that the dasher team are
going in now one of the activities is
using data with other sources of
information for example if you can talk
and move one muscle what can we do well
we have an idea called speech data and
this is an example of a whole class of
problems where you have other sources of
information so here speech is the other
source and speech recognizers do many
people use speech recognizers to write
on their computer
I think not they advertise them with
phrases like you talk it types but why
is the nice gentleman smiling so much
the real slogan is you talk it types you
laugh because it makes so many mistakes
and I think it's well established that
whereas raw dictation itself could go at
something like 140 words per minute all
the correcting of errors that you have
to do with real recognizes even in good
conditions with a good quality
microphone the correction process slows
you down so that you end up writing at
about 14 words per minute that's if
you're using a mouse and keyboard to
handle the corrections if you do the
corrections by voice alone you go even
slower and just to remind you of that
here is a movie that keep virtanen made
on a speech recognition system yeah I'm
frozen so for all the world select Dan
he wants denne denne select Dan he wants
then spell that d en select on curls you
want uncle's scratch that select on
curls uncurls select Anna curls spell
that UNC you RLS select uncurls scratch
that scratch that
spell it scratch that uncurls select on
curls he wants unclose select on scratch
that select on scratch that UN scratch
that you n CU RL s scratch that uncurls
on current was scratch that scratch that
uncurls select anna curls spell that you
n see you are LS slice and so he's still
not done and the question is can we do
better than this and I believe that with
a Dasher speech hybrid we can because we
have a new way of entering information
new way of using navigation and here's a
screenshot of what it looks like imagine
you have just said I follow curious to
juice his State of Mind and the speech
recognizer said well I'm not sure if he
said curious or Curry's or furious and
so on the screen these alternatives are
displayed in the dash away in
alphabetical order and so his keith's
first prototype he's made several I'll
just show you a video of his first one
where he says the same sentence the
hibernating skunk curled up in his deep
tan uncurls himself and ventures forth
to prowl the world a language model is
deduced from the output of the speech
recognizer is rendered on screen in
alphabetical order and now he goes and
chooses what he actually wanted but I
burning Scott curled up in his deep den
notice how fast all that was that was
faster than speaking speed perhaps
uncurls himself now this takes some time
because the recognizer didn't get
uncurls but now he's got it and he keeps
on going uncurls himself
and ventures forth to power the world
so keith is still working on this he's
finishing his PhD at the moment we could
use the same principle as part of a
translation system to help someone clean
up the errors made by an automatic
translation system we can use the data
concept where the grammar is constrained
so that instead of being able to write
any sentence at all you should only be
able to write something that obeys some
grammatical rules for example search if
you want to search for a spring in a
document it's stupid to allow the user
to type in strings that don't exist so
here's search Dasher that is a way of
entering strings that exist in the
document so here fill right th e and who
are highlighting on the left the
occurrences in the document of that
string we can supply rudimentary editing
using the dasher metaphor so you can go
into nodes in a menu hierarchy that
offer you the opportunity to move the
cursor around to delete characters and
so forth it's a bit like VI hitting the
escape key to get into this alternative
tree of actions in fact you can access
not only those elementary editing
actions but all the menus in principle
of all the applications running on your
computer can be accessed from within
dasha we're not shipping this version
because it might cause problems and
crashes and so forth but we have made a
prototype where you can pull down your
menu of your abiword and select bold
formatting and write text in dascha that
comes out and this is a real screenshot
of this this process controlling the
computer entirely through dasha and we
call this user friendly alternative to
the wheelchair ally of death which is
the sequence of pulldown menus which
again are very difficult for a disabled
person to actually control with say
ahead mass to wrap up I'd like to
emphasize that we can use Dasher in any
language and I'd like to end by showing
you screenshots of Chinese data and
Japanese data which were just finalizing
at the moment I understand Google might
be interested in Chinese text entry
alternatives so here's Danish finish my
hundred phrases Swedish polish Arabic
Hebrew going in the opposite direction
incidentally Persian Bengali order with
Pamela international phonetic alphabet
here's a
a semantic alphabet flow people with
cognitive impairment latex see Korean
works beautifully Korean has 11,000
characters each built out of two or
three elementary letters which are
consonants and vowels and we can render
that in dash and just work straight out
of the box no difficulty at all at least
in Linux where these things work fine
chinese 7,000 odd characters are in
Chinese and the way were handling
Chinese we need a new language model
here to cope with such a big character
set and the way we're working in Chinese
is you enter the sentence you want to
write in pinyin which is the phonetic
alphabet of Chinese at the moment we're
not including the tone marks but I'm
sure it will work even better if we have
the tone marks included in this string
and we can do that then you enter a
special character this one here that
means okay I'm done I want to convert
this then we get a language model from a
piece of free software that comes up
with hypotheses about how to turn this
into Chinese characters and here is that
tree of all possible strings of Chinese
characters and now the user zooms
through that sequence and gobbles up
what he actually wanted to say and there
he's done and now he comes out and he's
back into pinion to write the next
sentence we're doing exactly the same in
Japanese here's a screenshot of Japanese
done one way here you enter an entire
sentence in hiragana then enter the
special character then choose the the
Chinese sequence that you wanted or
within Dasha the other way of doing
things rather than doing a whole
sentence of the time is to convert after
every word and I think that's going to
be better for users so here's the here's
today's version where this is a word I
think that says with Ashley no and this
is then converted to it actually no here
and then here's the next word and
conversion to the next string so this is
where we're going with Japanese da
shower and I hope what's I hope we'll
have that out of the door within another
month or two so we'd be delighted if
people world over would get involved in
there it's free software it's available
on quite a few platforms linux windows
mac OS pocket pc we'd love volunteers to
get involved
porting it to other platforms like the
palm pilot and we do have a java version
working in your browser as well and so I
hope this might be useful to people at
Google thank you very much for listening
we are really the high of the boxes
proportion to the probability have you
tried kind of changing that scaling in
some way that minimizes the light
average time character ok the question
is how are the sizes of the boxes being
determined we've got a probability model
that says what the probability of each
character is how do we actually use that
and is it optimal in terms of writing
speed so what we're doing is the
vertical height of each box is
proportional to the probability so we
chop up each box in proportional for the
conditional probabilities of those
characters and that is the optimal way
in terms of getting the best possible
writing speed if we assume that your
user drives at a steady rate so they if
they can sustain a constant rate of
zooming so for example four factors of
two of zooming every second would be
four bits per second yeah four equals
vision problems
right so the question is what about
Dasher for blind people and for several
years when people ask that question I
said come off it dashes intensely visual
there's no way I could make a version of
data for blind people but after enough
people ask this question I did actually
come up with an idea and so we have a
version of data that I've made a
prototype of called VI dash F or
visually impaired Dasher and I can show
you just a screenshot of the the concept
we're assuming here that someone is not
only visually impaired but they have
severe motor difficulties as well so
they can't just use a keyboard so here
I'm assuming that they can press two
buttons and up down up button or a down
button and the idea is to give them the
set of all words in a language in
alphabetical order in a tree and you can
then use one switch to go alphabetically
before the word that's being offered to
you and another switch to go
alphabetically after maybe a double
press or a long press is a way of
selecting the word that's being offered
and then you can optimize this tree to
to maximize the information rate why is
this visually impaired well we don't
have to show the words we can speak just
the single divider word which is telling
you where you are in the library at the
moment so it'll say to you my and then
if you're trying LOL or and then it says
for and you say okay after and and we so
we do have an option we don't have any
users using this but that's the idea
question is what's going on with the
colors and in some languages there are
very natural ways of using associating
colors with characters or symbols that
have different meanings so in Japanese
for example I couldn't survive in dascha
without the color coding that goes at
you Oh kakakaka Cohen orange sassy say
so in yellow and so forth in English
there isn't such a natural grouping of
characters we could color vowels and
consonants differently in principle but
we don't because we don't think it
really helps so the colors were using in
English at the moment are a yellow box
surrounds all uppercase characters a red
box around numerals a green box
surrounds punctuation and the
punctuation characters themselves are
colored in a systematic way to make it
easy to find quote like characters or
period like characters and the letters
of the alphabet themselves are just
randomly colored with six or so colors
to give you a feeling of navigation in a
colorful world perhaps slightly Google
flavored color scheme if you don't like
that color scheme we've got lots of
options so you can just say i want the
appearance to be for example milder and
here is the mild look which isn't so
googly in appearance it's much more soft
blue and green shades there so any ideas
for how to improve the color scheme are
welcome and it's all open source xml
files so it's very easy to redefine the
color scheme if you have an idea you'd
like to try yeah Jeremy
how could that target Jeremy's question
is can I imagine a million people using
Dasher within a decade I definitely can
and I can see that happening in two ways
three ways three categories of user
there's all people with mobile phones
who want to do their mobile phone
business one-handed text messaging
especially maybe they're holding a beer
in the other hand so there's that
community and easily that that could be
a million users there's all the disabled
people who can't use a keyboard and then
the the third category is where was I
going um yeah so I think in Japanese and
Chinese users I think there could be a
big win for the night I've seen Japanese
people using the Roman keyboard which is
the default keyboard and it's a struggle
for them and so I think there could be a
big win there I think there's some other
group of users that I've forgotten as
well be your pocket you can probably
figure it out okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
