local chef of Chicago my day job I am a
research developer chef for a small
flavoring company called Belle flavors
and fragrances it's based on the dark
Brook but when I come home at night I
like to experiment I like to do a lot of
fun things I like to kind of teach
myself a lot of different things so I'm
basically going to do a rundown on
fermentation my personal experiences
with it work with it kind of learning
how to view think myself making
different fermented products and
fermented foods is just it's one of
those products that a lot of people
don't really understand the process
board but they love them over the thing
is one third of that could be anything
from soy sauce team chocolate coffee
sauerkraut kimchi any kind of cheese we
consume over 15 million tonnes cheese
annually as a culture over 22 million
gallons of beer other fermented liquors
like wide and kind of Bacchus look like
that and the basic understanding of why
these things happen is generally unknown
to the public by definition fermentation
is a anaerobic process so basically it's
the conversion of sugar or some kind of
carbohydrate plus some kind of bacteria
and converts it into alcohol or
combined with energy as long as along
with other enzymes other various
chemicals in a food sense it doesn't
have to be anaerobic also be aerobic so
large processing situations will add air
or add different temperatures we've kind
of control the conditions of the way
things fermented help kind of facilitate
that fermentation to help the growth of
organisms health and fries he'll compete
so this is the chemical reaction
it looks pretty difficult it's kind of
weird basically sugar and kind of sugar
glucose fructose sucrose you add it to
your microbial agent like yeast moulds
other kind of bacterias and they release
alcohol which is basic ml carbon dioxide
and some kind of energy in it whether it
be heat whether it be different
byproducts
why this is an important process
fermentation is probably one of the
oldest methods of preservation there's
quite a few different methods that are
tried-and-true
first one is salting what salt does is
it basically draws the moisture out of
your product and also inhibits my
grovyle growth so it helps inhibit our
businesses from growing something like
that but it's usually the fungicide
little spores stuff like that that it
helps prevent so what you're doing is
the salt will pull the moisture out and
pull out that water which is breeding
ground for a lot of different organism
stuff like that and then it will create
this boundary between their products and
air so that different organisms can't
penetrate through that salt solution
another one is smoking the same idea the
smoke is antimicrobial you're basically
in developing a product and smoke you're
creating this kind of crust it goes over
your product it's helping keep the air
from getting into your v help you keep
those organisms from and then the other
one is dry or dehydrated again you're
plugging the moisture out and moisture
is what helps facilitate this growth
fermentation is involved in a lot of
other processes kind of like ethanol
preservation where the use of alcohol is
used to inhibit growth high levels of
alcohol will kill organisms as well as
lactic acid preservation which is what
you see in cheese high acid levels and
vinegar pickling the highest levels will
only permit certain organisms to grow or
not
memorizing of products is two different
kinds of techniques we use to get the
process going it kind of started
facilitated inoculated I said the first
one is wild fermentation there's
basically just leaving a product out and
exposing it to air exposing it to
anything that's flying around the room a
lot of yeasts are present and everyday
flowers on the outsides of fruits and
vegetables on outer peel anything that's
really high in sugar it will attract
some kind of organism in the common the
other way is to have human input
basically human input provides a more
controlled environment that we can
change and affect the final outcome of
our Father so what they'll do is they'll
actually develop a certain product let's
say yogurt you know they have this
yogurt that they try to trim they like
the way it tastes what they can do is
take their original base that they set
out with heat it to kill all the
organisms that are in there and then
reintroduced that the yogurt that has
the flavor and the consistency that they
want to that heated base that basically
starts out with clean palate and only
incorporates organisms that they wanted
then they do the same method for making
yogurt will come out for the most part
the exact same way as the original one
if they do follow the same process wild
fermentation is a little bit unwell or a
little bit more unreliable there's a lot
of different things in the air that can
contribute to it but that also will
devote the most interesting flavors
stuff like sourdough breads can make a
sourdough bread in San Francisco which
is completely different than a sourdough
bread and Chicago because of the
temperature of the environment different
yeasts that are in the air other factors
in the end product via temperature
environment season humidity your
experimentation basically what your
entire process is and their flow of how
things get done this chart over here
just kind of go through a little bit of
each one and why making clarification if
you take out some of the solids in their
product it will affect the final
fermentation of the product will have
less panics less less ease because the
yeast kind of stay on the sides the
grapes to pull those skins out actually
point out some of the actual organisms
that are
a temperature shock weather that
organism has the right temperature to
grow usually about body temperature is
the perfect temperature for organisms to
thrive if you make no really cold they
won't kill them but they'll kind of kind
of go to sleep they kind of won't do
anything they'll get lazy they won't
actually ferment you raise it up to I
will kill them and then they can't do
anything other minerals other things
that can help facilitate the growth
whether the oxygen for minerals
different kind of salt some kind of
phosphate or nitrite and as well as the
my garage will microbiological
environment whether they're yeasts and
molds and everything are in the
surrounding area whether what you're
trying to inoculate with is able to
compete with what's already in the air
traces in history like I said this is
one of the oldest processes preserving
foods and it starts almost as old as
twelve to twenty twelve thousand years
ago Mead was one of the first products
that originated and it's basically just
a fermented honey drink honey collecting
as early as 12,000 years ago in areas of
like Egypt and the Sumerian areas and
for most part a lot of these things were
discovered by accident honey for example
is high in sugar
so you know it is an attractant for
these yeasts all those other things they
would collect the honey they've been to
with water to make a drink and they
didn't have refrigeration so they just
let it sit up or as I set out they
started to notice you know little things
changes going after that they said no
this bubbles come off excited to see
this coloration different things growing
on this visual cue was originally how
fermentation happens just seeing the
product change and tasting it ever
changed see the difference is see
whether they liked it enough soy sauce
dates back to over 2,500 years ago until
the 17th century with the creation of
the microscope it was generally unknown
why these things happened people would
started doing it in their homes and
their basements and they found that it
tasted good and they went off of that
sort of make the cheese is the starting
alcohols didn't really understand why
the microscope was created they started
to notice these little organisms
different things inside of the foods
well it's science in the time but is
such a new concept that have generally
disregarded a lot of science
use the fact that this could even happen
that there's some kind of small living
organism
eating and they just didn't even believe
in if they completely rejected it
outright it wasn't even until about the
19th or 20th century lewis the store
actually started that make this
connection between what was growing and
the changes that were done the way that
he came upon this process was that a
company that was making a beet juice
alcohol was having a lot of variations
in his product he didn't understand why
even making it the same way for number
of years and it was just coming out
different every single time he's making
it his very own reliable was affecting
his business so he gave it to the
chemist was the sewer to test out well
upon looking at the microscope he
noticed that from older samples of the
alcohol versus newer ones there were
different things different organisms
different small bacteria that were
present so we actually came up with a
method of pasteurization which we all
know which is heating a product we
killed that microflora and then he
reintroduced it with the specific
starter that you want
some benefits of fermentation
preservation it preserves not only the
product itself but it also preserves the
nutrients
it will actually increase the way that
the body body can kind of use some of
the nutrients especially like vitamin B
vitamin C calcium we rent something from
being destroyed by sitting for a long
period of time and kind of prevents the
degradation of the product itself
did I just evade a lot of the products
if they're not heated they still have
these live cultures and it still has
this micro flora and because this micro
flora can survive very acidic
environments it still is highly active
in your intestinal tract in your body
system so I actually go through their
system and often kind of make a small
home in your testing on track to
actually help you digest foods will help
you absorb nutrients better will help
absorb different nutrients that your
body normally can't break down a lot of
proteins a lot of amino acids that your
body has a really hard time breaking
down these Orientals will do the work
for you flavor myth development there's
a specific chemical reaction that
happens when you're doing this
fermentation and you're developing a lot
of different flavors enzymes
creating acids and alcohols they have
antioxidant properties that actually
opens up the antioxidants that your body
can use them a little bit better
it's a fortifier like I said it creates
a vitamin vitamin B it removes toxins
the process of fermentation is used for
ingredients like coffee my coffee is
grown it has a cherry on the outside of
it they pick the cherry they let it sit
out so that that fruit ripen kind of
fall off and then they take that means
from that helps remove some of the
toxins that are associated the cherry
stain tree with like certain types of
cassava Africa they have to take cassava
and soaking in water that help hold a
cyanide that is present in the vegetable
out once they soak in the water these
toxins from Holland I can actually cook
the cassava again yeah this approximated
tea is another example when I pull the
leaves they let them sit out to dry from
that this allows the team to develop
more flavor have less moisture in it
last longer
and I'm going over see specific examples
vegetable ferments they're basically
usually using a salt brine to help
protect the vegetables from rotting they
salt will pull the moisture out of the
vegetable create its own shelf where the
vegetable multiple changes occur and one
thing I use the example of sauerkraut
you first start sauerkraut you add salt
to your cabbage the salt will pull the
moisture out it will create this barrier
for your sauerkraut and then it will
only allow certain organ ends with the
girl you're using just straight water
and salt
only the coliform can grow once the
coliform grows it proliferate it feeds
will start taking the carbohydrates from
the cabbage and it will output a certain
level of acid once the axis starts to
get too high it actually diminishes in
on the coliform that's in the system and
then the kana stock will come in and
start feeding out that acid again it
goes up it proliferates and it starts to
die down and finally lactobacillus which
is one of the most common comes in and
will start to create lactic acid which
is that sharp kind of cheesy sensation
from a lot of products like cheese
sauerkraut kimchi
this is a basic a very traditional track
for making sauerkraut basically we do is
you take your salted cabbage which can
be sour craft can be anything any kind
of vegetable can be made in sauerkraut
take your vegetable you mix it with salt
spices these onions apples they leave
peppercorn stuff like that
you mix it with a salt and then what
you're going to do is you're going to
take a very very heavy weight push it on
top of those vegetables but the way it
does is it helps to push the moisture
out of the vegetables leave it at the
bottom you want this to be an anaerobic
environment so that it doesn't affect
how everything commence we don't want
them all as you month through actual
sauerkraut to develop an anaerobic so
once you weight it where you're going to
do is put a little bit of salt water
around the rim of the crock
I want the salt water goes again helps
to keep the microbes from entering into
your crock and for a live you let it sit
for anywhere from one week to up to a
year that's it
unrefrigerated you want to leave it at
ideal temperature for growth which is
anywhere between 85 100 degrees
it's kind of dark you can't really see
it this is an example the sauerkraut
that I made today that you guys going to
be trying it's basically just white
cabbage it's got onions and apples
different spices and stuff like that
this is that put it in the bowl and it
salt to it
you generally add about a 5 to 10%
solution of salt to your sauerkraut and
the salt will determine how long is sits
board we had more salt then you will
take your sauerkraut you major for a
longer amount of time at a lower
temperature if you have less salt and
you're going to age it for a short
amount of time
higher kimchi is one of the most popular
condiments of Korea said that every
Korean on an individual basis it seems
about a quarter pound of kimchi a day
which really adds up by the end of it
here it's a very very artisanal product
it's made by almost every family for the
family it's not really something that
you go out by as often that is
traditionally nowadays but convenience
stuff like that you can get it
mass-produced but usually it was
something that was a very home
orientated part of the culture they come
home they harvest their own vegetables
they think kimchi whatever vegetables
they have
they accept the salt spices generally
should we cover is use seafood will use
anything the big difference in kimchi
and sauerkraut
is that when you make kimchi soak your
vegetables ahead of time salt water what
this does is it pulls the moisture out
use the salt into the vegetables and it
also kind of helps getting a crisp
texture to that kimchi so this is
soaking some cabbage and make another
kimchi again this is about a five
percent salt solution
once you're done so can you pull it out
chop it mix it with various vegetables I
used radish carrot a couple different
kinds of greens generally use ginger
garlic pepper then you're going to take
it and put it in I use it's very similar
to the sauerkraut crock but you can do
it at home but just about any kind of
container usually you want to use some
kind of hard plastic you don't want to
use metal because the metal we actually
react with the acids and kind of
creative Latini taste too so any kind of
plastic and kind of create usually it
will be quite buckets you find as long
as it's ever been to use is a good
option
now what you're going to do is you're
going to put a weight on top and bring
that moisture level up I'll protect your
vegetables
this is an example of a fruit kimchi
made the exact same style again you take
your fruit to cut them off with the salt
then you can soak them in Brian if you
want but it's not necessary and you're
going to take them wait of death be
ferments a lot of people are familiar
with soy sauce is so tempting lesser so
natto to the Japanese whole soybeans
because of their protein content they're
very difficult for the human body to
digest so we've used the process of
fermentation to help break down these
proteins that they're easily digested by
thing
this is a kind of a simple diagram of
how soy sauce is made basically take
your ingredients of soybean meat and
some kind of mole that's already been
established with a different process
usually the same molds that they use for
making rice wine and sake is also was
present and soy sauce movie was that put
an open-air container and I proliferate
kind of a row then after they do that
take it put in the container that is
stood at a specific time temperature for
about six months after it sit for a
couple of months we'll take it and press
it to get all the liquid out strain it
that's how you have soy sauce that's the
naturally fermented soy sauce they also
have a method which is chemically
induced that much quicker usually takes
about a couple hours but they'll take
soy beans and I add hydrochloric acid to
it this hydrolyzes the vegetables that
creates that kind of
to it you'll notice that that tastes
very chemically doesn't taste as sweet
there's a lot of flavors that kind
just don't exist when you have this
coming paper this ourselves
tempeh is one of the more interesting
products yes you have any idea if I
could pick them honor if ever that
thought everybody kind of the stories
that we've had G Komen is actually one
of the few that are naturally through
okay a lot of the a lot of the stuff you
find the story is naturally food a lot
of the stuff it's a more industrial
scale something you buy they're
processing stuff like that company is
another bead ferment which is basically
cooked soybeans that are a lot cool they
have a starter added to it and this sit
in an open-air environment what happens
is that the starter will operate with
the addition of air and warmth and I
will start to spray and will create this
kind of hold what the mold will do
because we actually take all these
soybeans and connect them will grow
across the entire thing is have a
actually pull it together be this firm
brick and it actually will develop very
earthy and kind of mushrooms together
often desirable never change
because it has that texture to it absorb
light flavor and has that kind of
texture Dairy ferments lactobacilli
which is the common bacteria that are
very prevents come they eat the lactose
present in the dairy they turn it into
lactic acid lactose is a basically a
ingredient that's in most area that a
lot of humans have a hard time digesting
because we do not have the enzyme that
breaks down those levels so that's why
if you're lactose intolerant a lot of
people that are lactose intolerant will
find that they eat up a cheese or the
yogurt that's heavily fermented doesn't
bother them as much that's because the
fermentation collected by CI are
actually taking those and as I say can't
process some examples butter milk yogurt
butter all sorts of cheeses kefir which
is another
yogurt products yogurt more so now than
previously starting to be promoted with
having probiotics is having these
organisms in it that are helping your
digestive tract
metabolism this is not a new concept
around for thousands of years it
actually went away invention of
pasteurization because people were
afraid of these things that were afraid
that they're gonna make them sick if you
take yogurt and you just make it
normally you will naturally have these
probiotics will have these suggested is
actually pasteurize it for killing all
those things or what they'll do is
they'll add started to it loud turning
the yogurt heated after it's time that
they over to kill everything to make it
more safe for consumption safe visit
maybe not exactly save her but more well
received by the public when you're
making yogurt you only need to add a
little bit of the starter to get started
if you had a too much or actually the
crowd everything will cause less of the
bacteria to grow but more on the
estimate so you have a very very sour
astringent yogurt it's a relatively
quick product to make it takes about 8
to 12 hours depending on how long you
sit at the temperature with a bacteria
proliferate at will affect how sour your
product is so generally what you do is
heat your yogurt up this is me eating
the yogurt up heat up to 180 degrees
first eat your belt so you start out
with a melt base you can choose how much
fat
Spiner yogurt will have less bad very
peculiar will be high in fat throughout
40% that still have correct fermentation
I began by heating up the product to 180
degrees this isn't necessary what this
does is that helps create a thicker
yogurt house kind of loosen up the
structure of the proteins that when
bacteria come this is the yogurt after
it's finished so after you heated up 280
degrees
you're gonna cool it down to about 100
to 110 which is the ideal temperature to
thank yogurt at you're gonna add your
starter and you're just gonna try to
leave it at that temperature for a long
period of time as at 8 to 12 hours up to
24 the longer you leave it the more sour
your product with these less sour
products we have for eight hours more
sauerkraut a computer for 20 hours what
will happen is the enzymes will break
down will start the sourdough product
will make lactic acid and actually
thickening over this stuff G's is a
little bit different because you don't
actually need the fermentation products
that make the cheese an initial
the fermentation product to help right
the machines afterwards so what we're
doing is we're adding an acid to some
kind of mouth bass and heating it to a
certain temperature that will actually
cause the mouth to separate that's
occurred in some way the ways of liquid
because of the solids you can also use
rennet which is an exact parent a lot of
animals stomach slaughtering lining
animals and then what you'll do is
you'll strain the way off you'll leave
the solids and then your wrist let them
sit and that's how you'll get the
fermentation product in cheese you can
add different strains of bacteria to
give different kinds of cheeses that's
why there's so many different cheeses on
the market because depending on the area
they're from having on what's in the
environment that's where the flavors
blue cheese is is one of the most
notorious it's a very very rapidly
growing organism it spreads very quickly
so if you're an environment that made
blue cheese you most likely will have
everything else in that environment
turning blue cheese or have that same
mold on it within a couple of days it's
that rapid that takes over any other
bacterial grain from s also very popular
talk about sourdough breads what happens
is you add the addition of water to
grains you're hoping to activate the
yeast that are already naturally a hot
grains you're helping break down those
grants to help your body process a
little bit better the addition of water
will cause the yeast to activate it will
actually start to eat the carbohydrates
of the grain themselves how to loosen
them and convert them into more
digestible product easiest you're fine
calm pretty much everywhere anything
kind of sugar if you've ever looked at
some kind of plum or grape at white film
on the outside of your group is actually
pieces that are feeding on the sugars of
the fruit itself
so this is how you start a basic
sourdough bread all you really do is
just take flour and water put them
together put a cover over it let it sit
what I did for mine if I actually use
potato water and cook some potatoes
after I cook the potatoes that save the
water I turn that into a sourdough bread
an extra starch from the potatoes
this gives something extra for the ease
of you slowly to do is you mix those two
products together let it sit at the
ideal temperature again 80 to 110
degrees an open air container you want
to leave an open air at the beginning
because this is where the EES are going
to come from they're gonna come from
there you can add bakers Reese if you
want but it kind of feeds the purpose of
having this sourdough that's made with
things that are naturally occurring if
you let that sit overnight at the
temperature that I do temperature the
next day you come back to it you remove
half of it and then add the same amount
of flour water the root as introduced
again newer yeasts helps add some more
carbohydrates so that these consecutive
great or you do this for about three or
four days until you started to see it
bubble once it bubbles and you have a
solid starter that bubbling means that
these are active they're creating lactic
acid which is where that sourness is
going to come from we're going to
continue as long as they keep it fed as
long as you keep the vital nutrients
sugar for that keep going so these
starters can pretty much be kept
indefinitely some of the sour goes from
San Francisco over a hundred years old
because they started a sourdough hundred
years ago they take out half of it make
bread at more flour water and they just
keep making in everyday using that same
starter and then over time develops a
lot of different flavors from a lot of
different organisms this is another
fermentation practice which if you've
watched my Twitter it's one of the first
things that have kind of experimented
with fermented oatmeal you take any kind
of oats soak them in water overnight the
East present in the open oh actually
kind of break down the starch and will
result a very very kind of creamy
fruit ferments we see this
years
I guess we could grant you see this is
Tamil beer as well but the addition of
Ruby is normal and they control appears
what were you doing is basically again
taking those naturally-occurring
keys in there and they're feeding off
the sugar with proof specific sugars
will kind of help change the final
fermentation and that final flavor so if
you're using honey if we're using
molasses using sorghum using brown sugar
each one of these sugars has different
flavor profile and different types of
organisms will be attracted to let's say
honey brown sugar
that's pretty much it I have a bunch of
products here that we're all going to
taste I have a fruit kimchi that's made
with pineapple grapes cilantro ginger
some other spices again let's sit for a
week I have a normal kimchi that's made
a very traditional style it just has
radish greens chili pepper garlic ginger
I have a homemade sauerkraut it has the
addition of apples and onions good I
have some yogurts I have a full fat
yogurt his neighbor for 40% fat kind of
comes out for the consistency of sour
cream I also have a normal fat 5% I also
have some butter that was made with the
yogurt we can talk about that process if
you like and I also have some the ginger
beer recipe but I made it with galangal
basically took ginger shred it up mix it
with sugar and water they have that
environment so that easy girl once it
started to grow you add that to a base
ginger and sugar once you cool it on
that base and the starter that you've
made within active cultures and you put
in an anaerobic environment by putting
it into a bottle within of the city as
well start to create will eat the sugars
will create alcohol let's go to you and
that's where the carbonation caltrak
because you're concentrating this
the bottle so it can't escape so it's
amusing itself into the water to create
carbonation
so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
