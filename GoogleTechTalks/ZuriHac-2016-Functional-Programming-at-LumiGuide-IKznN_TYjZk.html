Sri hack again and I'm actually really
proud to be able to get the key key note
here because I think syriac is really
becoming like an institution in any high
school community it's really becoming a
tradition so it's really really great to
get this store so this morning I will
talk about new me guides it's a company
I work for and we are a haskell shop and
in the store problem I'd like to
introduce our company what we do but
probably solve how we are using Haskell
and so the first part of the talk is
kind of not really technical the second
part is really technical and we are
trying to like do a little live coding
session with my brother who's sitting
here in front and yeah so that should be
fun also dangerous but yeah I like that
ok so Who am I I've been really
fortunate to be able to use function
programming especially Haskell through
my whole career so far i started out at
the little startup company and
netherlands called santos hands where we
developed scientific instruments for
measuring gases and we use haskell as
kind of an embedded language to control
these instruments so yeah as close as an
as embedded software that was pretty
cool after that I moved to Zurich here
to work for a company called batter I
think most of you will probably know
that company we used to organize syriac
also which was a lot of fun i had the
privilege of working in a really great
engineering team and learned a lot there
especially as haskell developer after
that i went back to the netherlands to
work for company called luma guides that
my brother found it's about a year
earlier
I guess yeah and now I'm CTO there so it
means I'm kind of the technical guy but
my brother is actually doing more
technical work that I am because fifty
percent of my time will also spending on
doing business stuff so I'm wearing many
hats in fact I'm wearing many suits
because part of my time I'm doing sales
which is kind of a weird combination so
what are we doing well you're solving a
really rich problem i'm not aware of i'm
not sure you you have this problem in
Switzerland but this is a typical site
in benevolence of the parents train
stations where you see just one just one
pile of bicycles and so the problem is
when you when you go here and you need
to catch a train where do you park your
bicycle like where to go so this is the
problem that we're trying to solve we
help you find you we help you find a
place to park your bicycle and I've had
like a short introduction introduction
video that explains our system is
actually produced by the city of you
track yeah sir guys I'm having troubles
making those projectors work so people
who are sitting in front who doesn't
have the over head display probably
should move to the back so we can see
the presentation actually sorry and I'll
wait just a minute for the for the video
and you have to excuse with are some
really bad spelling mistakes in this
video I didn't make it but somebody
screwed up there let's see if you can
spot them okay so that's nice
traffic in boutique they are steadily
getting busier some hundred thousand
cyclists ride through the city center
every day and their number is growing
all these cyclists look for a place to
park their bicycle again and again
bootleg is looking for smart ways to
make bicycle parking at the right place
easy for cyclists one of these smart
ways is the new P route bicycle you text
is the first sitting in the world where
digital signs are used to guide not only
motorists but also cyclists to free
parking cases map installing only on
Roseanne from system a system artifact
optimizing in santa ana down the par
Matta of stalemate but alta fits black
overfeed start don't keep me away from
it in Whoville platinum check for sign
and offered or haven not baller long
speech pal
no like because home look on tonight
next I'm gonna stop in 614 so that was
that was a project we did for the city
of new track after that we've been quite
busy and expand our system to auto
cities in the Netherlands city of
Amsterdam city of The Hague and also our
own city of nijmegen where we are based
and now we're also expanding
internationally to to our neighboring
countries Belgium UK so let's move on to
something a bit more technical and
explain how the system works so we use
these sensors which we mount to the
ceiling of facilities and outdoor
facilities we actually mount these
sensors to polls and yeah so what are
these things actually we call them
optical sensors because they basically
consists of two security cameras just
off the shelf security cameras connected
to a little switch and then they're like
wired together and yeah so why do you
why do we use two cameras well we use
stereo vision to see in the third
dimension so what we do is have a little
picture here of what a typical camera
will see so what you're seeing here is a
two-tier bicycle rack so two rows of
bicycles on top of each other this is in
our outdoor facility what we do is we
draw in these what we call regions of
interest oh I should speak at like us
and four in each region of interest we
kind of we can see in the third
dimension in a so we can see depth and
when there is no bicycle we we don't see
an object and when there is a bicycle or
actually something else can also be like
if there is a pile of rubbish or or if
there's like these bicycle bags that are
in the way we also detect that as an
object and then we mark that place as
occupied there was pretty funny so when
we installed the system and opened it
turn it on then the next day I got a
like on reddit or my house classical
reddit I got a dis reply from Sebastian
Visser works for silk this Haskell show
up in the Netherlands and he lives in
Utrecht and he used to park his bicycle
there but yeah at some point his bicycle
or stolen which is a pretty common thing
in the Netherlands unfortunately and he
asked me okay you know do you record the
riccati images but we don't we don't
need to record anything so we don't do
that for privacy reasons but maybe in
the future we might actually provide it
as a extra service to cities to do also
to do also to surveillance so let's look
at a few more pictures this is in 9
bacon the nice thing about this picture
is that you can see that our system also
works for an erect free places so
competing systems they need to they
usually use a switch in the bicycle rack
bicycle rack like a physical switch but
if you don't have a wrecked and you
don't have a place to mount that switch
that's not a problem for us because we
just draw in these regions of interests
and then we can measure in those regions
so we don't really need a rack here's
another one from Utrecht again and then
so what do we do with that information
well we guide cyclists to available
space a new track we do that outdoor we
have 52 outdoor displays distributed
around the city and an indoor facilities
this is in the hague we use indoor
displays that guide people to available
space and then to basically to city
officials we provide management software
which is actually all written in haskell
at least the back end is and with this
software they can actually look into
their facilities get a like a
life overview of a facility which places
are occupied which are free and of
course we produce a lot of data so we
can provide nice statistics which they
can use to kind of inform their policies
regarding cycling so last week we opened
a new facility in Amsterdam and I'm
really excited about this process is our
first facility is fully implemented in
Haskell we used to write our software
and bitin because python has a really
excellent binding to the opencv library
as open computer vision library and
which is actually maintained by
maintained by the upstream developers so
we initially chose bite into to
implement our system but if if you have
a system that is growing and growing and
getting more complexed and bitin it's
not the ideal language because you
really really miss static typing and
then you have to write unit tests and
stuff like that and it's just a lot of
work so we decided to switch to Haskell
and then not write unit tests and just
rely on the type system well still you
still have you still need to have tests
and we are slowly creating a nice
comprehensive test we'd also what I
really like about this facility is that
it's it's completely new so all the
sensors are actually mounted into the
ceiling they are integrated into the
ceiling which just looks really really
nice this is just a panoramic view there
made last week also the displays that
you see in the background there are just
a lot just green colored matrix displays
and when when a row is full it will turn
orange or when it's nearly full it will
turn orange and then when it's full it's
rat we also develop these displays
ourselves they're actually running on
raspberry PI's a you see an example of a
center like really integrated into the
ceiling it just looks beautiful and here
you can see like a clear size of this
facility that's like space for around
three thousand bicycles it's really huge
and yeah there are
cameras everywhere everywhere so when
you're walking through the facility
you're like a big brother's watching me
right but we don't record anything so
how does it work we connect these
cameras to an internal network I speed
network and we connect them to a local
facility server which is actually doing
all the image analysis why don't we
upload so we could have skipped this
facility server but then of course you
have to upload all these images through
the internet and then you have pretty
huge bandwidth requirements and these
cities are typically connected to the
Internet to DSL or 4G so you really
don't want to stream all that stuff over
the internet so we do all the analysis
locally and then just upload the
measurements to our central cluster of
course in really reality we have
multiple facilities so it looks more
like this a nice thing to mention is
that all our systems are running next to
us if I have time and I don't think I
have time anymore at the end but then I
might talk a bit about how we use next
to power our systems okay let's move
slightly to something slightly more
technical one of our of when we deliver
a bicycle facility when we install our
cameras we also need to go through a
calibration face every camera in fact
every bicycle place every every region
of interest has to be calibrated
basically what it means is that we have
to put the two images of the left and
right cameras we have to like move them
on top of each other and then we have to
adjust some parameters to calibrate that
space we have to do it for every every
place we needed a tool for that so we
wrote a web-based tool why web-based
well we work with a whole team of
calibrators and they work together on a
facility and we want to have an easy way
to distribute our software this client
to these calibrators and then yeah what
what
easier than just a web client so this
program was written in Haskell and
compiled to JavaScript to GH TJ s one of
the libraries that we used to build this
tool was actually written by my former
colleague Simon Simon wire hey thanks
Simon so this this was really a great
just came in time for us I think Simon
wrote it for one of the high schoolers
meetups here in Zurich and I guess was
just a proof of concept that it was
really for us it was just at the right
time and we pretty much relied our whole
this whole application on the library
and what is place react well it
basically encouraged the
model-view-controller pattern in haskell
so you represent your web application as
a value of this data type app the model
is encoded as the state parameter so as
a programmer you provide an initial
state and this state typically contains
all the stuff that is like useful or as
needed to buy that app for example this
list of sensors that you see on the left
that's that's part of the state the
values of each text box which step is
selected all that as part of the state
secondly you provide the view and the
view is as a function a random function
from the state to an HTML Dom tree
forget forget about the action parameter
for a moment I will explain that really
nice thing about this function is that
it's pure so there's no io involve you
can't do it you can't like connectors to
a database or whatever it's just pure
function from state to an HTML tree if
you have experience with web development
you might know that when when you want
to change something in your Dom tree you
actually have to mutate the Dom tree
they actually have to maybe remove like
a text field and then add in a new new
element well
really do that here right because it's a
pure Frenchy you go from and state to a
new HTML tree which describes your whole
web application so how does this work
well this blazer react library the name
implies uses the reacts library on
internally from from facebook or the
library doses you as use you provide a
new HTML tree the Rue the one that comes
from this function and then the library
will actually compare that def it
against the current Dom tree which is
running in your browser and then you get
a list of patches and then it will
efficiently apply those patches to the
girl model and then you have a new one
so that that's basically you don't have
to think about the old state of the Dom
tree just have to think about always but
the new the new thing you are going to
render it so it's really functional so
what are what are these actions in the
Dom tree well if I look here if you have
like an input field that has an action
parameter what you can do is you can add
an event handler with the like on the
bottom see the own value change there
you can say ok I'm going to assign an
action which is something that the user
provides to that input button so if we
so we go back to this screen so you see
a few input text fields on top each of
them has an action assigned to it
assigned to it for example the for
example the back factor has a back
factor in which changed action assigned
to it when you actually added stats
value then this action gets fired then
that actually is put into this
translation function we apply action
function which then has to return
function from the old state to the new
state so basically as a programmer you
provide a state machine
and then when you when the state has
been updated to render function is
called again and then we go go around
and around and around that's basically
how is how this works I'm really really
excited about this library and we have
been using it in anger for about a year
and it works really well the next thing
I want to talk about something
completely else as I explained we use
opencv in our facility servers and we
used to implement it in Python but now
we switch to Haskell so we had to create
a binding to open CV as i explained also
in me and the other room there are
existing bindings to open CV but there
are bindings to the old version the 2.4
our version this is actually the new
version we just open sourced it it's not
really officially announced yet we might
do that theory hectus this weekend but
you can already download the source and
make contributions to it here you see
one of our experiments that we yeah
where we use our library here we kind of
detect the kind of the depth after or
maybe the earth I should explain the
distance from the camera to the first
object inside now you can clearly see
that the bicycle is visible there what I
really like about this example is that
you can actually see the shape of the of
the floor going back so in the front
it's closer to the camera and then it's
going going away and I really like that
it's that our elven algorithm is able to
detect these even the textures in the
floor so that's that's pretty cool this
is fully developed in a scope later on I
want to do a like a little live coding
session together with one brother so it
will be oh yeah yeah how we're doing
timewise 12 minutes ok then I just go
very quickly through this of course the
most important type in a beautiful
library is a 5-4 images and opencv
actually provides a matrix type for that
but we have to wrap that
Haskell so we provide this mop type
which is just a form pointer to the
internal matrix size from opencv the
interesting thing here is we have these
phantom types that encodes some static
information about the images like the
shape which encodes the dimensions
number of dimensions of the emirate and
then for each you mention the size of
that dimension the number of channels
for example if you have a RGB image you
will have to treat color channels and
then the depth basically is to dip the
bit width of the of the of each element
can be 8 bits or 16 bits or floating
point whatever now if you look at like a
little example function and decode
function you pass it a byte string and
you get back a matrix well this is
pretty difficult but why do we fill in
for these special marks but we don't
really know why should show this we
don't really know what the parameters
are statically we only know it
dynamically so what we've done is we've
introduced this basically this maybe
type we call it D s where we can say ok
instead of knowing something statically
we only know it dynamically and as you
can see in the the decode example we
know statically that the image should
have two dimensions width height and
width but we don't know what the size of
that dimension is so we turn that into D
which means dynamic you is here slightly
more involved example it's called so
binding to the warp affine function what
does functions also she put in a source
image and a transformation matrix and
then it will transform that image
according to the matrix if you forget
about these these parameters for a bit
and look only at the input parameter and
the output output of this function you
can see ok we need two dimensions item
with and we don't care about the size of
these dimensions it can be dynamic it
can be statically known but it's fully
polymorphic and but a really nice thing
here is that we can say okay the output
of this function should have the same
dimensions and also the same size of the
dimensions as the input saving holes for
the channels and depth they also need to
be the same the second parameter this is
transformation matrix nice thing is we
can use the same data type as for images
they're both just made matrices but this
should be a 2 by 3 affine transformation
matrix and we use this little type
family to basically provide a
convenience function for mapping this
list of 2 2 comma 3 do this statically
or there's this list of where with all
the DS wrappers around it functions can
fill an open CV so we catch those
exceptions in C++ and then we read that
in our own exception exception type we
also have support from mutable matrices
because for example when you're drawing
something you want to draw to an
existing image that's of course an
immutable operation so besides mods we
have mutable matrices and we can we have
conversion functions between them well
we can also convert them in an instance
unsafe matter the safe conversion
functions they copy the data and say if
they don't copy but then you have to
ensure that you're not going to use the
mutable matrix after you after you have
converted one of the crucial libraries
that we used in this project was in line
C was written by my former colleague
Francisco thanks Francisco is really
useful library or this allows you to do
we have a small example allows you to in
line C code or C++ code inside your
Haskell code and it does not using a
quazy quote you see that block party
quote you just passed some C++ code and
then it what if they'll do is it will
wrap
that code in in a function put its
function in a see file and then write it
will make a foreign imports ffi import
to that function and call that import at
that spot in the code and you can use a
high school values inside the C code you
can splice them in or quota min really
really useful yeah so I yeah we had to
have a live coding session but I think
we ran out of time sure yeah yes yeah
yeah I have a few slides actually about
next it's also functional language
actually when we opened our system in
Utrecht I got these nice presents from
the next OS developers these nice
stickers and coffee cups yeah because we
are one of well I'm not sure but we are
like a you're actually using necks in
production and it's pretty uncommon so
what is next it's a functional language
purely functional which is very
essential to tunics and it's a whole
ecosystem of tools we have next packages
it's a big get github repository of
expressions next expressions for
packaging or for linux packages and OSX
packages then you have next OS which is
a part of the next packages repository
which is a set of modules for
configuring configuring a Linux system
and actually we run next to us on all
our production machines even on our own
workstation so actually I I've here see
if that works under doesn't work sorry
I yeah so here we have what we call Umi
OS running it's our own extension to
next to s yeah it's basically just an
annex mode of a Linux system with X
monads and that's what we use to develop
our software you see one of the examples
of our opencv library let's move back
then we use Hydra which is a continuous
integration server based on next
basically pulls in commits that we push
to our ghetto proposed freedom builds
everything it's also also functions as a
binary cash so when my brother
implements something for example in
opencv and pushes that and when I later
pool eskom it I don't have to build
everything again because Hydra has
already built it and I can just
automatically download it from Hydra
it's really speed up development and
finally we use next hops which is a
deployment tool for deploying code to
our network of machines well the really
unique thing about next is that it
doesn't use the traditional filesystem
hierarchy standard but it uses it it
installed so far and in it in this
Finkel the next door and it prefixes
every package with a hash which
basically the hash of the all the inputs
to create that package and that enables
you to actually install multiple
versions of the same for example
software library alongside each other
and still be able to use one or both at
the same time as I mentioned we use our
own extension to the next OS cold gloomy
OS now let's skip this for a moment yeah
for development we really use Nick shell
which we which brings you into an
environment which contains all the acts
all the dependencies that you that you
have that are required as mentions we
use Hydra Hydra us also
configured using a next expression and
this here are less all the machines that
we have in the field and then when we
all know sorry so it is this is a this
lists all the jobs all the projects that
we want to build and either i will then
build them and it also contains a nice
web interface that you can see what what
went wrong and finally we use next ops 2
then deploy you pass it a few
expressions describing your logical
configuration of the system and the
physical configuration logical basically
means what surfaces should be running on
the machines and the physical
configuration explains things like the
hardware that you are using which file
systems that you're going to use and the
network settings and yeah the nice thing
of splitting that up is that you can
actually test your system but in a
virtual environment by using the same
logical configuration but swapping the
physical configuration for maybe a
virtualized environments and you can run
your complete network in a virtual
environment it's really useful yeah and
then we use next hopes to deploy and
what next hopes will actually do it will
actually also provision machines for
example if you're on AWS we aren't
currently we use hetzner but then next
ops will actually boots or create ec2
machines installed next OS on them and
then deploy your codes to these machines
that's that's it
yeah so maybe tomorrow or so at the
other place we have a table for opencv
and yeah we have scheduled a live coding
talk but my talk just took too long so
maybe we can do it they're locally and
autumn are here we actually we have this
room for the whole day tomorrow so it
can easily schedule the live session
tomorrow I think that will be the best
probably sometime along with other talk
you will see super yeah so if anybody
has a question feel free to ask me
anything Sheriff's should not probably
whose number of light switch over phone
number and yeah really leaks their true
I think this was a picture of the yeah
that's actually a lot less let's move
back yeah you're this one yeah so this
is actually one of our facilities that
we were that is not running our system
is running a competing system and we
have to interface with that system
because it's part of the period bicycle
in Utrecht these blips that you see here
is this auto system uses physical
switches and the bicycle racks which are
wireless switches and they have like
network problems sometimes so sometimes
the network just malfunctions and then
you get these drops in there yeah so I
saw most like to show this example to
clients a Eurasian by that system you
should buy our yeah sure yep I was like
fun around hands where every like Tommy
mr. really ask Jesus New York yeah we
used to be used opencv and of course we
have an algorithm but that just goes
functions from open
v and we just use that in a clever way
no they're they're really simple
standard off-the-shelf 80-degree cameras
yeah oh yeah the one in one of the
screenshots yeah we used to use these to
60 degree cameras because they allow you
to put a camera in the middle of a row
and you can see the right side and the
left side and you don't have to buy two
separate units so but we will not really
happy with 360-degree cameras because
the where you do the measurements is
actually in the end the far edges of the
screen which contains the least amount
of pixels so that's because of the
distortion goes to lands basically no
actually use the same the same algorithm
yeah yeah yeah sure this is gate asking
other people and this does he showers
well we don't tell them I mean they
didn't care that they really because we
kind of provide the system as a surface
we also be running it on our own clouds
service and they just care about that it
works and they don't care they don't
care that it's implemented in in Haskell
well yeah they do they do care about the
size of the company because you these
are baked European tenders if you have
to go through because these are really
costly projects like in the 100,000 to
400,000 range or maybe even half a
million so you have to go through a
tendon and you have to show that you are
like a healthy company you can do that
for example by part partnering with
bigger companies we have done it in the
past yeah yes yeah yeah we do we do at
the moment so we're working on a new
improved version of this where we
actually because one of the big problems
is when when you actually you have to
draw all these things by hand and then
for every region of interest you have to
do a calibration step which might take
like two to three minutes per / place
actually you need to put a bike in there
to do to actually calibrate it correctly
so we also have like a physical person
there puts in a bike and then and then
we at our office we calibrate it and
then we tell them okay move to the next
one it's a lot of work and that's also
costly part of our solution and we are
now trying to automate that by basically
providing a developing a
three-dimensional model of your facility
and using that model to do the
calibration and we are now working on
that yeah Raptors how much you got how
much relation to handle summer's day you
go through every day so for the central
surface not that much because we just
upload measurements to that and we'll do
you know how many measurements we have
maybe vehicles and change notice
otherwise is otherwise I own say if it's
a change or go to a change and even
thousand like time to all facilities
yeah I think now around 8,000 bicycles I
have a few million host data yeah
sophomore on the year so its many miles
actually yeah Steve y'all know that the
white version slide in a minute a
no-hassle Persian it's dr. trying to ten
seconds and it can easily move and all
factors transitive fourth-year thing but
that's already way quicker than what is
needed the city just gather this get
stolen like 50 seconds or something yeah
sure you're frozen very general and we
considered
using equal parts is much simpler yeah
yeah so we actually we got started out
as a car detection company and then
later we switch to bicycles because
that's what's really a niche market
nobody was was active in and for cars we
use we used to use sonar technology or
ultrasound so we emit a sound wave and
then the echo comes back and then we
know something is under that sense or
that didn't work for bicycles so we
switch to to an optical system but now
we're also actually using the optical
systems to detect by cars again we have
just like in the beginning of this year
we have deployed in Amsterdam an outdoor
parking facility for cars using the same
technology as for bikes yeah and it's
actually it's indeed easier to detect
cars because they're bigger and yeah
yeah yeah yes I you yeah that's a good
question yeah yeah if somebody is
standing in front of your region of
interest and you can't see it right so
we we can detect that that somebody is
standing on phone because we can see
okay we seen object but it sits in front
of the area that we are interested in
when we detect that we stop we stop
measuring for a we basically we don't
update that spot so as long as
somebody's in front we don't update but
then when he walks away we can see it
again and then you measure and usually
people are not standing for a long time
in the same place in the facility
because they parked the bikes and they
walk away so not really a problem but
you do have to detect it otherwise the
when people are working from theory or
measurements will like flip around yeah
yes sir this life online and it will be
yeah yeah we'll be at T I think I did
get a proposed three of the Aeschylus
group here yeah okay oh yes David why
did you try something simpler such as
you know if you close the rack flowers
popping up easily detector to detect and
I you Jesus yeah why a thing yeah so
with the like with a physical flack you
mean right I'm actually competing
products do that well they don't
actually detect the flag they just use a
flag to indicate okay this place is like
occupied of course you don't then don't
have that information digitally
available and you can't like put that on
this place but of course the
disadvantage of are like a physical
solution is that you actually have to
mount that to the bicycle rack and there
are multiple types of different Rex and
then you have to provide like a mounting
solution for every rack and that's
really involved there's also one of the
reasons we don't use physical switches
because that's what our competitor
competitor is using then you also have
to write make custom mounts for every
type of different bicycle rack and we
kind of we we also telling cities the
advantage of our system is that it's
completely independent of the bicycle
rack you can if you don't even need a
bicycle rack even like read free spots
in the areas were just wrestlers any
like randomly discreet and no we don't
put you of course you yeah we re
starting to do it amber the interesting
thing is you can also reverse the system
for example when you have like an
emergency door in a facility it's
important that there are no bicycles in
front of the door right because when a
fire breaks out people have to move
through the door so what we can do is we
can
throw in a region of interest before
that door and then basically reversal
system so when something is in there we
notify the guard and then he can remove
the bicycle and then the works in the
reverse way yeah yes yes yes abandoned
bicycles yes we do that that's 11 the
additional feature of our system it's
one for guiding cyclists but indeed the
other as detecting what we call orphans
bicycles and it's really a big problem
in the Netherlands like twenty percent
of each facility is occupied by bikes
that are never collected again and
that's and if you realize that to build
a bicycle one place 11 place is like
3,000 euros and yeah this facility here
is like 3,000 places yeah so that's a
huge amount of like twenty percent it's
a huge amount and yeah okay yeah I think
we have to maybe one more question and
then yes in the back say we ever easy
access yes exactly I'll keep that in
mind okay thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
