in some fairly significant way towards
policy related matters looking at the
internet from the perspective of legal
regulatory and policy matters and we
have a star-studded cast people to
discuss their experiences and
perspectives on this subject and then
after we have our break we're going to
dive into more technological view of
things specifically search in cloud
computing and then finally a look at the
potential future paths for the Internet
so it's my pleasure to begin this
morning by introducing Andrew McLaughlin
andrew is a colleague from quite some
time now he spent time as the chief
policy officer and vice president of i
can and then joined google in a similar
role as our chief policy officer andrew
has had I'm not going to go through your
bio Andrew but he's had perspectives
drawn from many different areas but
perhaps most important he's done a lot
of international interactions so his
perspectives are well beyond the
domestic and therefore even more
important for a global system like the
Internet to benefit from his topic this
morning at least according to the chart
here is the net as a platform for
democracy and I sincerely hope that it
has been and will continue to be but
let's find out what Andrew has to say
about that good morning injury so now we
move two layers eight nine and perhaps
ten for the next hour and a half I
retitled the talk information is power
so what happens when the network
democratizes access to information and I
decided to go with a Star Wars Ian
narrative structure to to talk about it
and of course I'm
coming up on 40 and so Star Wars to me
means episodes 4 through 6 not one two
three I don't even know how to describe
that narrative arc and I won't try so
here's the the backdrop for the story
that I want to tell about the
interaction between the network that
we're all engaged in building and
maintaining and human governance or
democracy in some broad sense the
backdrop is what what I refer to is my
good morning email most of you probably
have like you know morning routines that
are pleasurable you know they involve
coffee or orange juice a run or
something like that my morning routine
usually involves an extremely scary peek
at my email to see what's come in in the
last 24 hours and it's usually something
like this I you know extremely urgent
immediate priority response required or
else youtube blocked in fill in the
blank and my sort of graphical
representation of my mornings is this
and so you know from the sort of Google
side of things I find that we're
constantly running into governmental
opposition and what I want to do is try
to explain why I think that's happening
in almost every respect when I talk
about Google up here I just mean the
internet Google happens to be a kind of
a noted avatar for the Internet these
days but the things that I'm talking
about are fairly general to the network
so the narrative arc of course is a new
hope the Empire Strikes Back and then
return of the jedi the new hope is you
know a broad set of trends and themes
that the internet has has been fueling
over the last 15 to 20 years the most
important one of course is
democratization and decentralization of
power and this has been enabled because
the cost of creating the cost of
distributing and the cost of accessing
information has plummeted one of the
things that's peculiar about you know
working for an Internet company is that
you're in a declining cost business you
know every year the same unit
capacity the same unit of storage the
same unit of cpu processing power is
cheaper than it was the year before and
so the the ability of the average
teenager with a mac laptop to create
incredibly professional looking quality
videos and music and and text is rather
staggering and the kind of somewhat
overly ambitious way to describe this is
is that we're seeing a shift from
consumption culture to creation culture
you know the old Apple ad from 1984 kind
of captured what most people felt about
the last hundred years but you know the
the medium media of distribution of
information went from the you know many
the one too many mass passive
infantilizing sort of mode to a much
more interactive and creative mode and I
think it's you know because we're humans
there it's not like there's not going to
be a role for passive consumption of
things mass produced by others but we've
seen a notable and I think quite an
inspiring resurgence of individual
creative expression enabled by as I said
cheaper computing power cpu processing
transmission and and more ubiquitous
access so I'm not going to go through
all these because you are all internet
people and you know what these are but
you know when I talk to audiences that
are not composed of internet nerds these
are the examples that I show I try to
show people about you know deviantart
which is a great site that allows you to
you know upload your artistic creations
other people can buy them people can
comment on them create communities give
encouragement Wikipedia is obviously a
great example of kind of collaborative
sharing of information flickr prosper
and kiva are two sites that i'm quite
high on because they because they enable
peer-to-peer lending so you know
individuals about prosper for example
allows somebody who has money to find
somebody who wants to
money understand some basic data about
what kind of a risk profile they have
and then make the loan it's the kind of
thing that in a pre-internet age would
have been inconceivable at scale and now
it's it's a business and kiva is sort of
the same thing applied to micro lending
where you know people can give a hundred
dollars loan it out to you know three
different projects in in in 35 and then
$30 units and and and connect with
people on the other side of the planet
in a way that wouldn't have been
possible obviously the Internet's
democratizing the ability of people to
speak so you get all these awesome
political blogs from the left and from
the right if you want to find out what's
going on in Zimbabwe you're much
likelier to get an interesting and and
meaningful story from a blogger inside
Zimbabwe than you are from the BBC
stringer based in Johannesburg and you
know music is something I care a lot
about and you can see just these kind of
staggering productions of you know 19
you know a 19 year old sitting in a
bedroom providing and curated you look
at you know an entire music scene with
music files and analysis and so forth
you know online communities are sort of
another expression of this twitter is
the sort of fat of the day the Twitter
website that I've been showing just
because it amuses the hell out of me is
one that gathers a text sent over
Twitter that should not have been that
should not have been sent it's an
amazing site actually to to take a look
at it's you know i will now
if Carla's coughing it must be time to
move on you really don't and by you I
mean me you know there's there there are
these 3d worlds that again you know even
eight or nine years ago given what
broadband cost given what kind of you
know data center costs were and so forth
it would have been inconceivable really
to have something at the level of you
know a real-life 3d reconstruction of
Dublin down here you can see this is a
real-life exact replica of me in Dublin
here you can see my real life replica
hitting on probably a you know 53 year
old guy from Los Angeles but anyway but
my point is that my point is that you
you know you get you get a lot economics
are driving a tremendous amount of the
democratization that we've been talking
about for sort of you know 15 years more
broadly to me the most exciting things
you know in in in in the creation
culture that's emerged on the net or
remixes so these are people taking bits
of found text and repackaging them and I
think because I don't Oh does this will
this audio hookup work if i plug it in
I'll just show you one you know a
particularly enjoyable one that I've
seen lately which is roots
warning at all let me just move it so
that what I'm about to show you is just
you know a couple of seconds of one of
my favorite one of my favorite things
out on the net right now which is
remixes that use so that for example you
can see the for some reason somebody
thought that it would be fun to start a
meme around 70s TV shows and the
beginnings but all swapped out with Star
Trek and Star Wars and other images so
you know you can see like like the
beginning of the love boat and all the
special guests are you know from from
from early episodes of Star Wars or Star
Trek including like Carl two Cylon and
of course Charo but shall we say 1
million American dollars Death Star
plans are not in the main computer your
mama's going on a date you dig that a
date like the nice restaurant some fine
music constellation think that she's
going with me to gonna have a good time
can we take that
look man I'm in the proud of my life but
the baby where I got to gonna make me
some money again we're gonna fight I let
my turn me to champion of the world only
you could be so cold the Imperial Senate
will not steal things when they you
protect a diplomatic man i invite
infernal race i'm the demon nobody i
quit on you when you clear out a deep
chart with willie the pimp yeah you look
out to visit to find your girl you
selling out clothes and rain my silver
brushes you know what you're talking
about I'm a member of the Imperial
Senate on a diplomatic mission to
Alderaan aren't you papa me girl out
Papa you so you never forget it anyway
you get the idea that the point is this
sort of thing presents is is is it is it
is is a really really fun amusing
example of the kind of human creativity
that's that that's being enabled by the
net and that by the way presents a very
profound challenge to copyright law so
everything that we've seen up there just
now is copyrighted to some big important
studio I don't know who owns the
copyright to the old James Earl Jones
movies from the 70s but it's probably
not that Lucas Films and so by mixing
these things together you know you end
up with something which is
transformative Lee new but is it is
certainly in the view of those Studios
probably a tantamount to copyright
infringement anyway the last thing that
I want to mention in terms of creation
culture is just a sort of cool thing to
be excited about is you know witness
which is to say people filming the
beatings of monks in Myanmar feeding
filming the the shooting of protesters
in Tibet filming police misconduct in
the United States of the United Kingdom
we now have the ability to you know kind
of do the citizens scale reporting that
we were always very excited about
alright so it's not just a few nerds
it's sort of the default experience for
a teenager now to be able to speak to
the entire world
you know when I think any of us were
teenagers or at least most of us here
you know you couldn't really get on the
radio TV or newspapers which were the
only real mass media media out there now
for you know somebody in high school
they can speak to the entire world
potentially to everybody who's got
access to the internet which is
increasingly close to the entire world
um I i will just you know mention that
we're democratizing knowledge about the
world there's a you know a staggering an
impressive array of data that's now
available on platforms like Google Maps
you know here's a good one the beer
hunter which you know uses google maps
to help you find in Toronto the source
of every currently open beer wine and
liquor store with their hours and color
coded by what's open right now so you
know a lot of important things are being
done through Maps mashups you know we
talked about democratizing our majors
are deluded about democratizing
democracy itself and the government's
because I think that's a pretty well
covered topic I won't say much about it
other than to say that you know we're
seeing a moves to utilize commodity
technologies commodity computing
platforms to make government more
transparent to make it more
participatory to make it more
collaborative to make it more efficient
that's a good thing there is of course a
dark side to all this democracy to which
we have to acknowledge I mean you can
look at the website of the El loc so
martyrs brigade and see you know
glorification zuv people who have you
know blown up dozens of innocent
civilians at a pizza parlor you can see
stormfront for example which is a
community for racists so if you you know
dislike blacks Jews or whatever here's a
community where you can find other
people talk to them post things and and
and feel part of a larger group but in
general I want to say it's basically a
hopeful story about what the technology
is enabling so that's the new hope part
the Empire striking back is something
that I don't touch on just a little bit
later in a little gory
detail because for a technical group and
I want to talk a little bit about the
technology by which this is happening
but you know the Empire striking back
touches on Google in all kinds of
different ways I just pulled out you
know a couple of examples of things that
we've experienced in the last you know
couple of years google web search is
subject to censorship in all kinds of
ways and it's not just in China so China
is the most obvious and kind of best
example but mature sophisticated
democracies Germany France India Brazil
these are countries that have censorship
rules and censorship regimes and they're
validated by a democratic process so you
can't simply say that you know that the
free flow of information is being
blocked by nefarious governments there
are actual differences of values among
cultures that we have to struggle with
and when you embrace democracy you also
embrace the idea that those values will
we will be expressed through law through
regulation through policy so Germany's
got a unique historical experience and
its people have regularly revalidated a
social consensus in Germany that
pro-nazi speech extreme violence
glorification of war these things are
illegal and should be prohibited they
don't even care if it's effective or not
it's a form of social expression of
disapproval and it matters to them on
that basis we recently had a blow-up in
South Korea where the South Koreans have
implemented the new rule that requires
real name verification for online speech
so if you want to upload a video to
YouTube or you want to comment on it
their requirement would be the uploaders
or commenters have to go in and provide
and verify their real names and their
national ID numbers before they can
write anything or upload and so to our
cultural way of thinking this is a
flamboyant violation of privacy because
it violates the notion of anonymous
speech and we kind of think about
privacy as being often rather synonymous
with anonymity or the non identification
of yourself with things and in Korea
their logic was if you require everybody
to be logged in and use their real names
then when someone violates another
person's privacy you know who to track
down and go get and it's dissin sense
people from violating each other's
privacy
anyway there many many different
examples that I could point to you about
where the Empire is striking back where
those who have built their power around
the control of information in the
pre-internet age are trying to extend
that control into the internet so from
my way of thinking there are sort of a
there's an important set of
commonalities among some of these big
actors so if you think about movie
studios TV companies estate mapping
agency a book publisher record producer
these are all institutions that have
have exercised control over the
distribution of information to use erics
term yesterday they depend on some form
of scarcity in order to make money in
part so what they also have in common by
the way is that they've traditionally
had both a venture capital function and
a distribution function so I think about
movie studios the venture capital
function is you put money down on the
table to get a movie made and then you
profit from it above your investment
they also had control though over
distribution of that movie in a world of
scarcity the scarcity comes from the
fact that there's only n number of movie
screens in the country there's only n
number of seats or our end times
whatever number of seats in front of
those movie screens if you're going to
make money the only way you can make
money on your movie is to get the movie
on the screen in front of the seats and
have people collect money in order to go
see the movie the Internet has blown
that apart but the same model applies
with books records TV shows you know in
TV it's certain number of channels
certain number of hours in the day if
you can't get your show into one of
those slots you can't make money with
records it's you know bin space with
books its shelf space if you can't get
your book on the bookshelf you can't
sell it and you won't make any money
boonton so the Internet has blown all of
that wide open it does not jeopardize
the venture capital function it just
makes it a hell of a lot riskier because
of the way that you could use
distribution to ensure some minimal
amount of revenues I mean even the
biggest turkey films you could plan on
marketing the hell out of and getting
some amount of your money back even as
you hope for a hit so anyway these
institutions are trying to figure out
how to maintain the control and
that they've had over distribution in
many ways it means they're trying to
recreate scarcity on the internet where
there has been none so to me that's the
kind of Empire Strikes Back phase and
the question the sort of Return of the
Jedi question is you know is there a way
to try to maintain the things that are
great about the internet and still meet
to some acceptable degree the demands of
these threatened institutions to
preserve some role for themselves in the
new world some by the way just shouldn't
write like so for example a state
mapping agency in India which under
Indian law has a legal monopoly over all
maps distributed in India that just
simply should not be allowed to continue
there are others however like like I
think book publishers who have performed
very valuable social functions or
newspapers and will continue to perform
valuable social functions and for which
a role needs to be made so just to sort
of wrap up you know we've got these kind
of like big forces that I've mentioned
already information is power the
Internet is democratizing access to
information democratization is another
way to say disruption the internet is
disrupting these these modes of social
organization we're seeing a consumption
culture shift to a creation culture and
the last one which will sort of set us
up for the panel is we've got a
borderless internet and yet a paradigm
of the application of law that is very
bordered so you've got chunks of
territory defined by lines on a map and
within those borders a particular set of
rules apply and as i said earlier many
of them are actually democratically
constituted rules that present a threat
to the free flow of information that the
internet has now if i can just say yeah
sort of a word or two about you know at
a sort of theoretical level it's
important to think through kind of the
the sort of values questions so what i
mean by that is when we talk about these
problems of a conflict over control as
it applies to the internet what values
are in play in other words when somebody
is trying to exercise control over the
internet what value are they trying to
vindicate and this is just sort of a you
know a short list of some of the options
you might be trying to vindicate
individual liberty in order to sort of
preserve the freedom of individuals to
do what they want you might be trying to
preserve a kind of ordered Liberty which
is to say you preserve the freedom of
individuals to do what they want up
until the point at which they conflict
an individual's interests conflict with
those of others you might be trying to
promote tolerance and coexistence and
this is actually a very interesting one
if you think about india the it do to
massively oversimplify but maybe convey
a grain of truth the indian conception
of the state is a conception that's all
around tolerance and coexistence not the
flourishing of individual tastes and
preferences in an atomized kind of way
so when Google runs across this it's
because there's a video that for example
paradises the Mahatma Gandhi so yeah
there's like a Gandhi striptease video
and even Indians that we you know that
that I would find to be typically very
simpatico which is to say Western
educated you know grown up in multiple
cultures or whatever they will generally
agree that things which offend different
religions or defend offend the sort of
icons of the Indian state or society
should be censored because the
alternative is people killing each other
so it's just a view that like why would
you care about you know a blaspheming
Muhammad when the outcome of that could
well be riots on the streets of Mumbai
in in a week's time and so it's just a
different conception of kind of what
society is about not so much the
vindication of the individual but
tolerance and coexistence and so you
might be trying to exercise control over
the network to achieve that the Chinese
argument is political social economic
stability we need to exercise control
over the network to maintain social
cohesion and the economic growth that
that has improved their lives so much
over the last 30 years it might just be
maintaining power we need to control the
network because we don't want an
opposition to form and we need to stay
in power
a suppression of unwanted actions or
beliefs or Creed's your face this is
kind of the Germany example suppressing
Nazi speech is an important value to
them another way to think about it is
the vindication of democratic judgments
you might say the network should be
regulated in whatever way that the
democracy and the people having voted or
chosen their representatives decides so
anyway I list all those because I think
there's this interesting question about
whether the internet itself embodies a
normative value in other words we've
seen this rhetoric over the last 20
years really that the internet is in and
of itself an embodiment of a conception
of individual freedom individual liberty
the right to express the right to read
the right to hear and that there's
something unique about the architecture
of the internet that makes this so
actually think you can make a pretty
good argument that that the way the
internet has been built whether you kind
of use as a shorthand the end-to-end
argument the idea that the endpoints are
the ones where the intelligence resides
that that embody is a notion of kind of
individual autonomy and freedom that
will come into conflict with cultural
preferences or some of these other
normative values that societies may
quite legitimately decide that they are
going to pursue so you know a way to
think about this is that you know
there's a kind of like architecture
point which which john gilmore has
expressed a semi the net interpret
censorship is damaging routes around it
in other words getting packets to their
destinations is the highest normative
value of the Internet packet starts here
packet gets there and the network's job
is to deliver it that's its its value it
is content-neutral content blind but
that's the normative value it embodies
another way to think about it is sort of
an anti Geographic point in other words
the value of the Internet is that it
disrespects geography I can you know
Skype with my wife across the planet in
near real time and the fundamental value
of the Internet is that it does not stop
or slow down for national borders or try
to instantiate local values the one I
kind of like is just the idea that what
what the Internet as an architectural
matter does end and therefore bleeding
over into sort of the world of normative
values is locates power at the edge in
other words it's at the application
layer and with the endpoints of the
network that real power lies and the
network itself i doesn't interpose
itself between me and the people I want
to communicate with so I'm you know so
then if you do kind of a formula here
you've got your distributed architecture
you've got geographic ubiquity you've
got democratization of production
distribution accent what is that that
all equal up to well it equals up to at
the moment a hell of a lot of conflict
and a lot of fights over control over
information and the ability of the
internet to to meet it what is the
proper role for governments in this in
this formula well you know one one that
you might say one answer that you might
give is to advance some normative values
so if you're trying to you know your job
as a government is to try to maintain
social stability and to make that true
on the internet just as it is anywhere
else I think there's another argument
that you can make which is that the role
of the government's is basically to hold
the network together so not to screw up
the thing which has generated so much
creative expression economic growth and
so forth and and to think about its job
it's making sure that the internet does
not collapse on itself and so you might
be able to meld these two together and
say advance your normative goals but
only insofar as you're not actually
threatening the ability of the internet
to maintain a globally interconnected
network so i think i'll close there I'll
just you know note that there is a
tremendous amount of sort of pressure on
google and i think if we if we think
about the panel next as being a place
where we can talk about some of these
apply principles i won't go into them in
detail let me just mention one thing
whoops let me just collapse this
oops there we go ladies mention one oops
that didn't work well anyway we'll focus
in on China I don't want to mention you
know one just a couple of sort of
details about how censored this by the
way just a list of countries that are
doing censorship right now these are
just the ones that I've run into in the
last year and so you know you'll note a
significant number of actual democracies
on the list I just want to you know say
a couple of words about what's happening
in China just because we you know sort
of touched on it in this room a little
bit yesterday and I think it's worth
talking about so this is an example of
how a government that is seeking to
vindicate a normative set of normative
values that are in conflict with the
Internet can go about doing it and by in
conflict with I mean jeopardizing the
basic interoperable nature of the
network and the principle of decision
making at the edges so the great
firewall or is the Chinese call it the
the Golden Shield project uses a couple
of just basic censorship techniques they
do straightforward IP blocking of hosts
at the isp level they do this on all
kinds of different protocols they just
don't allow packets to advance toward a
particular set of IP ranges they do DNS
blocking they block dns lookups of
various descriptions they use DNS
poisoning and redirection so that they
spoof destinations on the internet and
interrupt your we interrupted flow of
packets that you were intending and
replacing it with something else there
are a number of search specific
censorship techniques that they use they
like pay they pay attention to the
queries that are being sent to google
they use packing keyword filtering
across all protocols they use the tcp
reset tactic which is a particularly
from my perspective kind of sleazy and
troubling this use of a standardized
interaction where you know they will
just decide that a certain number of
queries from from a particular subnet is
unacceptable send out tcp reset packets
this is a big problem at universities
and internet cafes where a single bad
user in their in their view a troubling
user can lead to the entire subnet being
knocked out for 30 minutes you can of
course set your machine to ignore reset
packets but most people don't because it
would not be a standard standardized way
of behaving the administrative
mechanisms are very vast and complex and
we don't have time to talk about them
but an interesting thing in China is
that they really are obsessively focused
on what we call it the 3 t's in the 2
c's it's Taiwan Tibet Tiananmen Square
massacre the two seas are the cult
meaningful and gong or what they
described as a cult and the control of
the Communist Party so when you touch on
one of those forbidden subjects you will
trigger one of these mechanisms of
information control over the network and
if you don't generally speaking they
leave you alone and so either that's
encouraging or that's troubling because
it's either a pretty broad set of
important political topics or it's a
small set of relatively unimportant
things depending on your point of view
so I just raised this because it's an
interesting example of some of the
standardized behaviors that we've been
talking about can in fact be hijacked by
governments that want to exercise some
form of control for their own purposes
so with that I think we should turn to
the panel let me just say by the way
there are a lot of ways to talk about
these kind of control impulses child
protection privacy network regulation
and be open Internet the question of
security I should have put on this list
there are lots of arguments that you can
bring to the table for why elements of
control need to be built into the
