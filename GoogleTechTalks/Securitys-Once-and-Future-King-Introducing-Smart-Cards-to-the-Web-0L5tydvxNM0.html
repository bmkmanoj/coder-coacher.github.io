I couples such labor and Krishna
shatabdi from gemalto to talk about
smart cards and the web and some very
interesting things that they are talking
about you know where they meet my name
is Rajesh mukerji and I'm a PM on search
it's really good to have them or here
today so let's just get started and keep
our questions to the end mostly but if
you if something pops up feel free to
interrupt keep this as an interactive as
possible all yours thanks argit so today
actually I am going to take you on a
brief journey in the world of smart
cards I will talk about basics what
smart cards are what is the
infrastructure they fit in and what are
the applications and their corresponding
software stacks which utilize a security
of smart card and finally at the end we
will see that how all of this scales if
you want to provide the security of
smart cards to the web so starting with
the basics first the hardware device
itself the way I like to see smart cards
are that they are they are computers
they have all the elements of computers
but they don't have the keyboard or the
mouse the human interface device
interface but they do have CPUs volatile
memory ram non-volatile memory where we
put our applications data and read only
memory which contains the operating
system that is that goes in the smart
card there is a very domain specific
term called integrated circuit God so
smart card is also known as I CC which
means that you have an eye on line on
which you put the data and that's how
smart card software gets the data to
process on moving on to the security
device itself first and foremost it's a
temper resistant device which means that
if you try to attack the hardware itself
it has some inbuilt mechanisms and it's
such that it either shut it shut itself
down or provide a way to recover from it
and and counter-attack
the attacker itself it also has lot of
cryptographic implementation most of the
algorithms that are out there are
implemented in the cart in software and
sometimes even the chip manufacturer
provide a very sophisticated secure
algorithm implementation and another
interesting thing that we do in our
industry is that when we make a product
or when we launch a technology smart
card-based technology we try to evaluate
it internally as well as we send it to
some evaluation labs and compliance with
some industry standards so Phipps is a
federal standard from united states
government and common criteria is an
international standard which which
basically states how the process how the
development process of this product
should be it should be in a secure
location source configuration management
should be this way and how the security
algorithms should be implemented also
since since we are a security aware
industry we also hire some word class
security experts and cryptographers and
which help us actually counter attack
the threats that come to the security of
the card and its owner so that bring us
to smart cut the communication protocol
so actually I I forgot to mention in the
first slide everything about smart card
is mostly standardized in Izu there is a
standard called iso 7816 which talks
about what are the mechanical physical
electrical characteristics of a smart
card chip so it's a pretty standard
device and in the same spirit the
communication protocol that is used by
smart cards is also standardized and it
is defined in chapter 3 of 7860 the card
so the car does not have a power of its
own it does not have a battery so it
typically acts in a master-slave
combination where card is the slave and
the host portion supplies power and send
some command to it and smart card
respond to that particular command
it's a synchronous protocol and the
interesting thing here is that the
protocol the communication protocol that
is used to communicate with smart cards
also overloads as an application
protocol essentially transport protocol
and application protocol there is a very
thin line between them and there is some
history some legacy reasons behind them
and foremost I think is because of the
resource constrained nature of the
device so here is a picture which is
showing how how this flow happens from a
transport protocol perspective there is
an application with sent command to a
reader I will talk about what reader is
later on through the reader it reaches
the card and card has a software
processor very maps that command to a
particular function so these are so
smart cards actually have various facets
various forms and these are few of them
the most famous is the same card and
actually everybody in this room i'm
pretty sure that has a mobile phone and
mobile phones also use smart cards which
are called sim cards and same is
actually the backbone of GSM industry in
the sense that it is the piece which
which authenticate you and your mobile
equipment to the operators network and
it also plays a major role in the it
also plays a very major role in again
doing what we called roaming then there
is a credit card form factor which you
know again we are familiar with in
United States though when banks issue
cred US credit card or a debit card it
is mostly a magnetic strip card but in
most of the European countries it is
mandated by banks to have smart chip
cards then then there is an another
interesting format which is a format of
us big tokens like you see mass mass
memory tokens the difference here is
that this time instead of you know
carrying a separate reader in which you
insert the card the reader and the card
are together in form of a USB token and
finally this is a latest new form factor
if you get a US passport these days
smartcard chip is embedded in the power
of the passport so that when you pass
through customs line you and it's
actually a contactless smart card so
that you can wave it from a distance and
your data is read so little bit about
the business verticals to give an idea
the segments in which we use smart cuts
and actually when I was gathering some
numbers I was myself very surprised to
see we actually the smart card industry
has manufactured in 2007 alone 3.5
billion smart cards which is like 3.5
billion operating system software that
goes with these tiny computers and and
here you know there are four areas the
first the top left is governments use
smart cuts or epass ports even to give
the cards to citizens to authenticate
for example DoD also using it here
corporations enterprises uzak financial
institution banking very famous in
European countries and the last and the
most important the place where you know
lot of smart cards are used every year
is in the GSM industry network with
network operators so what I'm going to
do to have a focus in this presentation
is that I'm going to concentrate on on
these three form factors these three
segments and although all of the scales
to same but in order to have a focus I
am just going to talk more about how
smart cuts play a role in desktop
infrastructure and then we will see how
how they could you know have a role to
play in the security of web applications
so as I talked about infrastructure and
I had mentioned earlier that smart cards
they do not have a power of their own
they do not have sort of a battery so in
order to draw power they need to be
inserted in a device which is called a
smart card reader which is further
connected to the PC mostly nowadays why
I use me interface and and because it's
a device you need a driver and that
driver is actually a standard USB class
called CCID and it's part of all the
operating
system today so in that sense readers
provide you a plug-and-play sort of an
experience on top of the reader layer
reader driver layer is another layer
which provides an obstruction API so
that you could write client applications
not knowing which reader you are talking
to her which smart card you are talking
to and that's essentially called a pcsc
PCC is stands for personal computer
smart card it's basically a group that
was formed by operating system
manufacturers Apple Microsoft and smart
card reader manufactures like you know
us so so this application sits on top of
the pcs sea layer and it communicates
wire this interface to the car little
bit little bit about the history of
smart cards the first commercialization
of smart chip cards actually occurred in
1983 in France to be used for 44 44
payphones the idea was that you could
store some points in the card and you
don't need on any back-end
infrastructure or spend you know money
using your credit card form factor so as
you talk your money is getting deducted
from the paycard 1991 as I thought about
same thought is the backbone of GSM
industry in 1991 they were created 1992
saw the commercial debit card in in
France which is called cart a blue and
it's a de facto standard these days
there and now from from programmers from
an application perspective will talk
about two major events that happen in
smart card history and they are Java
card invention and a.net got innovation
so starting with with Java card which I
call a revolution in the sense that that
that we took Java to some unknown
territories to some unimaginable form
factor imagine running a java in a
device which has memory of few kb's a
cpu which is 8 to 16 bits so in that
sense it was really revolutionary
because it was not even imagine even by
the creators of Java that could run
such a form factor and here actually i
would like to also quote a very famous
quote from ex-chairman of Sun
Microsystems got McNeely who once said
that that putting Java in a smart card
is something like playing golf in a
telephone booth so so let's see what is
so revolutionary about the smart card
first and foremost the notion of
programmable smart card earlier you know
V the smart card manufacturers will
write an operating system write an
application send it to the market now
because you could program this card in a
managed language in a virtual
machine-based language we just need to
prepare an operating system may be built
in some libraries and it's the third
party which actually create applications
so it actually created some business
opportunity and we believe that the
openness of the platform also helps
there in the sense that some other
people could innovate so so the API is
the way you program it is all standard
again through sun microsystems there is
a java cut specification if you visit
Sun Microsystems website and this brings
us to a very very important even very
important thing regarding Java card was
that Java when Java was created it it
had a mantra the trying once and run
anywhere so with for Java card we took
the spirit of that mantra in the sense
that that that we use Java the language
Java platform the compiler to generate
an executable which is our file for Java
systems and then we run a stool called
converter to generate an executable
which ideally suits the environment that
smart cards provide and this sort of
pragmatism is still applied today and
and actually two notable Google open
source projects when is GWT google web
toolkit which uses java to compile the
program into javascript and then there
is a new one which is called android
which also uses java the language
compiler tools but it generates a
different format of executable then the
jar file
so some points about how how it is
different from the Java that runs on the
pc both from Java card virtual machine
and run time it actually implements a
subset of Java language in terms of
types not all types are supported there
are some specialized byte codes in order
to handle the stack implementation the
interpreter stack that that we have and
there is a special treatment of static
fields in the sense that the Java
Virtual Machine in a smart card never
terminates and always execute on a
single thread so on PC when you program
you start a program it starts a virtual
machine and you have a program running
you start another program it runs in its
own virtual machine and the static pneus
of the types are different but here we
need to do something special so that we
can still maintain the integrity sanity
of static fields of a program moving on
to the runtime portion the this is where
you know you see the biggest difference
between the application running on PC
and smart thought is that the memory
management that we have is different
from what happens on PC on PC you start
a program it creates objects in RAM
program terminates objects die but the
most of the applications for smart cards
you need to least you need to store a
state for example if you are using a
credit card debit card type application
you need to do increment decrement and
still save the state when the smart card
is plugged in so what we follow is a
persistent memory model which means that
we create objects in PEP rom where they
do not get removed if you remove the
power and another actually important
thing here is a transaction management
so like in databases when you interact
with databases send something to be
updated or deleted you want everything
to happen under a transaction similar
thing applies here but in a small form
factor and little bit more complex is
that that because smart cards can be
taken out from the reader at any point
of
time that is the power can be taken out
at any point you want to make sure that
the logic the block the block of code
that you are running if it is updating
some some fields objects either they are
updated or if your logic has not
finished things will be rolled back so
we do handle this you know correctly and
this and this is one of the difficult
areas to get it right in such a
resource-constrained device and then
because Java happened for smart cards
there is a possibility of writing
applications so a bank can write an
application and airline can write an
application and they can coexist in the
smart card so sometimes they want to
share data sometimes they do not want to
share data so there is some protection
some some help that the framework
provides which is not there in Java that
when it runs on PC and it's called
firewall this is a toy java card
application is to give you a hint of how
these applications look like so the
application in a job in java card it's
called an applet so there are some
methods that that I ignore just for a
minute so the method of interest is here
is this process method which is an entry
point for the command so if you remember
my earlier slide where I said that that
in smart cards there is a software
called AP new dispatcher which takes a
command and invokes appropriate function
so here that dispatcher is implemented
in Java where this process method
receives the AP do Java card provides a
type typed interface to the protocol and
then it dispatches or it invokes
appropriate method depending on what it
sees what the logic of a program sees in
the input
so so Java guard is really a
revolutionary technology it did real
great things for smart card industry it
showed where you can run Java but like
any other technology it we do did have
some misses some limitations and and the
two that stand out for me our first of
all that it it provided a shame on the
communication layer but it never really
tried to abstract the transport and an
application protocol differences and
with experience you have seen that it is
really important because once a program
at start to play or start to learn about
these it makes his life difficult and
lead to lot of error prone situation we
want developers programmers to rather
concentrate on the business logic that
they are putting in the application then
dealing with the transfer protocol so I
feel that this is where you know Java
card had a miss so second is that so
there is a persistent memory persistent
store in the card but but there are
there are many times need arise in
market that you put an application in
the card and you want to update it I
meant the code of it so because the
objects are still live you cannot remove
the application because objects have a
reference has our dependency on the type
itself so in order to update application
or add new feature to it you would
essentially delete then the in all the
objects belonging to it and then delete
the application and reload it so this
was one of the problem and it arrives
main mostly because we didn't have an
alternative store in the cart so these
so so Java cart had some misses and you
know whenever there is a problem it
leaves a room to do some new innovation
to leverage on a new opportunity and
that's what dotnet smart card did which
I call an innovation it we learned lot
from our Java card experiences and
implemented in a in a dotnet smart card
which also addresses you know developers
who are used to program in.net microsoft
technologies so let's see what is so
evolutionary about the smart card so
from the get-go it tried to first
eliminate the problems that that were
there in Java card so it extracted the
communication protocol it uses a
remoting infrastructure provided with
dotnet so that you treat the object in a
smart card like a remote object and you
just invoke a method on it you do not
need to know anything about the
transport or communication protocol also
it provided a native file system
accessible via API so that if you want
to to store your data in a file by doing
serialization now you could do that and
the third and actually the most
important point here was that with
dotnet came some new things such as
notion of metadata and this actually
helped us in the in the smart card in
order to implement transaction security
and some legacy support thing in a in a
in a much better way because we could
not associate that as an metadata to the
application and then there are some more
things which happened when we were on
this dried of doing dotnet smart card we
try to even push the boundaries and put
you know some sort of XML parsing in the
smart card pushing the boundaries
basically trying to experiment with how
far we can go in a small form factor and
how much we can get out of it it has a
richer type support it supports strains
collections hash tables for you know
people on PC it's you know evident so
what's new but fitting it in in a few kb
of ram and few kb of ee belong it's
really challenging same application for
dotnet smart car looks like this which
is very much how you program on pc you
just need to compile it against right
libraries and put it in the cart and it
works
so so now we are at a very interesting
you know turn in the journey which is
talking about applications so these are
actually not the applications but the
categories of application that smart
card have these are very broad
categories authentication it's an
authentication device cryptography to do
digital signature encryption it has the
secure storage so that if you have some
sensitive material you could essentially
put it in the smart card and all of and
you can apply some sort of a policy
management on all of this so now smart
cuts have authentication as well as well
as authorization and there is one
application which I personally use very
much in days of January in February in
Austin is to scratch the ice from the
windshield because there is a black
Aizen in Austin in January so you can at
least use it use this feature so so so
so I thought mostly about you know what
smart cards are what is the
infrastructure in which they fit in the
readers infrastructure and now it's time
to see if some application wants to
liberate the smart card functionality
how it does so so in the previous slide
I I said lot of cryptography goes in the
card and and it made sense to look into
what is the cryptographic support
provided by operating systems and we
figured that operating systems typically
have an architecture where they try to
abstract it and they try to to have an
architecture such that anybody any third
party or vendor could implement a
cryptographic service service and they
also provide some cryptic cryptography
by by their own but the thing is that it
is not Universal across all the
operating system Microsoft uses
something called cap it's a Microsoft
specification Mac OS X uses cdsa and pkc
s11 is an open RSS standard whose
implementations are there on all PC but
it is not native to either operating
system these are the applications of
these are the example of applications
which uses these specifications /
standards to leverage crypto
graphic services I have this this guy in
big font big bold because that's
actually really the topic of our
interest and I'm going to talk more
about that later so a quick recap smart
card goes in a reader reader has a
driver in building OS it is used by pcs
see the abstraction layer and now there
is one more thing here which we call
middleware middleware essentially is an
implementation of the capi interface or
a CD sa interface or a pkc s11 interface
which communicates with smart card to
leverage its security capabilities so
again a you know a very dramatic twist
in the journey so let's enter the web
and before you know I I explain how it
works in web and how all of this scale I
just want to emphasize on a very
important aspect of web which all of us
know here it's the ubiquity web
application runs irrespective of the
browser OS combination that it is
rendered in and that's really a key for
the success of internet and the world
wide web so here is a slide where I am
trying to show how smart cards work in
this ecosystem if you want to leverage
the smart card cryptography
cryptographic services from Internet
Explorer what you need on the host
machine is a CSP implementation
essentially a CSP based middleware if
you want to go through firefox you
require p kc s 11 based middleware and
if you are using safari you need a cart
specific token be and if you want to if
you are on a server side if you are
programming a web application on a
server side you need to also be aware of
how your application will be rendered in
a respective browser because browsers
expose different cryptographic
interfaces which for me is a very nice
way of saying that you know if you want
to use smart cards for web applications
why not break the ubiquity of the web
and lose the mobility of smart cards
because in order to utilize the
cryptographic aspect of a smart card you
need to have this middleware piece on
the host machine and an even worse you
need to have it for all the browser
operating system combination so so smart
cuts other than security they also have
one more value which is mobility of your
credentials so if you are using a smart
card and you you move to another pc you
need to have that middle we are
installed on the machine so is it really
mobile and and there is one more thing
this is a very famous principle of
psychological acceptability mostly
pointing out at the usability aspect of
security mechanisms and in brief it says
that the security mechanisms should not
be harder then should not come into a
way of a user if they were accessing a
resource in a certain way and you you
come and you say you know this thing is
going to make your life easy or rather
more secure it should not you know make
it harder but if we look at this this
middleware and a smart card combination
it is actually making it harder plus the
support that is provided through the
browser's is not that nice either and
I'm going to show you how what I am
talking about when it comes to usability
so I made a website where where I am
going to log on using a smart card
certificate I have my smart card already
inserted it's basically a recorded demo
and and I also have the middleware piece
installed on my machine so the harder
part is still taken care of I am just
showing how what is the user experience
in this ecosystem so I go ahead and I
press on certificate login
and it presents me a choice to select a
certificate because everything in crypto
architecture it is agnostic to you know
which device you are talking to or you
are talking to a software cryptographic
service provider it lets it ask you the
certificate which you want to use to
authenticate so first point of you know
bad user experience who the hell knows
what certificate is you and me me know
because we are you know technology
people but for an end user it is really
hard to figure out what is going on and
then I select the certificate I still
have my smart card inserted which has
this certificate
and the middleware prompts you up
prompts you to enter the pin so that you
could you could ask your cart to do the
signature operation so I am going to
enter actually a wrong pin here just to
show what happens so I entered a wrong
pin and the middleware correctly told me
that you have some number of tries
remaining the the thing that I try to
that I am trying to show is that this
user interface is not consistent because
every middleware will have a different
interface yes sir because if I asking
for your thing right so this actually
dialogue is is coming out from a
middleware you do not have a way of
knowing it so i'm going to enter a pin
and them then i am going to press a
cancel and what happens is that see it's
a web application and it didn't have a
way of updating its UI to say that you
know something wrong happened you you
know cancelled it and ultimately it's a
bad user experience that's how typically
smart cards and browsers behave and I am
showing it with Internet Explorer it is
true with Safari or Firefox which have
again different way of presenting how
you authenticate
so moving on to a very interesting thing
that has happened to us which is we have
to dot 0 google is you know big huge web
company and in some ways they brought
this revolution of web to da to to the
illness industry and web to da to means
lot of things to a lot of people it
means social networking great user
experience maps it also comes with some
issues like fishing and theft because
more and more people are going online
the the thing actually when I was
looking at it the thing that really
interested me and which i believe is is
is the thing which really created all of
this for at least you know it it was a
bootstrapper for a lot of things to
happen and that's an object in a browser
called xmlhttprequest which lets
javascript in a page communicate with
the server in a browser and anna grouser
and operating system agnostic way it was
done in 1999 in IE and now all the
browsers have and typically when i am
giving you such a kind of talk i go and
explain you know what is the problem
that it is solving but i hope i don't
have to do here because you guys you
know no better than most of the people
in the world so it's a very famous quote
from Isaac Newton and so you know
looking at this xmlhttprequest Ajax I
got inspired and it made me think that
the device that I play with I use I
program I build systems it's a very
standard device it has it has a
mechanical electrical characteristics
specified by I so it's communication
protocol is standard it's even the Java
card specification is standard in some
sense it is from sun microsystems
followed by a large community and if i
want to use it for web I have to Europe
go through all this cryptographic
architecture which first of all require
lot of peace on the computer and does
not give me better usability and
this made me think that what we really
miss if you want to enable the security
of smart cuts for web applications is
just a connectivity bridge which could
use the same communication protocol as
specified by ISO to communicate with any
smart card so very much like
xmlhttprequest but this object instead
of communicating to a server it
communicates to the smart cut connected
to the machine these are some
characteristics of this actually it's a
browser extension we have done it for
all the operating systems browser
combinations it's it also provides a
toolkit to do smartcut aware web
application it's very lightweight it
installs very quickly and the most
important thing about it is it is free
for use it is for the industry it there
is there is no vendor specific pitch
here it is to make the smart card usable
to provide the security for web
applications basically again you
innovate on top of it as it has been
done for xml httprequest in the past few
lines of JavaScript will show you know
how all of this works so it's a very you
know simple the most simplest HTML page
that one could write and and and
actually this also you know reminded me
of one more thing that that I want you
to mention here we talked a lot about
cryptography in our last slides there is
one more thing smart cards also have
some other features like authentication
so there is a cryptographic based
authentication and you could have some
custom authentication mechanism built
into it and the one of the example is to
generate one-time passwords crypto
stacks do not provide a way to get
one-time passwords out of the smart card
and this application because now you
could communicate with smart card
directly through the JavaScript it
provides you a way to
do so so there is so you include a
script a rapper script which hides all
the browser specific differences you
press a button which invokes this gate
OTP method instantiate that object from
a library you try to find which reader
it is connected to and connect to that
reader exchange the command get a
response and you have the one-time
password very simple what I'm not
showing you here is that it also the
object also provide you of facility so
that you could you will have insertion
and removal of a smart card in the
reader you could detect it from your
application unlike you know the crypto
stack so the same application because we
did talk about dotnet card which so here
you see you know some commands which
looks very alien to you know the people
who program on PC the same application
the same JavaScript application if it is
communicating with a smart card looks
like this when the smart card at the
other end is a.net smart card so because
we have a remoting infrastructure and
javascript does not provide that
infrastructure we implemented the engine
to marshal a method call and get a
response back purely in script and what
you get is some code like that you
create a proxy object and invoke the
remote method on it so simple and
elegant
so what I'm going to demonstrate you now
is a you know a demo application that we
built to showcase the power of power of
s connect and this application is
nothing but a device administration
service this is something else also
which cryptographic stack does not
provide because you have a device you
want to change its spin you have blocked
it but you want to load certificates
this is not possible by the
cryptographic stack so I am going to
show you a demo which essentially
illustrate that and the user experience
that you get with s connect and in the
demo I am also going to show you how
easy it is to install if it is not
present on your machine
so the smart card that I am using is
a.net smart card and these are
essentially some functions changing pain
unblocking pin so here the this web this
browser did not have s connect installed
so the websites disabled website is able
to detect it and you know prompt you for
the installation
so now logic to I'm just pausing here
logic to detect whether the smart card
was present or not or if the smart card
is inserted happens now at a page level
so I inserted the card it is reading it
and then you providing a UI to to
interact with it so a lot of JavaScript
code happens behind the scenes you could
look at you know the characteristics of
a card so all of this you do not get via
the cryptographic stack so so so the S
connect extension basically is a wrapper
over the PCC layer which further
communicates with the reader and the
card so basically I met just the PCC
layer scriptable through an extension
for all the browsers so so it's very
interesting question so so JavaScript
signing is signing is not supported by
Internet Explorer and even in Firefox to
sign JavaScript it's little hard but
here the the combination is very
interesting so how do you trust so the
question asked was that does java script
needs to be signed for to interact with
the card and the answer is that not all
the browsers support javascript signing
and even the browser that the support
firefox and netscape the the workflow is
very hard to achieve but interesting
here interesting thing here is that you
are communicating with the Smartcar
device and most of the time smart car
device first ask the client which is
communicating to it to authenticate so
it is happening behind the scene here so
it would not speak to just any any
website the website needs to know the
same sort of a key material some sort of
a information which the car trust
and here this is a just a simple site so
so we are just using the admin key all
zeros here but in real life you get on a
phone and other guy also has a smart
card admin has a smart card and this is
what it used to unblock the car
so this was a very simple device
administration website and now I'm going
to show you a more concrete example
where you would see that the two-factor
authentication provided by smart card is
use I never actually spoke anything
about two factors so smart card what
they bring is what we call two-factor
authentication because smart card is a
device that you have pain is something
that you know so it's a two factors it's
two factors that you need to get in to a
system so what I have is a fix in a
company which I call muna and what it is
it's a very identity savvy company
identity and security savvy company
which believes in cloud computing it
even uses google apps to do its office
management but the thing is that it's a
security savvy company and it has to be
compliant with some standards and in
order to do that it needs to use
stronger form of an authentication to
let the user in stronger form of
authentication to us translates into
smart card authentication essentially
and and in order to do that so this
company distributes smart cuts to its
employees and because it's very identity
savvy company when a user registers it
also gets an open ID so what I'm going
to show you in this demo is that how we
enable the two-factor authentication for
google apps as well as you could use
your smart card same credentials to
login into any open ID enabled website
open ID is another standard out there to
to do single sign-on essentially google
apps using thermal specification
so what I am showing here is just a
simple registration at a monocyte it is
again you know using s connect
technology to communicate with a smart
card
so my gonna support different type of
smart cuts so when you insert it it
determines whether you are some smart
card is supported or not you enter a pin
and at this point just to emphasize on
when you said that how do you know that
it is talking to my smart card right
here the mutual authentication is
happening the website really knows that
it's a smart card at the other end
because before before before smart card
could do anything the website has to
authenticate and a smart card has to
authenticate to the server so we are
registering a user which is called
jaywalker and it's basically you know my
work area playground to your experiment
with technology so the website doesn't
look that nice so now this user is
registered and what he is doing is
creating some sort of personas so that
we can use different identities at
different websites and all these
identities attributes they are getting
stored in a smart card also
the so user is provisioned but he is not
creating some attributes about himself
because he is going to use it with you
know some any open ID relying party and
he may not want to give you no
credentials that he used at work what we
call personas avatars that he is storing
in the smart card so he is creating a
office of Thorpe you know where he will
give his office female they are getting
saved in a smart car
the question was that where are these
attributes getting stored in and the
answer is that they are going in the
smart car
so simple registration of a user
creation of identities in the in the
smart card
so now we have the identities in the
cart now we are going to any open ID
enabled relying party for example the
site that I picked randomly is Jade calm
and it requires that you sign in with
open ID instead of creating a user name
password account again so you press this
you specify your open ID identity which
you get once you registered with the
moona so it's Munna calm / jaywalker
this website has a protection of bought
bouncer so it is going to take a little
bit time because it wants you to tell
that you are a value because you are
going there for the first time
no accessor just to prevent some attack
from crawlers or automatic programs
and since at this time jade has
contacted through its back-end to Munna
and redirected you to a page where Munna
is asking do you allow this website to
access your attributes so I didn't need
to enter the pen because I had already
entered the pin and this website not
only required an authentication but but
in order to provide a better user
experience it also required some
attributes of the user so at this point
he is going to choose the attributes
that that that that he wants to be
transferred and they are coming again
from the card from the smart card so
he's going to choose his home persona
home of thought where his email is John
at Walker calm and you will see that now
he's logged logged in at open ID relying
party using a single sign-on using open
ID protocol and we'll also see that some
other attributes of his like his name
full name e-mail were also transferred
because he made a choice to to be sent
to the relying party
so it's single sign-on here so enough of
roaming around so now he wants to do
some work and he wants to basically
access his google apps documents email
and because memuna the fixtures company
required stronger authentication you
would see that because Google Apps uses
sam'l protocol to do single sign-on and
I have a set up I have purchased few
accounts from google to enable such a
kind of scenario he would go and so here
I am basically showing some some things
which are offered by google apps not
interesting to you but you know people
I've showed generally liked them so now
we are signing in so this is the
interface with Google provides so that a
user could specify its domain name and
the type of service that it wants to
access so as soon as you click go now
Google Apps communicate with memuna so
that mean when I could authenticate the
user again using two-factor here very
much like open ID but in the back end
the protocols are different you are
using the smart card to authenticate to
Munna in my Munna is sending a sign
sam'l assertion to Google saying that
this particular user is a good guy he
has authenticated to me using stronger
form of authentication please sign him
in so because I have limited accounts i
am mapping John Walker to a demo account
that I have called smart guy at memuna
calm and see here now he could access
his docs using a stronger form of
authentication so single sign-on coupled
with great user experience no middleware
it works on mac OS x fire for mac OS X
Linux Internet Explorer without needing
any host component other than of course
s connect which we call 0 plus install
because of it like witness and we feel
that if it is part of browsers
next-generation browsers it it it seemed
it would enable the seamless integration
of smart cards in the world of web
so this brings me to the end of this
journey and I hope I would I was able to
you know communicate how easy it would
be to use the Smart cut security for web
applications if we have this browser
agnostic connectivity bridge and if
there is any more caution line
so one of your very first slice where
you showed how many smokers that are
being produced and where they're all
being deployed yeah you focus on the 20
million part which was insignificant no
actually I focused on let me go back I
focused on three parts basically much
more sense to heaven s Canadian talk to
your mobile phone right that's my
question which is why would I carry a
smart card that I already because you
still have computers and you access
internet wire computer you do a lot of
cloud computing using your machine and
you want to have a strong authentication
implemented for that that computing
machine also it is in some sense you
have a sim card so all of this as I said
earlier we are trying to scale also that
in the in the mobile form factor so so
the numbers are actually not just 20
million it is 300 plus 20 plus 500
million so I was talking about all three
of them which uses the desktop
infrastructure with these techniques
also scale the same so to gsm which is
going to be our next focus to simplify
the life all so gsm the the phones
present a different type of challenge
because you know there are variations of
operating systems and browsers there and
so we are going to work there and i'm
actually looking forward to see how
android the google open platform for
mobile equipment is going to help us
there
yeah yes oh so we have we have done some
experimentation they are basically
accessing the phone there is a NFC phone
as an FC based phones so you could you
know connect them through your pc and
still leverage the sim card that is in
your mobile phone or call via bluetooth
how this markdown authenticate
so which side is smarter get together
the countries that is talking through
the religion part so the question is
that how the smartcard know that it is
talking to a legit minute party to a
right party right so so let's let's say
that if you have smart card application
you build a custom application and you
put in there some public certificates of
some websites right you go to you insert
your card and then this website what it
does is that it smart card gives a
random number this website and its back
end essentially encrypt that with the
private key in some sense sign it once
this goes to the card the card could use
the public portion of the key pair to
verify whether the site that it is
communicating to it's a legitimate site
or not and most importantly it also
generates a session key and all the
communication that happens is encrypted
wire this session p SL protect yes
that's right
this partner doesn't have you I or edge
of the hole trusted you I problem is
very troubling only see this you know
infested with malware
that is true so so that is why we that's
what we had the consent dialogue so that
so there is some help that we are
getting from the user that before a
website could interact with the card he
provides a concert sort of added to its
whitelist and because there is this this
secured communication channel even
though malware is sending something to a
card the thought is not going to reply
back with you know right credentials or
it will not sign your stuff until the
client application has proven that it's
a it's a good application so malware
will not have the same key material as
the the server on the backend would have
essentially you know the same answer
that I was giving you earlier to protect
against malware we mostly rely that that
the client application also authenticate
to the cart before card could release
its resources my small church always me
anywhere without me even know it done
because martha has to authenticate to
the tart
you shoulda trusted you I wear and my
pin is not compromised by the velvet I
assume it is so the lower knows my
people it's not just the pin pin is for
you the user to authenticate to the
smart card but there is one more form of
authentication that you have to also
build in which is that the application
the software that is communicating with
the card has also to should also prove
that its writes software using the again
public key cryptography be in SB without
being heavy ok so the D can't like I
don't see how to include like if my
machine has now we're always this car
doesn't it's basically an Oracle at
their disposal they can log in to any
site that my card feels like talking to
I think
mama your horse well it would be nice if
the smart card would sort of help you
there but it helps it helps in the sense
that indicate to them soft will indicate
but if the mother is so smart but it can
even turn up get an indication to
appreciate it sure but at that point the
question comes up like why smart car why
not just rely on the OS to hide your
privacy for me well you know it is
security in about different kinds of
logs right so we saw both spectrum so
you can have nothing or you can have the
bulletproof thing that never lets you in
or even out there is something in
between so that their kind of spectrum
of play-doh we're asking for people to
you know sure take a big hurdle here it
better by uh something I'm not convinced
by this much in that too
yeah so the Java car thing or the dotnet
car thing it's very interesting I go to
frys I can't buy one like what's up so
yes most consumers for something like
this they all manage your open ID it is
happening it isn't happening now so
there will be cards there will be cards
that we took a Java card and dotnet cart
come with their respective SDKs you can
buy them from the web store of the
company's the end user card if you are
talking to use it for yourself they will
be you know available in walmart in form
of USB focus when eyes involvement you
know all the retail shops there will be
but if you want to play with it from a
developer's perspective for the last 18
years right you can buy developer kits
from anybody let users count gift card
the end users are typically today they
are getting from their cooperation from
enterprises and everyone they really
need to work on that as you get over
that hurdle business like if I can't
think about from frys like why would I
use we are manufacturing actually a USB
token combination which has been a lot
of mass memory also so that you do not
have to carry tokens multiple tokens one
just for security and one for master it
so that kind of token will soon be
available in the market for end-users
open in the sense that I can program by
all if you buy you buy NSD kit know so
you buy you buy an SDK and you download
your own application in the card provide
it as okay as you said you know can I
learn new application in the card that
depends that depends on the policy of
the smart card so that is why you know
our industry distinguishes between you
know developer smart card and a end-user
card so you purchase the developer card
experiment with it you know build a new
stuff
people point to address right like
either its open and the card X on behalf
of the user it's like I make up a
private key I stick in this card it's my
oracle and my right right the
application or i buy a card from
somebody they tell me what it can do and
now everybody has to and yeah and i
think we are we are starting to look at
those models and I think technologies
like this especially when you go on the
web will help because it's also about
not only having the device what it's
about also what you can do with the
tracrac and so you're right though for a
long time that promise has been that it
is never quite made it but but you know
below possible all right look thanks for
coming and if you have any other kind of
questions about you know feedback on the
video etc we can try to set up I thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
