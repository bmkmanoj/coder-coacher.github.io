negotiation and international business
strategy so I like to welcome Erin hurt
and his topic today is chinese-american
negotiation styles a comparison you all
hear me I just got back from China
I actually was over there for about
three weeks coupled with a trip to to
Sri Lanka to see my son get married my
big opportunity to ride on an elephant
and wear a sarong and I continue to be
amazed by the differences in the process
of how people communicate and how
businesses are focused more and more on
the content of doing deals and
negotiation and often tend to neglect
the process of the negotiation so this
talk this morning brief talk and a
question-and-answer period will deal
with the processes involved as as
understood by me an American born
American in doing business with the the
Chinese I've never been on the Google
campus before I was flying back as I say
on the plane the other day and I opened
up Forbes magazine and saw an article on
googa which I believe is your how we
would pronounce
the Chinese subsidiary and I think that
the issue of growing a business of
penetrating a market obviously involves
a lot of negotiation and if you're well
prepared to not to do that then I think
that it will behoove you and it will
move your company Google companies over
here tend not to be so concerned with
the process of our negotiations are done
overseas and I think that is to their
disadvantage
most of the companies that contact us
tend to be foreign companies wanting to
understand how Americans negotiate so
let's flip the table on them here and
see if we can at least understand some
of the the pitfalls that might trip you
up the study of negotiating with the
Chinese is is is really fairly recent
they I mean they're there's a classic
study by a guy named Liu Shi and PI back
in 1982 but fundamentally there hasn't
been a lot written on it the library's
full of a lot of texts and and and
dissertations on negotiating with the
Japanese Harvard in 2003 and the Harvard
Business Review October had an article
on negotiating with the Chinese and
we'll talk about a couple of those
points as we move through this
discussion people negotiate if for lack
of a better expression it's almost it's
in their DNA it's it's the way they're
raised it's their culture and what we
need to to understand about any culture
is what what what has programmed them
the the economic philosophies of the
country a country like China the
political philosophies the changes that
are occurring in China most of you have
you been to China recently a few of you
quite a few of you I was I just amazed
that was there too
years ago I went back to Shanghai and I
don't even recognize it yesterday in the
Wall Street Journal there was an article
that population shifts equivalent to the
population of Manhattan move to the
major cities of China each year the the
change under the Shanghai is undergoing
is is huge and it's a mixture of well
anybody who says it's communist is is is
foolish if you're defining it in terms
of the old communist system but there
are definitely impacts on the people
related to the old Confucian system
related to the the the communist system
and related to how they how they operate
their their cities today education the
emphasis on understanding how we
negotiate the accessibility of education
to people increasing dramatically in
China cultures affected by language and
religion and of course the societal
structures so all of these things come
to bear when we look at a country and
what we need to understand is best
described by sort of a concentric circle
a culture starts out with core values
and those values tend to form an outer
ring called norms and the norms or how
society sets up sort of understood rules
of behavior and those norms which affect
behavior then are what we come in
contact with this outer ring behavior
now what occurs when you as an American
go over to China is that that outer ring
of behavior that we've been programmed
with intersects with the outer ring of
behavior that the Chinese have been
programmed with or any culture and that
overlap is where we can have a high
degree of confusion
let's talk specific
about China and see if I can give you
some examples one quarter of the world's
population approximately 1.5 billion
people 1.5 billion potential customers
rapid economic growth opening up more
and more to to Western markets yet still
doing business in the Chinese Way not
the Western Way and definitely expanding
opportunities yet China is very very
different in terms of how they approach
business negotiations let's let's let's
take an example if we look at an
American we say to American what is the
negotiation they'll tell you that a
negotiation is fundamentally a process
to get a deal to build value hopefully
and to to sort of codify in a contract
or a written or a signed agreement the
word tamp an in Chinese does not mean
negotiation in fact there's no
translation directly from Chinese that
will come up negotiation it tends to
come up as a discussion a dialogue as
someone described it has a beginning a
middle and a seemingly absence of an end
and so one of the things that we need to
understand is that the the goal that we
as an American pursue is not necessarily
consistent with the goal that the
Chinese might pursue now let me pause
here one moment I'm in this discussion
I'm not going to I'm trying to avoid
talking and stereotypes and stereotypes
are a big big problem however there are
consistent patterns which you need to be
aware of and you need to have your
antenna up and and and ready for
when you're negotiating so that you can
be prepared if you're confronted with
one of these situations China's a high
context society by high context I mean
it isn't all verbal you know read my
read my lips but read my face read my
hands read my actions as a high context
society that presents another problem
for most American negotiators we tend to
be very low context readers the best of
us tend to be women and it's a problem
for negotiating because it isn't always
the words it's the meaning behind the
words which become important going back
to the the American process again of the
contract Americans are looking for a
contract
the Chinese are probably looking more
for a relationship and a ongoing
business relationship however that is
not to say that they are obsessed with
win-win in fact I would say that they're
not obsessed with win-win at all they're
definitely looking for the the upper
hand consensus consensus is very
important to the Chinese yeah a Chinese
negotiating team is going to come up
with one game plan in most cases and
everyone is going to buy into the the
game plan the individuals on the team
must must embrace it one of the tricks
I'll talk about at the end or tips would
be for you to constantly try to couch
your negotiations with the Chinese in
terms of the societal benefit to the
Chinese because why is it good why is it
good for them as a group negotiations by
the Chinese are strongly affected by the
the old Confucian system of ethics and
morals of role and of hierarchy there
are definite
obligations placed upon the host in a
negotiation and obligations placed upon
the the guests or the visitor
you know Confucius talked about the
Emperor and how the emperor had to be a
in order to be a good Emperor had to
perform certain functions had to behave
in a certain manner and he also talked
about the subjects and said the subjects
as well in order to be good subjects
have an obligation to to do the role
that is to which they're relegated in a
negotiation the various members of the
team and the hosts and the guests
definitely have roles in roles they
follow loyalty loyalty is highly valued
and this can on occasion lead to the
problem of cronyism which is something
you you need to be aware of in other
words it's a very tight linked group
that you're dealing with the subject of
face mondsee now you've you've probably
you know many of you are Asian and many
of you probably all of you have
negotiated or been with people of Asian
extraction and you here okay face the
concept of face and it's usually don't
don't cause them to lose it don't don't
embarrass them but the interesting thing
about face is that face can be earned by
you and the increased amount of face
that you have as a negotiator with the
Chinese is all to your benefit by the
same token you can give face to someone
and one of the tactics that I advise
companies to do is to concentrate on
building up the face of the other side
in the in the negotiation the
the repercussions of causing someone to
lose face can be extremely dramatic and
and you need to be very aware of the
fact that something said which may be
seemingly innocuous to you can call it
can have really serious impact with with
the other party when you're negotiating
so you need to be very very careful Quan
Chi the the idea of connections the idea
that there are relationships
guanxi the best way to understand when
she is - to think of a balance sheet a
balance sheet that I encourage you to
roughly keep in balance we're doing a
favor for someone builds up your side of
the balance sheet so where you can call
in an IOU if you will later on one of
the tricks often use by skilled Chinese
negotiators is to give you favors is to
is to create situations for you which
result in you becoming indebted and once
you're indebted you may say okay I
understand what they've done and I'm not
going to fall for that but the reality
is that they then expect you to bring
the balance sheet back to even again so
you need to be very very cautious
I guess the watch would would be beware
of unsolicited favors when you're
negotiating the role of the word no no
is a word that I would encourage you to
avoid when when negotiating with them
there are ways to say no there are ways
to to convey your inability to do
something but I would encourage you to
try to find ways to defer as opposed to
actually flat-out rejecting I put some
phrases up on the screen there for you
to do you look at but you can see the
phraseology base
Stickley delivers the same message but
what we're trying to do is we're trying
to soften the the message in the
negotiation you know do you understand
that's sort of a one-way question
implying there's something wrong with
with the receiver of the message as
opposed to are we being clear or do we
in other words we're making a joint we
can't do that might be better said that
might be difficult for us to do and
shifting the responsibility is a pretty
common thing in insane
no well forget it the name of the writer
someone once wrote and said to be truly
powerful in China is to be able to avoid
responsibility for your decisions that
what's that what you need to do is be
able to to shift it off on something
else while at the same time indicating
and defending your position Graham and
Lam two Harvard professors back in
October of 2003 did a fairly exhaustive
study called the Chinese negotiation
Harvard Business Review in it they
talked about the the characteristics of
the American negotiator and the Chinese
negotiator this was building on the the
work of guys like Jesuits Alec who's at
Harvard who studied the International
negotiation process but think about the
characteristics which tend to to be
common for most Americans and maybe you
can see where there is the potential for
confusion when dealing with a Chinese
negotiator the individual versus the
collective one of the one of the things
that Americans tend to do in trying to
get to a quick deal we have a psychology
that says the fewer people on the
negotiating team the better there's less
confusion we can get this thing done in
a hurry
the problem with that is however that
that doesn't indicate gravitas in other
doesn't indicate that that we're placing
significant significance on the
negotiation by not matching the size of
the the Chinese team we tend not to
think in a collective mindset the
hierarchical mindset of the Chinese from
the old Confucian system that there are
roles one of the things I always tell my
students at Berkeley is at least over in
China gray hair can be a benefit that
there's a hierarchy and it isn't always
necessarily competence which determines
who will be running the negotiating team
who will be necessarily be making the
decisions we're an information oriented
society they are a relationship oriented
we think very linear we take like a
funnel if yeah I don't know how it works
here well you guys are notorious for
thinking outside the box but but
thinking linearly bringing things down
and diluting them to the main point as
opposed to looking at the whole the
whole of the the topic Americans I don't
know about you but Americans when polled
will say over and over they hate to
negotiate that most of them find a
negotiation and argument a fight makes
them uncomfortable yet China is
definitely what we would call a haggling
culture it's expected it's expected that
there will be a back-and-forth it's
expected that you'll push and expect to
get pushed back in fact if you don't
coach push back the Chinese call it
tremble and obey and tremble and obey is
not something that I would would
advocate time is money time is money
let's get this thing done let's hurry
the Chinese focus on getting to know you
to understand you but here's the problem
with the American approach time is money
I don't disagree with the concept at all
however the time spent putting back
together a bad deal probably far exceeds
the time that you spend in putting it
together correctly in the in the first
place if you are being sent by Google to
negotiate something and you're being
pressured to do it in a hurry perhaps
you want to lose your airplane ticket
it's not something that I'd suggest you
do you're not going to come to a fast
resolution or if you do there will be
there will be serious problems with it
the negotiation process tends to be very
informal with the Americans as opposed
to a structured formal process with the
Chinese the role of intermediaries this
goes back to Guan G in other words if I
want to get to somebody in China if I
want to get a decision I want to get to
the right person it's usually best if I
use an intermediary who has that balance
sheet relationship with the person I'm
trying to get to now what would I
advocate to a company like Google if
you're contemplating a negotiation you
definitely want to build up the Guan Chi
and the relationships well in advance of
the trip over there because you won't be
able to build it on the initial trip one
of the one of the things that companies
need to understand is that it's
important in a significant negotiation
to bring the big dawgs out in other
words to have a significant player show
up to indicate the importance of the
negotiation yet the negotiation itself
will not occur with that person that was
they will withdraw and the negotiation
will begin
at a lower lower level what is
non-existent in China is the concept of
cold call it just is just not going to
to work I made the comment about to be
truly responsible is to be able to avoid
responsibility for to be truly powerful
is to be able to avoid responsibility
limited authority plays a big role with
most negotiators which goes back to the
collective
you're not going to normally find
someone on the spot who is able to make
a decision right right then and there
most American negotiators tend to have
significant more authority when they're
dispatched to a negotiation and this I
guess what I'm telling you is pack a big
suitcase and plan to be there a while
don't someone said the other day did you
get a multiple visa or a single trip
visa and I laughed because a single trip
visa is a complete waste of money
I mean get to get a multiple trip visa
and plan on multiple trips because
that's what's going to going to happen
Americans tend to make proposals upfront
in a hurry let's cut to the hunt the
Chinese is the tactic they use is to
often talk about the goals and the
principles of the negotiation have you
buy into the goals and principles and
then turn the table on you and say so
why aren't you willing to agree you
bought into the principles and we've
given you the roadmap to accomplish
those principles and goals let's let's
negotiate from that point Americans tend
to be aggressive by aggressive I mean
lots of proposals on the table let's put
them out let's cut to the hunt the
Chinese are much better listeners and
what they're really listening for is
they're listening for what what
interests you and then to see if they
can take those interests and and use
them use them against you
enduring versus impatient
and it's it's it's literally a form of
Chinese water torture I mean it's just
it is a long long process but 25 percent
of the world's population it's a market
that no one can afford to avoid and they
take a fairly aggressive approach to
negotiation and this this proverb
probably sums it up very very well
they're they're very capable of
demanding of you something which is
completely unacceptable completely
detrimental to your position probably
asking that to see if you're dumb enough
to go along sort of an intelligence test
it's very common in a negotiation to get
an outrageous demand at the start and
have that outrageous demand immediately
backed away from as the as the
discussion continues the tactics that
you can expect are for an American would
be openness and honesty strength you
know confidence efficiency these are
kind of the hallmarks of the the
American negotiator the Chinese focusing
more on face respect flexibility
patience again back to this enduring
this enduring approach to a negotiation
they're prepared to fight for what they
they believe in what I would suggest
before you start the fight is to see if
you can come up with a fair deal a fair
deal and one of the tactics we teach in
negotiation it's called framing and
frame you know it's put taking a picture
and putting a nice frame around it the
glass is half full as opposed to half
empty the primary frame you want to use
in negotiating with the Chinese is
framing that it's good
for China quick deals definitely to be
avoided
the Chinese are masters at using your
exhaustion feeding you and what was
actually wining and dining you into
fatigue and then negotiating with you I
look out in this room and everybody's
significantly younger than me but I made
the comment to my wife the other day you
know having been back for five days I'm
not shaking the jet lag quite as fast as
I used to do to fly over there arrive on
a Monday afternoon to go into a
negotiation on Tuesday especially in the
afternoon of Tuesday is probably not the
smartest move that you could make if
it's a significant negotiation the
Chinese love to host you they get you on
their turf once they're on on you're on
their turf that way they can control
these these events the like I say the
food and fatigue round and so you need
to be aware that that is one of the
tactics another tactic that they'll use
they want you to feel like you need them
more than they need you
you'll hear continually look how big we
are look at the size of the market this
is a great opportunity for you and I go
back to the slide I showed you before
about the chicken and the pig you know
you're the pig you bring the bacon are
you really willing to give everything up
for the opportunity to do business with
them you should be honored if you do
work in China this is this is a real
opportunity you should be honored one of
the tactics that they'll use is the
siting of regulations we're unable to do
that there are regulations there's rules
we have we have restrictions on what we
can do and what we could not do ice I
urge you to very seriously check as to
whether or not that is the that is the
case I'm not going to say that they
they're lying to you but it's very
common that they're they're bluffing or
or shading the truth the issue of trust
I would caution you never to give too
much trust initially but that's probably
true in any negotiation that may be
disheartening to some of you but I don't
trust anybody at the onset Trust is
something that you need to earn but
certainly Trust is an issue when
negotiating overseas because are you
really sure of what they're saying of
what they mean do you really really know
them contracts contracts guarantee
nothing we will find a way to break the
contract I mean I gotta emphasize that
again contracts essentially mean nothing
we will change them we will break them
we will shift them in the interest of
Chinese interest be ready for it be
prepared for it and certainly don't be
expected when it occurs China is a
survival culture survival culture when
when is not the norm this is a very
different negotiation approach than say
the Japanese I said before that
stereotypes tend to be something very
dangerous to place your your confidence
in a recent study by the Harvard Law
School on the negotiating tactics of the
Japanese showed that 99 percent of the
Japanese respondents said that win-win
was the goal of a negotiation 99 percent
that's a pretty good stereotype but I
can tell you this it's not the same
thing in negotiating in in China without
a fight you don't know each other
expect the dust-up at the start expect
many of the meetings to end on a
negative
tone this will not this does not look
good things do not bode well your
competitors have given us a much better
offer or things are looking much better
for them what they want to do is to size
you up one of the reasons by the way
that they'd like you to come to China
that they like to control the game is
because they're going to play you off
against their other their other
competitors my point don't get
disheartened you're going to have to
understand that this is their tactic and
why they're doing it and use it to your
advantage
endure be patient okay tips for success
bill Gwangi find the right people now I
just can't overemphasize this you've got
to find the right people with the right
contacts and you need to to to be able
to call in those those markers if you
will as important as finding the right
people is to make sure that whatever
you're offering them whatever you're
negotiating with them is legitimate in
support of the Chinese society Chinese
business the concept of corporate China
bring your big dogs bring bring the
significant players first but then get
the significant players off stage the
negotiation initially will not be done
by them again I'm going to take you
right back to what I said about 15
minutes ago to be truly powerful is to
be able to avoid responsibility the
decision will be made but it will be
made probably by someone who is not not
in the room
beware of home court advantage the food
the drink
you've come all this way you don't want
to go back empty-handed
blah blah blah all of these lines will
be laid on you you do want to go back
empty-handed if you believe that the
deal you're being offered is one which
places you in a worse position than when
you started before be careful of your
love of talking the Chinese love to
listen they love to make you talk the
more you talk the more they find out if
you're going to want to talk and make
your points and obviously you have to
you need to initiate an exchange of
information Americans tend to engage in
a monologue they love to talk they love
to be listened to
they're going to want you as I said to
agree on the principles of the goals and
that's certainly something which is
important in any negotiation where do we
want to end up just be careful that when
you agree to the goals or the principles
that you don't fall susceptible to them
turning around and saying well you
agreed to the principles here's how
we'll get to it fait accompli
you don't want to have that happen
prepare for the long wait endure you
know this isn't about the Chinese it's
about the Vietnamese but one of my
favorite stories I use in class is in
from kissinger's book about the
negotiations at the end of the Vietnam
War but it but it sort of tells you
something about the whole mentality that
when Kissinger and the American
delegation arrived in Paris in the early
70s they took a couple floors in I
believe it was the Georges sank one of
the great hotels in Paris for the entire
American delegation when the North
Vietnamese delegation arrived they
purchased a chateau and the message
Kissinger said wasn't lost on him they
were here for the long haul and we as a
typical American we're here for a quick
a quick fix
check the caliber of the people at the
negotiation do they have the right
people there people who are at the
appropriate levels and do they
match up with you and by the way I'm
sure I don't have to say this and
politically correct Silicon Valley but
it behoves you for sure to have at least
one woman in the negotiating team if
there's two people one I mean I
certainly competence is the most
important thing in a negotiator but
women are much better readers of high
context nonverbal messages and you
definitely want to have the right person
on a team you're going to discover that
when you're sent over you have fairly
clear lines of responsibility at least I
hope you do what you're going to
discover over there that lines of
responsibilities are completely blurred
completely blurred as I said the
decisions are probably going to come
from someone else outside the room the
concept of compromise compromise to most
Chinese negotiators has a negative
connotation words we're again back to
the survival culture we're here we're
here to win another tactic that they'll
use they will cite their problems
they'll cite why they need a particular
concession from you and what they're
attempting to do is to get you to buy
into it and to agree don't buy into it
they distrust fast talkers if you've got
someone particularly slick on your team
you know send them somewhere else and
I'm to Hong Kong or something don't take
them in to China they distrust fast
talkers patience when you have to say no
the goal is to limit the damage you want
to minimize your nose you want to
minimize rejection just what if let's
consider let's defer drag the thing out
one of the first things in a negotiating
class will ask the students is why do
you negotiate
and the answer is you negotiate because
you need the other side you wouldn't
negotiate it if you didn't need them
you'd take it well if they're sitting
there with you I encourage you to
remember that as long as they're talking
to you they need you and if you keep
talking to them you will probably come
to solution you'll be able to get
something worked out control your
emotion it is it is detrimental to any
negotiation to lose your cool but avoid
not just losing your cool avoid the sort
of manic-depressive highs and lows which
come with jetlag and fatigue by the way
that that we're going to lose everything
that it's slipping through our hands
just take a break
hit the gym get a night's sleep and come
back number number 11 up is very
important increase your importance in
other words anything you can do prior to
a negotiation to increase the the
gravitas of either you or the other
members of your negotiating team that
can be communicated to the other side is
to your advantage it's to your advantage
and last but not least be yourself
you're not Chinese in most case you need
to you need to be able to to understand
why they're doing what they're doing not
fall susceptible to those traps but you
still have to be who you are in the
negotiation again I refer you I refer
you to the the Harvard study from
October 2003 which will explain a little
bit of the philosophy but I think that
the most important thing that I can
recommend to American companies and it's
something which is being done more and
more is that you spend some time on the
process of training your negotiating
team in other words your team needs not
just to be trained on the content of
what you're trying to sell of what
you're trying to convey but on the
process
are we going to do this how will the
team be constructed who will have
responsibility for what
how will we how will we handle the
various curves and fast balls that are
being thrown at us by the other side you
need to either coach yourself internally
or get coaching and I think you'll find
that the the results will be very very
positive so why don't we take about five
or ten minutes if you have questions
I'll try to answer them if yes you
mentioned that the Chinese negotiators
wouldn't take a look at a contract is
something that
that over time there maybe they come to
typing they want to revise terms in the
agreement and expect that that is going
to be some that can be done does that
work the other way as well men when
Americans negotiate agreement with a
Chinese party should the American
company expect to be able to similarly
so the question was that that if the
Chinese approach a conclusion or a
conclusion with hyphens of a deal with a
contract that they might feel the
ability to open that up again for
discussion should the American who tends
to play more place more faith in a
contract a field that they can do that
as well open it up if they see it to
their disadvantage and and the answer is
yes you should feel capable of doing it
of attempting to do it on the other hand
understand that the Chinese have heard
this same lecture from someone else in
Reverse and they know that you place
great faith in the contract so if
they're probably going to hammer back at
you and say but you signed the deal if
they say the deal is to their advantage
and try to oppose it normally what you
would do would be you would go to the
quote right people unquote and get that
right person over there to speak to the
person with the authority to open the
deal up and open it up that way rather
than a formal renegotiation it's all
about connections yeah any other
questions
yes
so do I find similar traits to other
Asian countries
you mean similar to to these yeah
certainly there are some the the the
enduring the patience the the lack of a
lot of of high high powered emotion tend
to be fairly fairly common the the
emphasis on relationships and
connections certainly very similar but
there are very there are very distinct
differences between
a a tiny GoSee ater and a Korean
negotiator emphasis is placed on
different things for example in Korea if
I was negotiating with a Korean the
first thing I'd want to find out was
what university that Korean had
graduated from and find the right person
assisting me from the same University
because that's probably the number one
door opening relationship that I could
have different than it would be say in
in Thailand or or Japan there's a good
book out there called it's it's sort of
popcorn for the brain but it's not bad
called
kiss bow and shake hands which gives you
sort of a an idea a preliminary idea of
how different countries might negotiate
yeah any other questions
yes about the role of the government
with another business organization but
there's going to be potentially
government oversight you know when
you're doing things where there might be
government concern around how does that
impact the question is the impact of
government or governmental concern on
negotiating with a Chinese business well
certainly I think your experience with
Google will show you that the Chinese
government is infant intimately involved
in most all of these discussions things
have to be done within the context of
corporate corporate China you may not be
negotiating with the government per se
but you're negotiating with the with the
influence of the government businesses
are allowed to enter into certain
transactions to undertake certain
obligations consistent with the resource
allocation that the government has has
given them I cited the issue of
regulations the companies will
constantly cite regulations the
government won't let us do that there
are prohibitions against doing that
that's not always the case but it's very
effective duck-and-cover that the that
they will use anybody else yes
if their goal is when if their goal is
win lose and ours is win win would I say
that we should try to make it appear
that we're losing let's just be a little
careful here the the the concept of
win-win has gotten a lot of play and I
was just talking without one before the
presentation when when is probably the
operable goal for an ongoing business
relationship you know the ladies have
all heard the nursery rhyme you kiss a
lot of frogs to find a prince okay we
kiss all these frogs we find a prince we
don't want to kill them off immediately
we have to find a way to make them feel
that they are not being taken advantage
of that is not to say that in business
there isn't a time for win lose and win
lose is based on having alternatives
that you can choose and if you have an
alternative you you go for the best deal
for you and and you don't care
the Chinese tend to push for win lose is
a lot of power negotiating in any
negotiation one of the things you have
to do is an expression from the old I
believe it was the sting Paul Newman and
Robert Redford cool the mark what you
need to do is help them sell to their
side what they agreed to make them feel
that they have come away with something
but it's got to be real it can't be
phony
yeah because they'll wake up the next
morning to discover they didn't come
away with something and they'll
immediately try to break the deal you
can take that to the bank but you never
gloat and it's just bad you just never
gloat and you you never emphasized the
one-sidedness of of any deal you can get
wool from the lamb every year but you
only can skin it once you've got to be
careful here any other questions
okay well thank you very much I am
watching with interest your your
progress in in China it's a it's a huge
market marketing students drool at the
prospect of China you know we talked
about 25 percent of the population
be living in mainland China try this one
on 8% of the world lives within 50 miles
of the Yangtze River so just draw your
marketing density right down there it's
it's a tremendous market and a
fascinating place and I wish Google good
luck in that and just remember whether
it's China or it's Indonesia or it's
Germany or wherever you happen to be
going there's going to be differences
subtle differences and those differences
can have a major impact on the outcome
of the negotiation it isn't just content
it's the process okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
