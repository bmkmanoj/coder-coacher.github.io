pleasure this morning for me to be able
to introduce to
very Allende just call him Boston though
because that's what all his friends
color he's from the Department of
Informatics at the University of Oslo in
Norway last time Boston was visiting me
I think was about twenty years ago when
he had a great huge land whale of an RV
parked in front of my house with his
three little boys and his nice wife and
we had a had a good time together and
that we got to know each other work and
Carver Meads lab at Caltech back in the
eighties and see him on and off over the
years but this is some really cool stuff
he's gotten into in recent years using
analog VLSI to do some radio and radar
work Boston takeaway Thank You Nick it's
really a pleasure yo Google I'm sure I
fit in here a little bit hardware on
oriented things that I'm working with so
but still I hope you can appreciate it I
am I hope it's something that you
haven't heard before which all is all
about impulse based systems impulse like
we have in our nervous system like like
small pulses in time and I'd say it's
all a little bit back back to the future
because that's how it used to be in the
Old Lace so for a start I'd like to show
you this little device here you can see
it's it's up here in um in front which
I'm really proud about it's it's a
impulse based radar there's a couple of
different versions here I have one that
sort of peel off here and just a little
newer version of it it basically it's
all contained in one single chapter in
order to because it's so easy to talk
about these things but in order to make
you believe that this is not just talk
it's real thing I want to take the
chance of giving you a demo of this
little little piece of hardware and I've
to run this radar in the most simplest
mode
and I've tuned it for just one sort of
distance there is actually a number of
this and different shells that are that
are sort of going inwards thoughts radar
see if I'm moving here you can see it
actually it detects me and there's like
a one shell I've tuned it to just one
shell you can see up here it's shell
number 61 there's like sixty four
different shells going outwards and
inward and to illustrate the sensitivity
of this little device problem is that my
body is here as well there but if I if I
sort of put my hand on top here you can
see that at some point here it's getting
really really sensitive you can see my
hand is almost not moving at all all
right so it's actually you can see my
hand
all right now this radar it's
electromagnetic sits is radio weight
it's sending just any pulses those one
antenna net is emitting a pulse and
another in Tanana it's actually
receiving this reflected energy from my
hand and you know compared to like s
where my hand is not a big thing though
but still able to to get hold of my my
hand here see I I can I soul it's almost
difficult to keep it still when I get
hit the sort of the sensitive shell that
that I've tuned it to just now now the
interesting thing about these kind of
devices is that since it electro
magnetics it's actually able to look
through through as well so if I move
under the table here I'll it's actually
you can see it's able to see my hand
straight through the table can you see
that so I'm sort of I'm sort of moving
my hand under the table here now and
it's able to to see my hand through the
table and that's that's that's a nice
feature that's something we can use
so that's to illustrate that we're
actually working with electromagnetic
now electro magnetics they are kind of
fast okay they're kind of fast
they're running not at speed
like but close like 7% or something like
that depending over kind of medium but
in arrow is yo its close to speed of
light and speed of light it's kind of
fast so it's it's it's demanding
I mean I'm we're wearing the in the
millimeter range here see I'm almost
it's almost difficult to keep my hand
still and the light is actually circling
the earth seven and a half times each
second so so when you when you have to
detect millimeter wave sensitivity in
distance measurements that's something
that demands really really fast
computation and processing and I think
this is unique that there's something
that you you can't buy I mean most radar
radios today they have like in a meter
range of resolution and this one has in
the millimeter range resolution that's
why I think this is in unique technology
it's still quite immature because the
you see it's noisy this data though and
there's a number of things that could be
your by simple signal processing and
working processing on this kind of data
but these two properties of this little
radar it's quite important because we
can we can look through matter and we
can we can sense changes movements which
in with high resolution and the last
thing which I consider to both of these
things has been done sort of before but
in addition we managed to do it on
Monday in square millimeter of silicon
and in using almost no power so the
power is our Amityville is radars very
little the pulses are like point eight
volts peak-to-peak the secret is the way
we do it so how do we go about making
these kind of devices and what I hope to
show to you today is that these kind of
devices
it's something which is actually quite
suitable for for for current technology
we are sort of exploring properties of
current knowledge II which is very
useful by the way you can these this
this I have to thank the smaller company
startup company in the welder
where which have sort of made these
things available to me some of the ideas
is sort of my own mud but there's this
enough company to try to make these
devices and those are the things I'm
using here so what I'd like to take you
guys through today is to figure out how
can we do things actually it's more the
way we think of the way we design it's a
matter of exploring technology in a
novel way okay and I'll try to convey
how it's possible to make these kind of
high speed processing because like this
radar piece here is actually running at
70 gigahertz and that's a little faster
than your Pentium but as you know lagea
is still not that advanced this 90
nanometer
I mean Pentiums I think is running at 45
nanometers these days so so there are
some ways we can explore silicon to do
not only these kind of sensors which I
call short-range radar but also to do
short-range communication in a different
way
I mean yet another wireless it's not
quite the same as the standard one but
I'll try to explain how we can how we
can get get this true so what I'm
touching input into today is sort of the
thoughts the way to think about
designing these kind of silicon systems
and not so much sort of promoting lis is
this this kind of products there now
first to to start out from the beginning
I mean sparks or spikes it's sort of
it's very old I mean that's what we have
in our body as I told you nervous system
is like spiky you know that
and the first radio why Makoni was also
a spark day system so so so impulse
based spike based system is it's a quite
normal thing what we should what we
should remember is that a spike in time
a very narrow spike in time has has a
wide frequency content yes there you go
so we have a wide frequency spectrum
when we have these short spikes here
well compared to the traditional radio
where you have a carrier wave it's
actually a very narrow band in the
frequency I guess most of you guys knows
these kind of fundamentals though but
it's good to have in mind when you start
to understand these kind of systems now
now there are different pulses we can
just send a pulse not there it you know
we have it some some force to choose but
can make just like a square wave kind of
pulse but they seem to have a lot of
noise inside bands these cosine half
motorcycle away a cosine is also good
and and then and these these sinc pulses
are making sort of like a brick wall
appearance in frequency which which
would be a very nice though but they are
tend to be difficult to make these these
kind of sync pulses so what most people
do in these kind of impulse based
systems it's making what we call a
Gaussian Gaussian shape pulse and the
Gaussian shape pulses is so caused like
a Gaussian shaped distribution like this
one is a Gaussian but then we we're not
only using this this sort of first this
original Gaussian pulse we do use
derivatives of this Gaussian pulse so we
have four different derivatives showing
up here or choose three derivatives I
won't go into details here but we can we
can explore these properties of the
pulse to make by changing the width we
can we can X Y or narrower suppose the
wider in frequency and we can also play
with the Oh
I mean which derivative of the pulse
were using so if we use high order
derivative we can sort of take away the
low frequency content of the pulse so
we're able to by paying reduce to
parameters we can fit whatever bandwidth
we want to transmit it okay these are
the fundamentals of Gaussian pulse
shaping and the reason I'm telling you
about it is that this is this notion
ultra wideband which was approved by FCC
I think 2002 sort of gave us a
opportunity to explore these kind of
devices even without a license and it's
quite interesting at the three point one
to ten point six gigahertz unlicensed
bandwidth it's actually the largest
bandwidth ever released so so it gives
up some some some some potential of
doing interesting things with impulse
based systems now one of the things to
take care of or to think about is the
low energy emission it's only minus
forty one point three DBM you're allowed
to transmit within one layer its
bandwidth but it is this that that's one
of the reason that is this kind of radio
are getting getting in there are
interesting now from my perspective I am
more or different I should say ideas of
why it's interesting because it gives me
a new challenge of making new and
interesting circuits I guess there are a
couple of other things that that we
should should it's it's quite different
from the mostly frequency domain
processing we're doing in traditional
radio it's like time domain things it's
also interesting because there's no
carrier it's the carrier less
communication
I mean carrier means that carrier is
actually not it's not it's not doing
anything but carrying the information so
a carrier is actually
it's not actually transmitting any
information is the modulation of the
carrier in traditional radio so the
energy I'm putting into generating a
carrier in a traditional radio is
actually a waste of energy so taking
that away it so it's sort of 'mentally
to get rid of an a power consumer in my
system I can do other different things
which is not that intuitive to see like
one of the problems with traditional
radio is interference I have introduced
our usually Act 1608 you know and Wi-Fi
there's like 11 or 13 channels depending
very raw so it's a reduced number of
channels and after all if you look at
Wi-Fi it's actually three or four
channels non-overlapping so it's very
few channels so a number of channels is
actually a problem with these kind of
time the domain systems I can make
thousand channels and I takes a little
time to show you why but that's I need
it's no free lunch after all so if I
make a lumber large normal challenge
sorry I have to but my penalty is the
bandwidth but that's on each channel
it's also interesting if there might be
some indications and the penetration of
these kind of radio ace impulse based
are little better but one of the most
important thing is the improved
sensitivity we are able to achieve there
it's I mean the radar I showed you here
just a while ago I mean the amount of
energy reflected from my hand when I'm
holding in front of the radar it's very
very very little now how can I recover
that basically if you look at it on this
on a siddha scope you don't see it if
you just look at it without processing
it it's it's noise and we have measured
this this this radar here is actually
able to recover energy or signals 1/10
of the noise floor meaning very very
very faint small signals there's no
magic to this the only thing we're doing
we're actually integrating we are
sending not only one pulse but we are
sending millions opposes right so if you
keep doing that for a while you can you
are able to sort of reduce your white
noise by intuition so there's no magic
to it
the important thing from this example is
that we have solved our implementation
makes I'll enable us to make these kind
of long integration which used to be a
problem with standard like analog into
it is because they are lossy but I'll
explain that it it takes some I mean I
mean it Nyquist tells you that twice you
have seven 1/2 gigahertz bandwidth in my
my band and I have to sent at least
twice the bandwidth 15 gigahertz
that's my sampling rate in practical
practical purposes I have to go up so
you can easily see that this is a
demanding toss to may discontent
circuits so for my my perspective we
need a new design approach and that's
what I'm trying to come up with here I
want to tell you about a new way of
thinking or it's not a new way but it's
a different way I guess that's that's
that's what I think we have to my
dignity mention Carver Mead he told me
listen to technology and I think that's
a good advice so what what do we get
head of silicon what what are we good at
silicon today now what's really good is
the two things happening we are getting
down we're getting we're getting down in
power and we're getting up in speed okay
so down in power means also lower lower
supply voltage
you know these chips is processor today
they are running at like one volt and
and that that impose a problem if you
want to do like traditional same
processing and logging processing
because because these low these low
power supplies is actually limiting the
quality of the thing that I can receive
all right so if I try to do more other
things that's hero and one which is the
digital way of looking at the world if I
try to do like an analog measurement of
some kind externally from a embedded
silicon system then then I
really need it's really hard to do a
good good solution so we should reduce
on the demands on the value but what we
can we have wasteful of speed we can
really we really have high speed
electronics so if you look at this a
little more systematic we have like we
have like a digital let's replace a
digital and analog like I guess I should
use this point to here so everybody can
see it so we have this analog approach
and we have this digital and in a pure
digital domain we have discrete values
and we have balanced order discrete time
and we have binary values now in the
analog domain we have a continuous time
and we have an analog or continuous
value so so but there are something in
between we of course we have this go to
sample data techniques which I know that
switch cap switch capacitors but the the
one we're going to explore today is this
sometimes called new morphic coding and
I'll use it good I'll use another word
for it today a continuous time binary
value so basically we'll take away the
clock
forget the clock so let's go continues
in time no clock and let's stay digital
in value and that's what I say when I
talk about what's listen to technology
what's best for my technology so I think
that's the optimal approach for scaling
your system with technology it's
blocking this time and work with binary
values just to show you a impulse
transmitter impulse radio transmitter I
guess I think this is the only
transistors I'm going to show you but
it's important for me not to show you
the actual solution but I want to show
you something with it quite important
with these kind of impulse impulse such
systems like the transmitter I have on
this little radar it's actually just two
transistors and a delay again I should
use this pointer here I guess so it's
just a delay here
two transistors that's always and you
can imagine that these kind of very few
transistors usually we use millions of
transistors but making it that simple
enables us to make very power efficient
transmitters and that's quite different
from what we are used to in an other
Wireless narrowband radio because in
your mobile phone you're the time you
can talk it's much less than the time
you can listen all right so you have a
standby time which is much longer and
that sort of reflect the fact that in
most systems most of the energy is
burning transmitter and little energy is
burned in the receiver and these kind of
impulse radio systems that that sort of
is reversed this is actually measured
pulse as you can see it's like 0.8 volt
peak-to-peak that measured say first
derivative of a Gaussian okay and you
can also see how it works first I just
pull up and I pull down after a short
period with which is given by this tell
okay I still need to keep using it and
then the nice thing is it scales to
higher technology sort of nodes so we
can we can sort of adapt to high
tonality very easily with these kind of
circuits but that's all there is I can
scale it to higher higher derivatives as
well but but that specially what solar
is to do with this transceiver it's it's
so easy now if you want to if you want
to transmit if you want to transmit some
information like in like like in a
wireless communication system we are
usually talking about we are
transmitting symbols and these symbols
are coded as a pseudo nose sequence we
want to try to make it or spread it out
in time in order to make a white
bandwidth so we can't just send one
pulse and see that's one bit we have to
send the number of pulses which is named
PN or pseudo noise in order to code like
a symbol must of caught my symbol could
be
could be one or could be Sarah can be a
it could be be whatever you symbol you
care to code your symbol but usually you
have you need at least two some symbols
that sort of the but but that could be
sort of traded in as number of channels
so this is how we made our make our
channels either we use we can we can
sort of fill this this sequence of so
where there's a one in this sequence so
where I have a one so here's here's so
all the ones here reflect that I'm
transmitting opposed where there is zero
I'm not transmitting anything and then I
can sort of play with with this sequence
of pulses here I can make them longer if
I make them longer I can I can make them
most balls if let's feel less filling
and and if I have less filling I can I
can trade that in for more channels
that's how I make my channels and I I
have to select codes however that that
are are the one usually called
orthogonal codes so they don't interfere
and that means that one of the important
issues of impulse radio is that we don't
have fading or interference or very
little interference and even we can use
it constructively which is what is
called sort of multipath or reflected
energy
so yeah let's meal in for that weirdo in
one of the issues we have to live with
is is the is the sort of difficult
environment that we are living in there
are all sorts of sources for reflected
energy around here so like like here if
I have a transmitter here there's one
part the green one here goes directly to
do it something in between here so that
maybe shaded from the actual receiver
there may be some walls or some whatever
bits and pieces around here that
actually reflects my energy so what I
see I see I see a direct path and I see
the reflected energy coming from the
environment around especially indoors
that very problem that that is it's
known to affect the factors and that if
we work on that it looks quite ugly it's
called a delay spread what did you see
down here and it's sort of reflect the
amount of sort of energy coming from all
around in environment here so my pulse
is not only one single pulses lot of
pulses that's what reflects out in time
now if I have this reflected pulses out
in time all they will they will look
like this is my post but what I see when
I receive them they resort out here have
a copy of them they usually they this is
not quite right they go down in energy
so they're getting smaller with time
though and if I this so this will be one
single pulse and we usually call this a
chip and if we combine it to a symbol we
see these solar patterns repeated they
tend to be very these patterns repeat
the patterns within one symbol they tend
to be the same right now and and we can
we can explore that that these symbols
the pattern the PN pattern appearing in
time it's actually repeated due to
reflected energy and we can try to
explore that in order to make to recover
our transmitted symbol those kind of a
series is actually called rake receivers
I think it was published in 58 or
something 1958 that kind of architecture
so it's good also no implementation of
rake receivers as is known to be very
powered amounting but but imagine why
because if I have now I've sort of taken
these these pulses and I've sort of
sorted them in time so we have all these
pulses here appearing it would reflected
energy in time and there's always read
out in a random pattern now I have to
look here these these boxes here we
present different templates there's four
temper zero I can get along with only
two whatever I care and then I have to
look look for these patterns in time and
that it's actually what is called a
cross correlation cross correlation is
sort of a
mounding si it's a demanding computation
and it's not used too much tend to go to
frequency because just because it saw
the money because I have to multiply at
each point in time here I have to
multiply my my template with my signal I
have to and I have to accumulate results
over here to detect the probability of
my signal appear in my symbol appearing
and that has to be in a like and running
fashion so it's a sort of a running
cross correlation that goes on so I'm
looking for that that pattern all the
time I have to do it all the time so I
can't sort of sit still and we'll just
look for it when I care I have to do it
all the time that's why it's known to be
a difficult and hard house today what
there are some approximations to that
but we have to realize that this is
actually a statistical operation we have
to to think about the probability
because we can't count on that all these
pulses are will appear because they're
so smaller so no intensity that day
they'll disappear so in noise so we have
to have to look at these patterns and we
have to compute probabilities that they
are actually appearing the the it's
known as I said to be very power hungry
but I'll try to show that this
continuous time by a value approach is
actually giving us a very power
efficient way of implementing these
these boxes this additional way is
actually you take you take template I'll
try to explore or I have to explain some
of the problems here now the traditional
way this is my receiver and I mix I
multiply if you like with my temple here
and then I have to ask my Singh who's
coming in here I have to sort of take
one bit at a time and I have to sort of
shift my through my template sift
through my template here in the correct
will correct at correct time all right
now that's a sort of messy thing because
then I need I need to
synchronize very accurately very
accurately with my with my sander and
and you know synchronizing I mean I did
remember I said that we're sort of
shaping our symbols as pseudo noise as
appearing as noise now how do you
synchronize when a noise that that's for
mentally very difficult so in one hand
we want to synchronize in other hand we
don't want to transmit frequency
components and that call it sort of
kills us it makes it really difficult to
synchronize so all proposals are loose
to that so does once your connotation
problem the other one is the stamping
problem I mean if I really want to read
analog value over it is this signal here
I have to sample with a really high rate
so our solution the solution of using a
binary value there's a very coarse
binary sampler just put a threshold and
check if my signal is below or above
that threshold that that's sort of a
very coarse quantizer
and and that that's something which is
feasible if you want to do more bits
it's really hard so all I'll try to
present you a continuous-time binary
valued solution this figure has both the
radar and and and the radio though but
but I'll so so let's if you look at the
radio down here the first thing we do as
I say we have a very coarse quantizer
I call it soon treasaor I won't go into
detail on that but it's it's a sort of
program we'll try showing element I can
set coupler parameters so to to sort of
hit the right where it won't be because
if you just take you have to find your
single so so that makes it a little more
complicated than just put a threshold
you have to put your threshold in a wise
way and that will stick to a continuous
time we'll just so after here we have a
binary value meaning zeros and ones and
zeros and ones were really good at
because that's digital and an in
continuous time where will will binary
value we'll try to do some of the
important processing
and then we'll end up with a
low-frequency standard solar digital
value but we are getting rid of that all
the high frequency demands like the high
frequency sampling and also the very
precise synchronization which is
required in traditional approach using a
DSP kind of solution
now the SEM plates I want I want you I
want you to just to think of it as an
analog to binary converter it just you
just we can set a threshold here oh
sorry
my it's slipping down here you can set
the threshold here and then what's
coming out in the other end here it's
it's just a high voltage or low voltage
which represent zeros and ones in a
normal way if we if we want to make a
rake receiver that means we get a stream
of zeros and ones that we have to sift
through and correlate with my templates
and and and and in order to avoid the
synchronization required in these
systems we make what we call a full rake
so we make a full rake receiver meaning
that we are we are looking at all sort
of possible occurrences of a a a pulse
and try to to cover all and all all
possible occurrences meaning that that
we don't we're not affected by the
synchronization I mean we can we accept
that it can appear anytime in time I
don't have to know when and the trick is
to to use this structure that you see
here which is a very simple very well
known structure it's called it ley line
so my Taos here are basically the
fundamental simplest thing then you can
make is inverter and if I spread that
out in time I I remember I have the
history I had a history of what what
happened and that history could shortly
be one one of these chips so so all
span of how long I'm expected my pulse
to to live women so we know there are
some reflections and we know the pulse
is coming and and if there's the chip we
have a chip rate at at which the pulses
may occur so if I make this de de
Leyland at least one chip rate I'm sort
of okay I'm covering where I'm expecting
my pulse to appear and and that chip
rate we're talking about it's it's the
order of mega Hertz it's not in Giga
Hertz it's like twenty to forty three
twenty to fifty megahertz which is a
reasonable clock is low clock so if we
if we now we can we can look at the
history here but by by looking at these
tabs here of the Leyland so by by by
reading out these tabs here we know the
history of my signal and if we sample
those things those are zeros and ones
nowhere in the low frequency clock
domain meaning twenty to fifty megahertz
of 40 megahertz we are able to to make a
sequence of ones and zeros which is
actually the one bit sequence where we
have we want to recover for a symbol so
if we organize now I have my continuous
time my bit stream coming in here in
continuous time this is continuous time
all the ley lines now if I look at all
these you can see the tabs here if I
look at these tabs and I I clock them so
I basically want to do I I take I fill
up my delay line and then I sample then
I fill up my delayed on an example
alright if I keep going like that you'll
you'll see that that we're actually
getting getting the symbols the the
stream the running stream of symbols
here at a little later test put a little
pointer time or a little actually
earlier in time I'll I'll get a sequence
of zeros and ones here and that goes on
so I remember all the patterns now I can
do this because these
these these electronics are only what we
call the latches they are very cheap to
make and there's another thing which is
quite surprising is that now the
demanding multiplication and when I go
to binary value it's very simple it's
just an angle so it's a very simple
operation so it's it's very it
simplifies my correlation computation so
I can afford to do all these fingers I
can never afford to do a full rake if I
simplify my multiplication and that's
what we do so to just to finish up I
hope I'll try to convey you some of the
principle of continuous time run a value
rate to zero where we actually we
quantize the input we use a sample a
line which is the continuous time thing
we make a full spatial rake receiver and
and and we avoid the synchronization
problem because I don't I can i can that
pattern I'm looking for that that
pattern my symbol it can appear in any
of these fingers okay and which one
doesn't really matter as long and and
also I look at all the reflections
because some of these fingers may may
have reflections and some may have the
what we call usually line-of-sight
single and I can combine all of them and
look for my pattern and all these
fingers so I do a collage called
constructive interference
I can use my defense constructively to
recover my single my symbol right so
that's a nice thing so I'll finish up
this part on the impulse radio by just
summarizing we have a very simple very
low-power auto low-power transmitter and
and we have a full continuous time rake
receiver which is also low power and we
have a sort of multipath detection and
we avoid all the sync problems so by
this I I
at least I give the background for
making a very power efficient lean
transceiver in an impulse radio in
standard technology that okay I'll leave
the questions to the end but I'll do
some of the radar stuff as well the
thing you saw here say the best part to
the end the this is also also a whole
smile there's a pattern from 1904 I
figure out where they actually stay I
mean as for radio they started up with
impulses then it you know in 1920s
everything was frequency but also they
in the radar actually started out with
impulses and it's kind of interesting it
was sort of explored and developed to be
for long-range applications during the
World War two there are some recent
defense work on ground penetrating radar
as well there are some interesting work
by Tom McEwen from yeast think it was a
Lawrence Livermore Lab in 1990s and he
proposed something called microphone
inputs radar which is some of the stuff
that I called me on this guy called
stuttery nee from Italy made this build
is radar based on some of these patterns
with discrete components and now this
figure is actually from his publication
it's it sort of shows you the
fundamental principle of radar let's
know you have a pulse generator we have
a transmitter that sort of radiates the
pulse on the target and the reflected
energy is sort of received here on the
receiver and then since we were all in
the same box here we can we can we can
sort of wait for a suitable amount of
time which is called ranging ranging so
we can change the range we're sort of
sampling in and then we put in the
sampler here and for and this one has to
be very fast usually they used you see
speed recovery diodes and things like
that
and then we do an equation and all these
were done with discrete components and
analog sort of solutions in this first
Raiders but still it's a very neat piece
of work so if you have time to look at
it I think it's great but we'll also so
um yeah let me skip that slide just to
do it's possible to look into a body
with these kind of things Stata Rini
proposed the idea of medical radar and
and and and it's not too much enter
attenuation like - 35 DB and something
that we can live it be kind of a kind of
kind of little layers you're going
through these kind of different layers
that we have in our body it's also
interesting regarding regarding
penetration and on in only nonlinear
penetration but that's a topic of I
won't be able to cover you today but it
is interesting I'll just explain you the
continuous time by the value impulse
radar it's it's very similar but the
idea of these analog graders we have
before they were not feasible to
implement on on a digital process so by
by exploring your continuous time
boundary value domain we were able to do
so so we have a pulse generator we send
out a pulse as we see so we you know
sort of the the general topology of a
radar and we have a delay element here
where we can do the ranging now we do a
little better these kind of integrated
Raiders because when we when we see you
do it we've seen signal here we have
this input stage which is basically a
thresholding thresholding element and
and instead of after having just sample
since since we threshold and we're a
binary value here but still continuous
time there's no clock so all this is is
buying a writing continuous time we have
zeros and ones here and and zeros and
ones is something we're really good at
treating at high speed again technology
so we can we can sample it we can have
more than one radar so actually compared
to the to the mccune radar oh sorry
what would happen here now compared to
the Mattoon McCune radar we have
something
like 64 different separate radars here
actually all working at the same time
there's the second generation here I
have here in my hand is actually a 256
radars what's also nice is that
integration of these bits it's kind of
easy to do because bits integration of
bits is actually just counting I'm just
counting number once so that if you go
in the single processing world and talk
about that you'll you will have
something called a lossless integrator I
can keep I can integrate for a long time
still I'm integrating which is undoable
in an analogue domain so this continuous
time money value gives me that
opportunity I can integrate for a long
time and that's why that's why I'm able
to recover these very faint things that
you see in this radar right we do
another sort of we had another approach
or which I think it's quite quite
important we call it swept threshold
sampling a little bit difficult I mean
basically if we only set these blue
things could be different threshold
voltages so if you have a high threshold
we only we will get a this sort of
dashed red narrow pulse here if I have a
low threshold I have get this white
pulse here so so so depending on what
kind of threshold I'm selecting for my
for my threshold I'll get these
different results so we figure out why
not sweep the threshold start from with
some low value and then sweep it upwards
and keep going and and we if we start
working a little bit on the theory you
see you we're actually doing a full a TD
conversion and of course if you look at
the teacher you'll find it it's got that
little one bit ADC converter so but we
do it a little bit differently though
but that's that it's a good idea you
actually map map out I mean the value to
any resolution
with these kind of approaches the theory
it's it's - I won't go true today a
little more elaborate how we do this
these things so we have a digital pulse
generator so that generates a pulse so I
don't know it's sort of noisy pulse I
send out as a si Gaussian here on the
antenna and again you find it lay here
which I can tune with a range and you
see what we do here we only delay the
clock input the the sampling time is so
low by a again our familiar delay line
but this is a very high speed lay line
running at that gives us actually I
close to 70 gigahertz and latest
implementation sampling or death
sampling so these are the different
countless different and indicators so it
will make gate gives me it gives me the
different she'll remember the shells are
talked about and run this radar those
are the different integrators the
counters are actually different shells
that I'm I have in my radar well keep it
moving this stupid screen and serve them
so so that's that's more elaborate one
of the most intriguing results is
actually exactly these results because
that they were unexpected if you
actually work with these kind of kind of
systems here we can compare it like the
behavior of these kind of very simple
simple quantization systems that we have
here if we did these if we only only
only x-axis here I have noise so I start
out without start out without noise but
in any real transmission there's there's
noise there's a lot of noise and of
course it's all proportional to the to
the amount of energy you are allowing
transmitted if I can throw out a lot of
energy there is no problem with it so so
we have a like a signal here but we keep
singing stable and we increase the noise
now you see the green lines here they
actually show that for an analog the a I
don't when I have an analog
your this is done in MATLAB so we're
going to have an analog in single I
don't need to integrate at all for at
in at low low noise values now as I
increase the noise of my signal over
here
you can see that those are three
different solution here depending on the
quality here one a really high quality I
have to I have to early start an
integration here and I have to integrate
so these are number of integration it's
analog scale so these are the number of
integrations that I need for for my in
order to recover my signal with some
quality okay and I three different
qualities here now the red ones here
those are what we call sweat threshold
sampling our our threshold sweeping
technique in our radar and again we have
three different sort of quality levels
quality measures of a number of sync
noise ratio if you like to that
old-fashioned turn and you see I can
with this cause quantizer I need a
number of number of integrations in
order to recover my single C I have to
start with the closed 100 for at least
whatever quality and even high quality
signals I need 100 it sort of it
intuitions in order to become a signal
now as we increase noise here and here's
what's important as we increase noise
here now we see that the ideal the best
case the best you can do high resolution
HD conversion in noise it's sort of it's
it's rising steeper than our our swept
threshold sampling technique so for high
noise values we're actually doing almost
as good as the ideal case meaning that
we we don't need too many more in
samples or integrations in order to
recover a signal and that's that's
surprising that not really show that
this this makes sense now if you look at
the good old literature you find out
there people have thought of these
things before so these blue lines
actually shows something called
stochastic resonance there was some
theory from the 80s I think in physics
guys figure out that if you have
something repeated if you do integration
you are able to recover signals buried
in noise and I should see for high
Israelis we are actually doing
stochastic wrestling sampling so it's
it's it's kind of it's quite remarkable
that we're actually doing us as well as
almost as well as the best case so what
are these I mean communication you know
wireless communication is something you
can lay some venue but is this new do
this device here what what is it good
for well we have I mean the first thing
was medical right I want to sense my my
my heartbeat or my breathing I things
like that and that's what that arena did
with his first radar and we thought I
was good at E because you can make it as
a touch device it doesn't most of the
heart beating measurements devices
they're to be attached to your body
somehow and you have these straps you
wear if you have these jogging things
and it's not it's not nice I mean people
don't like that so if I could put it on
back on my mobile phone and put it here
and you read my heartbeat that would be
much nicer if I could put it in the
backseat of my car I can use it to warn
me when I fall asleep things like that
so those are useful useful applications
though I mean I get I get when I talk
about these things I get a number of
ideas from people that think it's nice
like we want to track a radar or a probe
pill in your new body we can do that
millimeter resolution it's arranging
very accurate ranging devices rusyn
electromagnetics which is also a where
orders two or three orders of magnitude
better than set it out in an to respect
so so we have an even accompany looking
at stress detectors for pilots and and
well it's up to you we there's a number
of this is a year very immature or
premature eyes you can see device which
has to be polished and it's it's a new
technology and it's it's actually it's
actually one square little millimeter of
silicon so it's it's I think there's a
lot there's actually there's actually
potential so remember it's it's not only
its own not only a
one radar is actually only shows 256
shells that we have in these radars and
I mean I can easily make few thousand
shells if I care
so my last slide what will you learn
today I hope I really got you on
something that you didn't heard before
we can make impulse Raider in an
electronics inst off the shelf cheap
technology
and we can make very low-power
transmitter and also low-power receivers
using patinas time money value and I saw
demoed for you here with this new
technics we're also able to make this
web threshold sampling we which can be
used like which i think is RF distance
measurements is one of the achievements
of these current technology and also
these kind of sensing things I expect to
be useful for these devices alright I
think that's about it thank you are we
doing timewise all right how could you
use the mic
I was wondering if you could say a few
words about antenna design compensates
the scale lips that's the shape that's
our thing well I'm India and it's a
trade-off between the kind of band this
road is this one you see here first one
we made a little own frequency to 2.5
gigahertz and frequency fairly wide band
so actually it's it's not within the
sort of defined bandwidth by FCC as it
is now we have this one is better
now the penetrate the penalty of going
up in frequencies you reduce your
penetration so but they're about the
advantage your going frequencies you can
make smaller antennas alright so you can
make still make small antennas for lower
frequency but your efficiency is
degraded so so usually you try to make
some gain in your antenna and you can
make them and this one is sort of it's a
shell thing if you if I make different
shapes on attendence like your horn I
can sort of direct my energy and
parabolic shapes we are working within
with a since these transmitters are so
easy to make we're actually working with
a electromagnetic beam former that makes
it possible to focus energy without
using very focused antennas because
folks antennas tend to be large but but
these bowties antennas seem to be
working fine I I've tried with smaller
antennas they're also okay so but still
like I mean for making a really small
device the antenna is some of the issues
yet to solve I'm afraid it wasn't very
clear and surveyed but what is the
minimum size yeah but you get an idea of
the problems but have you considered
using
because that give you multiple
correlation values instead of the
bi-level
correlation values as a approach to
helping synchronization tell you one
model what kind of codes basically the
codes were using our total token with
codes these would be sort of like the
pseudo-random codes but instead of a
bi-level correlation they would give you
multiple value correlations well yes but
that's all of the trade of that you can
do that yes just just having more some
symbols and and and and that would give
you how a bandwidth but less channels so
that's that's what you you like to trade
so that's an in it's trade off if you
want everyone you can I can make high
bandwidth systems with this kind as I
actually suggest by by using more
symbols simply and and that's that's
something you can do but if you want go
for more channels then you want
basically it's its length of code and
and your population in the code things
like that that in the end trades off
your your well I guess the important
message in the message here is to convey
that that these kind of radio it's easy
to play with these parameters it's easy
to make longer symbols and it's easy to
make a higher speed if you need it or
more channels if you need it and I think
that's quite different because in a
traditional radio you have to design
your channels very accurately with your
modulation of each of the channels so so
it's these radios are much more dynamic
say okay
you've described a novel technique for
low-power short-range radio transmission
and and radar I'm curious to to know if
you have a sense as to applications
you know if somebody turned this into a
communications link where might it fit
in to other short-range communication
things in terms of power or speed or so
on I'm familiar with bluetooth with RFID
with 802 11 do you have a sense of what
you know where this might find sure I
think Kiton the key is that that the
reverse power budget these kind of
radios three low-power transmitter hmm
and and and more power and depending on
how so lean receiver right and that that
that gives say ACS symmetry which is
makes it interesting for like like
implants body implants B where we have
very you don't want to be change of
battery too often basically but also
like in my opinion the current RFID
technology it is very immature and I
think this is a much better technology
for for tags like RFIDs
because the two reasons it's very
low-power you can even do power
harvesting you know easy not easy but
you can do it secondly I have a much
larger number of channels so that
simplifies all my protocols I can go do
use some TDMA or CDMA kind of things in
order that's what you're doing today in
order to if I am have if I'm running my
yoked grocery store and I'm coming when
I you know hundred items I can't just
roll through today see but if we do and
that's paid fundamental is basically the
number limited number of channels
available you have to sort of do one at
a time because they interfere hmm so I
think this there is a number of
applications where these kind of
properties can be explored
so so and as you there's there's there's
a third sort of fundamental issue or
property of these kind of devices
that's the sensitivity which I showed
you with this radar because I'm able to
recover very weak signal now we're sort
of there's a lot of project research
going on for a home health care or even
in hospital health care where you
actually take away the wires because
while if you get wired up you can't move
around and and that it seemed not good
for you it's good for you to move around
so if you take away wire in a medical
kind of environment you better make sure
that what what's supposed to go in NMR
it's conveyed wirelessly right and
that's something that that sort of
guarantee is not good enough with the
current systems I imagine that with this
kind of integrating kind of hardware I
can increase my sensitivity to be much
better than traditional narrowband radio
okay and that I think is important there
is no free lunch so if I do intuition I
lose speed I lose I lose bandwidth data
bandwidth but but but most of these
medical applications if it's bits per
minute or somewhere that it's very slow
all right
so okay so these are some of the areas
I'm always you know I've I've got a lot
number of other suggestions which are
more specialized okay
so a lot of the design in the receiver
seemed to be designed to reject
multipath reflections as noise and
harmful but I wonder if you've
considered or or maybe you're using the
state of that rake receiver as as
information so that maybe sensing
something about the multipath
reflections is a useful signal may be in
medical radar
yes that's usually usually known as
making a channel model making a model of
your transmission channel and try to
review it is a good thing to do so if
you can sort of predict and correct your
incoming signal but about dependent is
gets its demanding processing voice so I
the question is how can we I mean I'm
I'm very prudent with technology I am I
aim is really low power solutions so
what does it cost me in order to do this
kind of channel models and compensate
for them my incoming single and and it's
done today I mean like ADSL is this
broadband modems they do that but it's
not free regarding power okay
all right thank you
