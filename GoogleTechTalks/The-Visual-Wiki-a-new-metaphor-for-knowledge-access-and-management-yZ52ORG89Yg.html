about a visual wiki thanks John this is
work that's done with a bunch of people
at Auckland in particular Christian
Hirsch who's a student of John Grundy
and mine together with some other
colleagues Tim Chaffee from our
information technology services group
and a couple of summer interns David
MacDonald and URI hell it's key oops so
I'm going to talk a little bit about
background approach methodology
concentrate on the visual wiki metaphor
that that we're developing a very short
evaluation that we've done of the the
technology and then some discussion
afterwards so if we think about the the
term visual wiki we can divide that and
see two parts the visual part and the
the wiki part and if we look at the
visual part there's a variety of
different things that come to mind in
terms of things like information
visualization on the one hand knowledge
visualization and a more general sense
domain specific visual languages which
is something that our groups been
playing around with a lot with and then
human-computer interaction how do you
interact with visualizations and make
them useful and underpinning that
cognition how do you actually make use
of a visualization in order to stimulate
the brain and to recognizing patterns
that it would be difficult to recognize
otherwise if we look on the the wiki
side of course wiki's are wrapped up
with the whole web 2.0 and moving into
the the business side enterprise 2.0
knowledge management as an alternative
to the the more formal approaches to
knowledge management then underpinning
that a whole lot of tools technologies
concepts the Semantic Web and so on so
what we're trying to do and what we're
aiming for with the visual wiki is to
try and marry these two sort of concepts
together so if we first of all look at
the the wiki side of it
if we think about web 2.0 or enterprise
2.0 we'll have a sort of understanding
of what they are although there are
really no clear definitions there's a
mixture of tools things like wiki's
blogs social software and the like which
is the the surface effect of it some
underlying technologies that make it all
happen things like RSS Ajax and so forth
and then the concepts that that web two
point O enables are things like user
participation mass collaboration rich
user experience remix ability all of
these sorts of terms that we're used to
seeing bandied about key point is that
this whole set of technologies and
concepts is changing the way in which we
as humans process information if we look
at the information lifecycle you can
sort of break it into stuff about
creating information or knowledge
organizing it in some way distributing
it around the place for other people to
consume the other people have to search
and find for it and then they make use
of it and reuse it so if we look at the
web one point oh this is web two point
oh we're used to seeing this migration
from things like strictly personal use
through to stuff where there's mass
participation as instant feedback on the
sort of stuff that you do and
underpinning that things like a move
from a proprietary content management
system into peer production
collaboration mess collaboration
organizing at via social surf software
mechanisms rather than using strict
directories hyperlink structures and
alike and all the way through of course
page rank folks on amis and alike as
ways of changing the way in which we
search search and access the information
following along behind this is the
impact on business and the intranet so
in enterprise one point oh so does
we're used to a top-down approach to
creation of knowledge whereas if we're
moving into enterprise to point oh it's
a more organic bottom-up sort of
approach to doing things and this
challenges the typical enterprise who
are very hidebound and policies and
procedures and the sort of organic
democratic approach to generation and
management of knowledge is somewhat
contrary to that centrist tendency in in
many organizations if we then go across
to the information knowledge visual
visualization both of these are
effective method methods for
representing and organizing knowledge
and information richard scenarios it
allow us to make sense of large
complicated stuff by providing
visualizations and the reason this is
effective of courses that we as humans
are pretty good at dealing with spatial
concepts dynamic concepts so if we have
visualizations that hook into that
cognitive processing system then we can
use exploit that ability of the human
brain to understand a large complicated
systems more efficiently so the
technique in both of these sorts of
approaches is to have some sort of
resource object that's the thing that we
want to visualize the information or the
knowledge we have some sort of visual
way of representing that knowledge
that's the domain specific visual
language the visualization if you like
and then we have some sort of purpose
that we we want to achieve it might be
that we're actually creating knowledge
so actually creating knowledge via a
domain-specific visual language or we
may be actually using the visualization
to understand or organize knowledge
transfer it to others and so forth so
coming back to our concept of the visual
wiki what we're trying to do is marry
those those two worlds together so both
of them have the potential to
improved a way in which we go about
doing knowledge management that's
reasonably obvious the wiki it's this
ability to think dynamically to be able
to collaboratively develop stuff have an
ad hoc creation mechanism and then
organize stuff afterwards and that's
much closer to the way in which we tend
to think about doing things we tend to
introspect a little then organize things
introspect some war and so forth and
then the visual side of it is of course
as I've already said a very efficient
way to represent and organize the
knowledge that we've obtained
particularly in from information-rich
scenarios so the approach that we've
taken in this work is to try and explore
this concept of what a visual wiki might
mean and to take that term apart
deconstructed and then work out how we
can go about exploiting a range of
technologies and range of proches to
develop a variety of different concepts
that relate to this visual wiki approach
so there are existing approaches of
course to doing this so if any of you
have played with Gliffy glyph is a thin
client visual editing tool so it's a
graphical editor it's allows you to
create diagrams on the web in our case
that's been linked with the confluence
wiki tool so it allows you to do things
like diagrams within a wiki page and
it's it's a very good tool if you
haven't played with that I strongly
recommend you ever have a bit of a look
at on so that's that's up sir gliffy GLI
ffy done
okay so that's an active approach there
are passive approaches as well so things
like the touch craft wiki browser allow
you to represent a graph associated with
a wiki so representing the the
connection of wiki pages to each other
that's a passive approach it provides a
visualization of knowledge that's
already been essentially organized so
what we want to do is actually combine
the active and the passive together so
that we end up with a mapping between a
wiki and a visualization and that
mapping may involve communication in
either direction and what we want to do
is exploit explore how we can actually
make use of such a mapping to do
interesting knowledge management
activities so in thinking about that
what you have is four components you've
got on the one hand the the
visualization on the other hand the
textual wiki stuff you've got a mapping
between them and then underpinning that
you've got some sort of concept which
you're trying to represent in some way
so what we've done is breaking that down
onto a whole lot of different parameters
associated with each of those mechanisms
and of course that's too far too small
to to read but if you take out the ones
that are really important the sorts of
things that we're interested in there
are the type of mapping so the
cardinality if you like on on the
mapping typically the visualization side
is often a a one where you're trying to
aggregate up stuff that's in a mini
situation within a wiki or textual
structure but that can be a one-to-one
mapping it can be a 12 in mapping or as
we'll explore later it could be a
many-to-many type mapping as well but
and then there's an issue of consistency
if so if you change something on one or
other side what's the impact on on the
mapping so you could have no consistency
so you're maintaining things sort of
semi independently you could have one
way consistency so if you change
something on one side that impacts
the other side or you could have full
bi-directional consistency now if you
look under lead underneath underneath
them to the the concepts the most
important parameters there are to do
with the the sort of content that you
have is this something that's quite
general sort of Wikipedia type stuff you
know general knowledge type stuff thats
related to mass participation or is it
something that's more specific something
that's quite internal to say a small
business unit and very focused and in
its representation and then as I
mentioned earlier there's a purpose for
which you're doing this so you try to
create knowledge organizer distributed
search for it or apply it or some
combination of those sorts of things so
having come up with that that sort of
formalism what we're interested in doing
was exploring various combinations of
those parameters to see how useful they
might be in practice so the approach
that we've taken is to choose one
control parameter amongst those four
parameters there and three variable
parameters vary the three variables and
see what effect that has on the control
parameter control parameter we've chosen
is the purpose so what we're interested
in doing is generating a variety of
different example visual wiki structures
varying the other parameters and seeing
how useful each of those different types
of wiki visual wiki might be for the
purpose okay so what we've in fact
donors is produced to date three
prototypes exploring some combination of
those parameters clearly there's lots
more combinations that we could look at
and then we've done a very brief
evaluation which has given us some clue
that we're on the right direction in
terms of the differentiations that are
being made and we're in the process of
doing a larger evaluation to get a
better handle on the different utility
factors
so the first of the the prototypes is
something we've called fig base the type
of mapping here is one to one so we've
got nodes in the visualization
corresponding directly to entities
within the the textual wiki pages
there's two-way consistency so if either
side changes you get effects on the
other it's very general content as we
see that's in fact Wikipedia in a
semantic web form and then we're
interested in what sort of purpose you
might apply that that sort of prototype
to the second one vb ke this is the
visual body of knowledge explorer the
mapping here was once many so this is an
aggregation of information that's in a
wiki into a condensed visualization the
aggregation is independently managed
from the wiki structure that essentially
no consistency although I'll elaborate
on that a little bit when we get to that
particular example and the content here
is medium in the sense that it's being
used to represent the information
architecture of a university in fact our
our University and the challenge that we
had There was that Tim Chaffee one of
the people contributing to this property
project wanted a way of explaining the
information architecture of the
University to our Vice Chancellor so you
wanted something that aggregated stuff
up in a way that the general layperson
could understand then the third one was
quite a specific one so the content was
specific it was a processed mapper so
the mapping here as many to many the
consistency is one way and it's quite
specific content so the three of them
together span all of the values of the
the various parameters there although
clearly there are different combinations
of those that you could apply as well
okay so the first of prototypes is a of
the think map visualization tool with
freebase so freebase is a semantic wiki
which is publicly accessible it's been
seeded with the Wikipedia information
base and there's been quite a strong
attempt to structure the information
within the semantic wiki to exploit the
semantic concepts that relate the the
Wikipedia wiki pages together in this
particular case as ass mentioned earlier
there's one to one mapping there's
two-way consistency although the system
or demo to you is only one way
consistent at the present general
knowledge and as I said exploits the
free based semantics wiki nature so what
I'll do is just flick over to think base
which is running over here so here we
see think base resolution to the screens
a little bit small so it's the
visualizations a little bit compact but
what we see here is the featured piece
of information is Indiana Jones and the
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and there's
a visualization of the semantic
relationships associated with that
around it so we can see that the people
starring and that whoops various people
starring in it there's two written by
David Karp and jeff nathanson for
example and various piece of information
and over here on freebase is the
freebase entry for Indiana Jones and the
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull if you
haven't seen freebase before you'll see
that further down on the entry in a
tabular form of a semantic linkages so
each of these there's a table and if you
eat it either end of it then there's a
consistent relationship managed so
freebase if you haven't played with it
is another cool tool to have a bit of a
look at so over here in terms of the
visualization we can
spore around on this so we can for
example have a look at Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade as a another
alternative and we'll see once it
rearranges itself hopefully it's
interesting we haven't had the freebase
come up let's try over here
okay we've got a failure switch all
right we're right okay so we see as we
navigate to other parts of the the graph
there we get free base coming up and in
correspondence to that we can do things
like find out about George Lucas this is
going very slowly so we can do a search
on George Lucas for example in Wikipedia
or well since we're here on google
connection is very slow we'll wait for
that to to come up so the key thing is
here that what we've got is a
visualization that we can wander around
them and once it's full of it it will
come up with some
maybe not place a case of don't do live
demos let's try doing something else
let's try doing a search up here oh it's
the google search for George Lucas it's
finally come up and here I've done a
search on Homer oops we had a exception
thrown that wasn't the homo I wanted so
we've got a variety of different search
results that correspond to that so we
can find the home of that I was more
interested in Homer Simpson and if we
wait for a while there'll be the
visualization come up on that so
normally this is running a little bit
quicker than this we'll leave that to
rearrange itself and come back later
okay so just going back to the the talk
here so we've looked at think base as
one example that's going very slowly as
i mentioned there's there's two way
consistency in the original think based
tool that we developed so you can
actually add new new semantic wiki
linkages in the visualization you can't
do in the public version that we've
we've made available and you can make
changes in the semantic wiki side and
the visualization side is kept
consistent so there's two way
consistency maintain their the second
prototype was an again an integration of
think map this time with confluence
which is a as a corporate wiki this is a
one-to-many mapping there's no
consistency except of the fact that it's
doing a search within the wiki so if you
change the wiki structure the searchers
will obviously get updated each time you
do them and as ice mentioned before it's
more specific knowledge in that it's to
do with the information architecture of
the University so here's part of the
visual vb hey running
sorry the resolutions a little bit
difficult to see here but the sorts of
elements that you have and hear things
like business units within the
university various applications that
your they using in terms of enterprise
software various technologies that
underpin those applications and and the
like and then what you can do in a
similar sort of approach here with the
visualization over here we've got a
internal search of the the wiki for
things that relate to the elements that
you've selected on the left now the the
graph that's essentially underpinning
the the visualization on the left is
separately maintained from the wiki
structure so if you like it's it's the
information architects graph
representation of the information
architecture of the University and then
that's mapped through to interesting
wiki information via similar sort of
mechanism that i showed you only the
think base explorer so you can do things
like sets the wiki again search google
and look at the URL associated with
these things and so forth but you can
edit the the graph as part of the
visualization structure so you can
modify the representations being
visualized there add new nodes modify
the the names of them and so forth so
that was the second one the third one
was again an integrated integration of
think map so we've used this in all
three applications because it's
reasonably convenient to to program with
and this is an integration to think that
this time with mediawiki with a and into
here mapping one way consistency in
quite specific knowledge in this
particular case what we've got as a
visualization of a business process so
imagine if you like some sort of
business process that you're mapping out
and what you're interested in doing is
to map that business process diagram
that you have through to
set of nodes that might relate to it as
part of a search result and then the
idea is to influence the wiki content
through the visualization there so in
this particular case as you create the
visual process within the visualization
tool you get wiki pages generating it
generated as a placeholder for playing
around with them so over here we have a
representation of a business process
this is enrolling a student within the
university with various steps in the
process and in blue there and various
business units like the Student Services
enrollment office and so forth
associated with them no over on the
right we've got two visualizations one
is of the wiki pages corresponding to
particular entity and the other is the
the web page is corresponding to in this
case the business unit associated with
this particular wiki structure okay so
that's a very quick run through the
three different prototypes if we now
look at the control parameter that we
had there which was the purpose what are
those three different approach is going
to be useful for in terms of that
knowledge or information lifecycle so
what we did for the evaluation purposes
of this was to do an online survey we
only had a very small group of
participants we wanted some very quick
information as to whether they were
going to be actually differences between
these sorts of things it's quite a
biased sample and that most people were
involved or related the project had some
some knowledge of what we were trying to
achieve but as I say it was a quick
qualitative feedback to give us an idea
as to whether we're going in the right
direction so the sorts of things we
asked people to do was to compare the
straight wiki structure with the visual
wiki concept and then ask them questions
about rating the improvement
of ability to do things like searching
for information or creating information
that sort of thing so they were related
obviously to the purpose which was the
control variable ahead so the critique
of that of course as I mentioned is that
we've only got a small group and it's a
by a set of participants so down the
bottom there you can see colored as as
per the bottom there what the survey
participants thought in terms of the
usefulness of each of the different
prototypes for the different types of
purpose that we had there and the
interesting thing is that there are
significant differences so for example
not surprisingly the think based one
which is very much about navigating
general purpose information was heavily
featured in terms of the search
characteristics there a little bit less
so in the creation but interesting the
organization rated reasonably highly as
well whereas the visual body of
knowledge Explorer rated fairly highly
in terms of distribution and that was
quite interesting because that was
really the motivation for developing
that particular tool was to allow a
distribution of knowledge from
information architects across to lay
people within a university so we can see
that there are definite differences in
terms of the the three prototypes there
albeit with a very small sample of
participants so if we just look a bit of
a summary now in terms of where we've
got to first of all what we've come up
with is this visual wiki model and this
the sort of theoretical model allows us
to analyze and discuss and evaluate
different approaches to what of this
visual wiki might actually mean so we've
then looked at a proof of concept in
terms of three different prototypes
which we've deliberately chosen to
exploit different characteristics within
that theoretical model and then we've
done a very brief evaluation of those
three prototypes which all suggest that
the specializations suit them for
particular information lifecycle
purposes we want to head to now
obviously as to improve on the existing
prototypes clearly we got a speed issue
in terms of the the link from Aucklander
here for the one I was trying to
demonstrate to you we're right now
undergoing a more formal evaluation so
we've recruited a bunch of participants
for a larger usability evaluation which
is being conducted online Maurice as we
speak we'd like to extend the visual
wiki model further to exploit explore
some of the other parameters that that
weren't mentioned that were in that
larger table that I showed their
implement those those further approaches
and then evaluate them as well and then
coming back to AAC and the the more
familiar medical work that you guys know
Jon Brande and I for would very much
like to weave this work back into that
net it'll work and what we have in mind
is the ability to generate visual wiki
applications using the metal structures
that we've developed so thanks to the
opportunity to talk and have it taken
questions John do you see the
possibility to use is also to integrate
various different sources of information
so you have say in an enterprise a
number of different data sources which
you want to visualize and using that
kind of concept to integrate various
sources yes definitely that's that's
that's a great extension of the concept
to some extent wikis already do that in
the sense that the whole purpose of
setting up a wiki culture within an
organization's is too dry try and glue
those various silos of information
together but doing it explicitly as you
indicate would be a great great set of
concept
what questions Cheers
and it's going back on the visualization
to one source of data that comes mine
would be source code and I wonder
generalization so that very generally
okay so the question if I understand it
just so people elsewhere can hear it one
of the things we've been aiming at doing
is to provide edits and both directions
and some of the some of the examples
exploit that Jazz's question was how
general can you make those those sorts
of it it so that for example of set of a
wiki you might have a piece of source
code on as the textual component and
what you're doing is editing on the
visualization that's that's the whole
point of what we're doing is trying to
exploit explore that further so to date
the the sorts of edits that we've done
have been quite simple ones so I've been
adding a semantic link for example in
terms of the the freebase work
generating a wiki page in terms of the
final process map for example editing
the separately maintained node structure
in the in the case of the visual body of
neurologic straw we're interested in
pushing that a lot further and the
reason for hooking it back to the
medical work is that we can then
generate much more sophisticated editing
actions on the part of the visualization
than perhaps were capable with with the
think nap tool that we've been using to
date so reviews think that because it's
been a very convenient prototyping tool
but we see very quickly that we're going
to extend beyond the the capabilities
that will want out of that the questions
okay thanks so much
