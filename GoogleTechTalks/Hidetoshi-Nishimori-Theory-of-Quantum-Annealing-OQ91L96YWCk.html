great honors that we have fitted her she
know she Mauro
visiting us today from Tokyo Misha
Morrison is professor of physics at the
Tokyo Institute of Technology and he is
actually an old hand in the theory of
quantum annealing spin systems and he
has thought about many of the problems
we are excited about today already 10 or
20 years ago is actually an author of
hundred plus papers and two books on the
topics and he actually got his PhD also
in Tokyo at the University of Tokyo but
spent his postdoc years some of his
postdoc years here in the u.s. at
Carnegie Mellon and Rutgers universities
and he won two prestigious prizes see a
machine and Memorial Prize and the IBM
science prize and very curious to hear
about his latest work and he will
present a little bit a general topic
talk on the theory of quantum annealing
Misha Morrison thank you very much I'm
very happy to be here to talk in front
of people in Google and others so I was
working on statistical physics I was but
I'm now better to be heavily working on
quantum annealing so I will talk on this
latter topic today the title is as
written here theory of quantum annealing
so let me set up the framework first of
the structure of my talk today it's
about quantum computation and very
well-known or the best-known framework
of quantum computation is the gate model
in which you prepare a set of curious
quantum bits linear combinations of
zeros and ones and you apply quantum
gates unitary transformations to those
sets one by one discretely and change
the state of the system toward the goal
and quantum annealing or quantum
adiabatic computation is another
paradigm of quantum computation and the
goal at least the current goal that is
actively sought after is to solve
comunitaria optimization problems as
efficiently as possible
so the problem itself is classical no
quantum mechanics appears in the problem
of community of optimization itself but
we use quantum annealing quantum
mechanics to solve it and it is now
known that these two paradigms are
equivalent with polynomial overhead
however we set a specific goal for
quantum annealing today to solve
community optimization problems so let
me focus on this aspect and another
reason is that quantum annealing has
been realized as hardware by d-wave
systems as you many of you may know when
I proposed the concept of quantum
annealing I never expected that someone
will manufacture such a machine it's a
crazy idea but they did it and they sold
it
so it's very amazing anyway it's not
about experiments it's about theory
today so we want to solve combinatorial
optimization problems a typical example
of which is the Traveling Salesman
problem in which there are many cities
on the map and the task is to visit all
the cities once and return to the
original position as shortest path as
possible so we have to minimize the tour
length or the cost function the cost
function is the generic name in
comunitario optimization problem to be
minimized and another example is the
latest protein folding in which amino
acids are placed on sites or bodies of a
lattice for simplicity and you try
various configurations of those
positions to identify the lowest energy
state and since we are putting amino
acids on the lattice the directions
between two amino acids are discrete so
they can be represented in terms of
zeros and ones so the problem is to
identify the lowest energy state given
the value of this sequence of bills so
this is a classical problem in the sense
that nothing quantum mechanical aspects
appear here
so a formal formulation of combinatorial
optimization problem goes as follows
it's to minimize the cost function of
discrete variables since discrete
variables can be represented in terms of
a series of bits zeros and ones that can
be easily translated into plus or minus
1 a set of those so-called Ising spins
and the Ising model of statistical
physics as the energy function or the
Hamiltonian or the cost function
typically of this form Sigma's are Ising
spins plus or minus one given at each
site or at each variable and in this
typical example the cost function is a
quadratic function of Sigma's with
coefficient j IJ but you're a problem of
communitary optimization may not be
represented in terms of this simple
quadratic form it may have a linear form
or third of the time but the story that
I that I'm going to tell you about today
does not depend upon the details of the
form of this Hamiltonian so let me take
this very simple form of quadratic
common tone e'en or the cost function or
the energy which should be minimized as
a function of the Ising spins or bits
so the lowest energy state of this cost
function is called the ground state in
physics so I will use this term
frequently and often those Isaac spins
plus 1 minus 1 are represented in terms
of the arrows up arrow an arrow means
plus 1 for Sigma I and down arrow or
minus 1 and a very well-known generic or
with a heuristic method to solve such
combinatorial optimization problems is
simulated an area so this diagram shows
the value of the cost function as a
function of the state or the
configuration of spins output ups and
downs so if you give a configuration of
spins or the series of beads like here
up down down up then the value of the
cost function is given uniquely given
here and in simulated annealing you try
to change the state by a small amount
for instance the upper left spin has
been flipped from up to down and you
calculate the body of the cost function
for the new configuration and since the
goal is to find the ground state or the
lowest energy state then if the new
congregation is that has a lower energy
or lower value of the cost function then
you accept the new configuration as the
updated candidate state but even if you
have a higher energy then you accept
that new state with the probability e to
the minus Delta divided by T where Delta
e is the difference between the cost
function the new state minus the old
state and T is the parameter called the
temperature you accept this uphill move
up here motion because a better state
may go beyond the hill and this
parameter T temperature is kept very
high initially so the probability is
equal to 1 because inverse T is close to
zero so initially the system hops from
state to state very frequently looking
for the best state in the whole space of
the states and you gradually decrease
the temperature to a lower value to
lower values and in the end you set the
temperature to 0 and if successful the
system will be in the ground state of
the whole state space which is here
and this is a very well-known method
proposed in the early 80s and the paper
by Scott calculate recon company has
been cited almost 20,000 times it's a
big breakthrough in the field so this is
classical in the sense
nothing quantum mechanical shows up here
and as a physicist I was curious what
happens if we replace this classical
thermal hopping process by quantum
tunneling processes so we call it
quantum annealing instead of simulated
annealing it's also made a heuristic in
the sense that it can be applied to any
problem if the problem has been
committed in terms of the Ising model
that melatonin that I wrote before so
initially similarly to the simulator
learning process we let the system
evolve looking for the best state among
all states uniformly but sense of
uniformity is different because we
accept a quantum mechanical linear
combination of all states so the
probability is uniform in the quantum
mechanical sense initially
so from this state with very large
quantum fluctuations we gradually
control the strength of quantum
fluctuations toward zero following the
shredding equation the natural time
evolution of the system of the
microscopic world then we hope that the
quantum mechanical probability will will
graduate constraint concentrate on lower
energy states and in the end if
successful the probability will be
sharply peaked at the ground state or
the lower energy state so this is the
basic idea of quantum annealing and it
sounds fancy to physicists at least it's
interesting but does it really work
quantum mechanical tunneling is
effective or not this is the first
question we asked ourselves and answer
turned out to be yes in the following
sense that I will describe and if it
works is there any reason to use quantum
fluctuations instead of thermal
classical fluctuations in other words is
it better than simulated annealing or
not and surprisingly we found the answer
is yes in some sense which I will
describe shortly so let me show you some
of the first pieces of evidence that
support those conclusions
so we took a very small system just
eight spins eight body with plus and
minus ones and those spins have been
connected by random interactions this is
the so-called the Sherrington calculator
ik model of spin glasses if the size is
very large to identify the ground state
configuration or the lowest energy
configuration of this program is known
to be very hard but the system is small
so it's a test bed and we control the
strength of the quantum fluctuations
which is written as gamma of P here as a
function of T in this form three divided
by the square root of T so if T is small
that is initially the quantum
fluctuations the amplitude of quantum
fluctuations is very large and as time
goes on three divided by square root of
T decreases so in the end it's very
small so we solve the trading equation
directory for this small size system it
can be solved directly because the
number of states is two to the eighth
it's 256 which is small and this graph
shows the probability P of T which in
for the probability that the system is
in the ground state at the given time T
the wave function as a solution of the
Schrodinger equation
is composed of a linear combination of
all states with appropriate coefficients
and for this small system we know the
ground state from the outset so we
looked at the coefficient of the ground
state and the square root of this
coefficient gives the quantum mechanical
probability that the system is in the
ground state at the given time T
so as you see this probability increases
monotonically as time goes on and
apparently it approaches one in the end
so in this sense at least for this
system quantum annealing works and it
works better than simulated annealing in
the sense that the probability exceeds
the corresponding probability of
simulated annealing which is plotted in
the second curve here and in simulated
annealing we control the temperature
capital T as a function of time P in the
same way as we control the strength of
quantum fluctuations 3 divided by square
root of T there is a reason there are
reasons to directory compare gamma and
capital T if you are curious I can
answer but let me just go on just
believe me it is legitimate to accept
the same functional form of those
functions so if you drive the system in
this way family by solving the master
equation which represents the
probability that the system is in the
ground state or any other state by
similar learning processes we found this
curve so asymptotically it seems that
this curve for the classical process
doesn't reach 1 in this sense of course
it is not negligible it's close to 0.6
so if you repeat this experiment twice
then with high probability you expect
that system we find the ground state but
in quantum annealing you can expect it
just by a single run so in this sense
quantum annealing is better than
simulated annealing at least for this
system of small size
and after this initial indication a lot
of groups in the world carried out
similar numerical tests and in almost
all cases they found comparable results
that is quantum annealing finds the
ground state with higher probabilities
or closer States to the ground state
with higher probabilities an example of
which appears here and this is a big
system 1,002 cities in the Traveling
Salesman problem so those people from
Trieste ran quantum annealing by
sampling that is quantum Monte Carlo
simulations and this graph shows the
time dependence of the era which is
called the residual energy here and they
ran simulations classically and quantum
mechanically for finite time tau so
after a finite time tau you may not
expect the system has reached the ground
stage so there is an error which is
plotted as a vertical axis here so H of
tau is the actual value of the energy
that they have reached after a finite
time tau and E true is the true ground
state and the difference is called
residual energy so this should ID
ideally be 0 so the smaller the value
around this vertical axis is the better
the result is so if you run the
simulations longer that is along the
direction told the right the better the
result you expect and the data shows
that tendency but you see that the curve
for simulating any annealing has a
shallower slope
although the functional forms are very
similar
this 1.4 so qualitatively those two
methods quantum and classical may be
similar but quantitatively in the sense
of the slope quantum annealing is better
this is the result and they exist many
other pieces of evidence that quantum
annealing is better than simulated
annealing in this sense and of course
there are a limited number of exceptions
in which simulated annealing shows
better results than quantum annealing
which is one of which is written here
this is for the three satisfiability
problem run by the same group from
trieste so in this result the slope of
the simulated annealing data is steeper
than quantum annealing so quantum
annealing does not always be simulator
meaning but in most cases it does so
it's a bit puzzling but it's interesting
so the next question is is there any
theoretical background to support those
results from numerical experiments and
the answer is yes
it's the convergent theorem for
simulated annealing first which was
proven by those people in the early
1980s they prove the following statement
in simulated annealing the body with
temperature capital T as a function of
time T lowercase T should be controlled
this way constant program dependant
constant C times the system size n
divided by the log of time then in the
infinite time limit in the end you are
guaranteed to reach the ground state the
minimum energy state with probability 1
it takes an infinite amount of time but
it is guaranteed that you end up with a
correct answer and this is a very strong
result and at the same time a weak
result it is strong in the sense that it
applies to any problem in the world even
the most difficult problem can be
covered by this theorem so this is the
very strong generic result and it is
weak in the sense that it covers the
worst problem in the world so in
practice you don't have to control the
temperature in this very slow manner you
can decrease the temperature more
quickly linearly or even spiritually
fast and yet you may reach the ground
state with high probability
anyway this is the mathematically
rigorous theorem which is back backbone
to run simulations by simulator Danny so
we asked ourselves if we can establish
something similar to this result and we
could do it the variable gamma as a
function of T is a coefficient of the
quantum mechanical time you don't have
to worry about the details of the
expression but gamma should be compared
to should be compared to T so gamma is a
function of T is to be decreased as a
function of time like this T to the
minus constant problem dependent
constant divided by the system size n
such that the system reaches the ground
state with the probability one in the
evening time limit this is a theorem to
be compared with a gimmick gimmick
theorem for similar kneading so again
this is a very strong result and very
weak result simultaneously in the sense
that it applies to any problem it covers
all the problems in the world in the
universe and it covers since it covers
the worst problem in the world it is a
very slow decrease for a given specific
problem which may not be the worst
problem in the universe but these
theorems apply these theorems assure you
that you get the result correct result
in infinite time limit but you cannot
wait forever your life time is limited a
student has to write a thesis within
three years typically so you should stop
somewhere so what happens
if you stop at some finite time so
suppose that you stopped the process at
time T and the temperature for simulated
annealing capital T is very small
instead to be very small and in
statistical mechanics it is known that
for very small temperature the residual
energy which is the energy between the
true ground state and obtain state is of
the order of the temperature so Delta e
the measure of the error is Delta e
which is comparable to capital T which
is said to be a small value Delta and as
I said the temperature is in the worst
case controlled in this manner constant
times the system size divided by the log
of T and if you solve this problem this
equation for time T then you get the
final expression T is equal to the
exponential of constant times and
divided by Delta so the time to reach a
small body of error is exponentially
large this is very natural because you
are talking about the worst problem in
the world and computational complexity
is the expression in the system size so
in the sense there is no surprise and
what can be said about quantum annealing
to be compared with this result
according to quantum mechanics for small
value of gamma the quantum term the
error from the true ground state caused
by a small value of gamma starts from
the second order perturbation because
first order perturbation which is linear
in gamma vanishes so the error is
proportional to the gap
square which is said to be a small value
Delta and gamma is controlled as I said
before T to the minus C divided by n so
T to the minus 2 C prime over N is said
to be a small value Delta and you solve
this equation for T to obtain the final
expression which is T equal to e to the
N log Delta divided by 2 times C Prime
so again the computational complexity is
exponential so this is no surprise once
again because we are treating the worst
problem in the world so is there any
advantage to use quantum annealing both
are exponential it's the difference in
the coefficient if Delta is very small
then the coefficient in the classical
case is very large for instance if Delta
is 10 to the minus sixth then the
inverse is 10 to the sixth but log Delta
of 10 to the sixth is of the order of 10
which is much smaller so in this sense
quantum annealing is better theoretical
so this is a sort of backup for the
numerical result that I showed you
before
and there is an interesting aspect of
this result this is the convergence
condition token money gamma of T is
equal to T to the minus constant divided
by system size but what is T here it is
the real time appearing in this reading
equation naturally but at the same time
we could prove the same result for a
quantum Monte Carlo implementation of
quantum annealing stochastic processes
you map the quantum problem into a
classical program by introducing many
copies of the classical state so those
copies the differences between those
copies represent quantum fluctuations
intuitively and you so in this mapped
picture everything is classical because
quantum replications have been reduced
to the difference between layers or the
copies and you run the usual classical
Monte Carlo simulations by flipping
spins one by one classically so the time
appearing here is not the shredding at
time real time but it's Monte Carlo
steps and yet you find the same
functional dependence of gamma for
convergence conditions I don't know why
I know the mathematical structure but I
don't know why intuitively this is the
steerer mystery point so this is the
small detour anyway let me give you a
bit different aspect of quantum
annealing which is quantum adiabatic
computation the idea the essential ideas
are the same
but a formulation or the viewpoint is a
bit different so you start up with a
state with very strong quantum
fluctuations which is a state with only
the transverse field so initially the
spins originally spins point either up
or down but if you introduce quantum
mechanical fluctuations spins main point
to the X direction not yet but X
direction and since the field is very
strong initially all spins point to the
X direction this is the very trivial
state so you start from this very
trivial state and you let the system
evolve according to the Schrodinger
dynamics and in quantum adiabatic
computation you enforce the system to
stay within the instantaneous ground
state during the course of time
evolution and in the end if successful
you keep the system in the ground state
as well in the end and in the end you
only have the cost function the
classical cost function written here in
terms of izing spins the ground state of
which is a non trivial state so you
start from this very trivial state and
end up with this very non trivial state
so this is the picture of quantum
adiabatic computation but in practice
the gap between the ground state the
lowest energy state and the next lowest
energy state the first excited state may
be very small the Delta may be very
small in which case the timing
evaluation may not follow faithfully the
ground state but may be the system may
jump on to the excited state so you
should be very careful if there is a
small gap in the course of the
evaluation which is often the case let
me give you a small detour
it's a frequently asked question what is
the difference between quantum annealing
and quantum adiabatic computation well
the ideas are the same we use quantum
fluctuations to drive the system from
the trivial state to the non to
non-trivial final state but as the name
indicates in adiabatic computation you
insist on keeping the state in the
instantaneous ground state as faithfully
as possible but in quantum annealing you
may allow the system to hop to higher
state with some probability so you try
the process many times so graphically
according to my understanding quantum
annealing includes quantum adiabatic
computation as a special case but it's
broader so the process is realized in
the d-wave machine our quantum annealing
I understand so anyway what is the
complete computational complexity from
the viewpoint of quantum adiabatic
computation it's related to the gap
according to the adiabatic theorem of
quantum mechanics
according to which
the time tchau the total time towel
necessary for the system to stay
faithfully in the instantaneous current
state is proportional to the inverse
square of the minimum gap and if the gap
closes very rapidly e to the minus
constant times the system size then time
necessary to reach the true ground state
grows exponentially which means that the
problem is very hard it's virtually
impossible to solve it on the given
computer but if the gap closes
relatively slowly by a polynomial power
of the system size then the gap closes
then the time necessary to reach the
ground state grows only polynomial which
means that the problem is easy and in
the gap closing point often a phase
transition happens and for faster the
phase transitions in which physical
quantities jump from this value to this
value this behavior is called the first
of the phase transition then it is often
the case that the gap closes
exponentially because these states are
completely different physical quantities
jump so this state this phase is
completely different from that so this
difference should be diminished very
quickly which means that gap toast is
very quickly in contrast in second-order
phase transitions in which quantities
change continuously although the
derivative may jump then the gap closes
the gap is known to close polynomial so
the order of phase transition matters
and there is a typical example of a
faster the phase transition in which the
problem is trivial
or spins or arrows should point up this
is the correct solution so the solution
is trivial you start from this trivial
state and you are asked to reach this
trivial state and yet there is a
first-order phase transition this is
axis of gamma and this is axis of the
gap so for small sizes like this the gap
has a relatively mild minimum but as the
system size grows the behavior of the
gap becomes sharper and sharper and for
a very large size it almost jumps from
here to almost zero and another value
here so the gap jumps in the large size
limit and it is zero exactly at the
transition point of first order and the
right panel shows the behavior of the
gap as a function of the system size in
the semi log scale since it's been here
it shows an exponential decrease of the
gap for various values of P 3 5 and so
on and so forth so this is an easy
problem that cannot be solved by quantum
annealing so it was a challenge for us
is there any way to solve circumvent
this difficulty and the answer is yes we
introduced so here is another diagram
that shows that difficulty here is the
axis essentially of gamma which is
written vertically now you start from
this trivial state and one you want to
end up with this trivial true solution
but there is a first order phase
transition
but we found that if you introduce an
extra term of quantum fluctuations Sigma
X Sigma X at different sites I and J
then you have another coefficient for
this new term so the diagram extends to
a two dimensional space and you have
another degree of freedom and we analyze
the phase diagram the order of phase
transitions in this two-dimensional
space then we found that this first
order phase transition disappears at at
intermediate point and is replaced by a
line of second order phase transition so
if you follow this path by using another
quantum driver Hamiltonian you can avoid
the difficulty of first of the phase
transition and reach the ground state so
there are ways to avoid such
difficulties is this method specific to
this very special trivial problem I
don't know we are seeking an answer to
this question but the indication is
positive
and there is another piece of
interesting result that we obtained
recently which I don't go into which I
don't go I don't explain in detail but
just look at this picture this is
another different problem but all those
four pictures show the dependence of the
gap as a function of the system size for
various parameters appearing in the
problem so usually if the gap closes
exponentially fast which means a
difficult problem then you expect the
behavior of the gap this way an
exponential decrease but in this very
anomalous case the gap changes very
rapidly as you see or like this or like
this or like that if you follow the
number of sides so the system size one
by one following the natural series of
natural numbers but if you choose the
right sequence for instance if you
follow the envelope of this set of data
then the gap closes polynomially one way
n but if you follow the wrong sequence
the gap closes exponentially so there is
a room of choice of the sequence of the
system size so even this is an example
of post of the phase function so even if
you encounter difficulty you may be able
to choose the right sequence of the
system size to get good result in this
anomalous case I don't think this is a
generic feature of first of the phase
transitions but we should keep it in
mind that there is such an anomalous
case so let me skip the details of the
problem to save time and if you are
curious I can answer the question again
answer questions but let me summarize my
talk quantum annealing works and it
works better than similar knitting in
the sense that I described and even if
you encounter a difficulty or faster the
phase transitions there may be ways to
avoid those difficulties by choosing the
right quantum fluctuations or by
choosing the right sequence of the
system size thank you very much for your
attention so I was quite intrigued by
the bound you gave of quantum Monte
Carlo and quantum annealing even though
quantum Monte Carlo is classical can you
serve it moreover that the same function
of home appears yeah yes yes yes
you want me to explain it once again I
understand this statement but I find
that you know quite intriguing that is
yes amazingly and even though quantum
Monte Carlo sauce or classical algorithm
yeah so maybe you could give some idea
no honesty no okay so you're eccentric
as me yes well as firemen said I never
understand quantum mechanics I know how
to manipulate equations but I failed to
explain intuitively always in that sense
the performance the fact that quantum
annealing works itself is a mystery for
me and even quantitatively classical and
quantum implementations have the same
functional form it's it's a mystery I'm
sorry I don't know more precisely saying
the statement is as follows in the
Shredderman dynamics the body or gamma
should be controlled precisely this way
but in the quantum Monte Carlo
implementation the asymptotic form of
gamma looks like this or small body of T
it has a bit different functional form
but for large T it reduces to this
expression this is a precise statement I
didn't get any sense of what your proof
technique is for showing that the
quantum annealing converges because I
mean you didn't hint it your proof
technique and I would like to know also
whether your proof technique requires
that your Hamiltonian be stochastic
which means that all the off-diagonal
terms have the same sign so you can do
quantum Monte Carlo simulation shredding
a dynamic sees to use that adiabatic
theorem itself for quantum annealing
that's what you use is this
lady bearethere okay yes and for the
quantum Monte Carlo in Sebring
do you hear yes for the quantum Monte
Carlo implementation of quantum
annealing we map the program to the
kraskow we map the quantum annealing to
the classical representation by trata
start by introducing throttle slices and
we apply the method of gman argument to
that classical program okay so when you
do the quantum annealing
so you actually estimate the gap then
for what you seem to be lost but you
said it works all cases so that must
mean you have a lower bound on the gap
in all cases is that right yes you have
a lower bound on the gap yes yes
it's yeah and how do you get that little
bound we use the hop theorem which says
that any type of you are given a type of
matrix and the hop theorem gives the gap
between the largest in some sense I can
bar you on the next largest eigen value
