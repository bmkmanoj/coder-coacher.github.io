thanks for coming out I know
particularly with the crayon here that
you must be fairly busy so oh it's my
great pleasure to welcome back Merlin
man again i/o we had him out here for a
Tech Talk last summer on inbox zero
which was very well-received at the time
I compared Merlin with spider-man which
is I think a analogy that still works
spider-man is a superhero but deals with
the kind of day-to-day accidentals and
stuff like that and if anybody wants a
kind of concrete example of that
something to make you feel like maybe
I'm not quite such a complete disaster
in life then you can check out the
perfect ' I think it was which was one
of the one of the best written essays
I've read in a long time and a very
humble piece as well so without any
further ado I'm gonna welcome back
Merlin man and he's gonna be talking
about somebody moving his brain I think
hi can hear me okay is this on you hear
me all right
hi everybody yeah no you actually
yesterday and specifically I think you
mentioned that I cleaned my own
underwear which was in the in the talk
which is good way to be introduced you
come out and you're kind of humbled um
yeah it's really good feedback that was
back in July of last year and it was it
was a really it was a good talk was very
thought-provoking for me because uh
talking to you guys you challenged my
very obvious insights so I'm grateful
for that that's good to be here I'm
gonna talk about your brain and I'm
going to talk about your life but I want
to start by talking about Mike Montero
which is a friend of mine Mike is a guy
who lives in San Francisco and he's the
co-owner and the creative director at
mule design which you may know not just
from their excellent design work but
also from making these t-shirts that you
might have seen you might have seen this
one in the New York Times recently worn
by none other than Oliver Sacks and it
makes a very creative guy went to art
school he likes making stuff he is like
most of us today a knowledge worker
which is a fancy way of saying he has
value to information but um mewls a very
very small kind of boutique a design
firm and one of the values that Mike and
his
really enjoy is that it's you know a
small easy go along get a long workplace
but Mike started to feel a few weeks ago
like his life was sort of disappearing
into a series of endless meetings where
every time he turned around the meetings
being called the meetings being moved
not these kind of like you know a little
30-second check-ins that you enjoy on a
team that kind of keeps the ball in
motion but this kind of like last minute
things where everybody gets called in a
room and there's no agenda and then
suddenly it's two hours later and your
head hurts those kind of meetings I
don't have you guys get those here but
Mike Mike was really kind of reaching
the end of his rope with this because it
wasn't the kind of place that he wanted
to work and it was his own damn company
so it was vexing to him if you guys
follow Mike on the on the Flickr
his name is dork master on Flickr he's
he's a world-class smartass and anytime
you see Mike becoming a smartass about
something you tend his first see it on
Flickr which is where I first saw his
idea for what he was calling meeting
tokens and meeting tokens is his design
for something that he wants to have
manufactured to use within his team and
the idea is that he wants to create
these little kind of poker chips that
represent 15 person minutes of time
inside the company okay so if you the
idea is end to the beginning every week
you get a little bag full of time to use
however you want right if you want to
have a little kind of you know 15
minutes check in with somebody gonna
cost you one token you would have a
half-hour meeting with two people for
tokens if you want to have one of those
old-school 1998 sit around the table
call everybody in and hang out and talk
you can't do it there's not enough
tokens he's deliberately not putting up
bags
tokens into your bag that you can do
that by design the idea is though that
he sees realized he introduces even the
smallest bit of scarcity into this
otherwise completely open resource it
gets people thinking a little bit more
carefully about how they use it now is
this a terrible idea is this may be the
worst idea of all time would people
eventually start hitting Mike over the
head with his own bag of time almost
certainly it's a very constraining
ridiculous thing but you know Mike's a
colorful guy but something about this
idea and seeing this as yet it's still a
prototype he hasn't actually made me
yet should tell you something but seeing
that idea really kind of set something
loose in my own head because I realized
a thread that was running through a lot
of the stuff that was catching my
attention in terms of how how knowledge
workers are struggling and if you follow
any of the stuff that I deal with 43
folders com you'll see I talk a lot
about things like procrastination and
dealing with a large volume of email and
things like meetings and I saw in this
one little ridiculous gesture something
that had really been congealing and
that's the fact that I had become way
too much of a bargain getting my time
and my attention had become much too
easy and it wasn't something that I
could just blame on others because I
realized that a lot of the problem was
how much I was making myself accessible
to other people and in this instance
what Mike was doing was saying you know
what I don't want this to be free
anymore I don't want it to be that easy
to take my time in my attention away
because I think what you discover is if
you live in a world where your time and
your attention have no value or very
little value you're going to see a lot
of waste and abuse and you see waste
because if you don't internally have a
really good barometric idea of what your
time is worth you're going to fritter it
away on really stupid stuff you're gonna
you're going to you're going to find
yourself doing things that are not
getting you to the places that you
really want to be but also maybe more
importantly you guys seem very organized
and together so that's probably not your
problem but a lot of us suffer from the
abuse part of this which is allowing so
much access to ourselves that it becomes
really easy to take us in a million
different directions and so it's my
feeling that in order to become a good
person and a useful knowledge worker we
need to give it a better sense of where
our time and attention go and make sure
it's going towards the things that are
really valuable to us because if you
don't you're going to end up going into
a world of pain you do not want to enter
a world of pain because entering world
of pain as a knowledge worker means that
all of the things that you want to get
accomplished are going to be furthered
away you're going to find yourself like
me say last night just hypothetically
watching Amadeus for the 15th time and
reading a sally Aires Wikipedia entry
for half an hour and and I used that
phrase find yourself because I think
that's the feeling of it it's not a
feeling of oh you know I meant to now go
and like download a whole bunch of stuff
off BitTorrent so I can listen to the
Requiem three different ways you find
yourself there you
kind of like how awake with a start and
go how did I end up here what happened
we're at what rabbit trail did I run
down that brought me to this place
I think everybody's suffering from this
everybody I talked to you I mean of
course you guys like I say you guys are
you know extremely successful you have a
monorail in your parking lot which is
new is that new in the monorail this
fruit in my old fashioned was a little
bit dry in my drink but the Shot zum
asajj was really nice so you guys
probably don't have this problem but a
lot of people do have this problem and
those people are knowledge workers who
are not getting the time and attention
trained where it needs to be and I think
that you find when you start spending
some time with this stuff that time and
attention end up being some of the most
precious resources that you have as a
knowledge worker knowledge worker is a
knowledge work as a term that Peter
Drucker and it's horribly pixelated
picture first started using in the 1960s
to talk about kind of emerging creative
class of people who weren't you know at
that time it was unusual to not be a
person who was you know making nuts and
bolts for a living or what have you
he's talking about people who are
essentially adding value to information
you can be part of a team but you're
doing something whether that's drawing
developing you know working on Android
whatever you're doing something that's
taking all of this education and
judgment that you've got in your mind
and then applying it to something and
well the quickest way that I found to
identify a knowledge worker I was
telling dick about this earlier if you
look for people with really girly smooth
hands you'll get to go to lunch whenever
they want that's usually a knowledge
worker and I think I think that if we
don't take care to keep this stuff
together and realize what a precious
resource it is we wake up one day and
find that our time and attention is gone
I refuse remember that feeling though a
lot of your a lot younger than me but is
it feeling when you're in college and
everybody at some point is really really
poor in college you know and there's
that sense of like I could do laundry or
I could eat or get a beverage but you're
having to make these really like
completely economic decisions that God
willing you're not having to make quite
as acutely today but do you remember
that sense of for example like you know
that sense that having the laundry
versus food decision and having such a
sense of what like a hundred dollars
meant how a hundred dollars could change
your life and how
not having that hundred dollars meant a
really substantial drop in your quality
of life you know people say time is
money but the fact is time is a lot more
precious than money because you can
always get more money right but you
can't really make any more time and you
can't make any more attention I think we
all get this to an extent but if you
think about the kind of work most of us
are doing today it's what I've started
to call a black box career which is just
this idea that there's there's kind of
there's stuff out there in the world
that's introduced into your world stuff
that sort of unimproved data that has to
have something done to it
that stuff all gets squeezed into this
kind of notional black box and inside
the black box all of your intelligence
and all of your insight and all of your
creativity is applied to solving a
certain kind of problem and then out the
other end comes perfect results on-time
and on-budget and as long as everything
inside the box goes exquisitely nobody's
ever gonna have a problem with you
because ultimately nobody cares what
happens inside the black box right all
they want to do is eat the hot dog they
don't care how it got made I think
everybody experiences on this on some
level right now
but I think what's making this super
complicated today is the very few of us
are working on a single job for a single
person like you know you're not to raise
your hand but think you're are you there
anybody in this room now that has
exactly one job and reports to exactly
one person like no that's like something
from the 30s
you know everybody I know you know has
these kind of dotted lines running all
over the campus wherever they work and
all these different people and all these
different people who have differing
expectations of them and they're the one
inside of that black box that has to
manage all of those relationships at the
same time so if one person that you are
committed to suddenly decides to
escalate the importance of a project
whose job is it to go communicate that
to all the other people that you have to
deal with well it's you unless you've
got an information information nanny
which is that something Google's do they
give you nannies decided not yet no no
but they'll come in on the monorail when
they do put that on the list I heard
they got them in Switzerland I don't
know if that's true but nice campus I
think until you get a get a sense a
really concrete sense of how valuable
your time and attention is you can't
really utilize it in them in a most
useful of ways I still talked about this
sense of hundred dollars if you're
walking down the hallway and
somebody came up to you said give me a
hundred bucks you know you'd have
questions he would say well why
precisely do I need to give you a
hundred dollars in the under book okay
say no forget it I lost a bet to you or
something why am I going to give you a
hundred bucks but at the same time would
you have that same pressing need to
understand the situation as if they ask
you to come have a meeting with them
would you have that same sense of what I
like what Monty Hall calls opportunity
cost or the sense that when I go and do
this one thing there's now other things
that I can't do as a result of that and
I feel like for myself until I got to a
place where I understood what that kind
of exclusion meant I wasn't really
firing on all cylinders
this is a an example that I've used time
and again because I think it's it's
terrific it's it's I first saw Joel
Spolsky who's a developer that does the
Joel on software site had used this a
few years ago to talk about software
development and just says if you're
thinking about the kind of features that
you want to put into what you're
building you know you could think about
this kind of fixed asset of how much
time you have to build this stuff as a
box and I'm saying think about a week of
your life or a day of your life or a
month of your life as a box right we can
all agree that it has a fixed you know
number of kind of cubic inches to it you
can't have a you know 700 hour week and
not in this Euclidean world we live in
ultimately we have to be the people who
are deciding what kind of blocks are
going to go in the box and it's
critically important that as much as
possible you try to make sure whatever
goes in the box is going to be something
that pays dividends in the in the long
run for you and to really I think the
thrust of what I want to talk about
today is trying to make sure that the
blocks that never go into your box are
really stupid that way you never have to
take them out how do you make sure they
never got there in the first place and I
think one of the things to do is to
really start owning this stuff and to
start understanding that even the stuff
that you just tacitly accept as now
being your responsibility need to be
something that you're very heavily
engaged with and if not you're going to
that's what to me that's what leads to
procrastination and that's what leads to
feelings of being overwhelmed is if you
have this entire horizon of stuff that
you have care about that's where your
world starts getting stupid and so
getting a lot more careful about what
you even just agree to fall into your
life it's critically important
so I you know I understand this is all
stuff that you guys know right and I
understand this is stuff that you get
and you probably also get that you need
to save for retirement and you also get
that you need to call your mom and you
get you need to go change the tires on
your car Merlin and you know all these
things but the trick in the kind of life
hack way of approaching this is how do I
make a synaptic leap so that all this
stuff that I know I need to be doing is
actually reflected in the actions in my
life and in my experience there's a big
gulf between those two things and then
ultimately to make the kinds of changes
even kind of modest changes about how
you approach your work to get those
dividends you need me to make slight
adjustments to your approach that go
that take that from being a good idea
into being something that becomes just a
natural way you treat your work when I
was in high school in the late 40s I was
taught something called defensive
driving which I guess they're probably
still teaching the day but a driver's ed
yet to have this idea of defensive
driving which is the somewhat
revolutionary idea that when I Drive my
car yes I should drive I should conduct
myself in such a way that I minimize the
harm that I do to myself and others
but ultimately that I should avoid
making decisions that rely too heavily
on guessing what other people are going
to do or more importantly I must stop
assuming that other people are always
going to do the right thing and that
really the best thing that I can do I
know this sounds a little bit on Rand
which I apologize for but like if you're
going to be out there on the road how do
you drive in such a way that we all kind
of are taking care of our own little
half-acre
before we figure out how to make
everybody else drive better would why'd
you start improving my performance on
the road now the fact is you can never
get every drunk driver off the road that
is there's nothing I can do stand up
here today and tell you that this is
going to make problems go go away but to
me that's even more reason to get better
about this stuff because if there are
going to be people out there and you
know apparently I'm told there are
occasionally toxic people and bad
managers and things happen and you've
got to react to that in a way that's
very agile and I think having a set of
skills in your mind about how you're
going to cope with that stuff without
relying on them to do the right thing is
going to help you keep your sanity and
help you keep focused on the stuff
that's really valuable to you
so I want to talk about this in two
tracks by the way today I deliberately
going to keep this pretty short because
I really like to have lots of time for
questions but I wanted for the rest of
the time hammering away up here I want
to talk on two tracks on a personal
level we're honest a person level I want
to talk about renegotiation and then on
a slightly broader level I want to talk
a little bit about team culture and team
culture I mean the whole idea of team
culture is something I have really been
thinking about since I visited here in
July because so many the questions that
people ask when I was here went straight
to this idea of all this stuff is really
well and good but what happens when we
start mixing people with different
styles and different preferences what
what kind of stuff can we do to make
that work better but let's start let's
start with our own half-acre and I think
just with all deference to Dave and Alan
the guy who read getting things done
renegotiation is one of my favorite
pieces of getting things done as a
terrific book it's not really a time
management book it's kind of a way to
start thinking about your work a little
bit differently a little bit more in an
action-oriented way he talks about
renegotiation is one of the three
options that you face when you're
overwhelmed with too much stuff you can
either do stuff you can cancel it or you
can renegotiate it and I've come to
think that renegotiation is maybe the
ultimate ninja skill because it's your
ability to go in and say you know what
this is kind of what I want to be doing
but if I turn this just 45 degrees this
turns into a project I really want to be
working on because by doing fairly
modest things to renegotiate your
relationship to the projects that you're
working on it can have vast positive
changes in the way that you approach it
but again I this is a little Randian and
I do apologize but I really believe that
with the great power and autonomy of the
having this first world career comes the
responsibility of also owning the stuff
that comes along with that and that's
where we negotiation becomes critical
it's my feeling that you can tell so
much about a person ultimately maybe
this would be a good way for you to
learn a little about you think about who
in your life could have access to you
right now who's allowed to have your
time right now how long do they get your
time and with what kind of sort of
pre-existing notice do they need to let
you know that they need your time
I think we would all sit here and go oh
well you know my my boss you know sure
boss cos she can jump in at any time and
grab me we're like you know my dad my
dad's sick he can call me any time and
I'll jump in I think most people feel
like they've got this pretty lockdown
right you go you know I'm really smart I
got spamassassin and like the portcullis
is down man I am NOT but then you see
things like this and if you're a male
bot app user like me I don't know how
many times yeah you can see up here that
there you see this ding and that means
mail just came in so better go check the
mail I don't know a Kiki I keep tough
from looking at that who that males from
I'm not really sure I can't tell either
because it's just a ding right if you
have your male open and it's making a
ding noise at you unless you're some
kind of squirrely you know one of these
pearl guys you need to get growl running
and you got notifications popping up all
over the place
by and large anybody who emails most of
the people in this room get their
attention the second that email comes in
so you're going to stop whatever it is
that you're working on in most cases and
jump over to email and go see what that
was about so this is a pattern in my
mind this is a pattern this is not just
about email and this is just not just
about ding it's not really based on
where your attention goes throughout the
week where these leaks are that it's
getting away and so yes this is one
specific instance I think I think
actually going in and telling your email
program that you would like it to notify
you about email a little bit less is
probably a really healthy pattern but I
think the larger pattern to this is to
start thinking seriously about who gets
that access and again toward that team
idea you know how much inside of a team
do we want to agree that we're a hundred
percent available to each other all the
time including weekends like one of the
times when I'm not available when or
times that I can depend on having a
firewall time when I let stuff stack up
for a little while and I just focus on
the thing that's really important to me
this is not to say that communicating
with your colleagues is not important
but it but it is a way of saying that
it's a good idea for you to be the one
who decides when that access is handed
out to other people think about giving
your business card to somebody in like
the 50s like you would give somebody
this business card they would have your
phone number on it and you know they
call you during the business day the
information you
on your card now in some cases gives
them extraordinary you're strangers now
have this extraordinary access to you
anytime right and if you're super wired
you know you're going to get an SMS
message if this kind of a notification
happens and we're basically just opening
ourselves at the BlackBerry fantastic
tool but think about the ways in which
that gives the entire world access to
you anytime and then think about what
you get in return out of that and this
never happened to you your your your
shooting down the hallway Henderson runs
up and has a quick question to ask you
and you say okay well I'm kind of busy
right now
Henderson is like oh no no it's only be
like 30 seconds you're like I can't do
this right now I'm totally busy let's
let's let's go make an appointment and
so you hop over to iCal or you hop over
to Google Calendar and you go and you
create a new meeting for your 30 second
question yeah I aim by here don't raise
your hands but just find me afterward if
you work on Google Calendar what happens
would you would you want to go create a
30 second appointment in anyway and the
next an hour-long appointment it doesn't
a Google Calendar - if you click it
makes an hour-long appointment so
basically your calendar is telling that
you can do about 6 things a day that
might that works for a lot of people the
larger patterns start thinking about the
defaults in your life start thinking
about some of the stuff that is handed
to you in a certain way think about this
I mean so you guys what ever you guys
went to like good state schools and
you've had a good breakfast so you have
the sense to change that to being a 30
second long appointment or whatever but
think about what happens to a world in
which every email program creates a
one-hour appointment for a new thing we
all start thinking that a meeting needs
to be an hour long I really think it's
valuable to look at defaults you guys
probably know this you guys are sitting
there right in your own badge profiles
and stuff like that the first thing you
do is open up the preferences but I'm
just saying think about some of the
defaults in your life and look at some
of the ways that you can renegotiate
your commitment to these kinds of things
in a way that ends up supporting the
sort of patterns that are valuable to
you my life changed when I started
qualifying yes which is my way of saying
I stopped automatically just saying yes
every time somebody asks for it there's
a time in the mid-90s when I was one of
the few people outside the supercomputer
center that knew how to make webpages in
northern Florida well a lot more people
know now but back then he knows a lot of
prestige you know so
is constantly us forever saying yes yes
of course I'll make your band website or
of course I'll make your you know
whatever kittens for the seminoles
website or whatever and I really ended
up regretting it because I was always
getting way way way over committed
because I wasn't saying maybe or kind of
or sort of I was always just taking
whatever they gave me and putting it the
way that they wanted it I think it's
really another hugely useful move is to
learn how to reshape projects if you are
having the black box career in other
words if yours if you're the person who
lives inside that black box and it's
having to negotiate relationships with
multiple people that really in the
aggregate could take up 120 percent of
your time you're going to have to make
these kinds of renegotiating decisions
it's not a question of whether you're
going to it's a question of when you
start doing it and when you start
getting better at it and if you're like
a lot of folks let's be honest a lot of
folk and folks in tech aren't here
because you know they enjoy
confrontation it's hard it's hard to do
this it's hard to get these
conversations started but I think it's
really valuable to say things like yeah
you know that's really a fantastic idea
I don't have the cycles for that right
now can we revisit this in six weeks or
what could you do with ten hours of my
time over the next month if I were to
work on this just finding ways to kind
of reshape this stuff bottom line is I
think it's important to just own your
stuff and I think I think there's a it's
easy to start feeling like a victim
after a while and you're so overwhelmed
by stuff that you feel like you're just
kind of like treading water in quicksand
I think just really getting in front of
it and saying that you know I'm going to
I'm going to make some slightly
different decisions about this that make
it into something that I'm really
excited about instead of something that
I dread um this is the one I got to tell
you I'm really happy to talk to you guys
about I'm going to talk about some very
general patterns that I hope afterward
we can spin out into some more specific
stuff but I want start talking about
culture I am have been for like four
years now I've been very interested in
this idea of personal productivity and
what it means to people and I am
satisfied that there are fairly modest
changes that people can make stuff you
could do to go back to your desk today
where you'd start handling your work in
a way that made you feel better and was
a little more responsible that stuff's
not actually all that hard because
you're the only person who has to
agree that it's a good idea right if you
decide you know what I'm gonna shut off
email or I'm going to turn off the IRC
for a little while or for that matter
I'm going to go and just plow through
all this email that's been making me
feel really crummy and I'm going to be
done with it
that's stuff that's not very nuanced
because it's just you the challenge that
I'm seeing now is trying to figure out
how these different people with these
different personalities different
schedules different priorities how do we
start working with people in a way
that's saying and I think sometimes
people do this in this kind of backwards
way where they think we should start at
the top and make a lot of policies and
make a lot of rules and declare things
like no email Fridays you know which for
most people turns into tons of email
Saturdays you know but what do you know
what kind of stuff can we do to really
start at the most kind of atomic level
of like the people on your little team
you know and I got to tell you I'm
sometimes surprised at to learn that
people aren't having more conversations
where's just slightly meta conversations
about how they could be using the tools
a little bit differently or about what
their preferences are for communication
I want to hear you I'll just split that
seed for you guys to start thinking
about that because I really want to hear
how you handle this stuff but I want to
talk in some very general hand-wavy ways
about stuff that I think can be really
useful I think above everything else
it's kind of like you know the
Hippocratic oath first do no harm I
think it's it's it's a good idea to just
get the conversation started and
sometimes that means trying to tackle a
problem that would have kind of outsized
results based on fairly small changes
and you know that could be stuff as
simple as you know what we agree as a
team that we're not going to put
time-sensitive information into team
emails anymore because that's not how we
want to use email we agree for examining
this what you need to do in just giving
examples we agree from now on if you
really need something like this
afternoon or this morning like either
come to my cube or let's do it over I am
but have have the conversation when
somebody new joins your team right have
the conversation take them to one of
these sexy little microbe kitchens and
have a little talk what how is it that
our team does this because the best
thing that you can give to people when
they come here and especially new folks
is to share the culture of how your team
works
that's incredibly that not making them
guess at that or wack of the pinata is
going to save you tons of cycles later
on and they might have new things to
share with you that would be useful as
well but start small like don't start
with like you know why does Jodie smell
like enchiladas don't do anything like
emotional start with something really
simple and then you can once you have
that conversation going it's going to be
easier to get into stuff that's a little
more profound you guys are probably way
ahead of the curve on this but I think
working out internal I don't want to
call them rules and I'm even reluctant
to call them standards but every team
every really good team that I see has
worked out kind of sawed off the edges
sanded off the edges in how they like to
operate right like if you're on a team
like what's a typical team size if you
have on a team of like ten people here
and like everybody is like bottom
quoting like old-school unix-style
except one person one person still
insists on top quoting like you're going
to go have a blanket party on that guy
you're just going to go beat the crap
out of them because it's screwing
everything up simple stuff like that I
mean one that I think is huge personally
and I will actually say I think this is
a good idea how you use subject lines if
you're not using subject lines well in
your emails I bet most of you probably
are because you seem like a pretty smart
bunch but if you're not then you're
wasting a lot of time you're wasting a
lot of everybody's time what if a team
where to go as a little micro kitchen
and hang out for 20 minutes and talk
about just how we use subject lines are
the things that we can do to just start
using like a om for super short messages
are the things do we need to have some
kind of a code at the beginning do we
want to let people know if something is
not time-sensitive maybe you're already
doing this but to find the patterns
where there are things like this that
could help everybody shave hours off
their day I think that's going to be a
good change when I spoke here in July
one thing that people are just always
mentioning to me now like a bunch of
people saw that inbox zero video and I
can't tell you how many people were like
I feel bad because you guys run you know
the internet but they're like man 600
emails a day and they're just sending
stuff to listen like ah they're like so
my sense is that there must be people
who are still suffering a little bit
with how all this stuff is going to work
you know and I just feel like starting
that this kind of squad level is a great
place to start
everybody's got an opinion on the email
stuff but I think getting some of that
ire
now can make life a lot easier I talked
with um dick about something at lunch
that I think is a really neat idea I
think it's interesting I personally just
this is just all anecdotal I have no
data on this but my anecdotal impression
is that people get hung up about people
using tools differently or in their own
words using tools incorrectly like
nothing will drive an old school email
person out of their tree like somebody
using email wrong you know doing the
super long quote or we're still doing
the like you know pristine length email
where all the actionable items are in
the penultimate paragraph and you've got
to like fish through that like have you
got have you gotten these emails the
like somewhere in here is a request for
my time but I'm not sure where like
start thinking about putting that stuff
in two different places and I know I
tend to seem kind of email centric I
know for a lot of people SMS and I am is
where is where it is now but I'll say to
dick at lunch I've been thinking a lot
about how a company like yours could use
a Twitter like functionality right like
what would happen if you started trying
to stream institutional knowledge and
questions through this kind of river of
information that was all captured and
then searchable so like instead of like
so what happens now somebody has a
question about something related to your
team or your bu or whatever that gets
shot to this list of like hundreds and
hundreds of people right even if the
even if each person is taking only three
seconds to read that email you still got
to process it and deal with it but I
don't think you guys use Twitter but
Twitter can become I guess like IR so
you can kind of become this background
application that just kind of runs and I
can't tell you how often in the last few
weeks now I've seen people we call lazy
Twitter like lazy web where people will
ask something and like all these people
will come back with examples or you know
answers to that question I'm just
tossing this out I think it's
interesting within your team or within
your your larger group start talking
about where information belongs rather
than where it has historically lived you
know there's always the wiki guy like
every teens got the wiki guy this guy
thinks the answer to every question wiki
started a new wiki and then everybody
else is like I go to wiki and I got
added to wiki and I just want to know
like how do I
for this day off you know go to the wiki
you know and maybe that works wiki's are
working great for people but you know to
paraphrase that old quote about regular
expressions you know if you try and
solve a communication problem with the
CMS now you've got two problems so be
careful what kind of things we ask for
I'm really intrigued by the idea of what
I've been calling radio silence which is
this idea I think it's kind of like the
anti no email Friday if it isn't clear I
think that's kind of a bad idea like
telling people what days are allowed to
use tools but I'm very interested in the
idea of saying inside of teams what does
it look like if we say for this certain
three or four hour period on this day of
the week it's not that you can't send me
email it's just that you can't you
should not expect me to respond to it
then I'm going to shut everything off
I'm just going to work closely with
people on a project that means a lot to
me you know you guys got the whole like
notional phony-baloney 20% time deal but
I'm talking about something maybe even
more profound than that which is like
within our team we're just we're just
going to let the world know like you
know we're not out having a picnic or
anything we're making this thing I just
think inside of a company culture across
the company what would it look like if
we had a morning each week when we were
not scanning the horizon and we were
just focusing on the stuff that was
super valuable to the team these are all
just ideas I'm tossing out like I said I
look at these as patterns
there's semi specific but I think
they're things that I again I want to
hear what you guys have to say about
this the toughest part of all this is
figuring out how to spread it if you do
come up with really good ideas there's a
terrible photo but I've been waiting to
use this album cover for years you know
is there's all these kinds of things you
guys probably do this way you probably
like rent a cruise ship and hang out and
have a Vision Quest to talk about your
process but I think the idea of like how
you share this kind of institutional
information is critically important
like I'm not a developer I'm not like
you know the mythical man-month guy but
like I know enough to know that culture
has a lot to do with whether you float
or sink and the ability to pass that
culture on to people inside of the
company is the greatest gift that you
can give to yourself and your team and
the company so start what are some of
the ways these are really questions as
much as anything what are some of the
ways that we can start
letting people know what are the best
practices that have worked for us that
might work for you and I don't know I'm
not sure the answer is always a wiki I
think sometimes in the same way that the
parts of South by Southwest that I
enjoyed all happened in a hallway I
think that probably the kind of
spreading of culture is going to happen
in micro kitchens and hallways and while
you're getting a massage it's a joke
the gotta go because you're so touchy
the reintegration engage renegotiation
and culture that I think are they are
the two tracks to be looking at right
now finding a way to kind of reshape the
stuff that's coming at you and I'm not
saying you got to sit around and be like
you know Johnny push back but when stuff
comes your way figuring out just will
the tiniest little turn on this project
turn this into something that I can get
really get behind and be very excited
about and then in terms of cult culture
really just beginning the conversation
inside of our team but what we can do to
make it better and so by my estimation
I'm just a little bit below owing each
of you three tokens right now so I'm
going to stop short this is not the end
of the presentation this is just the end
of me talking directly to you you can
plot politely if you like finally I
should mention that when Mike put
together he's putting together this set
of tokens every bag of tokens that you
get comes with one read Merlin which
means at any point during the meeting
you can throw that down and the meeting
is immediately over we're done here
