here at at Google I've actually was a
graduate Carnegie Mellon so there anyone
from Carnegie Mellon yes yes hi so
there's more than there's more than one
of us here I saw several CMU people so
I'm really happy for that I'm the tech
lead on the GData API steam so we build
the a lot of the api's first for Google
products google has a lot of services we
have a lot of data and we have a lot of
problems of one of our problems making
data universally accessible so one of
the missions of the GData API team is to
make it universally accessible and also
easily accessible so my co-presenter
here is Jeff so Jeff works and
University Relations you want to say hi
well actually I work in developer
relations apparently one of the things
we relate with this developers still
earning their degree so so he actually
helps a lot of people use the products
that my team helps helps build and so
how many people are familiar with the
Google Data API s already how many
people actually use them so how many
people know that very well Pamela's
she's also in developer relations so of
course she's used them how many people
have also have used like RSS atom feeds
you guys familiar with RSS and atom for
receiving data ok let's go something
simpler xml how many people you've used
xml or no xml yeah okay now we're
getting some some some ground swell and
an HTTP how many people know HUD thing
right so so it's good so there's a
technology base on which we're going to
build and everybody knows that one so
this is a informal presentation if you
guys want to ask questions feel free
jump in raise hands yes
so you want to know like a concept of
well Google Data API is you've got a
microphone Google Data API is actually
if you go to the next slide I'll just
say a little in fact I think I start oh
I go to the next slide oh cool this is
my first time with a clicker so one of
the things that we're talking about here
is google has data so we have calendar
data we have spreadsheet data we have
bloggers we have wit but I'm what I'm
talking about the data is not just the
web stuff that we have I'm talking more
about there are personal data sets that
everybody maintains at Google this is
sort of there are many little tiny sets
of data that people have if you've used
Google applications which is one of the
primary deployment areas right now for
Google Data API s you keep a lot of your
data at Google if you're an
administrator of a domain you have data
on all the you have a lot of data you
need to manage at Google of who are all
your users you have a lot of blog posts
you're creating you have a lot of
calendar events that you're managing you
have the set of calendars that you're
subscribed to that you're managing and
so you have a lot of data and you want
about Google one of the things that
cools trying to do in making data
accessible is not just creating these
really cool web apps so wet applications
are all about your personal data and
sharing it and making it available but
that's you eyes are great for humans but
they're really bad for programmers so
one of the things that we want to solve
is that you're sharing your data sets a
lot of little data sets you're sharing
them on the web so we talked about some
of the properties here does that give
you an idea the type of thing we're
talking about so one of the things we
talked about here was I was just sort of
trying to outline a little bit of the
problem case that Google Data API s
which are actually built on a protocol
called atom publishing protocol which
I'll use a lot and one of the things
that some of the properties were trying
to encourage so I say here structured
data so obviously of course you know no
you know you could basically just dump
blobs of text on the web you could do
CSV files there's all sorts of simple
ways to structure data so that computers
can consume it discoverable I mean how
do you find this data on the web how do
you access it cacheable this is one of
the things that Google deals with a lot
is scale so you know you know if a
million people are accessing your data
being able to cash it as
extremely important or being able to
take advantage of ways of performance or
important and then of course just
standard based protocols one of the
things that we're all so that's this is
about universal accessibility if we
build our API is I'm very common well
accepted standards that people could
then anybody can access this data
anybody can build programs to interact
with it so another part of data like all
these datasets that i'm talking about
these application data sets you want to
be able to edit the data on the web so
if you say for your calendar you want to
be able to modify your calendar and
actually synchronize with your calendar
applications you want to be able to
modify your photos you want to be able
to change upload videos and search
videos and do all these other types of
things that you're going to want to that
create blogger posts all sorts of things
and finally then one of the things that
one of the other goals that we have is
that we're trying to really make our AP
is extremely user-friendly google is
about trying to make stuff universally
accessible which means not just the
programmers who spent like who have a
company that will pay them a year to
read every specification on some
particular access technology but they
can pick it up overnight it's very
familiar simple technologies that they
can learn quickly so I just sort of
looked at a little bit of suggestion
here some of the type of technologies
you know just sort of give this a little
bit of a of a context some of the
technologies were looking at and how the
Google Data API sort of fit into this so
HTML think about HTML is a way to share
data I mean you probably all think of
HTML as a presentation protocol and for
papers but think of it as a way to share
data you can put tables up anybody in
the world can get them they're extremely
discoverable their search engines
they're simple everybody can they're
extremely usable I can you know Mike
could probably teach my mother to write
HTML tables it's not that hard there's
really no tooling required so we really
win on user friendliness we went on
standards-based but it has absolutely
almost no structure it has up it has no
edible and edit ability at least not
instant
there are some things with wiki's but
again they're completely non-standard
edibility edit ability but if you want
to just share your data HTML is actually
quite good you might you never may never
thought of it as a data sharing protocol
but it's actually pretty good so if you
think of other ways of doing things on
the web another another extreme sort of
of another end of it would be sort of
like soap soap is the standards-based
xml model of doing RPC so now you've
immediately got this idea you can
exchange arbitrarily complex structured
data it does any arbitrary RPC it has
sort of a discoverability issue so if
you've got a data set that you want to
make available to other people you
publish your what is the definition
language for soap i can't remember
though with wisdom yeah you publish your
wisdom and so anybody can read that
wisdom construct an interface and start
accessing that data they can do any
operations they can certainly do crud
basic crud operations on your data but
they can do any other arbitrary
transformations and but however it's
it's basically just arbitrary RPC
there's a certain the user friendliness
level of it sort of goes down there's
been a lot of problems with
interoperability among soap
implementations so and you've definitely
are dependent on the tool chain that
builds your soap so your weekend
programmer isn't going to necessarily
pick this up it's not going to be
something that I will pick up in an
afternoon and as I say it's
standards-based is this someone said I
put two stars there because as someone
said the nice thing about standards is
there are so many soap is I think known
for having large numbers of standards so
in the last five years there's been a
trend towards a style of architecture
that they call rest and how many of
anybody here heard of the rest
architectures so rest is a whole
philosophy of building api's so it's a
little bit difficult to summarize real
quickly but essentially the idea is you
think of your api's as resources and
that's what the RN rest is resource
representational state transfer and the
representation is of a resource excuse
me so represent
ours representation and if Adam rest
model is basically based on sort of like
the ATT ap excuse me rest modeled is
like the HTML model but for data so the
idea is HTML objects pages are resources
that you fetch in view rest objects are
resources that you fetch and manipulate
and they're all addressed by H team
they're all addressed by URLs every
resource has a URL every resource is a
document containing a certain amount of
information in it and the protocol for
manipulating your resources is the same
protocol that the web uses its HTTP it's
crud it's you know you've got your gut
you've got your get you've got your post
put you've got delete you've got your
basic crud operations on these data
objects and that's really how rest is
very simple and what you get from this
is rest the doc the format of a rest
document can be anything we typically
use XML so already it's going to be
structured it's relatively simple as
simple as XML can be for the average
user it certainly has the model of
discoverability all your resources exist
is URLs and you can / you can actually
include in your resources links to other
resources so that you have the ability
to be discoverable because you're built
on the HTTP infrastructure the protocol
infrastructure you get this great
benefit of cash ability so if two people
fetch the same resource there's a proxy
suddenly this resource is cacheable you
have cache coherency protocols that HTTP
has worked out such as using what if
you're familiar with entity tags which
is a way of tagging a resource with a
with a strong version so that you can
validate that the resource hasn't
changed without actually transferring it
twice so these are the types of things
that that rest architectures give you
and again it's so simple no tools
required adam pub is an implementation
or sort of an embodiment of this rest
philosophy and what they've done is
they've taken well actually i'll go into
a little bit more detail at a pub a
little later so i'll just sort of show
you but the idea is it is a rest based
protocol but is it as an implementation
of a rest philosophy
so everybody sort of get that because
that's kind of a core philosophy behind
the whole adam pub way of doing things
so when you want to look at what is the
google data AP is the Google Data API is
are at their core we are atom publishing
protocol which is what Adam pup is an
atom publishing protocol is a rest
product breast style protocol that sort
of defines two things one is a wire
format for transferring data and that
wire format is based on atom syndication
format so i mentioned i asked to people
know RSS and atom essentially RSS and
atom are an xml format for transferring
collections of information and it's it's
a fairly fairly trivial system and the
protocol I'll actually go a little bit
more detail the protocol operations for
atom publishing protocol are all HTTP
verbs so what we've done with g data is
we started with atom publishing protocol
and then we've added several extensions
to how you're going to use that on
publishing protocol essentially taking
it from this theoretical construct
that's good for reading and writing
blogs to something that's much better
suited for reading and writing data and
so we've actually been extended the data
model so you can model how we actually
come up with patterns design patterns
how to model more data and make it more
available we've sixth ended we've added
querying we've added some some basically
concurrency issues in authentication
batch processing basic things that we
find that our our consumers of these up
of this data sources really need so atom
publishing protocol one slide there's
only two data types in atom publishing
quote two basic data types in atom
publishing protocol two main concepts
one is the concept of a feed you always
talk about RSS feeds and atom feeds and
we use the word feed a lot and it
confuses people because everybody thinks
nobody knows what a feat is it's this
thing that pushes shovels data at you in
our case in atom publishing protocol a
feed isn't something that it's not a
conveyor belt of data it's just a
container that you store data in on the
web and it exists out on the web and
it's addressed by a URL it is itself a
resource is the feed resource within the
feed then there's another type of
resource which is the entry
and the entry isn't just any data item
resource and that data item is itself
structured and if you go read the atom
syndication format and the atom
publishing protocol specular feed in
entry is just it's just a fetus is a
simple documents when you reprimands fur
the contents of a feed over the web
you're transferring an XML document and
the entries within it are just XML sub
documents within that it's very
straightforward most people can sort of
look at one and understand what it is
and then the actual protocol is limited
it's crud and this is about it so we're
using HTTP verbs insert add an entry to
a container get the contents of the
container which is the feed document
containing the entries and then you can
perform the basic crud operations on
individual entries and that's pretty
much the whole protocol it's very
straightforward so first thing I'm going
to talk about a little bit about is what
does one of these data entry items look
like so this is everybody's XML as I
told you it's extremely easy to read
right everybody can read this yeah so
let me break it down a little bit for
you so if you think about what is a data
item this is an entry if you notice I
have an entry field here so this is a
data this is an entry item and
essentially there's some content this
entry happens to represent a calendar
event so essentially there's content
here Adam provides a standard set of XML
tags for representing content title
content what is that the content tagged
actually says what is the the nature of
the event author there's several other
standard features at XML offers for
actually conveying data one of the other
nice problem properties of using adam
pub using atom syndication format is
every entry by is required to contain a
certain amount of metadata that makes
that entry very self-describing and very
useful so extremely useful metadata like
date and time stamps when was it created
when was it last updated these are
required by the atom publishing protocol
and they make it very easy to do
synchronization and start doing you know
start getting the most recent changes to
the to the information on the web a
universal ID all items have to be tagged
with an a unique identifier again in
true web fashion it's always a URL
which goes on forever this seemed to be
an infinite number of them and then of
course you'll have things like links i
mentioned that you could always embed
links and this is a lot like HTTP only
in this case the link represents a place
where you operate on this link in order
to edit this particular entry so this is
what the atom some of the things that
the atom publishing protocol provides
adam format and atom publishing protocol
provides is representing data so in g
data what we've done is we've taken this
basic format and we've provided our own
extensions to it so we say when we're
doing calendar events we've defined our
own xml for extending the data that's in
this that's in this entry so that you
know essentially start time enzyme
reminder and so on and also we've added
a typing mechanism so this in this case
this category tag says so consumers now
they see this entry they know it's a
calendar event they know what's kima
it's going to conform to and boom they
can actually start processing it and
people this this format is actually
simple enough that people can process it
they can hand write code to process it
HTTP processors are easy XML process
parsers are everywhere and every
language has one and you can start
building on it so the basic protocol
again as I said is based on HTTP I'll
give you a quick example of how to
insert an entry into a container so
you'll see i have example org slash feed
very simple protocol and i'm going to
send an atom entry to the server and
what I'm going to get back is an HTTP
result 2013 ated standard HTTP return
codes no special contents in no special
code in the body of the message itself
and what we're going to have here this
entry now is going to be modified by the
server to provide you know the server
can assign a unique ID it can assign
links and tell you where you're going to
go to edit this thing it conveys all
that information back and from here now
that I've got an edit link to this entry
i can edit this entry in the future i
can also get do a get operation on the
feed and get a list of all the entries
that exist in that entry so it's a
fairly straightforward simple protocol
low barrier to entry for programmers so
querying I'm see I think I was a say I
think I actually was going to drop that
slide so querying is
probably simple enough essentially we've
added a query model and it's the
simplest thing you could imagine
essentially use URL query syntax so here
I'm doing a full text query on all if
you if you pass this to the feed URL you
pass a query it will return you a feed
document and all entries that contain
that text it's not it's not particularly
difficult and we define whatever query
parameters we find you know whatever
metadata query parameters or whatever we
think they're going to be most useful by
the consumers of this data source we've
one of the things that we're very
concerned about is authentication
because we're dealing with your personal
data we have to deal with desktop
applications you have to deal with web
applications we have to deal with
JavaScript applications so we're for all
we're trying to expand the suite of ways
that you can authenticate and still
maintain security so how you share how
you do access control all these things
come along optimistic concurrency we
originally created our own optimistic
concurrency protocol by embedding in the
edit links we'd actually embedded a
version number so we could detect
conflicts we're actually moving towards
a newer version which is this entity
tags these are standard HTTP mechanisms
for conflict detection and this will and
they are also standard HTTP mechanisms
for caching so this move is going to
improve make us more standards compliant
which again means we're building on
common libraries and will improve our
Cashin performance and media entries you
can store binary data in the atom
publishing protocol that's actually an
batching operations you can make changes
on multiple items these are some of the
types of extensions that we've worked on
we're actually working on extending the
protocol based on the feedback of our
users so I think partial update and
partial get are things that are people
been wanting to modify one individual
field in an entry and so on so we're
actually actively working on developing
this protocol and moving these things
into the standard space so where do we
actually do adam pub api's this is a
short this is the current list it's
growing every day so when i mention that
it was originally atom publishing
protocol was originally designed for
blogger but we're using it for calendar
web albums youtube is one of our most
popular api's and
and picasa web albums are one of our
most popular api's our health product is
all built on g data in fact their whole
UI actually is built on top of this
GData API and plus it's all the inter
connection with all the service
providers is built on top of the
intricate EAP is and and so on and so on
and so on and we're adding more and i
highlight these two because you'll see
those a little bit later and the other
thing that we provide as the GData API
team we helped build GData API is within
google which are Adam Club ap is we also
provide a huge set of language toolkits
for clients so I said it's easy enough
that people can connect but we actually
try to provide a higher level for people
who want to actually interact with them
in particular languages these are all
open source libraries you can open you
can download and play and modify any one
of them and with them you can connect to
any of these services and get slightly
higher level semantics for inserting
entries deleting entries and so on
because it's an open source protocol the
specification is simple enough we've had
people developing them in all sorts of
languages so I just mentioned that and
if and it doesn't even require a client
library a lot of people just subscribe
with a feed reader a lot of people use
we have a JSON output format which a lot
of people write JavaScript that are
immediately fetching data say the latest
five blog posts they fetch it embed in
JavaScript format embedded in their web
page immediately so there's almost there
almost half our usage some are around
half i believe is done without any of
our client libraries that's how easy we
that's how low the barrier to entry is
for using that for accessing your date
so that's a brief tour of all the the
GData effort at google just going to
present some little application that we
trying to show some of the applications
of d data and he's going to do a quick
presentation are there any questions on
this stuff rollro quickly so okay Jeff
okay well give you plenty of time for
questions again at the end so the
application that i'm going to show you
is actually a game built by our own
pamela Fox who's fighting right
and so the idea of this game may
introduce it to you first is that a user
is presented with a set of images and
they're supposed to munch I guess the
ones that represent this keyword they're
given so they go through when they pick
it and if they pick the wrong one they
lose their life and if this random guy
who's coming after me heats me the
tragal I'm sorry well you also die and
then you can progress the different
levels and get high scores and all that
sort of thing and so it's you know a
cute time waster but the the real point
of this is a simple observation that I
think many computer scientists have
realized that computers aren't very good
at recognizing images at least not
compared to people so you can design
algorithms you can train machines but it
takes a lot of time and effort and cpu
power but you can throw a simple little
game up and people will waste their
bosses time giving you a nice index of
relevancy search so what we've abled
what we would do here is we record every
time someone clicks on an image and then
we decide that well if they clicked on
it sooner rather than later it's
probably a better result that's more
recognizable it pops out to them so
here's here's an example of things we've
collected on the left is the image that
we pick based upon the highest score and
on the right is just doing a tag search
for that image so Apple a little bit
more relevant got baby there you want to
mention what the data sources yeah I'm
getting to that don't rush me and then
like line really hard to define an image
search for that but people can visualize
it very easily so as the question that
Pamela just asked is where does Google
come into this little mashup I mean
you've used flash that's not even Google
this whole thing is hosted on App Engine
i'll mention off the bat which is our
application hosting environment where
you can upload a bit of python it runs
on our infrastructure but how do the
data api's come into this well the
images are coming from Picasa Web Albums
so there's one API there and I actually
built a second piece into this
we have a slide to to demonstrate all
this there we go so we we are pulling
these images in from picasa web and we
have this App Engine back-end we have
the front end that uses these images to
run the game and display you some
results and all the data is stored in
the App Engine back-end but now maybe
you want to publish some of these
results so a trivial implementation here
is to export to blogger and so if I show
you that create a really basic report
generator that you know if I make it
login again I can get an access token
for my blogger blog so i picked the blog
i generate a report in this case it's
just the 25 top-scored images and here i
open a nice draft the HTML table of the
data and i can edit this and then i can
publish it to my my research blog and
everyone can see oh great what today are
the top images and you can also imagine
exporting this to something like
spreadsheets which is very good at
visualizing tabular data and setting up
charts and setting up gadgets to
visualize them and track differences
over time see what people are most
interested in and so that was a very
simple integration using our Python
client library we're mentioning our
client libraries earlier to use the data
API for blogger and create that and then
the other component which is showed the
bottom of this chart is we've actually
republished our database using an atom
format so an arbitrary consumer of Adam
can look at our data so in this case
here is a feed representing results data
for the tag Apple but likewise we could
do line and actually if we go back to
Apple for a second you notice the second
result is steve jobs but so Firefox
makes this pretty and you can't really
see all the metadata in here but we do
have XML describing for example the
number of trials of a given image has
shown up in its current score based upon
how people clicked on it and also the
URL to the thumbnail that we're using
for the image
so this is sort of a toy example with
the toy data set but you can imagine in
your own research you probably will
collect gigabytes of data stored in some
database and right now you could always
I guess burn it to a DVD r for a
colleague and have them set their own
mysql and do their own queries against
it but you could also consider exposing
it as a restful web service like this
and people could query just for the
slices of data they're interested in and
create neat visualizations on what
you've managed to gather so that's sort
of kind of the spirit of what we're
trying to do here in terms of exposing
data for collaboration and making it
useful to not just whoever owns that
data whoever storing that data and of
course I have to show you some code to
to convince you that I'm not just making
this up and it's not all magic smoke so
for example to integrate with blogger
this is all Python I don't know all of
you love Python or not I do but so we're
just creating a blogger service we're
getting this authentication token back
from a sub and a lot of it really is as
simple as creating a new blog post entry
setting some bits of metadata for it and
then submitting it to the service so
it's really not too bad I mean I did
this in like 10 minutes I took I spent
more time trying to format the date and
then I did actually exporting to blogger
and the nice thing about App Engine is
it uses the Django template engine so
you can do things like create report
things based upon data structures in
Python very easily and similarly I was
even able to create the entire atom feed
just using the simple template engine
where I pass it datasets in sort of
stored in template variables and it just
magically generates an entry for each
photostat we have whatever tag we're
querying on and so that's like a really
really super high level view of what
we're trying to do here with this
application but I think you can
appreciate the the greater message in
that you can use our API is either to
collect data in the sense of you can
grab images from picasa web you can grab
videos from youtube but you can also do
things like build little applications on
top of them with App Engine and you can
republish them to
applications you may be already using
like blogger to do a research blog or
spreadsheets to visualize data and to
keep track of it and so I think that's
everything for and then that might be
one which was just yeah just usually as
one more just yeah Adam well Adam Adam
pub is a publicly available for Matt
it's IETF standard and if you wish to
republish data yourself it becomes a way
for other people to consume and build so
right and now so we have the top of the
data that you're collecting and the data
that you're exposing we've opened g data
format as well so you can steal all of
our semantics in our query language and
we won't go after you and so that's very
cool so you want to go to the next slide
here so um so what we thought for the
last part so what we've given you an
overview of what gdata is and one sample
example so we were sort of hoping to
have a little dialogue and gets ideas
from you when you have this way of data
formats what are the types of things you
can think of that would be useful to do
and you know what how could you use it
how would you like to see us use it you
know what could we do for you to make to
make your life easier so I went down and
I sort of tried to think of the types of
things that we think of when we think of
g data as this sort of big an atom pup
is a sort of big area that can be used
to do lots of things one of courses we
shown you is build applications I mean
this is exactly what he did he said I'm
going to build a novel application to do
semantic classification of images
structuring it as a game but i'm using
but i'm using all these data sources
exposed to get data i'm using this g
data protocol to publish data and to
share my results this is a form of i
guess you can think of it as a form of
data mining so we're actually sort of
mining the data from from google and
trying to do some analysis on it there
are limits on query responses it's stuff
stored actually at google so i don't
know how much data mining you'll be able
to do but there is the the idea of being
able to exceed asuras on the web there's
also the sort of the boring obvious
stuff which is administrative issues
like you know a lot of people just use
it as a way of managing say the
resources in a lab you know you want to
be able to you can build your own tools
you can build your own web applications
that will make your life simpler make
your system run smoother
because you can integrate with all the
tools so if you're using google tools or
other tools you can integrate with them
and and manage things that way and then
also what we just said was like sharing
your data and making it available to
other people to use it was interesting
application I put in here called radish
I just thought it was a very cool
example where somebody had come up with
an idea that we hadn't thought of so we
created this calendar API and our main
thought has always been synchronization
and one of the one of the engineers at
Google said well you know now that all
the data now that all the conference
rooms are in our calendar and they all
have an API to the conference room
schedule I can put on each conference
room a little device that electronically
retrieves the schedule and displays it
so what did they looked at it and said
you know we're printing how many
thousands of sheets of paper every day
to stick in those conference rooms to
say this conference room is owned about
you know this conference room was
reserved every day and they reprint
those every single day and we've got
what you know 800 conference rooms you
can you can count the paper and so
somebody went ahead and built a little
device it's a little wireless device it
uses ambient electric light to charge
itself the salt so it is it's solar
powered and then it has a one of these
electronic paper displays that requires
no power when it's actually off and so
every once in a while at wake every
couple hours or minutes it wakes up
queries the GData API figures out what
that conference room schedule is
displays it and then shuts itself down
again and just sits there and soaks up
ambient light takes no powered
electricity this is just and he said I I
just couldn't abide the engineers just
could not abide by wasting so much paper
and so he came up with a very novel new
way to sort of exploit the fact that
your data is available to do something
to solve a problem that nobody had ever
even considered which was saving paper
so I really thought that was kind of a
cool example so um you know I just want
to open up to you guys what do you guys
think where this what do you guys think
is where ways that we could possibly use
our API sore possibly make a you know
that the exposing data on the web could
be could be better or things that you'd
like to see us do or just questions
about the API is in general of course if
you have technical questions about what
we do or how we do
it this would be a good time so I was
wrong if there's a way that you allow
people to link into tools like Google
Maps for example because the technology
there would be great for some of us to
you know bring in so I work on
biological data bringing our biological
networks then lay them out with google
maps and things like that or are you
keeping all of those completely prepared
um well she let Pamela take that one oh
you and you rent it you guys kamla
support engineer for maps maps api but
if not it is not making games my job is
actually to support the Google Maps API
um so I don't know if there's a talk
about the google maps api today or not i
don't think so okay um so we do have
api's for Google Maps and Google Earth
now and so the api's are really
visualization API so letting you easily
create a map and then add data on top of
the map so they're actually we don't
have any sort of geo data API although
we have announced that we're working on
that so actually so calendar is like
storing data that specialized for
storing time time time time data to
right so we're going to have a Geo data
API which allows you to easily store
data that's geotagged and then you can
imagine that the queries that you do
against that data would be stuff like
bounding box search radius search
something specific to geo data that you
obviously wouldn't do on a calendar feed
so that's going to be coming out we
announced pronounce that a few months
ago so we do have the Geo data API
coming out till then we have you can use
the earth API if you want to control 3d
earth in the browser you use the Maps
API if you want to create your own 2d
map smash-up and one other thing to
point out is that we have a standard for
geo data called can't KML which has
integrated with Adam a little bit and
we'll probably integrate more in the
future especially with this GData API
coming out so if you want to publish
your format so here this is publishing
your data generally to be consumed by
anyone if you have geo data specifically
you probably want to look into
publishing that data as kml as kml is a
standard that we started at Google Earth
but now is embraced by
Microsoft Yahoo and you know a lot of a
lot of different places and there's like
thousands of KML files on the web so
that's something to look into so yes hey
what is in place that could help serve
for digital signatures for knowing that
the code is backed by someone that we
can that we can go back to that we know
that it's a legitimate version of
something I referring to the code of the
data like the value of the belt because
I actually could be done in both I mean
you've got some libraries you're making
available and then you've also got the
data that we can download with things
like cache poisoning if we're going to
if we think we're downloading data from
the map how do we know we're really
getting data from the map rather than
something that's going to lead us off
off a bridge or into a restricted area I
have a number of issues like this where
when you're passing a lot of things
around as as both feeds and as libraries
there are all kinds of opportunities to
mischief and and so this is an area of
my concern in my research having having
some good digital signatures having some
trace back some authentication measures
would seem to be reasonable and I'm just
wondering who's working on that what do
you have available well for that for the
GData API I mean I'm sure there are
plenty plenty of attack vectors as you
said you can attack the client libraries
you're going to attack a lot of DNS you
can attack a lot of things basically if
you think of atom publishing protocol
and rest in general it's it's a lot like
working on any web problem I mean it's
essentially where we are not any
different than than anybody's suffering
from fishing and we all know the
problems that come along with those we
have so realistically speaking the GData
API is per se don't deal with a lot of
those attack vectors those are probably
things that need to be solved at a level
you want the mic those are things that
need to be solved at a level below that
in terms of our I remember I can
remember what else I was going to
mention I never mentioned a sub request
signing so well in terms of
authentication there are some issues
well one of the things that we do work
on specifically is authentication which
is knowing that the person accessing the
data is actually getting the data so
there is standards out there called off
sub
excuse me Oh auth if you're familiar
with hola yeah so for those of you who
aren't aware oo auth is based on the
idea that i'm working with say i'm
working with a website that wants to get
access to my calendar information and/or
my core commonly actually one of the
more popular cases my contact
information I want my you know I want to
give I want to give a friend feed my
comp my contact information and
friendfeed then wants to go query my API
but I don't want to necessarily give
them I want to give them the access
rights but I don't want to give them my
username and password so we have there's
a standard now that's emerged called oh
uh where that website friendfeed would
redirect you to Google you would log in
at Google at unknown / again HTTPS so
we're relying on basic web security
mechanisms Google then redirect you back
to that website and that would website
with them would receive a token that
they could then use to access your
service without knowing anything about
it so that's an issue that's one issue
actually work on a lot as authentication
and authorization issues are one area
where we do a lot of work but just as a
quick follow-up to that when you said it
similar to fishing a lot of the ways
that we can deal with phishing attacks
and getting false pages is to have them
digitally signed and so I guess really
going back to the issue of if I'm going
to request data from them from your Maps
or I'm going to send a selector that i'm
going to ask for data that i'm going to
bring in and then process google has a
lot of computing power and being able to
put a digital signature on that data
before it goes out or calculate a
message digest even that i had some way
of tracking back would be would give me
greater confidence that I'm getting the
real thing and then I'm getting
something that was actually in 10
to be provided to me from google so as a
single action I could I can mention that
that Adam if you're familiar with that
I'm publishing atom syndication form and
excuse me the format the data format
that we use there actually are signing
standards for signing the data items
themselves I don't believe that they've
been heavily used in the web so a lot of
the atom feeds that come out right now
come out unsigned but they do is
position but those standards do exist
and that they haven't been widely
deployed yeah I mean I think it's
reasonable we do have some API so just
work over SSL but since we have signed
requests we might as well have signed
responses in the future if we want to
look at that yeah we've looked at that
like I said I think where you'd probably
want to go is with the atom signature
type mechanisms I think one of the
biggest problems with them was a lot of
the idea behind the atom signature a lot
of the idea behind some of the atom was
being able to republish information like
an entry would be a self-contained
object self-describing you can then
republish but then the signature tends
to get broken because of it tends to
depend on like source attributes that
change and depends on how you sign it
right so the signing actually became a
very complicated problem and a lot of
people just threw up their hands and
said I trust that if HTTPS gets gets me
to the source I'm okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
