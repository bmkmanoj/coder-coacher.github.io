Mike
Marisnick and he was someone I was
inspired by just by picking up a bucket
and reading about the research that he
was doing but it's about all of us
possibly attaining our potential and
then speaking with him and realized how
much a passion he had for all of this so
I just wanted to introduce you to dr.
Mike MERS myth of posit science and
scientific learning and his team that's
up here and we have a mic in the middle
for questions right after and we're
recording this for posterity so other
people can be inspired so if you could
speak into the mic that's the only way
you can actually log the questions so
without further ado dr. Mike Marisnick
right thank you Peter
it's a great pleasure to be here I want
to say at the outset that I'm going to
talk about very complicated science in a
relatively simple way and that's the
science of brain plasticity and if you
actually look across the sweep of
neuroscience now probably about a third
of scientific reports related in some
way or other to the fact that the brain
is continually changing itself as you
acquire ability and in the progression
of every disability and that's basically
what my subject is so the subject is
massive from a scientific point of view
so it's necessarily going to be treated
with superficially here I want to say
that you can think of this as sort of an
introduction to to basically thinking
about how this applies to you in your
brain and how you think about the brain
in the world in society and how its
organized maybe how you're organized a
little bit here at Google I also want to
say at the outset that the research I'm
going to talk about more directly which
relates to the application or uses of
this science they try to drive changes
or Corrections or improvements and the
functional operations of brains of
actual people has been contributed to by
hundreds of people some of those people
are at scientific learning corporation
which is a public company in in Oakland
California right across from City Hall
and some of the some of that some of
those contributors there at posit
Science Corporation which is in downtown
San Francisco most of both companies
that I helped found with the notion of
trying to bring to science with approval
at the University of California out into
the world for the benefit of people that
need help
and but also both scientific learning
and positive science have collaborators
scientific collaborators across the
world both rely on scientific
consultants sort of the best experts in
this field and they've contributed
immensely and also there are clinics you
know many many schools in which these
things are applied many many clinics
many many places which it's applied and
they're also in a sense participants in
the unit in a sense in this lecture so
I'm going to talk about brain plasticity
across the lifetime the brain is a
machine that continually changes itself
as you acquire ability and as you lose
it
the brain is changing it's plastic it's
not like a computer it's actually
changing the details of its connectivity
across the lifetime I'm going to talk
about using brain plasticity science in
attempts to improve individual's brain
power and these are some I'm going to
focus initially on people that really
obviously need help children are
struggling to learn or adults that are
struggling to to keep with it as they
age and so forth and I also going to
talk about the normal individual all of
us are subject to positive change at any
point in their life I'm going to talk
about the special problems that relate
to maintaining brain fitness once you
have acquired it and then try to say a
little bit at the end about why this
science might matter for you so the
brain is a plastic organ if you think
about it the last time you might have
been around one of these
this happens to be my grandson Gus he's
a cute little devil as you can see and
when he popped out into the world of
bright lights and clear sound he was
born more or less stupid
so you think about babies and what they
can do they're much more impressive for
what they can't do right they have very
poor perceptual abilities they have
nothing that you could call cognition
there's not really any thinking going on
in there believe me there's no ability
to control movement they poop they suck
that's pretty much yet it's going to be
many weeks before before the brain is
organizing its control activities enough
so the baby can roll over for God's sake
much less reach out and grab something
that they desperately want and there's
not really much communication there
can't be much indication that there's
actually a person there after all the
person that will be there is formed is
created by the plastic processes of this
machine within its lifetime and doesn't
come into the world as a hand off it
actually comes in the world with all
kinds of possibility and that person is
going to be created by its interactions
with the world and here we see a boy a
few years forward in life and you can
see that he's bouncing a soccer ball in
his head while he's running and probably
shouting at us at teammates we see a boy
of this age not too many years later
this boy has very acute sophisticated
perceptual abilities
this boy is is able to control
operations and thought yes it's
elaborate cognitive abilities but
they're still in a period of very rapid
development many years going forward
he will become more and more complex in
his mental operations and its ability to
control movement you see series in
controlling incredibly complicated
movement in this case in fact multiple
movements simultaneously there's no
question at this age that there's a
person there a unique individual we know
if we talked to him and got into things
with him we would see that he was unique
pretty much in the world would not have
seen anyone like him no one that has
this quite his array of abilities his
knowledge his operations in the world
every one of its unique everyone is
special everybody has an individualized
repertoire of capabilities and all of
that comes through brain change all of
that comes through the specialization of
the machinery of our brain Hardware
literally changes itself in ways that
specialize itself that account for this
incredible differentiation person by
person you might notice that he's
bouncing a soccer ball in his head and
you could probably guess just by knowing
that fact where he's from so he's
actually from Sao Paulo you guessed
right and in Sao Paulo about 40% of boys
of his age have this ability
you can go out into Sunnyvale or Redwood
City or someplace around here and you'd
have trouble finding a boy that can do
this run and bounce a ball in the head
and if you found one there probably some
cell Paulo and that's all another way of
saying that we are very much shaped in
this in our special abilities by the
culture into which we just happen to
have been born now we happen to bed war
more or less recently and culture has
evolved a hell of a long way before we
arrived and most of what we actually do
most of the hours of every day apply to
skills and abilities that didn't apply
didn't exist thousand years ago many
didn't exist 100 years ago our brains
are different substantially different
and how they're constructed and
specialized from the brain even of our
relatively immediate ancestors every one
of us is shaped by culture and as
culture evolves the individual brain is
evolving in its capacities in its nature
in its operations and its control more
or less than an undisciplined way
because the advance of culture which you
are contributing to mightily in this
great institution it's more or less
advancing in an undisciplined way from
the point of view of the perspective of
the brain now we're going to talk about
brain plasticity and three life epochs
because it's not completely constant
across life the first epoch the brain
has actually got to establish the
control of its own self development
isn't worn with that doesn't really have
the basis of controlling its own
plasticity when it's born it has to go
through an early period a special period
of plasticity in order to accomplish
that in a second epoch the brain is
acquiring its primary skill repertoire
and this applies through check childhood
and through young adulthood when you're
basically specializing yourself in all
of the hard and complicated ways that
define you as an individual
operationally in the world and then
there's a third epoch that lasts pretty
much to the end of life and through most
of adulthood in which the brain is
primarily a user of manifold mastered
skills and abilities you no longer
changing it so much i acquiring new
skills by acquiring new abilities you're
sort of a crass user of things you long
since mastered
so let's begin with epoch one we're back
to Gus actually his name is Augustus
Knut representing the complex
combination of an ad mixtures that we
have wonderfully in American society
when you begin to create yourself in an
early critical period of brain
development and what really
distinguishes this period is it's a
period of what you could call
anything-goes or always-on plasticity
the brain is continuously plastic and
it's actually shaped by modified by any
input that arise by any action that the
baby makes and there are competitive
plastic processes in the brain and
change its detail wiring and those
plastic processes basically help the
brain set up the initial forms of its
processing machine and the environmental
stimuli are shaping the initial forms of
each great brain systems processing
machinery now it's easy to demonstrate
that and we've demonstrated in many many
ways we expose a little baby animals
across this period to meaningless dumb
sound doesn't really matter what this
sound is and the brain quickly
specializes to become a sort of optimal
processor for the representation that
sound so we can quickly occupy all of
the auditory domain by the
representation of any dumb sound you
want can be a noise be some simple song
or we can set up more interesting
competitive processes for example we've
raised animals with the complexity it
would be equivalent to raising the
animal in a zoo
and actually we did that by getting a
tape loop from scientists who we
collaborate with in University in Zurich
and they literally did collect these
samples of sounds and localizations of
animals birds in a zoo in the Zurich Zoo
and you expose animals to repertoires of
sound in which their 40 calls of
different animals and birds each created
in multiple variations six or seven or
eight or nine different variations so
then we'll the baby
oli sounds roll by and in that case we
get a very beautiful auditory cortex
very elaborate very highly specialized
in selected to represent those sounds or
we can turn that around and raise the
animal under conditions in which all of
the sound that's arriving to them
it's basically undifferentiated
for example modulated noises all I hear
all day long is she she she she she she
she noise going by and what we get is
the brain that goes through this period
maturation period with no specialization
basically a very primitive cortex but
now it's very unselected for anything
that could have meaning or could bear
meeting in the world the baby's brain
can't know what's meaningful they can't
know what's useful it can't know what
sound is important it can't put meaning
to any sound basically it has to evolve
in its processing and be able to operate
selectively to a substantial extent
before any of that is possible and it
does this through natural competitive
plasticity processes because the
plasticity switches just turned on all
it takes is exposure and just by
exposure basically the brain sets up
initial forms of its processing
machinery for example in the auditory
domain in human infants initial primary
sound processing specialization is for
the babies native language doesn't
matter of course if the babies born into
a family that peak peaks Tagalog or
English or Bantu or whatever doesn't
matter brain can't care does it care
can't no and it can't be initially about
any of that language meaning anything
because from the perspective the brain
it can't mean anything and in fact the
baby has actually been exposed on the
average to four to five million words
before it struggles to put meaning to
the first one when it's about nine
months of age massive exposure has to
occur and in fact in order to accomplish
the initial specialization of the
processing machinery so that can
interpret and sort those sounds of its
native language it has to be exposed to
at least a half a million of them
massive exposure has to occur massive
change has to occur
beautiful specialization occurs in every
baby's brain just by being born into the
the presence of all of this complex
sound flowing by we know that it doesn't
matter to the baby what the speech
actually is because we can study
language development and cultures in
which baby in which parents incessantly
talk to their babies and we can contrast
that to cultures in which parents don't
talk to their baby system
of cultural strategy so for example in
East Africa there are two groups one
group doesn't believe the baby is worth
talking to until her have their first
birthday and at the first birthday they
have a big ceremony the mother takes the
baby off her back and now the baby is
part of the community and they begin
talking to the baby and then the Jason
culture the Masai they jabber at their
babies incessantly absolutely believe
that it really matters that they talk to
their babies incessantly and
continuously so comparative linguists
have gone to these two groups and said
how different are they are these babies
that have not been directly talked to
substantially backward in their language
development from babies they've been
talked to incessantly and the answer is
there's not there's not a measurable
difference between these two groups okay
because in order to establish basic
phonemic competency what is required is
merely exposure can't have meaning
speech can't have meaning now I'm not
recommending you don't talk to you baby
if you have one by all means talk rub
but understand these plasticity
processes does not strictly require it
this early cortical specialization is
critically enabling the development of
working memory and selective attention
you have to differentiate the
representation of things of the world
before you can operate on it in ways
that can render it to memory you have to
be will create selective processing
before selective attentional processes
can operate on it to control selection
okay Mangia Tory control processes that
are enabling plasticity in the basis of
behavioral outcome also mature across
this period at a later age debate the
brain is going to make an evaluation of
the consequences of its action it's
actually going to control plasticity so
that plasticity is only permitted when
the brain interprets it to be good for
it okay and it has to mature the systems
that are going to evaluate outcome
before it can establish that control
first very primitive lee that initial
primitive control is established across
this early period of infancy and from
the end of the critical period forward
to the end of life
cortical plasticity is powerfully gated
now we have on and off switches mostly
off and only going to allow change under
control of working memory and it's a
function of selective attention and as a
function of the brain's own assessment
of behavioral outcomes so we have a
really amazing thing in the early
evolution of the brain it's born in the
world without it without the ability to
control its plasticity it evolves to a
point in it in its control machinery
involves to the point in this
representation of the details of the
things of the world and it can begin in
primitive ways initially to actually
control its own self development which
is an amazing thing
now that carries us to stage two when an
older brain is going to control its own
plasticity as a master's skill after
skill in the learning context I'd like
to talk about the way the brain
accomplishes this by this simple example
so we here you have two beautiful
children they happen to be my other two
grandchildren and we see that they're
using this tool this tool is a is a
lever it has the scoop on the end you
can see that this child in this
relatively primitive the control of the
tool as a fulcrum stet relatively near
this group so this is a conservative
position but it doesn't give you much
very effective control of this tool
because you know that you have to move
the fulcrum out to really have the
freedom degrees of freedom that would
really give you sophisticated control
right at first you learn in this way you
see that this child has been working at
using this tool for a while that she's
still not very accurate
and you can also see that she's still
using an alternative strategy now she's
going to use this tool thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands of
times and ultimately she will become
sophisticated like this user she'll be
able to control a tool basically with
the folk come set back in with high
levels of agility now this is not a this
is not a trivial accomplishment of a
brain when you think of the control that
would be required to manipulate this
tool let's think about that a little bit
now of course what the objective of this
use of this tool is to dip it into this
to introduce it into this substance the
substance can have lots of resistance or
little it can when it's loaded it can be
heavy or can be light it has to be
brought up right without losing the load
to the mouth which is out of you
right and then it has to be dumped
successfully right so this is not a
trivial undertaking now all of these
require relatively fine dynamic control
in the control of movements and muscles
postures are the fingers right this is a
pretty complicated thing and that can
only be accomplished with relatively
sophisticated feedback it's coming from
the skin receptors in the skin that are
measuring the forces and the and the
pressures dynamically and from joints
and receptors that are in deep in the
fingers and in the muscles and in joints
of the hand in the arm and so forth and
beautiful level of sophisticated control
has to be mastered and actually to
manipulate this simple tool now actually
when you train a brain at a task like
this anywhere you look with it the
representation of the surface of the
hand the arm receptors that come from
deep in the arm or hand or fingers or
you look at the representations that
relate to any aspect of this behavior
you see specialization you see the brain
is actually specialized for the mastery
of the skill or different aspects of
this field brain region by brain region
the plastics we've seen is actually
massive now the brain strategy for
accomplishing the specialization is very
simple
it has a great trick all it does is
evaluate the success of an attempt and
the basic evaluation of successive
attempt when the attempt is a good one
by its evaluation it says save it save
that one that was a good one
now what does save it mean it means that
it strengthens all of the connections
the myriad connections that contribute
backward in time to that successful
attempt and what it's doing in effect is
giving and those changes in the
strengths of connections produce
iteratively through thousands and
thousands and thousands of attempts lead
it to on a beautiful path of progression
towards perfection now how does it
evaluate the success of attempt well has
two simple strategies first a sardonic
it wants the food the food itself as a
reward so it's working for the food
the second is more sophisticated but
it's more powerful and important to the
brain it actually creates a model of a
good attempt in memory this child has
watched people use this tool and she
knows what this tool use is about she's
actually create a model in her brain of
successful to use and she's evolving a
model by her practice in its use and
that model itself is being slowly
elaborated and perfected in her brain
and basically she's evaluating this
six-feet the success of each attempt
against that model so she's actually
holding the model in memory and she's
evaluating her performance against that
remembered ideal and by that strategy
you have mastered thousands of basic
skills and abilities that define you
operationally as the human that you are
the highly skilled and elaborately
skilled human individual that you are
now progressive experienced induced
plasticity has also created something in
a sense even more sensational it's
created you the embodied person that you
are is a product of brain plasticity
within your lifetime and that's occurred
because every time the brain is
recording information it's recording it
in the context in which
it's associating things that occur
nearly simultaneously and time and
that's the basis of building a model of
the world you've constructed your model
of the world you're constructing the
associational relationships between
things in time not just in the present
moment but on the basis of the
prediction of what comes next just like
a Google search engine you're making all
kinds of predictions of what goes with
that what comes next
right now with every thought with every
action with every perception with every
movement there's an association that
always occurs and that associations to
the source and the source is you
billions and billions and billions and
billions of times a year the brain is
making that Association it's making it
in an individual way that relates to the
complex information that's being fed
from every environment that's
individuating you the person that you
are by this massive self associative
process because that information is
coming powerfully on a heavy schedule
every day from the receptors of your
skin the creation of the person you are
that self referenced creation is
embodied it comes to the limits of your
height of course it's basically a
product these plasticity processes in
your brain now brains don't always
develop in a powerful way and in fact
it's very easy to screw them up you can
screw them up by giving them bad genetic
history you can screw them up by giving
them a bad childhood and of course we do
that massively culturally we give
millions and millions billions of
children in the world are not very
adequate childhood and of course there
are hundreds of billions of children in
the world at least that have a bad
genetic history one of the important
things to understand about this
plasticity process so that is in there
is a resource in a brain as long as an
animal's line so when the animal is
young we can screw the brain up
genetically or we can screw it up by
giving it a bad childhood and we can fix
it
and we can fix it by driving it in a
corrective direction and this is a very
important way that we've tried to use
brain plasticity
for good we're basically trying to use
it's incredibly powerful resource which
is what what it is do Drive range and
positive or corrective directions now
here's a dumb little experiment
meaningless now that I looked at this
slide but it illustrates my point if you
understood what the hell this means
we're looking down on a little piece of
the auditory or hearing cortex this is
how it represents sound frequency low
frequency toward the blue height with
the red and here's here's an adult
that's been raised in a bad environment
basically in the presence of continuous
modulated noises it's matured so that
has no real representational resolution
of frequency that's worth a damn near we
just trained it's a litter mate and the
litter mate looks like normal in fact
it's easy to make a litter mate super
normal
and here's another litter mate that
hasn't been trained that says the same
age now Matt's with us we've done this
experiment in many forms this is a very
simple experiment to do you're not stuck
with the limitations of childhood
necessarily it can be quite complicated
to train a brain to catch up but you're
not stuck with it now in the same way
we've done experiments like this and
rats that are near the end of life and
the brain is turning crappy just because
they've lived too long or let's say live
to a ripe old age and a whole series of
physical and functional ways that brains
to look dysfunctional they have very
poor control of inhibitory processes in
the brain they have they don't they
respond very sluggishly dynamically they
are very poorly correlated actions which
means that they're operating very
precisely and with great with great
confusions and you see this expressed
behaviorally in a whole variety of ways
you see it expressed in their elemental
neurology
we can make the brain of an animal near
the end of life that is greatly impaired
in almost every way look like an animal
that's in the middle of life physically
functionally chemically because these
brain plasticity processes are
substantially reversible that's what I'm
going to begin to talk about I'm going
to begin to talk about how we use brain
plasticity for correction and in
experiments like this we know that we
can improve the fidelity or accuracy of
representations and the cerebral cortex
or other places in the brain we know
that we can improve the power the string
reliability of cortical representation
we know they can increase the
coordination of cortical representations
and coordination is critical because
from coordination comes reliability and
functional control of systems we can
increase the complexity of natural
complex signal feature representations
in all kinds of ways we increase the
noise immunity of cortical
representations basically by increasing
the way activities occur in correlated
has correlated responses and populations
we can increase the speed the detail
completeness or this intact set syntax
the cortical operations and we can do
that at any level of operation in the
brain actually there's a very large
literature in the animal domain and
which people have trained adult monkeys
to do all kinds of things usually
macaque monkeys all grow monkeys and
this model has been used repeatedly
because brains are of all our animal
models that are available access
accessible of neuroscientists they're
the most human-like macaque old where
monkeys are smart they're in a sense on
the path to us not so many many million
years back and they're very capable and
they can be taught to master simple and
complex behaviors and probably in two or
three thousand different forms
scientists across the world of trained
monkeys to do this or that simpler
complex thing so in the one level they
might train a monkey to make fine
distinctions about simple aspects of
stimuli on another level they might
treat trained an animal in two ways in
which they have to master some complex
principle of reasoning or count some
complex principle of manipulating
information that changes every time they
act or something doesn't matter all of
these experiments work now what assigned
to see when they do these experiments
well let me go to a halfway reasonable
place in the brain neurons are
specialized for the behavior they do
just the right thing this is not a
particularly difficult experiment
whatever the behavior the brain is
massively specialized every time you
acquire a new ability at any point in
life at any age whatever its nature
you've acquired it through brain change
the machine is different once you've
acquired it from before
Nosa seen an experiment after experiment
after experiment so our practical goals
that is to say the goals of scientific
learning corporation in posit science
corporation these are these companies in
San Francisco in Oakland Oakland and San
Francisco have been to define
contributions of brain plasticity or
maladies or limitations to the
expressions of developmental adult
acquired disabilities or disease and
with that understanding to employ the
brain's inherent plasticity to dry brain
processes in empowering or corrective
directions now before I say more about
that I want to say that we don't just
train people that are in trouble we've
trained hundreds of thousands of
children that are doing just fine and
then their case the object is to help
them do better the majority of children
and the majority of adults we've trained
though do have problems and basically
we're trying to drive whatever their
condition we're trying to brave their
private uh brain in and empowering in an
enriching direction you could say in a
corrective direction our major prep
targets have been developmental
impairments and language reading and
cognitive abilities and children and and
also in adults who are struggle with
normal or with pathological aging so
this is a universal every almost every
older adult is losing it to some extent
and so that's a big target it's a
universal disease as it were and then
some adults have special problems that
require or justify special efforts for
rescue we've also been very interested
in we have elaborate collaborative
studies that being conducted by
scientists at Yale and UCSF especially
in which we've been addressing problems
of psychotic illness I'm not sure I'll
have time to talk about that but our
primary target really has been
schizophrenia both its prevention in
individuals at risk for onset and its
treatment once you have it devastating
human condition
we're also been interested in improving
the lot of people that have suffered
brain injuries that trauma trauma could
be diffused from a variety of causes it
can come from a variety of can come from
infections that can come from
a bump in the head it can come from keep
chemical poisoning and chemotherapy can
come from a lot of places from oxygen
deprivation a lot of sources or it can
be acute it can be localized as in a
stroke that's not a stroke that's a
stroke and then acquired movement
disorders we're trying to determine
whether or not we can we know that we
can reverse some of these complex
conditions we think that it's possible
we ought to be able to prevent the onset
of something like parkinsonism if we
knew it was coming and so on and so
forth so a whole variety of ways in
which you're trying to use this I want
to talk a little bit about these uses
first of all let's say they will have a
child with a learning problem well turns
out that learning problem can be
effectively overcome in most children
not all but in most children with
intensive training the targets brain
processing accuracy and speed these are
key neurological skills that support
facile language and reading so we have
the average kid that struggles to learn
has a noisy brain probably most often
arising from the fact that their native
language wasn't really English or
Spanish or Tagalog because a brain was
noisy the native English was actually
baby language it's actually noisy
English or Spanish or Tagalog and the
brain processing is optimized for that
degraded condition one of the things
that happens when that in that early
condition is that the brain sets time
constants that are longer basically
because it has to listen longer in order
to reliably get the answer right okay so
it just makes natural adjustments and
regiments are reflected by speed and of
course they're reflected by accuracy
every important child of course has a
resident access the brain is still
plastic so the question is can we drive
the brain in a corrective direction and
in most children that's absolutely
achievable now before I talk about that
I want to talk about another great
source of variation in human ability
that's just as important as inherited
differences and that's a variation in
the richness of environments and then
the consequent elaboration of the brain
machinery of individual children there's
tremendous variation in the richness of
environments and actually in fact we
bring way too much
on genetics so for example if we just
look at and this is from a study that
was conducted by Hart and Risley more
than a decade ago if we just look at the
difference in the environment in
language exposure of children that are
raised in families that are out in
welfare as opposed to children that are
raised in the homes of professionals now
what we see is that there is a 30
million we're different in the exposure
of children by the time they arrive at
the schoolhouse door that's a massive
difference now not only is a difference
in the quantity of language that the
child's been exposed to this driven
changes in their brain and perfected
their language processing machinery and
all of its elaborations but there are
big differences in the quality big
differences from the complexity of the
language that they've been presented
with so they've seen language and very
elaborate and elegant forms compared
with the average kid in which the family
is in struggling and not only is there a
difference in the quality there's a
difference in the nature of the
interactions in language between the
child and the adult so for example Hart
and Risley simply counted the number of
times a day in which the interactions of
the child were have probations as
opposed to the number of times of in the
day in which the interactions were
affirmative stop that Billy don't
do that Billy right
that's an approbation way to go Mary
nice job Mary that's an affirmative
right so when the family is struggling
twice as often it's not the interaction
is corrective in the in the family
that's doing well six times to one the
interaction is affirmative now who do
you think arrives at the schoolhouse
door with a good attitude about talking
right you can't shut Mary up everything
about talking to Mary is a bonus she
expects some reward she commonly
receives and not not only that but Mary
is a talker Mary is smart
Billy is limited Billy is acting up from
the outset Billy doesn't want to talk
that much talking to Billy is bad news
Billy fails in school with such high
probability is going to do not do too
well not be identified too quickly too
as being right up there in the front row
you know how do you think these his
interactions in language and
communication and being called on by the
teacher how do you think that's going to
evolve now if you just look at these
children going forward whoops
G there have slides out of where I left
out a slide if you just look at these
children going forward and you look at
these great divisions of a society and
you say well how are these children
going to be different hi Brett nice to
see ya
Brett's a former doctoral student of
mine nice to ceiling audience and sorry
for the interruption but he's an old
friend of mine I lost my train of
thought going forward when these
children enter that's the way he used to
interrupt my train of thought all of the
time you know so not to surprise that
occurred again going forward when the
children in her high school we know that
children from these two great divisions
in society are going to be about five
years separated in the reading ability
so it's not good to get off your brain
to get off to a bad and limited start
from the point of view of the rich men
of language exposure right you'll bear
the price of that ever after and the
challenge for us has been actually drive
improvements of the operations of brains
enough so we can actually change the
slope of those kids that are on that low
trajectory that's going to give them
have them be five years behind before
they enter high school that's our goal
so these limitations that turns out can
be overcome in most children by
intensive training that corrects their
neurology and then this training
children work at highly efficient
computer-controlled exercises they
commonly work for thirty or sixty
minutes per day and three to five days a
week and there are nine exercise suites
that are chosen from and that some are
focused on language abilities which are
critical prerequisites for reading
success and some focus on reading itself
because reading successful reading is an
absolute absolutely critical for a child
to succeed these are products that
scientific learning
corporation the Oakland Company
exercises are game-like but they're not
games they're serious they're optimized
in their efficiencies they're there
they're actually directed targeted to
enliven the brain and to drive it
progressively in ways that actually will
improve the foundation skills that will
support high-level language and reading
abilities and then the exercises are
constructed so that everything the child
does is recorded so that we can
reconstruct compliance progress and
outcomes all of those are continuously
monitored an objective success and what
we're trying to do in training is to
bring every child in a kind of a
closed-loop environment where we track
the progress of the child and we're
trying to drive every child that's
trained towards proficiency proficiency
in something like reading means carrying
the child to the 70th percentile so 70%
of Americans children in school aren't
proficient okay so it's a good goal to
carry any child that's below that mark
you could say to the level of
proficiency in reading and we now know
but no more or less because we have this
the largest database that's collected
data from children in the world in
Oakland data from more than a million
children we now know more or less what
it takes in a progression of training to
carry a child wherever they start on a
statistical average to a level of
performance efficiency that's what we're
trying to achieve the games are created
or the exercises are created in
game-like forms that are more or less
Universal that is to say they're not
American so that they can be applied
anywhere in the world and increasingly
this is a typical game little snapshot
of a game and a space-themed games have
these kind of themes that could be
acceptable to child no matter where this
child sits and no matter what the
language of the child might be is the
idea progress in developing and applying
training programs for school-aged
children or we trained about 1.25
million children today nine complex
training program suites for target
language abilities five target reading
some are designed for children of the
young age some are designed for kids
that are in middle school or high school
we have outstanding results in which we
can demonstrate repeatedly that we can
move children that are not doing so well
across the distribution we
that because we commonly collect state
achievement test scores so we commonly
evaluate children after they're trained
and we can see that we were moving them
differentially in relation for example
to other children in their state or
other children in their school district
I looked at the records or talk about
the records about three weeks ago with a
with people at scientific learning about
a school district in the state of
Louisiana in a parish in Louisiana that
was affected by Hurricane Katrina and
two years ago in the school district the
average kid in the school district was a
standard deviation more than a standard
deviation below the normal median for
the state of Louisiana you can imagine
it that's probably not doing too well
right that means the average kid in the
school district was below the 16th
percentile for the state of Louisiana on
state achievement test two years later
the average kid in these schools where
this programs have been provided across
the normal median now that's called
moving against the distribution that's
exactly we're trying to achieve we're
trying to move children differentially
by improving their brain power improving
the speed and accuracy with which their
brains are processing information homes
of intervention with a similar number of
hours per week all effort involved well
you can actually train a child
individually if you are with me if I was
with the therapist for an equivalent
amount of time one-on-one you know I
would see results that are not too
differentiated from this the problem is
is that it's incredibly expensive right
so I could actually implement this I
could train a specialist to deliver this
kind of training substantially you have
many of the aspects that can prove
provable that's just not deliverable so
that technology basically provides a way
to deliver it at low cost and then we're
better than the therapists because
basically what we think we can deliver
is very high throughput in 3 or 4 or 500
times an hour we can have a child make
decisions that are monitored decisions
about let's say what they hear what they
see or what how they how they think
right so basically we can have the
learning cycle occur over relatively
short a period of time now the advantage
of the therapist
can make with the really skilled
everything be very highly important
momentous for the child but we can do
that too in all kinds of ways that we
know how to engage skilled kids so that
everything is really important to them
in an exercise increasingly as I said
before outcomes are controlled by
therapists and schools by customizing
training to achieve assured academic
proficiency so we're trying to close
this loop you got a kid that's at the
10th percentile you know this this this
this and they should be a lot of
proficiency right creasing lis this is a
control process and then of course
training we know in a variety ways
actually corrects impaired brains you
can look at a brain that's not doing too
well so these are twenty boy and Girl
Scouts earning a merit badge in San
Mateo County and they have their in a
reading task in which they're judging
whether words rhyme or not and these are
these children can all read and this is
an area where II know that what they see
orthographically in the printed text is
associated with what they hear here are
twenty failed readers and you can see
that twenty of twenty lack this response
this area in the lateral frontal cortex
is actually associated with reading
accuracy rec recognition ability and
reading is associated with the just the
strength of activity in this region you
can see that there's little or no
activity in these twenty children here
and now we train the children and what's
seen in this kind of experiment in this
case seventeen of the 20 children
required acquired a response in this
region and you can see a much more
strong and coherent response in this
more anterior region
remember seventeen to twenty is at
twentieth twenty but it's most of the
children that are trained and that's
typically what we see now you can see
this activity in this region it's quite
strong turns out that region is active
in a child it's really initiating just
initiating orthographic to sound
correspondences and we know that in this
early period that area is activated and
then this action basically moves up into
this zone so this is these are children
that are acquiring this skill and
ability and that's confirmed by later
experiments now we've done these
longitudinal brain imaging experiments
using language skills and memory and
attention
on other abilities and we see the same
thing we see a recovery of normal brain
we see the brain correct and children
basically that need the correction so
that leads me to epoch three in which
you are people are users of mastered or
automatic skills and abilities and those
these are healthy people on the decline
just like many of you I see a pup of
people in here that might still be in
the in in before leading this charge and
other people that are well into it like
me okay so if we look at knowledge
knowledge continues to grow in human
individuals until relatively late in
life so here's a placeholder for
knowledge placeholder in this case is
semantics word definitions vocabulary
and you can see that it's continuing to
grow in this this is a big statistical
study of individuals into their our 60s
and then slowly declines and then we
could have other placeholders for
knowledge in which there's pretty much a
continuous growth you have to be around
to accumulate the facts of the world and
the longer you're around the more you
know sorry you younger people that you
just don't know as much as Weald all
people do it's temporary but at this
point we have had the lead but look what
else is happening to it we older people
we have a placeholders for a whole
variety of other abilities the open
circle is reasoning spatial
visualization perceptual speed down
episodic memory down could be a hundred
things that we could measure that are
basically declining from our 20s and 30s
now this is important for older
individuals because in these fundamental
operational abilities that we're really
reflecting the performance
characteristics of our brains and their
dynamics people in their 70s are in the
bottom 20 relative of people in their
20s so this is a big difference right we
don't like this wielder people well why
do we lose it as we grow older well for
one thing your brain is older and as
it's older it's becoming noisier and
noises the enemy of the brain
representing information in a highly
resolved and high-speed way again as a
function of noisy noisy
the brain has to slow down in every
older brain is slowing down in its
operations and thought and the control
of its actions so your body is also
older and the brain is all about
controlling your actions and it's not
helping the fact that your body in fact
in its control is slowing down a third
thing that happens is that older
individuals I spent a lot of earlier
life building up a capacity for
abstraction and in an older age you rely
on that abstraction to get you through
your day you're not very much dealing
with the details anymore and it turns
out to in the details of the
representation of input from the world
of what you see and what you hear is
information in the form that can be
remembered I can create a form of oral
speech by by manipulation by processing
by creating a synthetic form that has no
details in it I can do that just by
creating speech for modulated noises and
when I do that you understand it
perfectly understandable but you can't
remember it I can create another form of
speech in which every time a little
change of variants of the signal comes
in I just splatter a little bit of
energy in that moment it turns out
that's a little harder to for you to
interpret initially but in a few hours
you understand everything and you
remember it because in the translation
of information from the brain it's when
you represent information in the brain
in detail with little moments of
correlated activity that the brain can
actually record it and older brains
don't have much detail they're operating
in levels of abstraction and then the
third reason that declines is that
generally most people are not good
caretakers of this crucial resource so
what do I mean by that well let's take a
simple example let's say that you're a
violin player and you're sitting on some
City Orchestra and you're a professional
violinist that has been acquired the
skill or ability through massy practice
right which is what it takes to be a
professional on this level
you're a master controlling the fingers
and fingering of your hands and
precision and pressures and and timing
your master at translating the trains
orthography of music into those
movements in firming it by precise by
precise hearing you're a master at the
African
accurate listening and you're a master
at translating your emotions and other
aspects of control into your bow hand
and what happens if you stop practicing
well within 2 or 3 or 4 weeks everyone
around you knows that you're not
practicing why isn't Sam practicing
right within a year you're almost
certainly going to lost your position in
the orchestra within 10 years you're
going to be a pretty good violinist but
no sense would you be regarded as a
professional on the other hand if at
that 10 year hiatus I said well Sam you
can recover or Sam decides that he wants
to try to be a professional again we
know he could improve we know he could
reach drive himself back towards that
asymptotic performance probably wouldn't
get so far but could substantially
improve you're not doing the average
person does not understand what it takes
to maintain the function of the brain
near an asymptotic level performance
they let it slide most of the people in
this room are letting it slide that's
the natural attempt to do now one of the
reasons it's sliding is because you're
not learning very much that's truly new
well maybe hear more an occupational
sense more than average but that's truly
new to a very large extent we are still
using those skills and abilities that we
learn long before and we're applying it
together new content and we confuse the
acquisition of content for the
acquisition of new ability in a
fundamental neurological sense so what
aren't we exercising
we're not exercising the machinery that
controls learning itself that vivifies
memory the mandatory control machinery
that underlie the acquisition of all of
the ability that defines us is slowly
dying so how do you be a good tare cater
well you got to eat right got to have
some exercise and you have to have some
social exercise I can see some of that
happening around here over the noon hour
but also it's a good idea to have a
little brain fitness but what is
effective what would you do so one of
the things you've got to address is the
fact that old brains are slowing down so
here we're just looking at the ability
of a brain to operate in time in fast
speed to make a determination in this
case
the task is to identify little piece of
sound and then to recover and identify
second and following success subsequent
time so how often can you do that well a
person in their 20s can commonly do that
on the average about 20 times in a
second and you can see that by the time
you're in your 80s you're down to about
seven times a second so what that
translates to about six to eight samples
per syllable versus about two samples
per syllable that's a big difference in
how the brain is resolving information
in detail in time we see exactly the
same thing in vision older individuals
move their eyes relatively infrequently
a young bright-eyed person is popping
the eyes around
subject of interest and they're
basically taking a series of snapshots
and they're reconstructing what they see
on the basis of that's that series much
sparser encoding occurring in an older
brain and because of that spar seing
differences of sampling rate all the
brains are error prone they're they're
noise sensitive doesn't take much to
disrupt them they have degraded
syntactic or predictive control because
information is coming back in prediction
so slowly that widespread memory or
cognitive deficits they have reduced
processing efficiency and they have
lower learning rates so because
information is recorded in a poor way
they can't record it in memory and
because they're operating at slow speed
their processing efficiency is poor just
like the kid that's struggling in school
it's they can't take in information from
the world with efficiency so most of
what they hear and most of what they see
just goes on by they forget most of what
they see they forget most of what they
hear just like the kids struggling
imagine what difference it would make if
you could double the rates which people
can take in and record and remember
information as in childhood in an older
age so we train these individuals we
have training that targets language
abilities we have training that targets
vision we're working on training the
targets complex thinking we use for
aggressive computer-controlled exercises
again they're game-like but not games
and they're optimized in their
efficiencies to try to drive changes in
brains that are corrective as fast and
efficiently as possible and if we look
at something like the outcomes of brain
fitness exercises this is from
language training program we have big
improvements of processing ability that
reflected by big improvements of memory
and cognition that are reflected by big
improvements of everyday life what is
the magnitude of this improvement well
it turns out that cognitive ability in
older individuals by this training takes
about 40 hours translates to improvement
of your overall cognitive performance by
about 11 years so if you're 70 and
you're trained on the statistical
average you operating cognitively as if
you're 59 we know we can do better than
that
we're almost certain that we can double
or triple that we want the
seven-year-old to be operating like a 30
year old and if we can achieve that then
the young person is going to struggling
keep up with that person with greater
knowledge that's our goal now actually
when you do that you improve processing
speed so how much well before training
people were where they belong in this
large trial they were about 73 years of
age and this is the average speed of
processing in this task and after
they're trained they're in the average
performance ability of a pretty good 20
year old okay now it's how to translate
these improvements more richly into
improvement of every aspect of cognition
cognition that's one of our goals now
similarly we train people in vision and
we see similar effects and one of the
advantages we have in training vision is
that in one of the training components
that we studied a collaborating
scientist from the University of Alabama
at Birmingham has looked now five years
after training these basic skills and we
can therefore know that as consequence
of this training that if you did this
five years before you are more likely to
have sustained your independence about
30% greater probability if you're older
you'd be in better health about $1000 a
year less and your health expenses in
your 70s and your 80s you'd have had
fewer Falls of personal injuries you'd
have had about half as many driving
accidents by sharpening your vision in
this way you'd have about a 30% lower
incidence of pression and so forth so
it's within your it's a good it's a good
a good notion to think about brain
fitness in in adult life not just when
you're older
but in adult life so recommended in
addition to these eating right exercise
and social exercise two little words
it's called a brain gem think about it
think about what you would do what you
could do what you should do think about
it for your mother and father think
about it for some older person aspect
you loved as well as the children that
you know might benefit from this so
we're we also have these other practical
goals they relate to disease and injury
and so forth I'm not going to talk about
them just to say that this is the
beginning of a revolution and the
revolution is about using this
incredible power that resides within the
average human skull to drive the brain
in a useful or corrective direction okay
highly underutilized highly
underutilized in medicine this will be
medicine and it will be medicine that's
much more sophisticated much more useful
than the current media axe
pharmacological approaches to all of our
mental and neurological and psychiatric
problems
it'll be a part of it so finally why is
this science important for you and for
Google well access to customized
information and richly loading brains
with it is a key part of the modern
world story that's your part you're in
the and other great players that have
created this incredible revolution in
the Information Age but there's a second
key part and the second part is our
capacity to improve brain power we have
the capacity to make much more out of
brains individual brains and
collectively out of how the brain says
that would reflect modern societies the
writing the culture the capacity applies
to brains that get off to a bad start
millions of brains get off to a good
start
most of those most of those bad starts
can be overcome substantially overcome
the brains that run into trouble well
many disasters ways brain in trouble we
now believe and have increasing evidence
can actually be prevented by
strengthening their operations or their
devastating expressions can be sometimes
reverse or substantially ameliorated and
then ranges get older but brains can be
successfully rejuvenated and we're
entering the area era of a personal
theory of evolution
in which we understand that in a sense
because what we are is a product of
where we've been and it's completely
under our control it's not a handoff you
were not given the person that you are
from some outside agent it was created
in your lifetime by what you did it is
your personal responsibility you are the
Shepherd of that flock you're the
custodian and understanding that
understanding that self-improvement
it means improvement of your brain and
understanding how to go about that and
do that contributing powerfully to the
growth of personhood I'm almost done
we're living in an area era of almost
completely undisciplined cultural
challenges to the maintenance of your
brain and brain health and you can ask
yourself on the basis of what we
understand about this now how is Google
good for you good for your brain and how
might it not be good for your brain and
how could you think about the interplay
between what could be positive and
negative and assure that it's all
positive and finally good Google's
contribution to society societal advance
be further amplified by contributing to
the advance of the science assigning
it's deliberate out to the billions of
individuals who could benefit from it
and the answer is of course duh right so
a fit brain is an invaluable human asset
almost everyone can have one the
effectiveness of Google's tools for
changing the world for the better are
limited by how fit brains are you know
that but fortunately that's a greatly
expand scible human resource and we're
working on it we're doing our best we're
piddling in scope but by Dan we're
trying hard and I propose that we
discover ways to work together to
improve human brain power and the
elaborate sources of individualized
innovation information that that think
people like you can provide to guide and
shape the richest possible forms of
personalized growth because that's
really what it's all about I think we're
in a transformative period in human
history in which we're going to marry
understanding how to basically get the
most out of every individual life and I
think we both have important roles to
plan that thank
Thank You dr. McKeon tonight and for
those of you've been generous to stick
around thank you and we can still take
questions yes thank you for your
presentation my name is Ron Hughes and I
work for Google I have two questions
first of all I need to mention I used to
be smart and I'm 51 years old started
gaining weight
my doctor cared and about three months
of guys diagnosed with sleep apnea so I
getting sleep I'm getting treatment for
my sleep apnea and I'm getting smarter
again have you got something that can
help me accelerate that process I think
that you could probably benefit from
this kind of form of intensive training
because you probably have had some
diffuse losses and you want to make the
most out of the sort of high performance
characteristics of your brain so you'd
probably benefit by being trained using
these adult training programs if you
write me an email message you know I
might just send them to you okay my
second question is do you know if these
tools that you can provide you know if
they're covered by Google's medical
insurance I have no idea I know if not
it doesn't really matter if not raise
hell thank you very much uh hi thank you
for that fascinating presentation
are there any everyday hobbies that we
could perform that would go kind of like
the software the yeah that's a great
question
I mean there and but it's complicated
because some things that you probably do
so for example are some aspects of video
game usage in performance we commonly
use video games as controls and you know
we we have big effects against video
games but there's some aspects of video
game for performance that requires high
speed advanced high speed and high
accuracy performance that are
progressive that have value more than
that you know I I strongly recommend
that people take up activities that
engage their brain relatively richly
from a perceptual to it to a complex
cognitive level now what kind of thing
would you do to do that take up a
musical instrument
really try to master a complex killer
ability like that that has an
orthography a reading aspect it has a it
has a listening aspect it has a
performance aspect it relates to refined
movement control learn another language
learning another language is another
very rich elaborate kind of behavior
that engages the brain in every level
now find your own find your own
behaviors like that that involve some
aspect of the control of sensory
feedback to guide action that leakin
that have an aspect of complex
operational control you know and that's
what the second thing I recommend is is
that you don't get too far removed from
physical reality you know when you
operate as a young brain when you
develop all of these skills and
abilities you were connected to the
flowers in the soil and the dirt in the
details when you learn to read it was
all about the details right it was all
about learning your letters and then
associating the letters in their simple
rhyming in other word forms and learning
or by chemistry and then pretty soon
you're looking at big abstract bodies of
text and you're only going to the
details when you need to back check and
guess what you remember you remember
when you look at the details so you can
always operate in life by opening your
eyes again and actually looking about
what's between you when you go from A to
B as opposed to being in never-never
land actually the truth is I moved
across the street from my laboratory at
the university because my wife was
deadly afraid that I would kill somebody
if I drove on my car every day because
I'm always I never never land
but I'm nonetheless I can give this
advice pay attention to the details of
life again right be an accurate listener
be an accurate observer you know
basically being active be active in the
way you use your vision to take in
information in the world so when you say
you're in never-never-land do you mean
like your daydream EULA's yeah I am I am
I am I'm mr. spaced out you know
abstracted scientist so I say these but
I work it I work at it so I've been
trying to recover
the immediacy of life and interactions
with the world myself yeah as a habit I
personally daydream a lot too so is that
something I should yeah yeah well you're
that's wonderful exercise and that's
another level of exercise for your brain
because that that's you're actually in a
sense by going through those mental
rehearsals and those cycles the brain is
plastic just like it's plastic if you're
actually acting in the world but bring
yourself back to reality when you're in
reality and try to try to smell a flower
again that's what I that's what I
suggest and also what would you
recommend for parents or yourself like
to teach our children and help them
develop it well these same kinds of
things I think that many times parents
need assistance they need an intense
efficient course of training the kind of
training that can be provided by
software like this so you know it's just
not I've had every roller relative in my
extended family use it and every one of
them has said that it's helped them so
you know I mean basically you can drive
the brain relatively rapidly in a
corrected direction and for many older
individuals is going to be corrective my
mother-in-law at the point that she
initiated training was at the 5th
percentile in cognitive illness she was
identified as mildly cognitive pairing
and she had a wonderful result she was
actually driven to the 60th percentile
on cognitive performance for age totally
different person it can be fabulously
powerful as a rescuing strategy that
doesn't happen in most people most
people don't have changes of that
magnitude but but almost everyone is
stronger and has has more of it as
moving into a safer position relative to
real problems or the loss of
Independence and so forth so thank you
you bet I done your fold again um I had
a question as with many medical advances
your focus initially seems to be on
raising the performance of individuals
with drastically reduced perform right
have you tried this on average or above
Andrews average and yeah actually we're
doing that now in fact we're running a
study now in a school district in
Kentucky or someplace in which we're
trying to determine how children do on
their SAT scores I'm not really sure
what the outcome is what we anticipate
that they will be better because we
actually look at children toward the top
of the districts now some school
districts change every era ket and you
see you see benefits across the board
the biggest benefits are children that
sit on the low side of the distribution
but even a child that sits let's say at
the 80th % 4th percentile of standard
deviation
median you know if you look at 5060 kids
there's significant effect about point 5
point sixth of a standard deviation so
they moved up into the 90s somewhere
right okay so we know that we can impact
children all across the distribution
everybody at skills that are important
to them can be better everybody we're
all improvable thank you hi I had a few
points I wanted to ask you said that the
brain continues to learn even until the
end of life oh no towards the end of
life it slows down its learning so
you're saying is it is possible to teach
an old dog new tricks it's just a little
harder right second second question by
the way one of the problems that older
people struggle to learn is because the
learning machinery is down regulated but
the first thing you can do is to up
regulate it how would you do that
well if you aggressively and re-engage
the brain in learning that machinery
actually has trophic factors that has
factors that control its health and
status and you can absolutely actually
up regulate it again so you can actually
increase learning rates by engaging the
brain initially in ways that effectively
accomplish that and that's part of what
we built into the training we're not
just training these elemental skills and
abilities that would make you a more
accurate receiver of information we're
actually trying to change the learning
power of the Noldor brain because we
know that that's part of driving
successfully to correct itself my second
question was on one of your slides you
said it's possible to change a learned
behaviors right I think I read somewhere
that some researchers were trying to
work with for example sex offenders or
pedophiles that had learned a behavior
that I were trying to relearn to prevent
that do you believe that it's possible
to remove behaviors that the brain has
already learned absolutely and they're
increasingly compelling examples of it
that relate to things like obsessions or
phobias the sex offenders are
particularly difficult because that's a
particularly deeply embedded very
powerfully rewarded behavior from the
brains perspective so that's a tough nut
but there are people that are that are
trying to address that challenge and I
think that are making progress on that
arena so I think we're going to see a
much more I think this is going to apply
to the treatment of prisoners in
and actually scientific learning has
trained a lot of incarcerated youth in
ways that are improving their lot and
and so forth so we're going to see more
and more inroads into this this sort of
these these sort of applications and
uses I had a third point but I forgot
what it was yeah oh thank you doctor I'm
finished hi my name is Petra I'm a
doctoral student at MIT so I have two
questions as well the first one is you
have a loaded so far basically the
exercises that these people do to
improve their skills are sort of like
more immediate let me see
you didn't say this but let's say
pseudocode is like a game each type
things and my question is a
comparatively sort of is deep
mathematical thinking more like what's
the marginal contribution of deep
thinking compared to this right again
like yeah that's a wonderful question in
an exercise like Sudoku it's any
exercise like that is useful especially
if it's on newly you know in the period
in which you're acquiring the ability to
follow the simple rules that relate to
it and of course the main thing that
you're acquiring by such exercise is the
mastery of sadaqa all right doesn't
really translate to any significant
generalized benefit and really what
you're trying to do the question is what
generalized benefit are you seeking now
if you were seeking improvements in
something like deep reasoning or deep
linking in a sense the strategies have
to eat to evolve first of all the two
aspects that one is what are the
fundamental resources you need to
support that so there comes a foundation
of the manipulation of information below
that that has to be in place before you
can ever be you can be powered it's like
you say I can't make complex
combinations of information in order to
solve complicated problems in anything
unless I'm a good receipt and accurate
receiver of information unless I
received it then I can begin to
manipulate it so you're basically saying
that and but let me finish and then in
the deep thinking aspects itself those
the rehearsals that you have in your
mind as you're going through the
manipulation of these of symbols and
conceptions in your mind that's learning
that's plasticity okay right just as if
you are up the brain was operating on
something delivered extrinsically to
make a decision about it it's the same
except now it's internalized but it's
the same process there's nothing
serious about it's the same process and
of course you have to exercise it
sure so the second question is basically
from the brief examples that you
mentioned it sounded like what you give
to these children is the motivation to
do the work not so much because
everybody can sit down and solve
problems but most people find it
pointless so they choose not to actually
that's not right well but you can look
at their operations for example in fast
time and you can see that they're
operating within these neurological
processes with time constants that are
very long they're about an order of
magnitude longer if they're
substantially impaired from a
high-performing individuals and they're
their whole brain is operating by
processing information with those sort
of integration and successive signal
processing times you have to you have to
basically drive the brain you have to
Ratchet it over slowly so that basically
can operate at high speed in high
accuracy and that basically takes
intensive progressive directed training
it takes 15 20 hours of intensive
training and then you have to ensure
that those elemental processing
abilities generalize to the actual
operations on orally receive speech for
example and so it's complicated
you cannot drive the brain to make these
Corrections without substantial
aggressive intervention okay and it has
to be of a specific form okay thank you
right hi and I have a question that
might reword a little bit the last two
questions and formulate my own you
talked about limitations in some of the
children that you talk to I think it was
Billy um some of those limitations are
emotional right in basis you know shut
up Billy now sure how does this work
how's this work limited by emotion and
how does it address emotional factors
well it doesn't address them on the
level that it could and it's it's and
when you come into these complex issues
of correcting behavior since this it's
especially young school-aged children
this is dicey but one of the things that
does do for Billy is it helps Billy
reconstruct a positive self confidence
about their operations in language so
you know you can you can think of it
this way Billy every day comes on to
this exercise and four or five hundred
times in an hour he gets the answers
right and he's rewarded as positive
right everything about it is constructed
to rebuild Billy's confidence in the
operations and language and it does do
that it does do that so in that sense
now Billy looks at language not as an
enemy but as a you know as representing
positive force in his life when you see
the transformation in a kid that can't
read and you carry the kid through a
relatively narrow window of time two
three four months and now you have a kid
that can read you know in in the average
benefit for children of a high school
age in reading by going through this
this simple training investing 15 20 25
30 35 hours the average improvement is
is somewhere between two and three years
in reading ability in reading age and
you see a kid that suddenly can read
transformation is fabulous from the
point of view of their that how they
look at themselves they've been blaming
themselves as a failure for all this for
their entire life now suddenly the world
is open to them and that's an incredibly
powerful compensation compensatory thing
for these children emotionally now you
can't correct every s finally we are
dealing with people have wounded
emotional constructs for example
schizophrenic
a life of wounding very little social
socialization very little social control
it's amazing how well we can
re-establish that my intensive computer
guided training you don't have to
overcome some emotional barrier first to
get there well absolutely but one of the
things about computers and about this
this sort of technology approach is that
it's acceptable to a child let me give
you a simple example if I have a kid in
in school and the kid is asked to read
and the kid can't read the kid is
traumatized they'll do anything not to
be called on on the other hand if I just
have a computer that's listening to them
which scientific learning that has and
it's evaluating the accuracy of their
reading and and when they're interacting
with the computer and the computer is
fundamentally supportive it's completely
different they want to read right it
completely changes the way in which they
think about learning reading school
trying hard all of those things are
completely changed a lot of this can be
changed and you're really advantaged in
a lot of ways by
taking it out of the hands of somebody
that's going to look in the eye and say
you're not doing it well I'm
disappointed with you and into the hands
of a computer whose basic attitude can
never be can always be in a sense hidden
always be good I'm sorry I have you
thought of partnering with maybe an
emotional based therapy to make it maybe
even more progress with we have I mean
we are now trying to actually construct
social social control emotional control
programs we imagine that and we imagine
all kinds of uses for that that relate
to people that are struggling and from
but probably primarily initially
targeting adults because of the
sensitivity of trying to manipulate the
attitudes of children right thank you
very much we we seem to have a line that
keeps growing so dr. Marisnick like how
do you feel for a couple more questions
I'll take any you know okay I know
whatever hi doctor thank you for the
presentation my name is Mark Jaffe and
fairly recent Google employee but also
involved with a non-profit locally
caught which is providing support for
people with attention and learning
differences and I'm wondering if you've
had much success with treating ADHD or
done that um but dyslexia yeah well
we've trained I'm not sure how many
children that would be formally counted
as dyslexic probably a couple hundred
thousand and we have outstanding
outcomes most of those children acquire
reading ability and and most of those
children in time require
age at age level or or above level level
of reading we've looked at the we
there's a recent study that's published
by a scientist from the University of
Oregon that's looked at the attentional
impacts of this training and the
neurological responses and intentional
control behaviors of children are
substantially restored not in every way
we restored substantially restored by
this class of of accurate listening
training again and and and so you know
this this in the terms of the elaborate
problems that plague children that limit
their learning is still a work in
progress at posit science
I've actually been discussing ways to
elaborate and complete the attentionally
potential training that would make that
attentional training in children or
adults still more powerful so these are
but we have big offense brain actually
come a poorly attending child an ADHD
child when they're trained looks like
it's above normal
it's a pest potential tensional control
abilities and actually they leapfrog
children that are not trained that are
normal not intentionally player controls
then we train those children as controls
and those children are buck up to a high
still higher attentional control level
and so forth so you're going to see more
and more of this intensive brain science
guided training brain plasticity based
training to drive these kind of
improvements in child populations and
dull populations you know what and
another quick question is have you seen
have you been working in any treatments
for addictive behavior like stopping
smoking only only in thought I mean we
we've met with psychiatrists that are
dealing with a variety of obsessions
compulsions addictions and so forth so
we we know we have things that are
operating in the background in a more of
a fundamental research aspect but we
don't really have anything that we
develop that we would that we have
assured benefits that we would promise
anybody or practice but that's certainly
an interest thank you
abstraction
um I think like perfect pitch is
something that we've abstracted out
right where do you feel the appropriate
level of abstraction lies and you
sounded like you were saying go back to
the roots go down to the low level right
in from the senses but you need
abstraction for hyland away perfect
pitches on abstraction and the way it's
not people now find that people with
perfect pitch actually have constructed
a relationship between musical notation
and sound representation that's in the
region not far from the region in which
you're making these associations between
word sounds and their letter
representations so actually people that
don't have perfect pitch can't have not
made that construction so that you you
basically are able to create a valid and
relatively accurate relation
relationship identity between these two
things musical notation and sound so it
so that's not an abstraction exactly in
that's a that's a correlation based
integration of activities you could say
I mean it seems like like the low level
like hearing API has get pitch and not
everyone involves that right yeah well
let me answer your question in another
way it's all abstraction you know
there's nothing real about the
activities in your brain right in a
sense it's all symbolic right but it's a
matter of how far you are away from the
immediate interpretation of the
immediate representation of the details
of what's coming in you can say in your
operations so I can when I take in
information to detail the brain is also
by correlation creating abstract
representations of exactly the same
thing that are reduced right and it's in
when you're older you're relying on that
second level did that detail us
construction that's been created by this
massive correlation that's occurred
across earlier life and so forth and you
know you go from a situation in which
you're really connected with the world
you're really connected with physical
reality how often how many hours in your
day are you really connected to physical
reality
not many yeah there you are that's
that's what I'm trying to say hi dr.
Mertz image thank you so much for coming
and sharing your knowledge um my
questions about kind of breadth depth
and diversity or variety of activities
for brain fitness is it better if you
want to increase your overall kind of
brain fitness is it better to or is
there a difference in doing a new
activity or learning a new activity
versus doing an activity that you're
already good at you're still like for
instance the example of deep thinking
and mathematical problem solving and
there's still a challenge but it's not a
new activity right um and kind of relate
it to that what if you do a lot of
different activities you're kind of
learning a language you're picking up a
new sport you're doing a lot of
activities but you're not necessarily
going deep in there right
yeah that's those are great questions
first of all the only time you actually
change a brain is when it's serious to
the brain itself so you can train a
monkey on a task with experiments that
we've done historically that's easy for
the monkey to solve monkey bay
basically can do it automatically
relatively quickly or you can train a
monkey to accomplish the same goal but
it's difficult hard as hell in the
latter case you see big changes in the
brain a former case you see none right
has to really matter to the brain and in
a sense it has to be serious from a
brain matter meaning that it's it's
challenging or matter in a sense of like
well it is your the monetary machinery
in the brain is is is controlled by the
focus of your attention by aspects that
you interpret under which motivation so
the actual power of the neuromodulators
that drive change that enable change are
determined by how serious it is from
these perspectives and so and that
that's reflected by the release of the
chemical neuromodulators that are a
function of how serious it is now you
ask is it is it important that you work
on behaviors that you've already
mastered in a sense as long as you work
on the cutting edge as long as it
matters the extent to which your your
operations are in problem solving are
can be done almost on automatic pilot
it's not very useful the extent to which
you're challenging yourself to
continually drive yourself to the limits
of your ability that's useful right so
that's equivalent to any again you're
driving the brain progressively to
refine its operations you're driving
changes in your brain when you do that
and then of course one of the important
things is that you can ask the simple
question what will go wrong as I get
older in the brain across my operations
and the answer is everything well so if
I think about from the point of view of
brain health what do I have to be what I
have to think about keeping in good
stead answers everything right so I
could train you to be come an accurate
listener let's say and I could look at
the improvements in your vision and
they'd be modest I could look at your
improvements in how complexly you're
manipulating information and thought and
they would be modest but if I trained
you in all three they'd be powerful and
I'd see synergistic relationships
between those benefits so think about
engaging yourself relatively broadly
right and that that's in think about
exercises and a strategy in life that
continues to enrich you relatively
broadly
another real quick question um with
regards to the kind of fitness programs
that have been developed it sounds like
there is performance feedback and if
you're by you know bottom 5% or top 6%
um
do the people who use this anecdotally
do they can they do they sense it do
they do they actually see in their daily
lives like my memory call has gone up I
said that in one of my slides they do
see that their impacts in their quality
of life that they almost always describe
in the terms of their how well they
remember you know who they remember that
the last party they're at or you know
how well they did at the grocery store I
mean all of these things that relate to
the quality of life operations I feel
more confident I'm doing things I could
do much time going back and started
flying my plane again all of these
things that relate to obvious real world
quality of life impacts your mall
you must always see that described in
terms of the individual operational
specializations and and in things that
people are really are at the center of
their life in their life's interests are
usually expressed in those terms thank
you I have a question from the
perspective or maybe right designers or
developers so for those brain exercises
as those ones I mean just to reduce to
be in your talk
so like user is a very different for
each other they have like different age
and very different style of life style
so how much do you need to know about
the user like the gender the age and to
design access successful strategies
fully prove their mind yeah that's
that's a good question and and it's a
continual challenge it's it's it's a
challenge to make a universal program so
that every child will like not so much
the difficulty is not so great with six
year olds but it's certainly greater for
for sixteen year olds and it becomes
differentiated across human cultures as
you know yeah that's right and so you
know we do the best we can we make
programs that are designed to be
universal and universally appealing we
use the models the best models that come
from the world not just the US and we're
trying to make them not be identified as
specifically American or specifically
American school and the same with adult
programs but you know by the time you're
60 or 70 or 80 you're
any strongly differentiated right and
men and women have quite different sets
of things that are really appealing to
them and so forth so it's it's a it's a
real challenge to make one site size
fits all exercises and you know we Lent
we lean heavily on the gaming industry
you could say in the kind of games we
know are the most universally addictive
or useful and then we try to make them
not games but convert it into our
training exercise kind of formats so but
it's never entirely successful and I
think what's going to happen in the
future is that these will be more and
more richly differentiated and and with
more and more complex consideration for
what someone in Tokyo would like or
someone in in in London would like
versus someone in Palo Alto yeah you
mentioned in passing the effect of like
brain injury such as chemotherapy or
like chemo brain right how this can have
an effect on that right um is it similar
to the kind of training that you do on
older adults yeah in like progressive
aging and do you see results better
immediately after chemotherapy then like
five years out or ten years out right
it's a good question actually when you
poison the brain which is what chemo
chemotherapy does for a while
you have very widespread losses and the
brain is becoming noisier and it's
having the problems with resolving
signal and it always it does this it
makes the same adjustment over and over
again what has problems with signal in
noise conditions it just changes its
time constants so if you just look in
such individuals you see that it's made
these natural adjustments and so it's
representing information less completely
again and so it turns out that that's
something that you can almost always
possibly manipulate now in order to
speed it up again you have to ensure
that you've you're you're maintaining
accuracy so the training has to be has
to be designed to assure that in
whatever domain you're operating in
you're improving accuracy of speed but
when you do that you see the same kind
of memory and coggan
that you see in a kid population or in a
senior population right now because the
injury is relatively diffuse it's
commonly the losses are relatively
widespread so there's a lot to train to
really be back to tip-top shape again
but but we found that we can pretty much
recover a person that has substantial
losses from chemo-brain this is this is
research being done at UCSF okay and
again there's big quality of life
benefits from it so we I think this is
going to be part of the routine
treatment of people that have these kind
of brain injuries we see the same thing
of people have infected brains Lyme
disease would be an example where brain
infection can occur West Nile virus is
another AIDS is the most probably most
common ultimately aids dementia comes
from the infection of the of the AIDS
virus in the brain again the same thing
we can see substantial improvements of
performance in such brains again because
there's very diffused damage and we see
the same thing and individuals from Iraq
that have been in the presence of ie D
explosions which actually create bubbles
in the brain creates diffuse damage so
there's there there are common ways that
you'd approach these conditions there
also some things that are special about
each one of them okay thank you we're
going to stop it there for ignite
questions but please feel free to come
up for some informal discussion and
thank you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
