I work in University of Cape Town South
Africa and in the computer science
department they are doing HCI type stuff
I've been there for eight years so if
you're interested the accent is Irish
not South African he's genuinely South
African and most of my work revolves
around mobiles because there are
Mobile's everywhere absolutely
everywhere and they crop up in different
forms in tines do you know about these
containers that people have so what
happens is any old containers off
lorries and stuff the kid a mite with
cell phones that are shared usage so
that's what it looks like inside and so
these are different because these are
cell phones that are used by any
arbitrary person as opposed to you know
your own person so different people have
different experiences of the cellular
network so that is actually the cellular
handset the multiplex into the cellular
network so so although it looks like a
landline it is actually and if you go in
on these booths there are numbers
written up and an important stuff so it
says since I a weird ecology and these
have been so popular because you cannot
steal handsets out of a solid metal
container usually that the cell phone
companies themselves so this is one of
the networks LC are making these
containers and I started I is kind of a
an ad hoc McIver kind of solution but
now it's got real traction and these
guys rush into townships look there you
go there's your communication and they
run back out again but what's
interesting to me as a pretend
ethnographer so i should say I'm a
computer science originally but I've
kind of seen the light since then is I
know let's find my career's over anyway
is what grows up in the townships these
cell centers become like a focal point
and you get all these funny little
businesses starting up so this is India
kessell repairs with very interesting
spelling of words and so forth see there
and then there are people selling fruit
and this becomes like a central point
for for the neighborhood and this I took
these shots oh is that bad so I took
these shots at the start of my
sabbatical which was in the second half
of last year so these are taken in you
fiddle okay so these are rural sorry
urban usage and then I went spent a
couple of months going through Zambia
and Malawi so Zambia Malawi are two of
the 10-person nations on earth but I was
hearing all sorts of stories up by cell
phone usage so I don't know if you can
see these are actually zebra zebra done
here in the grass everywhere you go
their cell phones to recap quickly
seventy-seven percent of South Africans
have cell phones yet only eleven percent
of South Africans earn enough income to
be liable for income tax all right so
that that's kind of startling so
that's active usage I met a lot of
people but they don't always have enough
credit okay talk about that in a minute
so so they're not a monthly plans no no
no one's a monthly friends they're all
pain is we're going in the another
common theory is it the stories you're
telling are very consistent lots of the
third world that I've been in two I've
been in two example Carson Caribbean
exactly similar you see an unemployed
guy with two cell phones on his bone
yeah so there is this all of this shared
usage as well these telephone bureaus
this is Malawi where they just take over
an old shack and put in the cell phones
and get a battery this particular
village is no electricity so the guy
puts the car battery on the backwards
bicycle wheels off gets a charge comes
back people bring in their cell phones
and yeah it's Batman I'm a weird thing
and this company cell pal besides the
the containers being dropped in they
can't afford to do that in Zambia they
build these little shacks where you can
go and buy airtime or it's kind of a
less organized affair I don't know I can
understand how you go here and call
summer
if the UH nutrition is in the same
economic statuses you are how do you
know how to call them they're new to one
of these things oh yes the that's right
okay I take your point there there is
that but so what most people as Olga
said have their cell phone for is
receiving calls and I'll talk a little
bit more about that which sounds like an
oxymoron but it's not really just we
have a different economic model that's
precisely so everyone has a phone in
fact in South Africa there have been 80
million phones sold and there are 40
million people living there so there's
been two phones sold for every member of
population which is why the
seventy-seven percent statistic is
important that though seventy-seven
percent are active they're making
receiving calls what's happening well
Robin a lot of people have them for work
this is a farm building way out in the
middle of nowhere so the farmer can
phone up his workers and check that
they're working and so a lot of people
get given phones for work and then if
they can save up a little money they'll
use them for their own private reasons
also for a lot of people the only thing
the only piece of technology they can
afford is a handset which means that I
get used for everything this is a nice
lady filling up my bike the reversal and
riding bikes at this point and she used
a calculator to add up to tally up what
we owed you go to the bank everyone has
their cell phone on a lanyard is doing
the sums that can't afford a calculator
and the cell phone that's just unheard
of want an abandoned calculator no it's
not but you can only afford one thing ok
the cell phones much more useful because
if you buy one of these for example it's
got a torch built in as well so you
don't need to buy a torch either and
besides all the communication the
communication is very important if
there's a view who work I in my talk I
talked about kind of itinerant working
and families are torn apart because the
husband's on the mine and then his wife
can SMS so they're they're very
important social tools when I was in
Zambia I saw someone get a phone call on
the cell blah blah blah blah blah blah
hang up take the phone apart put in a
new sim card reassemble it make a call
blah blah blah blah blah take it apart
again put the original sim card back in
and I got into this and I discovered
their three networks with slightly
different tariff structures now you and
I for the sake of a couple of cents
they're not going to stand there with
five minutes for a phone to reboot but
for these guys that was a crucial
difference and to the point that you
know some people who run businesses
they've actually got three phones
because they can't be bothered juggling
but it's cheaper to have three phones
and you know work out which tariff is
going to be and all this is denominated
in u.s. dollars none of these cell phone
companies are interested in learning
earning local currency it's a little bit
be earning in dollars so it is quite a
price sensitivity and as I said if a
cell phones all you've got then how you
use it is very different so how many of
you got camera phones most of you what
if that was the only camera you had in
your life there's no downloading there
is no backing up your whole life you put
your wedding photos on your camera and
your camera phone that's the only place
they're going to be kept right so if you
do that it fundamentally changes the way
you feel about your camera phone and so
guys that you talked to Andrew was
talking about this earlier today when
you go and meet someone they come and
they have a collection of photographs
already on their phone it's like a
PowerPoint presentation of their life
now when you're chatting to them they
get it out and they take you through
it's quite a deliberate act and because
of the limited storage they think very
carefully about which images they keep
in which they discard and so I'll show
you in a minute or two some of the
Jax we've done a rundown so there's the
kind of upbeat stories couple of lots of
good stories this is the Cacambo
business center and is the border
between Angola and Zambia and it's run
by this guy called roi and roi is having
trouble because the cell phone companies
opened up two months ago and he runs an
internet cafe and his internet cafe has
had no customers in two months and it is
not that the people are accessing the
internet through their phone which they
are to some extent it's the fact that
all the spare cash in this economy is
not going on our time so the grocer's
shop is shutting down the clothes shop
is shutting down now obviously this is a
novel effect right obviously people
can't go on without shoes well actually
they can and close but it'll be
interesting to see at what point if ever
the businesses the other businesses pick
up and this is in a tropical area so you
can grow pretty much anything you want
to eat so you don't need to shop for
food and so these cell phone companies
are hoovering up and so cell phones are
killing the internet the other story
that I hear a lot about cell phone usage
in Africa is hired as helping
subsistence farmers have you any of you
guys come across the story about hi like
the fisherman there I to catch the fish
and they phone up the markets and then
they go to the market that will give and
everyone feels nice and warm inside oh
I'm glad to be part of Technology wow I
spoke to some of these guys on Lake
Malawi and they just laughed like Oh
what call the market says look these
fish aren't worth the value of a phone
call and and besides why would I go to
that market all my friends are at this
market I don't to go to that markup for
a couple of cents pointless I'll go and
see my friends I have a good time have a
few bears does he think yeah you're
right actually if your subsistence
farmer would so I poked around a little
and it turns out yet there are such
systems for farmers
but it's for commercial farmers if you
have you know umpteen acres of coffee
beans you can subscribe to the National
Farmers Union and find out which country
you should export your beans too but
that's not really the stories that I was
told about / little subsistence one-man
farmers so I think there's a lot of
disentangling of what's actually
happening and what the companies would
like you to believe is happening up
there the other thing is buying phones
in the developing world do have any of
you seen this handset before this is the
new motorola handset designed for the
developing world and it's fantastic it's
really good it uses e ink for the screen
uses little pirates got two antenna in
it so you don't have to be close to a
base station but I tell you nine no one
is going to buy it right why would you
buy a handset and at poor people so if
the only thing you can buy in your life
is this one piece of technology you're
not going to aspire to the you know the
the crippled handset for poor people I
mean these guys are just the same as us
there's no difference the same thing
happened with Siemens in Europe a few
years ago when they launched a film for
old people right there are big buttons
in the screen this is what all people
want right so they don't have to put the
glasses on to read the screen but nobody
bought it because would you goody yes
that's the phone for me crusty old
person phone give me a 40 free cardigan
yes yes so so they really remarketed it
actually is the big button phone and
they sold lots of answers but it's the
same mentality yeah and so if you go to
a cell phone shop in Africa what you buy
are not cellphones but batteries think
about it all your old handsets are
getting stolen or traded in or whatever
but they end up in Africa and the first
thing you're going to need is a new
battery because the batteries are dad so
you going to cell phone shop
there are no no actual handsets for sale
so this is a battery for a siemens there
comes with a 14 months guarantee which
is misspelled but natori guarantee now
if you imagine when you go in these
shops there are thousands of batteries
right so how do you choose well
obviously one with a 12 month guarantee
is not as good as one with a 14 month
guarantee even though there's no address
or if this thing blows up and takes your
head off there's no one to sue there's
no address you start look at the
packaging there's a little tin foil
hexagon stuck on here to emulate a
hologram right it's kind of cargo cult
but my favorite bit is the free plastic
cigarette right the other major brand
gives away free pens but pans are not
could look at this guy you can see
rundas nak here he is wearing his
plastic cigarette with pride so for some
reason I mean it took me along while the
figure the port was going on but it just
so happens that in Zambia at the moment
it is really cool to have a plastic
cigarette and so people were buying
these batteries the other thing to
notice is here is a hands-free kit need
by the Bluetooth company no it is not
bluetooth there are big cables in here
and it is for your for your naki n ok I
3172 10 etc which is a good mitt for a
mobile phone it's hidden no it's
manufactured in China and these are the
local importers have made this box for
up but if you said knit ma te with the
Zambian accent it would sound like Mitt
good Mickey and I finally of course if
you can afford the battery and you've
little spare cash you would want a new
hopes all right back up the end well
then look at the packaging here for the
cases right you want a new case because
your phone scuffed
it's all white people because again it's
an aspirational thing yeah I'm sorry but
this is just higher days in Africa white
people can afford good products
therefore if there is a picture of a
white person using that product it is
good I mean let's not get into the
sociology and the reasons for that it's
terrible but that's how stuffs marketed
but if you look these are look like
scenes from films but they're no films
that I've ever seen and there I
carefully look through all of them
they're not actually taken for films
because that someone might get sued then
so it's constructed to look like people
in movies use these crappy covers for
their cell phones fastly I don't know
what the answer to this is I'm still
kind of rolling around in my head but
they're all sorts of kind of intricate
understandings of the way stuff works
there that just doesn't happen here for
example and so that's where I was at at
the end of my sabbatical these are just
some insights for you to mull over
another thing i thought i'd show you is
just some of the projects that we work
on to give you a feel for the kind of
research that's being done there one of
these is in conjunction with a charity
called cell life which sends out HIV
workers to people who are HIV positive
to assess their needs of drugs and so on
another student who was working with
this charity he would go to a clinic and
he would help the doctors build these
applications for the clinic's nurses to
put on the phone so they could go I'd
ask questions the person you know ask
about lesions and wait and stuff and the
hits and and then the doctor could post
the correct drugs to the patient it was
a very efficient system but my student
realized actually there isn't enough
time in the universe for him to go and
visit all these clinics so he built this
system that allows you to collect allows
nurses and doctors to collect the data
they want they basically draw little
screens and they hit deploy and it
compiles into a technology called wig if
you know this stuff that gets installed
on your SIM card it's a sim application
so doesn't even need Java this is a
standard as it the application cannot be
bigger than something like 4k is crazy
but if you can fit what you need in 4k
it'll sit on the same card in acts
through the menu system in the phone I
don't know in the in the US when you get
a sim card with your service provider
often on your handset there appears and
menu from that service provider have you
seen it this the same technology it says
on the sim and souvenir is built this
thing and it's been given I'd to clinics
the other thing we built is for photo
sharing remember I said about keeping
all your photos and a handset will have
a nice project the sushi how you find
the photographs but we saw guys you know
do you want to see my family and they
pass around their handset so what you're
seeing here on the screen are three
separate screens we did on PDA so you
can see it but the idea is if I want to
show you my photos these are being
broadcast over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to the
other handsets so as I'm describing
what's happening other people can see
and was like pan around and touch things
on the screen or with the five-way
controller that change is being
instantly reflected in other people's
phones not with the PDA version the
student who did this Leo added a little
drawing feature and he thought it would
be fun to not impose any protocol in
other words there's no token passing
anyone can contribute at any time and
what we discovered is people started
drawing mustaches on each other and
playing in oh and the evaluations we did
it with friends because we thought it'd
be useful for for storytelling amongst
friends I'm sure enough these guys loved
it to the point that you know when the
evaluations over thank you very much no
we're not going anywhere we want these
here we need give us back but and so
that was fascinating and why kind of the
reason I'm telling you this is I would
never thought of this if I lived here in
the developed world because I should I
would share my photos / Flickr put them
on the internet everybody can see them
or I put them on my laptop and spend my
laptop run but if
have no laptop and you've no flicker how
are you going to share for those and so
that made us think of a design solution
that's not obvious but yet has relevance
and traction here I think as well if you
could do this I've noticed this myself
if I go out with my friends and we take
photos or something we will sit around
afterwards and show each other the
photographs of the thing that we have
just done together do you do that okay
so that's insane right on one level yes
I know I was there but somehow there is
a kind of bonding around then and so
it's fun to do that I know the project
that Andrew is working on at the moment
is building on this notion of people
having as Dan was saying having cell
phones but no airtime can't afford to
use them and we discovered that people
have an interest in information in their
local area in their village and what
Andrew did was it was built a system
whereby you have a big plasma screen
you've got fun Thanks and if I was
interested in something I would walk up
to the screen and take a photo of what I
wanted and why would you do that well
all this other stuff that we've seen
today it on this where you have a small
phone interacting with a situated screen
requires client software on the phone
right to either recognize visual tagging
or to you know to some link into the
internet but we set ourselves the design
goal of well can you do it with no
client software because the people we're
trying to get to I'm not going to have
you is not like they can download it off
the internet it's not going to work so
what we eventually came up with his a
system whereby you walk up to the screen
and take a photograph now at that point
that the phone usually says do you want
to save this photograph or send it
uhit's and via bluetooth and you send it
to the screen now the good news is if
you want if you have two devices that
want to communicate with Bluetooth
normally you have to pair them right
type in the code have you done this all
right and so but that's not going to
work with six people you okay that's
craziness the other standard solution is
to spam content at people does this
happen in the USA en in London if you
walked on Oxford Street every soften
your phone goes boo boo boo Boop and you
go accept incoming Bluetooth message and
it's some crappy advert right there it
is people but if you sound a photograph
to a display two things happen firstly
the photograph is tagged with the unique
ID of your handset so the system behind
the screen 9 knows who sent think what
the vice anything the second thing you
do is you run image recognition on the
image that's just been sent and there
you can see ah he wants information
about what's happening at the school and
you can push back and V cards or videos
or documents and the person lie has it
on the handset for free no network
connection involve no special client
software as long as you know how to take
a photo with your camera phone you're in
good shape it pushes back to one device
the other great thing is if you take a
photo something that is not on the
screen you can contribute content so you
send it up something the system because
this isn't something I know about okay
so it just creates another little stack
on the screen so let's say you're a
plumber you're no job you up your vCard
onto the screen next person comes our
planner grab that got the v card in the
phone hello so there is this huge
interest in local content and the the
pill sorry little bit earlier in these
projects we involve an NGO called
bridges org who help us understand the
kind of social impact that we're having
with these interventions and they've got
a list here called the real access
criteria and I could talk about those
but I want cuz it'll take all day but
one of them is for any successful
project it must have local content and
so cuz I was coming here today to google
I was thinking well
I think what we need in Africa as Google
village right go with me here people so
this this system I've just described to
you it could be financially viable right
so imagine you've got this big screen
you section off a portion of the screen
to a commercial or the government or
some organization who has a vested
interest who is willing to put money
into getting information to a place even
one of the cell phone companies to buy
airtime off the screen that's a so they
pay for the screen and the pc you hook
it into the network over a little GPRS
card and then the village can upload and
download and create its own local store
of information for that village now I
don't know how to do searching and
retrieving them okay so I know some
people who do in this room so I just
thought you know if you guys Matt you
said you're interested in kind of
getting into this sort of developed did
you maybe didn't leave any surgery yeah
so this kind of developing world like
things I mean this is there's one thing
I think that Google could do very well
if ultimately as a company you guys
wanted to get into into Africa and do
Google village I thought this up two
nights ago I thought it was a good thing
it's been done great my career is over
anyway so that's just some of the thing
about and I don't know if I got okay
well I'll use five more so just some
other projects that we work on which is
we're trying to do internet banking had
this epiphany moment that was telling
people about at lunch time where I saw
someone come up to a street trailer and
say can i buy this thing here and the
trader said yeah sure it's five dollars
and the other guy said can I pay you an
airtime like I said yeah sure and so in
Africa one of the networks MTN is this
me
to you system where you can peer to peer
transfer money as airtime and so the guy
went bbbbb peep and the trigger when
beam up yes there you go and so they
move air time around and I think about
this people have been trying to do am
banking solutions forever and they start
with banks these guys don't have banks
they don't trust banks I don't want to
know about banks because banks means tax
that's no good but it they trust the
network's nice friendly MTN and Vodacom
these people and and there's no new
interface they know how to load our time
they just move in a run down to him and
so 50 Cent's 50 US cents that's how much
an hour and SMS costs yeah it's good si
so you mean you may think this is crazy
but people save up to buy 50 Cent's they
skip a meal save fifty cents and they
can send an SMS to their husband so I
just had this all our time is the new
currency but I for unfortunately I'm not
an economist and so there is an idea I'm
trying to understand I think if you want
to launder money it's a great idea fifty
cents of this planet okay last two
slides wanna education of this crazy
idea about getting rid of computers in
developing world universities because
all the students of cell phones are
ready and computers are such big
complicated expensive things I thought
well if you gotta even if you lease
high-end cell phones to the students
where they can keep all their notes we
built a little system which is what this
thing showing you where if you've got a
laptop with Wi-Fi Bluetooth you Hoover
up a slide deck it pushes at each of the
clients in the room so you've got all
the notes here if you need to work on
the notes or write an essay you take
your cell phone along to the computer
labs there are no computers but there's
a docking station monitor keyboard do
all your stuff because the other big
problem we have is the connectivity our
entire university
of 17,000 students and 5,000 faculty has
a 10 megabyte link right as 22,000 of us
trying to use 10 meg so we want the
students to stop you know looking at
pornography or whatever else is clogging
up so if you had to do all you're
searching through your cell phone you
would only really search for stuff you
actually needed i conjecture so that way
i think would solve a couple of problems
at once but my vice chancellor it just
smiles nice i did gary so but someday I
hope to find someone else bones from
that and then last project though again
Olga interestingly enough when she was
in captain worked with the thing called
the district 6 museum district sex is an
area of kept time that was bulldozed
during a pod height because a white
colored and black people lived there
happily together and the government said
that's not right can't be doing with
that and just moved in flattened the
place so that area is still a field in
the center of Kipling everyone was so
horrified by that act then no one built
on it was just just so wrong so what we
did is we work for the District six
Museum oh we've started to build a
virtual environment of district 6 how it
looked in the sixties from oly old stock
photography in fact based on work down
in Stanford about volumetric
reconstruction from from photographs but
I thought how boring to sit in the
museum mmm so all we did is we got cell
phone or actually we got PDAs and we
stuck GPS receivers on them and tilt
sensors and we built a time machine
right so you can go out to the field and
this little window the screen on the PDA
acts as a peephole back in time because
you've GPS until you can see what was
there at five frames per second and it's
not really kind of fully immersive yet
but you get the idea ok and it's kind of
a nice technology for the future and so
just to finish off I live in Africa it's
a nice place to come and visit and if
any of you are interested
you know I'd be happy to chat to you
about the projects we've got a
conference coming up which is designing
interactive systems and kept on in
February so if any of you enter the the
design side more of interfaces and so on
we'd love your submissions and if any of
you know anyone we'd love some
sponsorship because our chief sponsor
resigned from his company three days ago
and so when I without a sponsor and also
there's this really clever guy called
Matt he wrote a book with if I talk
about a lot of these projects in the
last chapter we wrote Stefan developing
world and so if you're interested in
these kind of developing world aspects
of mobile and that last chapter is
probably good place to start there's
lots of references and so and that is my
30 minutes up I see thank you I'm
keeping track of time so you can just
start talking talk a lot about taking
pictures
holds do people really have advanced
courses I feel a lot of very many lose
there's a lot of basic nokia most the
ones they have bluetooth the camera
phones are starting to come through now
and even the mp3 phones creative
resource efficiency visions for the next
in two years time yeah I mean if you
think we'll be cutting edge stuff right
now today I mean that's like you're
thinking like five six seven years about
the line for Africa some kind of a wolf
work destroyed these events and hope
that in a year or two time do something
vintage camera phones one kind of falls
down to market and then we'll be ready
it was a business that older technology
I'm at this one for a guy here six mp3's
on his phone and he has doomed to listen
to those sex mp3 the rest was like no
Pierre internet in your car that was
intriguing i think intentionally
provocative and it was basically
usability doesn't camp-dependent could
you say a little bit more about why it's
perfect people who weren't there because
i think you made a very interesting
argument for your particular design
problem space yeah and i was intended to
be protected provocative so I said use
abilities irrelevant and my rationale
for saying that is that that's not the
start of the process you need to start
with understanding what people actually
need if you can give them something they
need or adds value to their life they
will figure out how to use it and it's
not like they have a lot of other
distractions and you well that's not
true there are other technological
distractions they've only this one thing
they'll figure it out if it actually is
useful I mean sure they've got to go and
carry water and all these things but
it's not like I don't have time to
figure out the internet and the TV and
the Jolly handset right just of the
handset and one as soon as someone
figures it out there is such a community
of use you know everyone will know how
to do it it's amazing as oh look you
could do this and tell all their friends
and so the usability aspect is not that
relevant unless you want to get
published at Chi
yo justify over that watching people do
mobile applications in the developed
world and people who've commutes have
more time to play around to find the
features that is a different thing it's
not that they're going to put up with
things which aren't usable that they
will invest the times there's almost
like it's fun to spend some time finding
what this application will do and I
think you know we try to build things to
promote that sort of engagement because
it kind of locks them into the
application with ways wrong so I think
again we can learn from its really
nicely to play learning from the
emerging world into our room which is
also allergic did I technologically my
start doing that how do people choose
their phones that they're buying or
something what are the criteria that you
use another day market different people
there is this notion when I was talking
to people that they want a strong hand
SAP now there's no English equivalent to
what they actually mean but by strong
women has got a good battery life it's
sufficiently thick like Matt's razor
here is too thin the people know but if
you have a brick phone like a 5110
eurozone doc is with the first express
off one's home people laugh is terrible
social faux pas so there is I the most
popular handset is there nokia 1100 with
the torch you know this one is black and
white space got a torch on the top it's
got a torch on the top that is a useful
feature if your village is no
electricity was it was really nice to be
unique so the nurses I work with when
working the Hanson i gave them had a
nice color screen so that was really
focus on status item you know Anna had a
camera in sort of archive big family
photos it's like that so you need to
stand out as I suppose I've been wanting
thing so that's interesting point about
prior solution anybody else have
questions and you at some point well I
was actually wondering if people get
into photo sharing would go and then
children advertising downloading
pictures or is it your advance there is
the wealth and care time they might but
for the vast majority of Africa there
are no internet because nowadays new
energy yeah so the cancer so the big
thing I wrong was when someone like
Venus has had their they would have got
very important family photos that
they've taken like oh there there child
that was back on their their sister who
was working somewhere else and they
would sit you down once you admit them
and they would say they would run you
through this little presentation in that
savers of my know my daughter and this
is my sister so my husband was quite an
important thing thank you went to that
motion as a present like downloading our
computers that's a sexual look more
first not yeah I mean you've got it with
you the whole time and when you meet
people you know up comes the phone yet

these stories
