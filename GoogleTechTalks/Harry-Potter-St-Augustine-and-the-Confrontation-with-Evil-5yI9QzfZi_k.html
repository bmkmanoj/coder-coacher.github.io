else Dane who is joining us to discuss
Harry Potter st. Augustine and the
confrontation with evil professor else
Jane among her many accomplishments is a
regular commentator on NPR and is the
Laura Spellman rockefeller professor of
social and political ethics at the
University of Chicago so without further
ado professor else Jane well thank you
very much I'm delighted to be here I
didn't come here for this purpose I'm
actually here because my granddaughter
Joanne will choose right here in the
front had her choice of anywhere to go
in the continental United States for a
short trip with grandma and she said I
want to go to googolplex so that's why
we're here yeah and and word got out
that I was going to be here via John
Trowbridge good friend of ours who is
one of your google people in Chicago so
I agreed to sing for our lunch I guess
by doing this it is very fitting to be
describing Pat Romania at this point I
suppose given that the the excitement
knows no bounds the film opens tonight
at midnight the book is coming out soon
a few years ago when I was at the
library of congress I did some work on
the theme of Harry Potter san agustin
and the question of evil and I thought
that I would bring that up again rethink
it and present some of this to you here
today let me begin historically
Americans historically ordinary
Americans have always been more
comfortable deploying biblical language
than people in many other places mhm
certainly nowadays when the language of
evil and sin and horror and the like has
been banished from the vocabulary of
many elites certainly this is true in
Western Europe it's true of a wide swath
of our own intellectual and professional
elites including many in the Christian
clergy speaking of sin and evil in such
circles invites the suspicion that you
may be too sympathetic to traditional
rule
legend to be trusted it's easier to talk
about syndromes and about sin it's
easier to talk about maladjustment than
about evil because evil seems very
archaic very elemental perhaps too
judgmental now a few years ago friend of
mine smart guy named Andrew Delbanco it
was a literary scholar and historian
wrote a book about the death of Satan in
American culture and he fretted about
the disappearance of this and other
representations of evil and here was his
argument he said without evil we will
abandon any notion of the sacred of that
which should not be violated without
evil it is difficult to articulate what
is good now dubenko argues that a gulf
has opened up in our culture between the
visibility of evil on the one hand and
our intellectual resources for coping
with it on the other the repertoire
vvill has never been richer he writes
but never have our response has been so
weak we have no language for connecting
our inner lives with the horrors that
pass before our eyes in the outer world
how this crisis of incompetents before
evil came about and how it has made
itself felt in the united states is he
proclaims a matter of grave concern and
genuine puzzlement his own mother
Delbanco reports often told him quote
with tears in her eyes that joseph
gurbles who was Hitler's propaganda
minister had been the devil incarnate
now from my own childhood I recall the
hushed conversations carried out in a
low german dialect called plot deutsch
between my grandmother and my mother and
my aunt's Mary and Martha about what had
happened in the old country as my
grandmother called it until the day she
died now what had happened was all too
familiar in twentieth-century political
history the century of mass murder par
excellence
my grandmother and grandfathers people
were a very small insignificant people
and the overall scheme of things a group
called Volga Germans a community of
Germans living in Russia they'd been
brought in by Catherine the Great during
World War two the Volga Germans were
either killed outright or by the tens of
thousands sent into internal exile and
my grandmother never heard from
relatives left behind in the old country
again what was the charge against the
Volga Germans they hadn't done anything
but they were the wrong sort of people
the assumption was that their latent
sympathies would be with the German
invaders and they were a foreign an
alien body sitting amongst Slavic
people's and therefore were not to be
trusted that was enough now del banco
reminds us that these sorts of
confrontations with political evil are
among the basic sources of identity
historically for most Americans for the
simple reason that so many of us or our
families or their families before them
fled from some place to escape such evil
an absent this shared sense of evil he
tells us we are all left without the
moral markers we once depended on for
knowing who and where we are so double
go questions whether American culture
shaped as it has been by shared
experiences of horror and oppression can
long survive as a culture without some
reinvigorated sense of both sin and evil
including of course our own founding sin
of slavery both sin and evil are
important he tells a sin because it
reminds us that we to fall short evil
because it is not just something out
there it is in here and because there is
no other accurate way to name certain
horrific phenomena now as you know the
authors of the Declaration of
Independence
the Constitution are usually called
deists and men of the Enlightenment but
this characterization is terribly
misleading each was keenly aware of what
he took to be God's providential design
each believed it necessary to guard
against human shortcomings and
wickedness by building in a
constitutional structure that for
stalled a temptation to domination this
is james madison's famous discussion of
factions and the need for separation of
powers now Madison was keenly aware of
st. Augustine's libido DOMA nandi or
lust to dominate mmm and it's corrosive
effect on human life and institutions
after all Madison had been a student of
theology at Princeton University the
steady awareness of and preparedness to
check wickedness that men tempted might
succumb to is characteristic of the
temperament of those who crafted our
political structures now all of this
makes enormous sense for evil is central
to Christian theology you cannot
understand mmm Christianity historically
unless you grapple with what theologians
call the theodicy question if God is
both all-powerful and good how did evil
enter the world now we're not going to
settle that question here you'll be
relieved to learn but we need to keep in
mind powerful biblical imagery the
attempt to give a face and a name to
evil for all human beings without
exception must deal with how to protect
themselves and their societies from
those who go over to the dark side
whether the subject is domestic
criminality or international terrorism
excuse me my voice is a bit wobbly
because of the medication i'm taking i
usually don't wobble so I hope I'm
intelligible good the fascinating
struggle of early Christian theologians
with this question helps us to
appreciate what human beings are up to
daily in their confrontations with
temptation
in sin wickedness and evil and with that
let's go to san agustin on the question
of evil and the way this will feed
directly into our discussion of harry
potter now st. augustine's is the most
monumental of all efforts in the history
of Western theology and philosophy to
grapple with a question of evil his
confrontation is so significant because
he rejected the temptation of dualism
and which evil is always externalized
and we the good are always exempt and it
is evil he's talking about not some
behavioral maladjustment now agustín's
argument I think is very difficult for
us to grasp and I want to sneak into it
by using a moment of augustinian ism
from the 20th century from 20th century
political theorist Hana aren't perhaps
some of you have heard of her as a
preface to Augustine himself aren't is
the author of one of the great classics
about totalitarianism a book called the
origins of totalitarianism and she also
covered the trial of Nazi war criminal
Adolf Eichmann for The New Yorker and
wrote a famous book on that called a
human in Jerusalem now there is a rather
brittle exchange that Hana aren't had
with a scholar friend of hers named
Gershom Scholem who was distraught that
aren't had shifted from the notion of
radical evil which she posed at the end
of her grade book on totalitarianism to
the idea of the banality of evil at the
conclusion of her great work on the
Eichmann trial and this is what are
until Sholem about the reason for that
shift you're quite right I changed my
mind and no longer speak of radical evil
it is indeed my opinion now that evil is
never radical that it is only extreme
and it possesses neither depth nor any
demonic dimension it can overgrow and
lay waste the whole world because it
spreads like a fungus on the surface she
goes on to say evil is thought define
because thought tries to reach some
depth to actually go to the roots of
things but the moment it concerns itself
with evil it is frustrated because there
is nothing this is evils venality she
goes on to say only the good has depth
and can be truly radical so let's
consider her words evil is banal it
lacks depth it is a flattening of the
world through a failure to engage it at
its roots it is me he'll it is nihilism
now this formulation reflects San
Agustin long struggle with understanding
sin and evil and it is a story in part
of his struggle with and finally against
metaphysical dualism which in years a
day was championed by a group called the
Manichaeans and the confessions in the
city of god Augustine offers an account
that lays bare his conviction that evil
is not a free-standing active autonomous
principle of its own but is instead a
privation it is a diminution it is
parasitic upon the good it has no
ontological structure of its own
contrary to the view of evil as an
active external force poised eternally
against the principle of good a kind of
polluting force against which good is
passive for Agustin evil loses any
generative power it cannot create if we
take the measure of the theory of evil
that Agustin proffers we can see
something of that flattened wasteland
that hana ahran glimpsed listening to
adolf eichmann at the trial in Jerusalem
as he spouted deadening responsibility
denying cliches more than a thousand
years later now Agustin had been
searching for a world in which perfect
good squares off against perfect evil
such a world would prove handy because
when things go wrong one could blame the
evil principle including by the way
within a Manichean is in one's own body
because the Manicheans believed the body
itself was a source of pollution so you
could do what you wanted with the body
but somehow the spirit remains pure
Agustin tried that out and it didn't
seem to work very well the purity of the
spirit didn't seem to emerge he knew it
was wrong so he kept struggling kept
mulling over the issue and finally hit
him we can no longer claim that it is
not we who sinned and some other nature
that sins within or against us I prefer
to excuse myself he writes and to blame
this unknown thing the truth of course
was that it was my own self my own
impiety had divided me against myself so
from that moment of recognition on
august and understands evil differently
he rejects the notion that God created
evil as a full-fledged malignant
principle engaged in a cosmic struggle
with good and in his mature
understanding evil is stripped of any
glory it is denuded it is depleted evil
becomes the name that we give when we
are implicated in it to an assent to
temptation that may congeal into
thoughtless habituation and a chain of
servitude over time evil is a kind of
non creation a draining away from that
which is good so let's consider then the
picture drawn in his mature theology God
is generative the world God created
including human bodies is
good evil is a falling away from that
good man who has free will is the agent
of this falling away not because the
body is corrupt Paris say but because we
can defile it to file our relations with
others and so on there is no such entity
he tells us in nature as evil evil is a
name for the privation of good evil is
the turning of a limited creature all of
us from the good to ourselves we become
our own principal the sin of pride now
stripping evil of any grandeur is no
small accomplishment it's difficult for
us to grasp if you look at a lot of the
current literature the popular
literature on the Nazis they're often
presented as you know sort of glamorous
evil Demi urges who dared to go where
others hadn't gone before there's a kind
of dark sinister glamour associated with
this that's what agoston was trying to
strip away and aren't a thousand years
later now listening to the stories of
survivors and the jerusalem trial of
adolf eichmann witness to the millions
who died in Nazi camps hana aren't was
determined not to permit iphone or any
like him to attain the stature of
romantic wicked demi urges no she tells
us these were limited men and women this
is the banality of evil totalitarian
evil destroys the living tissue of
social life and civil society that's the
function of totalitarian ideologies and
deeds good by contrast relies on the
unrehearsed d-doing of ordinary men and
women who from time to time are capable
of extraordinary acts like the villagers
a little village and occupied France
called loose Shambo sir liam
depicted in a wonderful book I commend
to you by Philip Holly called less
innocent blood be shed the villagers to
the man woman and child took in refugees
from nazi-occupied Europe and helped
them to escape their death-defying acts
of rescue offering asylum from Nazi
terror or generative radiating out
opening up new possibilities
generativity or the banality of evil
that really is the question now let me
conclude this by gaston section in this
way the metaphorical representation of
an absence of evil is really nothing is
a difficult thing to you to express how
do you explore the horror of evil while
denying it the status of a created
reality how do you name a life killing
negation when we think of evil we think
of self-absorption cruelty resentment
self-hatred even the laughter of the
derisive and the mocking now del banco
comes up with a wonderful image i wish i
had done this the image of the not KN ot
not the not does not exist in and of
itself it requires a material entity a
rope evil is the twisted pneus of the
not not the Rope itself that is it is
parasitic on that which is and is in and
of itself good ok now the parts you were
really waiting for harry potter and the
return of evil i'm going to begin at the
beginning with volume 1 I had some help
from my grandchildren I should forewarn
you that volume 6 is yet to be discussed
I didn't I haven't got that far harry
potter and the half-blood prince but the
others are in here so let's see if we
can make any headway now as all readers
of harry potter know Lord Voldemort or
he-who-must-not-be-named is a brilliant
wizard who has gone over to the dark
side rather like the fallen
angel who chose to will wrongly and
became Satan and Christian cosmology the
angels are sentient creatures with free
wills a major angel will drawn Lee
Voldemort articulates his philosophy and
volume one very clearly it sounds alas a
little bit like some of the bargain
basement Nietzschean ism i get from
freshman at the university of chicago
there is no good and evil there is only
power no good and evil only power so
Voldemort lives in a world beyond good
and evil this of course is a philosophy
that offers an open invitation to all
who would malign and harm and destroy it
creates a principle of exculpation we
are only doing what everyone wants to do
we just have the guts to admit it now
this evil wizard having been reduced to
nothingness as the first book in this
series begins is a kind of disembodied
thing because his killing curse against
the infant Harry Potter has backfired on
him and in Volume one he's managed your
recall to attach himself in this very
amorphous form to the back of Professor
quarles head quarrel being the teacher
of defense against the dark arts at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry now Voldemort's parasitic quest
explains why quarrel always wears a
turban because evil must not disclose
itself prematurely and Voldemort uses
quarrel to do terrible things as he
needs some how to represent himself in
order to act now there's something about
coral that makes this parasitism
possible makes him a good host and we're
led to believe it's likely his hubris
his inordinate ambition Bouldin word of
course the name itself means will to
death as i'm sure you you figured out a
long time ago what has saved Harry
against the arvada Kedavra
or the killing curse the life-affirming
life saving power of goodness his
mother's love and sacrifice this caused
Voldemort's curse to backfire as
Dumbledore says to Harry your mother
died to save you if there is one thing
Voldemort cannot understand it is love
he didn't realize that love is powerful
as your mother's for you leaves its own
mark not a scar no visible sign to have
been loved so deeply even though the
person who loved us is gone will give us
some protection forever it is in your
very soul quarrel full of hatred greed
and ambition sharing his soul with
Voldemort will to death could not touch
you for this reason it was agony to
touch a person marked by something so
good thus did this remarkable series
began and and as I indicated at the
beginning as evil disappears for much of
our elite culture is understanding
children who know there is bad stuff in
the world and puzzled to the point of
obsession over it are being treated to a
serious discussion by JK Rowling and
this I believe explains at least in part
the power and popularity of this series
ok vol 2 harry potter and the chamber of
secrets Voldemort continues to act
through surrogates you recall he mind
controls young Ginny Weasley who just a
child is untutored and how to fend him
off victimized by the Imperius curse she
does his bidding things get very
complicated as I'm sure you know
voldemort returns to Hogwarts using his
younger self tom riddle riddle had
killed his own father because his father
was a muggle and my grandson reminded me
like us grandma when we were talking
about this tom riddle came back through
his diary eventually there's a showdown
as riddle the younger self and whom
Voldemort has gained temporary if
apparitional representation
gets hairy for death he is determined to
finish off what he Voldemort failed to
do initially and he also wants some of
Harry's blood in order to regenerate
himself the basilisk the snake-like
monster is sent to kill Harry by tom
riddle and Harry can't control the
basilisk even though Harry possesses the
ability found primarily in dark wizards
of speaking Parseltongue in
communicating with snakes and we all
know snakes have long the
representatives servants who invited the
initial fall of human beings from their
statuses good creatures to their
statuses sinning ones that's often a
mark has been a representation of
consorting with the dark side and you'll
recall at the very beginning of volume 1
when harry's under the Sorting Hat and
the sorting hat is saying Gryffindor
Slytherin Gryffindor Slytherin you could
be great you know you have some of the
stuff dark Wizards have and Harry's
saying Gryffindor Gryffindor not
Slytherin he making a choice already to
move away from the allure of dark
greatness but he has a bit of the
temptation in him Harry is saved by
folks the Phoenix belonging to
Dumbledore who blinds the basilisk and
whose tears of goodness he'll Harry's
wounds so we're left at the end with
Voldemort riddle dissipating
disappearing still searching for some
way to represent himself so he can
destroy and lay waste if you ever have
the opportunity to read Augustine's
monumental City of God and everyone
should do that once in a lifetime you
will find that he spends a lot of time
is really fascinating stuff talking
about how evil and the demonic tries to
gain representation some of it sounds
like B movie script but it's great sort
of cultural critique it's a lot of fun
vol 3 harry potter and the prisoner of
azkaban introduces us to the scariest
of many scary things the Dementors this
is what grandson Bobby said about them
if Dementors kiss you they suck out your
soul you may be alive but you're
destroyed you can tell when a dementor
is nearby like this it gets really cold
you feel like you will never be happy
again Dementors aren't human they Glide
they can't see but they can sense where
somebody is they also have gross caddy
hands like skeletons now if a dementor
sucks out your soul a feeling of
emptiness dominates you forever that
vast wasteland of the self of which
agustin rights in harry's early
encounter with the Dementors the
Hogwarts Express is plunged into
darkness the cloaked fingers figures
extend their scab fingers and and draw a
long slow rattling breasts and they suck
the life out of the environment why they
can only deplete they can't create the
cold we're told was inside his chest
inside his very heart he was drowning
and cold he was being dragged downward
and later Harry's best friend Ron
Weasley said I felt weird like I'd never
be cheerful again and this suggests one
strategy for combating the spread of
evil that is suffocating the life out of
things and that's humor Ron and Ginny
Weasley's madcap twin brothers Fred and
George are irreverent cut-ups and they
keep laughter alive laughter helps to
drive the demons away and i think this
also spurs us to appreciate why so many
christian theologians you wouldn't know
this way people think of theology but
they did they spoke of good humor as one
of God's great gifts Hilary toss a
reveling and the joy of life itself
that's the way to hold the demons at bay
when we move to volume for harry potter
and the goblet of fire we've got the
Death Eaters identified a Death Eater
one of old and mort servants a wizard
who's in league with evil the story
begins with Voldemort still struggling
to regain a material form he's in league
with Nagini a snake and a servant
Pettigrew or Wormtail who does his
bidding including carrying him around as
he's kind of yucky disgusting thing at
this point does this not suggest that if
no one fed evil so to speak it could not
grow it could not enact its deadly
project it has no volition ality all on
its own the snake provides venom for
Voldemort's consumption Voldemort speaks
to the snake and Parseltongue as well
something called the dark mark appears
in the sky which means Voldemort will
return it's a magic spell of a head and
the sky there's a mark on the arms of
the Death Eaters like tattoos that
appear whenever Voldemort returns or is
near you'll recall that Harry's name is
put into something called the Goblet of
Fire so he's forced to compete in the
Triwizard Tournament Voldemort wants to
get hold of Harry in order to kill him
to lure him away from Hogwarts and to
acquire some of his blood and then to
murder him and volume 4 concludes with
an absolutely horrific epic struggle
between Harry and Voldemort for
Voldemort has managed somehow at that
point to rise again which is troubling
for several reasons it seems at least at
first blush to suggest a kind of triumph
of evil and the coming into a body of
that which has no integrity and standing
on its own but rallying builds in
precautions Voldemort is not one of
God's good created creatures he's
cobbled together out of grotesque
elements he needs Harry's blood in order
to gain some of the strength conveyed to
Harry by the gift of his mother's love
and sacrifice and this is the way
Voldemort speaks his mother died in an
attempt to save him and unwittingly
provided him with a
protection I admit I had not foreseen I
could not touch the boy his mother left
upon him the traces of her sacrifice
this is old magic my curse was deflected
by the foolish woman's sacrifice and it
rebounded upon myself pain beyond pain
ripped from my body less than spirit
still alive awaiting the opportunity to
resurface and to be restored to a body
end of quote I must say it was a bit
worried when i learned ray Fiennes was
going to play Voldemort that he'd make
him too attractive but that seems to
have been forestalled so I'm a little
bit really Voldemort could possess the
bodies of others animals snakes being
its preference mm-hmm he finds the
gullible wizard he had found her kills
her taking this rudimentary weak body at
first uses potions concocted from
unicorn blood and it is a terrible sin
to kill a unicorn and then adds to that
snake venom uses a bone from his dead
father the father he murdered but he
needs the blood of his foe he goes into
combat with Harry the Death Eaters at
his side Harry having been transported
along with his classmates eadric Diggory
away from Hogwarts and during the battle
what we see or all those Voldemort has
ravaged and killed sort of appearing out
of the end of his wand so much damage so
much grief nothing but the repetition of
grief nothing new just destruction we
see Harry's mother and father and they
give Harry instructions Harry saved once
again the spirits of the good victims
helping to stave off the curse of
Voldemort Harry makes it back to
Hogwarts carrying the body of yet
another victim his classmates ceedric
Diggory and Harry and Dumbledore send
out the alarm the battle against evil is
once again upon the Wizarding World
Harry has passed off as hallucinatory
and attention-seeking Dumbledore is
dismissed and deprecated
the Ministry of Magic officialdom
refuses to believe that evil must be
fought as I wrote these words I must say
I thought of Winston Churchill's long
years in the political wilderness in the
1930s years he spent trying to rouse
people to the dangers of Nazism in a
rearm Germany and he was considered wild
and a loser natori as well until it was
almost too late ok vol 5 is the last
what I'm going to talk about as I said I
haven't written out my coming son volume
6 yet ah well Harry Potter and the order
of phoenix the movie is about to open
Harry's clearly a teenager caught in the
tumult of that age we see him fighting
with his own temptations and his own
inclination to harm an awful sadist
Delores Umbridge comes to Hogwarts to
teach defence against the dark arts but
not really to teach it at all because
children are lot no longer to be taught
how to defend themselves against evil
they must be disarmed in their dealings
with darkness Harry's Godfather serious
escaped from Azkaban where he's been
sent after having been falsely convicted
of the murder of Harry's parents
teachers Harry the inviolable rule never
never surrender your wand along the way
the awful umbrage becomes high
Inquisitor at Hogwarts then headmaster
the great in good Dumbledore is forced
to flee having already been removed from
his standing on official boards and so
on because of his resolute insistence
that Voldemort must be fought the death
eaters who were not free to roam but had
remained prisoners in Azkaban escape
they're in league with the prison
keeping Dementors who've also all gone
over to the dark side the students at
Hogwarts form dumbledore's army to learn
to defend themselves and they readily
speak of umbrage as evil as she extends
her reign of terror she's evil twisted
mad says Harry she's a sadist who laughs
as she tortures and
humiliate students and turn some
students the known bullies and
tormentors of other students against
like Lucius Malfoy turns them against
the other students it makes them
official and their capacity to torment
Fred and George Weasley fight her with
pranks humour irreverence there's a
culminating battle in which Harry
stepfather serious dies Dumbledore duels
with Voldemort who's forced to flee and
at long last after so much more damage
Harry and Dumbledore believed this is
very clearly a battle of good against
evil now Dumbledore tells the Hogwarts
students that even those who champion
good may do some of Voldemort's work for
him by spreading discord and enmity by
breaking the bonds of friendship and
loyalty and love as voldemort would have
it when fights him Dumbledore who's a
wise man tells the students by showing
an equally strong bond of friendship and
trust and do not surrender your wand
never be without a means of Defense debt
for Death Eaters cheer at the news of
torture and murder they revel in it for
they can only destroy so I submit to you
and moving to conclude here that the
Harry Potter series whatever quarrels I
may have with it from a theological or
philosophic point of view from time to
time that's small potatoes and the
overall scheme of things offer America's
children and children everywhere a
picture of a moral universe in which
very very bad things sometimes happen
but none of us including children are
without the means to fight back love
loyalty friendship solidarity all of
these protect and defend us
garden-variety disregard and mistrust
the splitting of friendships envy
jealousy these are the ways it all
begins one must also clearly name what
needs to be named and not flee from the
scene of
battle JK rowling is helping children to
imagine evil and to evoke it in modern
Western culture from which it is
frequently banished powerful children's
stories have always done this but we
have quite mistakenly sanitized those
stories making believe all the while
that we are protecting children as we do
so we don't want to frighten them we say
but children know the world isn't always
nice they deal with petty cruelties and
bullying and cutting comments all the
time and the original mother Goose
stories with a lot of the scary bits
probably serve better over the long run
than carebear there are those and I am
one of them who fear that if evil
escapes our imagination then it will
indeed have established dominion over us
Dabangg co-writes if the private of
conception of evil continues to be lost
between liberal irony on the one hand
and fundamentalist demonizing on the
other we shall have no way of
confronting the most challenging
experiences of our private and public
lives end of quote so how interesting it
is that even as a kind of therapeutic
okay hbu Larry from which evil and
horror have largely been banished
prevails in the work of those who define
much of what we think about and how we
are to think about it children are
reveling in a world in which parents are
murdered by evil wizards are driven mad
by the Cruciatus curse danger lurks in
many places and what is more the good
like harry harbors something of the
temptation and evil in themselves but
they do not capitulate to it and that
really is the difference thanks very
much thank you
Thanks thank you apologize for the
wobbly voice I'm on this new regime of
medication and it's i'm not going to
faint away on you don't worry but it's
rex a bit of havoc with my system at the
moment so sorry about that i hope was
clear nonetheless and I understand we
have about 15 minutes for questions if
you have any yes so it seems like is
Assad I hear you okay so it seems like
in harry potter the type of evil that's
presented isn't banal it's there is some
sinister glory to it and would you say
you agree with presenting that aspect of
evil well yeah i would say that that in
a sense it's it's mixed that is to say
there is no doubt that we're fascinated
by by the wicked you know by the outlaws
by those who as I said have gone over to
the dark side but there is there are
also ways in which it seems to me it's
not so much a glamorous glorious evil
that finally we are left with that's not
the image but of all the destruction all
the deaths all those images of people
murdered coming out during the battle of
the of the wands I think that's that's
what rally and I believe means to to
leave us with that that Voldemort is is
a parasite he must be fed he must in
some bizarre way be nurtured by others
who out of ambition or malice wish to be
part of his project but he cannot again
generate he can only lay waste think
things are become darker and they become
cold and they become crueler and
friendships are smashed
and lives are ruined and there's nothing
very attractive or glamorous about that
so I would say finally the banality of
evil image is the one that pertains erin
was very careful when she said venality
vvill she didn't mean to diminish what
evil does what she wanted to suggest was
don't imagine these people as dark
heroes they're not they can only repeat
horrible stuff that's all they can do
they can't create they can't generate so
from a theological point of view what
should happen in book seven well from a
theological point of view what should
happen in book seven is that Voldemort
is bested and there and there will be
costs because the battle against evil is
often very costly but hopefully Harry
who has gone through so much as well as
ron and hermione's demonstrated you know
the Solidarity of friendship throughout
even with some bumps along the way
hopefully they will they will make it
but you know one never knows i mean the
the the battle against evil the costs
are often considerable so i will be in
line on midnight with with Bobby I don't
know if you'll be there Joey no Jan
you'll be out of town waiting for the
book and we'll go back and get no sleep
and find out so that's how I'd like that
would be very satisfying but but as we
know the outcome in political history
and so forth is often not fully
satisfied so depends on what rally wants
to do to us I guess yeah yes you
mentioned in the beginning constructor
Walmart's principal power yes evil
there's far good and I'm just kind of it
was curious about two things is how does
it kind of go back to our lives and you
know it I'm ambition you know people who
desire to move
two and two are growing stuff like that
how I guess the question I have is how
do how should we look at power yeah um
you know because we you know fight this
or like how should we receive i braid on
power yeah well as you know power is one
of the the great words and and the
complicated words and if you look at the
Latin a couple of Latin words that are
translated into power you can see a
couple of shades of meaning there's
potestas which is power as mastery
dominion the kind of power that
unleashes Augustine's lust to dominate
that temptation there's another kind of
power the Latin word is potencia from
which our word potential comes the
notion that power has a generative
capacity it's the ability to create to
let's say use your educated gifts to
their fullest one might say and I see
absolutely nothing in Christian theology
that says people should run around being
self-abnegation 02 to a degree that is
self-destructive use your gifts create
generate but always be alert to this
temptation to dominate over rather than
to serve and so forth now that's an easy
part the when you get to questions of
for example political rule and
governance there has to be we call the
you know we calls powers the Dominions
in a sense in the in the antique world
the principalities and the dominions and
there have to be structures of power
power in the sense of the capacity to do
that which must be done in order to
maintain intact a system of some kind
but hopefully that's a system that has
enough free play shall we say so that
power as potencia that other notion of
power is not quashed and power as rural
governance dominion does not harden in
congeal
and become simply the vehicle of you
know a certain kind of mastery over
others that has this deadening effect
over time even worse of course the
mastery over others that leads to the
terrorists of which I spoke at the
outset of the 20th century of mass
murder that's how i would start our
discussion i mean obviously we would
have to keep going from there to talk
about all of this i mean there are
reasons for why the greeks had the
notion of hubris for why and
Christianity pride is a danger and so
forth because there are very real
dangers associated with with power but
no society I mean you can't there cannot
be human society without power power
resting somewhere power being something
that can be created hana Ahrendts notion
of power was that which is made possible
when people come together for a common
purpose so for example there are some
examples of our own lifetime if you were
in Prague in November of 1989 and you
were part of the tens of thousands who
flooded into Vince's Schloss square
peaceful protest and you watched this
authoritarian operatic start to dissolve
that was a form of power that was
generated at that moment astonishing
stuff you know unarmed people going
against this regime that just started to
unravel a regime that supposedly had all
the power same thing happened in Poland
peaceful protesters solidarity i was
there in 1983 on the occasion of the
second pilgrimage of John Paul's second
back to his homeland and million I mean
millions of people as far as I could see
singing waving banners calling for an
end to the regime and power was being
generated a moral power of a kind that
becomes fungible now it's the kind of
power that sorry to say eludes most
political analysts because it's not
exactly located someplace
but nevertheless things are made
possible when people come together for
certain generative purposes and I think
we can point to those kinds of moments
and see a form of power that we don't
think about very often and i think the
Harry Potter books perhaps permit us to
go off in those kinds of directions from
time to time yes
I I suspect that the good and evil is is
is one big part of it but of course not
the only I mean magic is fun I mean you
know thing to think about a world where
you know things can happen in this
remarkable way and and we're all kinds
of stunning creatures that you know you
may be imagined it turns out they exist
I mean the way we know what's not to
like I mean that's that's exciting stuff
but i think if you again if you go back
and look at the history of children's
literature and how much the theme of
children dealing with bad stuff has been
a feature of that there's something
about that that attracts children
because they're often dealing with some
of their own tumultuous and not shaped
inner feelings of fear anger and so
forth and we either help them as a
culture to understand that to shape it
or we try to pretend it's not there and
pretending it's not there as worst
possible thing we can do a few years ago
well probably as I get older a few years
is not 20 there's a book by a child
psychologist named Bruno Bettelheim they
call the uses of Enchantment about the
harm done by sanitizing all the the
children's nursery stories and so on
because he said they spoke to real
things that are happening with kids at
different stages of development it
doesn't mean you want to frighten a
child out of his or her wits obviously
but there's stuff going in the on that
kids themselves can fully articulate and
we need to find some way to respond to
that without overwhelming them with it
and I think rallying is really for a
certain age cohort and kids have grown
up with her ten years now you know if
you were eight when the first volume
came you're 18 you grown up with her
that she's done a pretty good job of
that how about one more question or two
or three away however many go ahead
sure sure
well that might be a bit of a
sophisticated move to expect a kid to
make but I think that that let's put it
this way that the books help us to
understand why the word evil even though
again many in our elite culture don't
like it why politically it retains such
force President Clinton when the
oklahoma city was bombed spoke of it as
a day of evil 911 evil the trips I made
to central Eastern Europe before the
democracy changes folks there had no
trouble whatsoever with President
Reagan's characterization of an evil
empire they couldn't understand why some
people in the West thought Reagan
shouldn't talk like that they said do
people know what it's like you know they
thought the name was apt so I think the
question is not should it or shouldn't
it be used for political purposes but
does it accurately named something that
couldn't be spoken of with as much force
in power and any other way I think
that's the question we need to ask
obviously it becomes a problem if the
word is bandied about 22 frequently is
deployed incessantly it loses any of its
force it shouldn't simply become a
standard rhetorical device but I would
submit that there are some political
phenomena that are accurately named evil
this doesn't give us our marching orders
as far as how we are to respond to that
you know you can name something
understand it as evil death camps were
evil it doesn't tell you exactly what
you can do other than defeat Hitler of
course to stop the phenomenon so I think
the connection would be a bit rough for
for a child but I have a
that for the adults reading these books
that it is food for thought on how evil
is deployed politically that's that's
for sure and again whether it's deployed
well or for ill purposes I would not
banish its use we have to evaluate that
use yes
well go ahead okay well I thought I'd
guard against that by talking about the
fact that my discussion of Agustin about
the fact that he rejected the total
externalization of the notion of evil
and that all of us have to confront
temptations and habituating ourselves to
to send temptation evil along the way so
calling let me just put it this way
unless you're living in a completely
dualistic universe naming what happened
on 911 is evil doesn't mean that you are
there by exempting yourself as pure
doesn't mean that at all you can
accurately named that it seems to me as
a horrific day when wicked things were
done and that still leaves open space
for you to talk about any ongoing
critical reflections you might have
about the United States its course in
the world the way it understands
international relations and so on so by
using the word evil again unless you're
devoted to this drug dualism does not
commit you to the view that of complete
self exculpation where your own self or
your own society is concerned so thank
you for giving me an opportunity to
clarify that anyone else how about will
make your as last question
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I good
question good question thank you yeah
the the question has to do with whether
one of the attractions I hope you got of
the harry potter book is precisely the
sort of manic an ism the dualism of it
because that clarifies the moral
universe for us in a very striking way
and i'm sure you're right i mean i think
that's if i were to have a longer
discussion with JK Rowling about that
that one of the things we talked about I
dare say that day will probably never
arise but but I do think that again she
she does build in these precautions by
showing that at the very beginning you
know it's Slytherin or Gryffindor and
you know now Harry at each point along
the way with some lapses has made the
decision not to go the route of
selfishness and cruelty and so on but
he's struggling with it he's struggling
with these these issues and since Harry
the protagonist is the person the child
is going to most identify with I think
that that that's an enormous sort of
help in making more nuanced the
understanding of good and evil as a
daily temptation for the person I don't
see anything wrong with trying to
clarify the principles of good and evil
and the figures of Dumbledore and and
Voldemort there's undoubted power in
that I think that you know dualism
wouldn't have such a long life if it
weren't so attractive and and it's hard
as I mentioned in the discussion of our
gustan theology augustinian ism it's
hard to it's hard to work against it
because of the immediate force of it
but I think work against it we must
because eventually if it prevails then
you know Harry becomes one of the pure
utterly pure and it doesn't have any of
the the sort of dark parcel mouth you
know nasty urges within him and I think
that's what needs to ongoing Lee be kept
in there in order to show the force of
his own struggle with it thank you all
