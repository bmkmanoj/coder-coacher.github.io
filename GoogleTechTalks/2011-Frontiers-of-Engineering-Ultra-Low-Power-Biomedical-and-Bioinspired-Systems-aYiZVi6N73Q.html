the session is Professor rehearse our
pêche car and we actually chose Rahul to
kind of bring us full circle and so
within the neural prosthetic space not
just look at how do we build systems
than interface with the brain but as
part of that process looking at what can
biology teach us about the way we're
doing other engineering and Rahul
actually is you heard the questions
really kind of embraces this manner of
thinking and after his question
yesterday I was teasing him that we
should not use the matrix to represent
him but avatar because he's interested
not in just in brain interfacing but
also in living in trees and so a little
more appropriate science fiction analogy
perhaps and so please join me in
welcoming professor Suresh car thank you
so much for that very kind introduction
Tim it could have been a lot worse so I
said I'm gonna give a fairly broad talk
and I'm going to talk about
ultra-low-power bio-inspired and
biomedical systems but I'm actually
going to talk in some ways about how
biology and engineering really should be
thought off in one language and it's the
language of analog circuits so that is
sort of my deeper agenda and I'm gonna
show you how in a very deep way if you
do that that can impact medicine our
understanding of biology and our
understanding of engineering so the what
I want to say is that there's sort of
two directions that are very big right
now that are going on which is that in
engineering engineering is used to
analyze biology it's used to instrument
it it's now being used to design it and
to repair it of course as in medicine
and there are many many people working
at this interface and also biology it
turns out is fantastic and when I say
fantastic I don't just mean biology is
good I don't mean biology is amazing I
mean biology is mind-bogglingly
brilliant so when I give you the spec
sheet of the human ear the spec sheet of
the human eye the spec sheet of the
human cell the spec sheet of a heart
I've got all these specs down as an
engineer and I just give you the numb
how much energy time-space materials
does it take to make this gadget what is
the precision with which you compute
what are you computing reliably you find
on every single thing biology is built
over billionaires of evolution it's just
mind boggling and as an engineer I've
built many phenomenal systems many of
them that hold World Records and every
time I get deeper into the biology I'm
like I've done nothing and that's the
message I want to convey to you and I
want to convey that you can actually
learn from that biology to build very
amazing engineering systems and then
there's a positive feedback loop you can
actually take those engineering systems
and go back to fix the biology and that
actually results often in the most
powerful algorithms and circuits and
systems because it's natural to mimic
the biology when you're trying to fix it
and then you find hmmm I'm having a
problem in engineering well how does the
Year solve it and then you look to the
year for clues and then you find out I
can now design a better cochlear implant
by taking guidance from the year itself
and so you'll see that theme emerging as
I move on and to start one of the great
secrets of biology is it's not a bunch
of dumb ones and zeros we don't think in
black and white our brains are not ones
and zeros our cells are not ones and
zeros we actually think in a hybrid
mixed signal analog and digital way and
I want to remind you of why that is the
case so some of this is elementary but I
want to go through it just to show you
why
biology is actually evolved a mixed
signal hybrid analog digital system of
computing and building things so by
taking analog computer which some of you
probably think is outdated and compare
it say with the way we would compute in
a digital computer so this could be an
analogy for the brain it could also be
an analogy later as I'll show you for
the cell in analog systems you compute
on a continuous set of numbers so you're
going from say zero all the way through
one so any irrational number irrational
number everything is fair game typically
if you're an electrical engineer the
lowest value would be ground the highest
value would be VDD in your power supply
if you're a mechanical engineer you
might say there's some minimum velocity
and a maximum velocity in digital you
compute on a discrete set zero comma one
the only things you care about are the
boolean zeros and ones and that means
you only care about the lowest value of
the power supply or the highest value
where are your primitive
your basis functions of computing coming
from there coming actually from the
physics of the devices themselves so for
example Kirchhoff's voltage law gives
you a free ad you don't need to reinvent
it Kirchhoff's current law gives you a
free ad you don't need to reinvent it I
equals e to the X which is the current
IV relationship in a transistor it gives
you a free exponential and the logarithm
it's already built in conservation laws
like addition and other kinds of
adaptation I equals C DV DT on a
capacitor and inductor enable you to be
very complex sophisticated partial
differential equations that are
nonlinear that interact with each other
and this goes on in the brain and in the
cell and as a consequence the amount of
computation squeezed out of a single
transistor computing device is very high
because there's no you're blurring the
boundary between hardware and software
your physical devices are actually
computers they're computing and so
there's no clean separation between the
body of the physics and the
informational soul of the information
the information is embedded in those
physical devices and those physical
devices actually transforming their
states here you're saying well I don't
care about that because the primitives
of computing actually going to come to
the mathematics of boolean logic which
means and or not not Man X or my
primitives the transistor is a switch
and so I'm going to purposely abstract
away a lot of things my devices could do
so that the amount of computation
squeezed out of a single transistor is
low one wire represents many bits of
information here one Y represents one so
all of this looks very good for analog
Oh which is why you might be wondering
given all this why we're not working
with analog computers today and the
reason is that you'll see that analog is
not scalable and purely analog is not
scalable and that's because the
computation is offset prone that means
that it looks beautiful on paper I've
got this nonlinear differential equation
I can implement with three transistors
or with a biochemical binding reaction
in biology but when I build the thing it
doesn't work because it's mismatched
here it's relatively less offer it's
wrong because I've intentionally as an
engineer designed it to be robust by
having a large enough separation but
my power supplies the noise is due to
thermal fluctuations and physical
devices so physical devices have
molecular flows and fluxes or electron
flows and fluxes and those cause noise
and the noise in a digital system is
primarily due to roundoff error and
temporal aliasing and the signal is not
restored at each stage of the
computation an analog system and that's
because you don't know where to restore
it to and the signal at every stage a
bad zero will become a good zero a bad
one will become a good one as long as
your logic stage has a gain greater than
one in a electrical system so if you
take analog computers with a mechanical
chemical like in the cell or electrical
if you take a cascade of sufficient
analog stages noise will start to
accumulate and build up and certainly
roundoff error also accumulates and
builds up but you typically Pat it with
enough bits so that unless the
computation is highly nonlinear high Q
or chaotic you're okay and we also know
that analog systems are not as flexible
or not as easily programmable digital
systems are and analog systems because
they're soft will often degrade
gracefully and of course we all know
with digital systems that you just boot
them up again but they do have
catastrophic heart failure so if you do
a deeper analysis of this which I don't
have time to go into and you go into the
fundamental device physics of what sets
noise in a device and work that out you
find three big insights one is that
analog computing is much better at
computing with low precision so that
means if you want to add two numbers to
six bits of precision or four bits you
don't need to reinvent it you hook three
wires and kirchoff's current law doesn't
add for you or if you're a biochemical
reaction in a cell you make three
proteins if they're all the same protein
all those three fluxes add and now
you've done an ADD operation the problem
is if you try and do it at high
precision let's say you wanted to go to
ten to sixteen bits of precision a
digital system does the very smart thing
of saying let's take many one bit
precise units that just have logic basis
functions and have them collectively
interact with each other through the
mechanism of the carry so a 16 bit
number can be represented with 16 one
bit precise units each of which is not
doing very much but collectively they're
interacting and representing the
information and
system makes the mistake of trying to
put all that information on one wire and
all that computation in one processing
channel so eventually it doesn't scale
the energy required to keep the thermal
noise or the mismatch or offset under
check goes through the roof and because
of that Nano oxygen will scale like a
power law as a function of the
signal-to-noise ratio and a digital
system will be logarithmic so as a
consequence at low precision it's good
to use Kirchhoff's current law but at
high precision maybe you use a bunch of
full adders if you're trying to do 16
bit ads so one of the big secrets in
biology is it's neither you don't take
one analog unit and try and do an 8 bit
add or sixteen bit odd neither do you
take a set of logic basis functions that
have thrown away all the computation
that's already inherent in the device
you and you have these all interact with
each other with only one bit precision
instead you take analog devices that
have analog basis functions that are
useful for the task that you're trying
to do and those basis functions which
might be multiplies adds weighting
parallel addition a learning operation
in a synapse in a neuron all those
operations are distributed so that in
many moderate precision analog units
with analog basis functions interacting
with each other to preserve the eight
bits of precision so this particular
case I've shown you two 4-bit precise
analog units eight one bit precise
digital units and one 8-bit precise
analog unit it turns out there's an
optimum that has to do with the cost of
computation versus communication I won't
go into it but one of the reasons for
example the brain is actually made up of
very very noisy neurons and asked a very
brilliant thing to do is that if any
neuron communicates with a hundred
thousand neurons the cost of computation
is very cheap so it's actually better to
compute noisy and have collective
interaction with lots of computing noisy
devices than to make any one device
precise and the converse side if you
have a very precise device then you can
communicate less and compute with higher
precision so that sets the trade-off and
another trade-off that shows up and this
particularly shows up for example in the
urine the eye is you have humongous
amounts of information coming in that
are all meaningless you don't really
care about most of it
in fact you can show that if the eye was
designed
with the linear CMOS imager along with
an ad D converter and we sent that
information into the brain and you took
the 135 million photoreceptors and the 1
million pixels that go out you would
essentially be sending 36 gigabits per
second to the brain which means your
brain would have to be the size of this
room to analyze all that data so you
don't do that what your retina does is
it does a thousand to one compression in
a very clever way and it pre analyzes
the data so that you're only sending
about 20 megabits per second to the
brain to analyze by basically doing a
bunch of analog pre-processing before it
samples and digitizes the signal and
sends it out and so many systems can be
made very energy efficient by exploiting
these analog basis functions and
delaying the digitization and there's an
optimum point you don't want to do it
too early and you don't want to do it
too late if you do it too early you're
not energy efficient because you're not
exploiting your physics to actually
compute and if you do it too late then
it turns out that you spend too much
energy time and space trying to make the
analog precise enough before you get a
reliable answer and so we have applied
these techniques in many systems in my
lab but let me start with an example of
a bio-inspired system that actually
illustrates why the year is a brilliant
custom fluid mechanical analog computer
so I think you've already had an idea of
how the year works but I'll reviewed for
you very quickly sound comes in and it
stimulates a piston that piston goes
into this fluid filled coiled cavity and
when this jiggles up and down with the
sound wave that causes fluids to move
inside which press on a membrane called
the basilar membrane basilar membrane
sends more fluid forward which presses
on further basilar membrane you get a
coupled fluid membrane traveling wave
system now because this membrane is very
stiff at the beginning and floppy at the
end if you get a high frequency sound
you will mostly stimulate the beginning
and the wave will not be able to
propagate it will die out because the
membrane is too floppy to keep up with
the fast motions if it's a slower sound
wave at a lower pitch the wave will
travel a longer distance before the
membrane again gets too floppy and can't
keep up with it so we looked at the
answer what the year does is too big
things is it separates out the sounds
based on frequency by saying these are
high frequency sounds these are low
frequency sounds I'm gonna do a
frequency to place spectrum analysis it
also does some very clever gain control
with outer hair cells which are the best
piezo electorates known to man and
through that amplification it is able in
14 micro watts of power to do a gigaflop
of computation and since 128 of an
angstrom of a hydrogen atom at the urine
room so we looked at this custom fluid
mechanical computer and we said what is
interesting about its equations and the
way it's architected and one of the
things that stood out outstandingly is
if you ask yourself what if I took an A
to D converter and built in FFT and I
said I wanted to build an end point FFT
the acquisition time for this digital
system would scale like n log N and this
is a very efficient algorithm now if you
do it in a purely analog filter back
fashion the acquisition time would be o
of n for an end point spectrum analysis
but N squared in hardware and it turns
out the cochlea because of an
exponentially tapered transmission line
has a very clever architecture so that
whatever spectrum analysis at any filter
trap you're trying to do you take a
cascade of filters and you have a moving
window that moves and zooms around and
because it moves and zum-zum zero-point
you're interested in only twenty filters
behind you contribute or only these
twenty or these twenty and so the system
is completely scale invariant and shares
the computation a very interesting
collective analog fashion and it's
because of this that you get very very
efficient algorithms so we actually took
this idea and I don't have time to show
you the video but we built an RF cochlea
in my lab we took a fluid mass and we
mapped it to an inductor we took a
spring stiffness in the year and we
mapped it to a capacitor we took the
active amplifiers in the year and piezo
electrics and act them to RF amplifiers
and we actually built a chip a very very
tiny chip that you see here that's an RF
cochlear that actually mimics its spiral
and we were able to build a radio
receiver that could operate like the
year very very broadband in this
particular case from 8 gigahertz to 600
megahertz and it's very useful in very
smart and cognitive radios of the future
and it turns out the outer Europe inner
is also like a radio antenna it's a very
cleverly designed
radio antennae with the middle you're
doing impedance matching to the radio
receiver in the inner ear and so we
found that by doing this we could get
20x lower hardware cost and an analog
filter bankin hundred x lower power than
direct digitization so this is an
example of where a bio-inspired
architecture so I think Tim you were
right in saying avatar here because the
soul comes from the cochlea but the body
is actually on an RF chip and you're
actually taking the mathematical sole of
the cochlea with all its differential
equations just mapping it onto the
different body of an RF electronic
system but they're actually
mathematically identical they share the
same soul but it's in a different body
and so this is what I would call
stealing intellectual property from
biology because we're taking ideas and
we're really taking the intellectual
property and then we're mapping it into
some other space and there are no
patents to worry about except the ones
we ourselves create but this is an
example of doing that and now you can go
the other way
you can say well now that we've learned
how the Year works can we use it in
medicine for example in cochlear
implants actually use what we know about
the year to build better cochlear
implants and fix them and let me review
for you how these devices work Jim
Weiland did a very good job of already
reviewing it so I'll go quickly but a
microphone transduces the sound into
electrical system that is converted into
a system behind the year that does some
gain control and spectrum analysis the
gain control and spectrum analysis then
goes through an RF coil which is
telemetered out to a receiver RF coil on
the other side and the reason you want a
wireless link between the outside of the
body and the inside of the body with the
skin in between is you don't want to
send a wire through the body wires will
pick up infection and the FDA doesn't
like them so by sending the information
wirelessly you don't you avoid the wire
and you can also send the power
wirelessly so you send the RF power
wirelessly you rectify it to create
voltage on an ultracapacitor in some
cases if you have an implanted battery
you can also recharge it and that
information then goes through an
electrode array to stimulate in the case
of say a cochlear implant you may have
22 electrodes or 16 and you may say oh
that's a loud high frequency sound
stimulate electrode one
hundred micro amps of charge balanced AC
current for a hundred microseconds or
you say oh that's a very soft low
frequency sound stimulate the very
latest electrode that's deeply
penetrated the cochlear with ten micro
amps of charge balanced AC current for
ten microseconds sir mapping the
intensity of the spectrum into the
intensity of the current stimulation and
your mapping the place of location into
the spectrum corresponding to the sound
there are many other things that you do
like for example converting DB into
micro amps because the Europe irsie
things logarithmically rather than in a
linear fashion and you have to do some
very sophisticated gain control but many
of these implants will someday in the
future be fully implanted inside the
body that means you won't even know a
person is deaf they will be truly bionic
the microphone the battery the recharter
the processor everything will be inside
the microphones ultrasonic they can
probably hear better than you at other
frequencies and if they don't like what
you're saying they can shut you off
literally
so for those kinds of system energy and
power are critical and even for very
advanced low-cost systems today that
might be needed in third-world countries
you need to really make the system small
in size and have the right electrode
count and be cheap in order to do that
it turns out one of the burning issues
is power and the reason power matters is
not just because it takes the battery
longer it's because you can make things
smaller because you don't need such a
battery or you can have more electrodes
which means it makes you more robust and
noise and you can change the size to
something that a surgeon will be happy
with so taking the same cue from biology
we delayed digitization and a cochlear
implant processor that was the blood
sweat tears and toil of five of my
graduate students over some time in my
lab but we basically built an ultra-low
power microphone front end with an AGC
and we had enough program ability in
this system such that a just like a
digital system we could program 86
patient parameters with 373 bits and a
cochlear implant subject took out her
processor and put our processor in and
she understood speech with it on the
first try she thought it sounded the
gain control sounded a little quacky and
that it turns out we could fix so this
system actually is robust to many
sources of noise like biology is be
the feedback loops and it's in the
process of being investigated for
commercialization so I want to now show
you an example of a system where we
actually look at what the biology does
and we built another chip that actually
learned from how biology samples the
auditory nerve to improve the hearing of
music in patients so one of the big two
things that are going on now with
hearing and cochlear implants is
everything works well when everything is
clean you can take just about any
algorithm an FFT or something and in
clean speech everyone's going to do just
as well as you but if I turn up the
noise in the environment in a cocktail
party or I ask a profoundly deaf patient
with a cochlear implant to hear music it
sounds terrible and let me show you why
it sounds terrible so this is what you
or I would hear if we listen to jazz
music can we hook him you turn it up a
bit okay I'm gonna play it again so
here's the original music
that's what they would hear now you may
say why would they hear that and it's
because we haven't encoded the phase
information in music and the phase in
music is critical in speech you can take
a 10 millisecond of speech and flip it
around which means you've completely
inverting the phase of 180 degrees and
you won't hear the difference it'll
sound like whispered speech because
phase information doesn't matter for
speech that much but in music phase
information in the spectrum is critical
otherwise all you're going to get is
this modulated rhythm but why don't we
send phase information in a cochlear
implant to patients because it's very
energy expensive to do so in order to
send phase information it's not enough
to just know whether this part of the
spectrum has high energy or not I have
to get the sine or cosine right which
means I have to get fine sampling in
time of every single detail in the
signal and that costs a lot of energy
because that means have to stimulate at
that speed and if I stimulate at that
speed
hey the patients may not get it because
of low-pass filtering and my energy will
go through the roof which is why most
cochlear implants don't have that so we
said well how does the year do it it
turns out the year actually samples in a
very clever way by phase locking to loud
sounds more than soft sounds and
therefore preserving the phase
information but sampling in a stochastic
fashion not in a clocked fashion like an
engineer would at a fixed sampling rate
but it actually has the information
generate the clock so that automatically
samples at the right time it samples
more when the sound is louder and less
when the sound is softer on that channel
and it has an asynchronous stochastic
strategy that actually does it sampling
so we copied that strategy of sampling
in the year and we did it by having a
set of channels compete with each other
in such a way that the loudest one would
be sampled more and the softest channel
would be sampled less but yet they would
all be sampled in such a way that would
encode the phase information and yet
would be at six times lower sampling
rate in energy so then you can take that
and you can reconstruct the sound based
on that information in envelope and
phase and say what does it sound like
which is very predictive of how patients
actually do so let me show you what it
sounds like if you take the original
sound
so it doesn't sound as good as the
original sound but it does sound a lot
better than not having any phase in it
and you can more or less get it so this
algorithm the asynchronous stochastic
sampling is something that's actually
mimicking what the auditory nerve does
and we have actually used some of these
ideas also envision although I will not
talk about them turns out the year and
the I have many many deep similarities
if you map time into space and you map
1d into 2d even the architectures the
feedback architectures of coupled
transmission lines in the year and the
AI are very similar so you can take
algorithms that work and hearing and
literally map them one-for-one into
vision which we've done so this is an
example of that here's another example
of a year inspired companding algorithm
I'm showing you a very noisy spectrum
yeah so I don't know if you can see it
but this has a lot of intentional junk
in it and I believe it's a spectrum of
the spectrogram of the word Sun so you
have time on the x-axis and the spectral
channels on the other because the year
has a very clever nonlinear gain control
algorithm called two-tone suppression it
actually sharpens up and cleans up the
spectrum without degrading resolution so
it turns out by copying that we were
able to create an algorithm and that
algorithm has now been actually tested
on deaf patients and shown to improve
their perception of speech in noise so
what I've told you so far is
bio-inspired stuff there's a bunch of
stuff that we do in my lab that isn't
bio-inspired that it's just raw
engineering that you have to do to get a
cochlear implant to work I'll feature of
three of these the latest one is an
energy recycling adiabatic stimulator so
it turns out that when you stimulate the
nerve you have to get a charge balance
and have an AC pulse when you're going
down and then coming back up so my
students got orphaned was able to figure
out that if you actually copied some of
the ideas of recycling the energy that
show up in breaking cars so you know
that in hybrid cars when you break and
you reverse the direction of
acceleration you can recycle some of
that energy store it and then use it
again so
we were actually able to copy that idea
electrically recycle the energy store it
and stimulate in an adiabatic fashion so
that the power supply voltage was always
just higher than needed to stimulate and
adapted it turns out mitochondria do
this as well in an adiabatic fashion and
so by combining the energy recycling the
adiabatic nature and feedback current
regulation we were able to reduce the
power of neural stimulators by a factor
of two and a half to three and
potentially we could get order of
magnitude improvements in the future
this is very important because deep
brain stimulators cardiac pacemakers
cochlear implants many brain implants of
the future will can all use such a
stimulator my student park built the
world's lowest power a neural amplifier
it's a micro power neural amplifier and
that allows you now to do closed loop
systems so that you don't just stimulate
them but you can see what happens and
then telemeter the system out through
back telemetry my student michael Baker
figured out how to do very
energy-efficient Wireless recharging
that was set by the fundamental limits
of physics so that's very energy
efficient and my former student Sam Yuji
Mamdouh figured out how to do very
energy efficient wireless telemetry at
one nano Joule per bit impedance
modulation so you could both send data
into the brain or into a cochlear
implant and get data out of the brain or
out of cochlear implant and he did it by
using a technique called impedance
modulation so that there's very little
heat dissipation inside the tissue you
basically short or open your circuit
inside the tissue and you measure the
impedance change that's reflected
outside so most of the power dissipation
of the telemetry is on the outside Wow
five minutes says Tim which means okay
I'm gonna have to somehow make it why
don't we say seven it's a prime number
they're both prime okay so I'm gonna
erase a little bit but we take the kinds
of systems that we built and we put them
together and we test them in animals in
collaboration with other researchers so
for example this is a friend of mine
professor Michael fee at MIT who's a
neurophysiologist
he took one of our wireless neural
stimulators and stimulated the brain of
a bird with it and you can see the bird
is normally singing and then we
stimulated so it goes gggggg teach we
stimulated and stop singing which means
we have a wireless remote
trol on the song of the bird and we can
turn it off when we want now this might
sound cruel to you but actually the
birds are much happier because they
don't have a wireless umbilical cord
when they're being recorded and studied
and so they can actually sing more and
they're free to move around the cage and
we only stimulate them every now and
then when they start singing and they
get confused and then they restart
singing again it's just they send a what
they get stimulated but this proves
basically that you can't stimulate and
get an effective in the brain like
people were saying so that's one of the
systems this is another system that's
geared more towards paralysis and
blindness so here in blindness we're
actually stimulating other regions of
the brain the lateral geniculate nucleus
or the v1 rather than the retina and so
this system needs to get data out of the
brain and so we use our system with the
neural amplifier and such and we test it
on monkeys since I've only got five
minutes I'm going to move on and I'm
actually going to move on in a slightly
different direction now and I've many of
the talks have suggested that electrical
stimulation of nerve in the heart in the
brain in the muscle is going to
basically be very therapeutic in
medicine and so their electrical
engineering is a very obvious
application in these three medical
systems because they are electrical but
what I want to focus on now is I want to
tell you that I believe actually
electrical engineering applies to the
entire body because the entire body is a
circuit and I'm going to show you that
because the entire body is a circuit if
you think of it as a circuit you can
actually do all kinds of medical
therapies including gene therapies where
you bring the principles of circuit
design like I've told you with analog
circuits to change it so let me start by
telling you first of all well why the
cell is a circuit this is the circuit of
a cell so all of you think your cells
are some dumb little 1 micron sized
things on your skin that are doing
whatever they're doing it turns out
they're the most brilliant
supercomputers on the planet a single
cell and I'm just showing you one over
here has got complex signals that are
coming in complex signals that are going
out this looks like a PC board to an
electrical engineer there's a program
that triggers the cell to commit suicide
when it's when it thinks it's got cancer
or DNA damage or is in
affected by the virus if the glucose
level goes up and it's a beta cell it
might release insulin there all these
pathways with feedback loops and
redundancies and hybrid analog digital
circuits that make the cell work if you
look at the specification of a cell our
world's best super nanotechnology
computer looks like a kindergarten piece
of crap so for example here is the
specification of a cell ten micron
overall style this is a mammalian cell
and e.coli cells better 10 to the 7 ATP
consuming biochemical operations per
second which means a single cell in your
body is consuming about a Pico watt and
you have a hundred trillion of them so
the brain it turns out is impressive
energy compared to the energy efficiency
of a computer the compared to the energy
efficiency of an average cell a neuron
is actually very power hungry its power
consumption is more like 0.6 nano watts
so if you look at the 30,000 no gene
protein molecular network that you can
build in a cell with nanoscale devices
the reason it sounds very impressive is
it's 20 kt per molecular operation so
even at the end of Moore's law at 2035
or whatever nobody thinks we're going to
do better than a hundred two thousand KT
and right now we're doing something like
10,000 KT to ten to the five KT in our
advanced nanotechnology devices so the
cell is working with humongously small
amounts of energy at the nano scale with
these elementary biochemical molecular
operations at point three six nanometers
difference in a base pair so for example
of a transcription factor binds and
moves over a slightly little bit on the
DNA you're going to get a retinoic acid
receptor versus a vitamin d receptor and
so it turns out it's a nano scale device
self-assembled and it does additive
manufacturing why does the cell do
additive manufacturing well it's got an
alphabet of the amino acids it's
digitally encoded in the DNA it combines
them together with the amino acids to
make whatever it is you want all
combinatorial expressions and the
interesting thing is its attitude answer
practice the thing that you made can
come back and affect what it is you made
and degrade it so that you can have a
very complex program that's built up in
the cell and I mean the most obvious
example about this is the self-assembly
of a human baby you start out nine
months later after forty-seven cell
divisions one fertilized egg cell goes
through this comp
program of differentiation and
self-assembly and additive manufacturing
to actually make a human which is just
phenomenal so if you look at this you
see that the cell is really quite
amazing and the reason I'm focusing on a
cell is I think it's underappreciated
it's very appreciated that our brains
are amazing but it's not appreciated
that our cells are amazing and the brain
has actually inherited a lot of this
amazing stuff so it turns out that
fortunately cells and electronics have a
very very deep connection to each other
so if you look at a particular region of
operation called sub-threshold
electronics and you look at how
biochemical binding reactions in a cell
work reactants make products and there's
an energy barrier to them and an enzyme
is a molecule that lowers the energy
barrier so in a chemical reaction when
the enzyme comes in the rate of flow of
going from chemical reactants to
products increases the rate of flow of
going from products to reactants
increases as well because the energy
barrier is lowered the difference
between the two molecular flows causes
the net rate of the chemical reaction
the passat noise of the forward and the
reverse flows causes the noise of the
reaction if you look at how a transistor
works an electron starts out at the
source of the transistor which is one of
the terminals you hook up to a gate
voltage acts like an enzyme it lowers
the energy barrier it increases the rate
at which an electron goes from source to
drain and gives you an electronic
current it also increases the rate at
which an electron starts out at the
drain and goes back to the source to
give you an electronic current the
difference between the two electronic
currents is a net electronic current
like the net rate of the molecular
reaction and it turns out the noise is
the sum of the two shock noises of the
forward and reverse electronic current
so by realizing this deep analogy
between biochemical binding reactions
which are ubiquitous in cells cell-cell
interactions hormone interactions
neuronal interactions we rise we could
basically build a digitally programmable
analog computer that could mimic these
reactions and lightning fast in a
compact fashion create what the chem
biochemical reaction pathway might be
doing so in this particular case we were
just limited by how fast we could take
data off the chip but we could already
get a speed-up of about 30 X in our
simulation time now the reason this is
important is for many sister
biology diseases like cancer and
diabetes we actually want to understand
what is going on in all of these paths
lives which are very susceptible to
noise and stochastics and drug
treatments will work on one cancer cell
but not another cell and it turns out we
cannot even simulate with our
supercomputers 30 stochastic variables
in reasonable time for example a six
state variable nonlinear stochastic
dynamical system in the cell would take
seven hours to stimulate in Kapaa C so
this means that we can actually instead
build an analogue supercomputer that
mimics these reactions that's digitally
programmable and actually build an
analog supercomputer for synthetic
biology and systems biology and also for
simulating neurons and this shows you
that we can go in the other direction as
well we can take a circuit in bacteria
that was built by my postdoc and this is
a circuit in a bacterium that's
basically making a particular protein
and that protein acts as a transcription
factor and then you can measure the GFP
and it Maps very directly to an
elementary almost freshman electrical
engineering analog circuit that you
would study and it's actually very
beautiful in symmetry as well meaning if
you have a repressor that's D repressed
the current goes left left if you have
an activator the current goes right
right exactly like the biology works and
so you can see that we can actually
match the biological fluorescence data
very nicely with these analog circuits
this is actually showing you that a
MATLAB and the circuit simulation as
well as the actual data from a bacterium
are all the same and so we're now
attempting to actually build analog
supercomputers that can be used for
rapid simulations of synthetic biology
if you want to genetically re-engineer a
cell for certain diseases or for systems
biology to understand what is going on
and figuring out what particular nodes
and genes that when knocked out may have
some problem just like an engineer would
go to a PCB and say what's wrong the
circuits not working is this node
charted is it open is that over
expressed is it under expressed and it
turns out that many of these techniques
were figured out in analog circuit
design quite a long time ago so Tim how
am i doing one minute Wow was that with
the seven or the five
Oh next frame number okay so I'm gonna
summarize what I said and there were
three big insights biology is not a set
of ones and zeros it's actually got soft
and hard nonlinearities and that's one
of its great powers and its ability to
learn and compute within an energy
efficient fashion so you can give me
anything you want and if you don't limit
the energy time and amount of materials
it takes to do it and the precision of
your computation I don't care so when
somebody told me that Kasparov had
whatever deep blue had beat Kasparov or
some other computer beat him
my question is reduce the computer to
the size of two pizza slices have it
compute with fourteen point six watts of
power and those number of devices and
then let's see if that computer can take
on Kasparov or the jeopardy champion
because if you don't equate energy time
and space and computation is free that's
not a fair comparison there's a deep
link between energy and information and
information is represented by the states
of physical variables so anything you
say about how information is processed
deeply ties into the energy and that's
kind of the big theme of a book that I
recently wrote that showed for example
that there are ten universal principles
of low power design and they apply
whether it's analog digital biology
electronics or cars in fact many of the
principles of low power design can be
used to design a low power car and the
reason trains are efficient over cars is
because they work in a slow and parallel
fashion just like electrical circuits
work in a slow and parallel fashion and
are efficient so the deep theme that I
want to come back to is that there's a
connection between biology and
engineering and a positive feedback loop
you really if you deeply understand the
biology you can get insights to design
interesting engineering systems like the
RF cochlea in these hybrid
analog-digital ways you could take those
insights and improve the design of
circuits in medicine and devices in
medicine and you can go back the other
way you can then say oh I've got these
interesting circuits now can I go in and
re-engineer a cell can i stimulate it
electrically chemically with inducer
molecules and fix it circuit so in my
view the entire world is an analog
circuit and when I say the entire world
is an analog circuit I don't mean just
some part of the world I mean mechanics
chemical chemistry physics I know I can
do quantum make
with an imaginary capacitor all of
circuit design and electrical
engineering and I think it is the right
abstraction language for understanding
biology because it's not overly complex
simple like a logic gate or overly
complex like a differential equation you
actually have these pictorial right
brains of ways of understanding things
that you can map to both therapies in
medicine and for designing interesting
engineering architectures so I think I'm
gonna say thank you time for a few
questions from the floor hi that was
fascinating
a great talk to end the morning with I'm
Douglas ak from Google and I'm wondering
if you could comment on the cost of
producing the the analog digital package
for the cochlea and and how might that
show up in our cell phones or other
consumer electronic devices a few years
down the road to save us some power and
give us better better microphones yeah
that's actually a very good question so
it turns out many of these analog
systems can be fabricated in very
ancient technologies for example this
one was done in one and a half micron so
the cost of a one and a half micron
technology for a big die size is very
very cheap and in fact it's better to
not use the most aggressive technology
node in these analog systems so it turns
out the costs are cheap silicon can be
made in Moscow so easily 15 cents six
cents per square millimeter this is much
less because the technology is lower and
so it turns out that by doing that you
also reduce the cost of the DSP as well
as the ADA D and that's because they
don't have to work at such high
bandwidth you can now do a lower power
digital system or a lower power ADA T
that's working at slower speed and
slower position so that's one of the big
advantages in thinking of it as a system
and re partitioning the analog digital
divide so that the analog is doing a lot
of the gory computation and then handing
it off to the digital later so that's an
excellent question unclear
on commercializing some of this for
medical devices but certainly many of
these things can be used in audio
devices cell phones the compounding
algorithm I told you has been applied in
speech recognition for improving speech
recognition in front ends that are
robust and noise we've also made
electronic vocal tracks and we've put
the vocal tract in a feedback loop with
hearing processors so that you have a
motor representation of what you're
saying that makes again the speech more
robust in noise so many of these analog
systems of applications and consumer
gadgets as well great talk again I mean
I everyone's gonna say that but when
when I see the the you're talking about
the cell and I guess that's a really
interesting approach and people should
be using that when they're shutting down
pathways yeah it's like that understand
it as well but you have I keep seeing 30
equations 30 unknowns and what you're
talking about and how do you get good
enough data to think that someday that
you're gonna be able to figure out
what's going on to have that many
variables that you know that much about
yeah that's an excellent question and it
turns out that even if you don't have
data you can use this as a rapid
exploratory tool just like for example
circuit designers do not know the
threshold voltage of every transistor
you build you actually purposely go in
and design and simulate saying well if
there's a mismatch I have this feedback
loop that will calibrate it and you have
some rough range statistically of where
the KDS will be so just like we don't
know the synaptic weight of every neuron
in our brain you know and we're not
going to and figure it out we're not
going to know that's the KD the
equivalent in the cell of every single
KD but many designs now in synthetic
biology and systems biology are looking
at it just like neuro scientists study
the brain and saying well even if we
don't know the KD
this is a positive feedback loop it's a
high loop gain that means it's going to
oscillate or it's going to have high
gain and it's not going to do that so
you use it as an exploratory or simulate
Ori tool to actually tell you oh what if
I change the KD artificially by doing
this what will happen and are you tested
so you have to have a feedback loop
between the design the theory the
simulation and the biological
implementation that cycles back time for
one more question
Witney Colella Pacific Northwest
National Labs thank you for a very
interesting topic I'm in the front row
here I was well okay I'm just curious to
understand a little bit better if the
cochlear implant works for the hard of
hearing or deaf for whom the hairs on
the inner ear are damaged or gone and if
not what our research approaches for
addressing that group yeah so it works
for the profoundly deaf who have more
than say 80 to 90 DB of hearing loss
otherwise you could try and get away
with a hearing aid usually hearing aids
don't work well beyond 60 DB of hearing
loss but even if you've lost your inner
hair cells as long as the spiral
ganglion dendrites are intact it works
for many deaf people and the reason
those spiral ganglion dendrites are
often intact is they're protected in
this bony case and so the cochlea is
actually a very unique organ in that
many of the biological structures are
well protected naturally so even though
you've lost all your hair cells the
outer hair cells in the inner hair cells
as long as you have a few surviving
dendrites on the spiral ganglion you're
okay and in fact if you use it's kind of
a use them or lose them because if you
do if you keep using them and they keep
sending information to the brain they're
more likely to stay intact so people are
also looking at releasing drugs like
BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor
which will actually promote the growth
of these dendrites to get closer so that
when you stimulate it you lower your
stimulation thresholds so the answer to
your short answer to your question is
yes it does work thank you so let's
think
