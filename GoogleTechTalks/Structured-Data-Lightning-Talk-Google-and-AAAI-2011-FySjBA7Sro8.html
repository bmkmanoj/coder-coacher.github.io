the name of the group ordinarily we
would have been called the database
group database business group but that
doesn't sound cool enough I would get a
spot in this you need to talk to you
guys I'm sure half of you actually
started your career wanted to be
database people but you could make it
through your impersonated a scores
because you fell asleep as i can
probably doing that would be that if i
called we call the group the database
group we would be in charge of three
quarters of all of google and my
stressful enough for them that sort of a
there's big table there's indexing
database we have a lot of databases
google so what we actually do in this
team is we look at the structured data
that is on the web what i'm going to do
in this very very quick time to show you
that there was a lot of structured data
that exists on the way that you want to
do very cool stuff with it and that's
what we're trying to do ok so like peter
said we're following up my view is
coming unlike previous decade now the
age of structured data and we can you
start to feel better than ever before so
i want to say one other words we're sort
of a combination of AI databases ok so
this the kind of things that we need to
employ in order to solve the problems
which I saw are actually a combination
both of these fields and love that okay
so let me give you a few examples of the
kind of structured data that exists on
the way at the end that you can that you
could leverage in certain so for example
if you did a search for birthday to
Barack Obama you could actually find
that that he was born we decided
birthday and the way you can do that is
you can find a lot of sentences on the
web that actually mentioned that tax act
okay and looking at how often they
appear and whether they appear in the
top results that Google produces
whatever you can actually highlight the
fact that you can come to a conclusion
this is actually a pretty good result to
highlight in your search result so this
is the structured data that is extracted
from text okay so that's one example a
second example is you have got a lot of
data sitting there on the web in tangles
so last time I count it count I count
every day if you look at the number of
tables that exist on the way of just an
HTML form high quality what you would
call relational tables you have about I
would say 200 million of them and that's
only in English okay that's about five
orders of magnitude more than any
database system has ever had to deal
with in terms of the number of cables
that it's not a particularly interesting
table that's just an example of the
table in there you know a lot of them
like that when the web started everybody
started talking about the Deep Web so we
have you know a lot of forms that are
actually hiding a lot of really good
structured data behind us so that's
another source of a lot of structure
data i would estimate something on the
order of 20 30 million really really
good forms that high-quality content and
the Deep Web presents its own
challenges we have an effort called
Google public data where we actually get
public data from a variety of government
organizations and we annotate the hell
out of it and choose if we should clean
it with all kinds of things and we
produce visualizations that are very
easy to to use by anyone this is
probably the only place on the web where
you can find a reason to move from
California to New Jersey New Jersey is
lower an apology served with people that
part of the world they have less
unemployed we have more unemployment
here okay this is an example of a
product called Google Fusion Tables that
comes out of my team where we make it we
make databases sexy okay so we make it
very easy for people to take their data
put it into the cloud manage it create
beautiful visualizations and publish
them anywhere you want okay and the key
point is you don't have to be a database
geek or know any database geeks in order
or pay any database Keats in order to do
this we're trying to make it very easy
so anybody has an interest in their own
deck that can do that so this is the
wall street journal that took a user
system to make a nice visualization of
the latest census data okay exactly
guardians from the UK the guardian
newspaper just won an honorable mention
for an award for innovation in
journalism for using rizon tables that's
kinda cool if you had any doubts about
the importance of structured data on the
web so this is about data provided by
the government of Australia this shows
you all the public toilets in Australia
as varied about the thing is it on a lot
in Tasmania a lot a lot in Tasmania okay
but if I had me when I put this up i was
actually here and prepared this bird
talk that I gave in Australia and all of
a sudden the audience just like you
burst up and laughter for much longer
time and you know I sort of felt like
I'm not part of this party and when I
finally asked them what the heck is
going on here apparently you see this
man here this is taz mania and so
apparently this visualization confirms
all the stereotypes that Australians
have about we have so we had over all of
this data on um ok and so what do you
want to do with it what a planing is the
main thesis underlying our team is that
we're not doing a very good job at
creating the city ecosystem and
unstructured data on the web so the
first thing you want to do is you want
to discover it you want to be able to
say you know public toilets on Australia
you want to something they come up right
so we're not very good at discovering
structured data on the web what is
actually relevant to our queries we also
want to when we hit that data even if
it's sitting on a web page that's not
good enough we want to actually manage
it we want a filter we want to do all
kinds of things we didn't create
visualizations you want to visualize
that you want to enhance it you want to
ask maybe harder queries like give me
public for this on Australia that are
close to be the pubs or something I
don't know something useful like that if
I if you have a piece of structured data
that is useful to you you may want to
find related data if you an example this
in the moment and obviously the dream is
to integrate data from multiple sources
because that's when data really comes
alive and gets really cool so I am a
party not profess document so i have a
data set sail on this is where coffee is
being produced
pretty clear pattern now I want to find
somebody else who knows about where cost
is being consumed in the world and you
realize that a bunch of Scandinavians
are drinking a lot of coffee that ok so
the ability to actually find was like
the biggest sets is is a tool that will
enable people trying to get more value
out of their data comfortable and
conclusions all that great stuff this is
an example that was created by somebody
again using Fusion Tables just after the
japan earthquake what they did this guy
took the data about all the earthquakes
in the wall since 1973 and put it on a
map so red is where you have a lot of
risk waiting ok not a good place and the
purple points are where all the nuclear
reactors in the world are this is like
after the meltdown of the actors in
japan and this this is the best example
I know of the power of data integration
you want to know where to buy your next
house ok so when you can start putting
data together like that find it on the
web put it together then you're starting
to create an ecosystem around around
structure bigger than so what are the
challenges here the problem is that
there are all these hundreds of millions
of greatest great data sets but none of
these people stay awake during their
database courses ok something didn't
even try to go there so there is no
schema there is no integrity constraints
there's nothing that you know database
maybe these people take for granted and
there were we don't even know what the
data is about the data is embedded in
textual pages where the description of
what the relationship represented by the
table might be somewhere in text it
isn't thanks but nobody tells you where
is and the most important thing about
this data which is very different than
what database you need to do is they
lays it up everything ok in a day than
traditional database i decided i'm going
to create a database about you know on
company and its employees right so I
know pretty much what I'm going to be
talking about but in on the web thing is
about everything and nobody tells you
what it's about and so you can't create
a scheme of emotion of schema that is so
central
existence has to be thrown out the
window okay open the window here I would
do it for you okay so let me just show
you the one really nifty trick that we
do to try to address this problem or
some of these problems so here's a table
okay and I looked at these things and I
had no idea what these things are okay
I'm not a biologist okay and so when
when when a search engine looks at this
it also doesn't know what these things
are which makes it harder for it to
retrieve this angle for relevant hurts
however you can look you can use things
like hers patterns and try to find where
you know green ash appears on the way
and you will find in those if you only
two hours building two examples that you
know green ash is actually mentioned in
census that talk about species and talk
about North American species so if you
find enough occurrence of occurrences of
these Inditex on the way metal start and
start seeing that all these values or a
large majority of these values are
actually mentioned as North American
species and now on sudden can add
another very valuable semantic
information to this table that this is
talking about North American species ok
so again here what we're doing is we're
using the multitude of texts on the web
to my information that enhances our
understanding of the tabular data on the
web so this is a kind of it okay so done
and inexperienced references here is one
active some of this will be available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
