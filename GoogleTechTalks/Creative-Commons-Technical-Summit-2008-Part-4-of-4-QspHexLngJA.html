going to be me doing a whole lot of
talking if everything works out
according to plan it's going to be you
guys doing a lot of talking and maybe
I'll help guide it along a little bit so
we've heard some very interesting stuff
from the folks working on registries and
what we want to do now is pop up a level
and ask all of you you know our
technology friends and partners about
our strategy for copyright to point o
registries to point o what is the what
should be the goal of this kind of
technology and there are four questions
that I've prepared let's see here first
question is what do we we not creative
commons we as a people need out of
copyright to point o registry to point o
so think about users and publishers what
are we looking and for in terms of
features the answer could be nothing i'm
perfectly happy with the state of the
web or it could be quite a drastic set
of tools and and and questions we'd like
some kind of system to answer for us and
then what are the collaborative
technologies technology efforts rather
that will that are needed to get this to
come about so lots of startups are going
to happen lots of stars are going to
build technologies around this kind of
stuff but what are the collaborative
efforts that would really push this
along and then here's one very important
question what role should Creative
Commons not play in this right we but
there a lot of people have asked us to
do various things in this in its realm
but the first question we have to
address is where do we just stand back
and just not even try to do anything
because either the startups in the
market will take care of it or it's not
our place what are the things we
shouldn't do and then are there any role
is there any role that maybe we should
play in this process and this is really
meant as in
open-ended set of questions to get your
feedback get your thoughts we have no
answers to these questions so why don't
we start with the first one so what we
have is we have mics that are going
around you don't have to get up I think
we do right yes so just raise your hand
and our fantastic interns will bring you
a mic and you can say what you want or
you can scream it if you can scream loud
enough what do we need out of copyright
two point O registry to point o pic
aside maybe you're a publisher or you're
a user from that point of view what do
you want a definition sorry we're ah
yeah Fred from Creative Commons but I
curious what people's opinions of
copyright two point O would be I mean in
Creative Commons is kind of an obvious
of this example maybe and maybe not I
don't know so you're saying Creative
Commons is copyright two point oh ok
yeah it's creative commons enough we
need more this is a gunner from Adobe so
I've been thinking about this stuff for
a while and I think what's the missing
ingredient for copyright 2.0 is is I
think trust and we were just having this
discussion that it's really important
that the relationship I think when I
step back and look and see what we're
trying to do here is you have basically
a somebody who's offering up content
somebody who wants to use the content
could be buyer could be seller if it's a
commercial thing but essentially you're
establishing a relationship between
means to people through the media and
through the license and the
infrastructure and when I listen to all
these panelists today I think you know
trust was mentioned once or twice but I
think fundamentally getting getting to
enabling that level of trust is we're
going to be really important and I don't
know if that's going to be a technical
solution or not I think there's going to
be aspects of it which will be technical
but I think what's fundamentally needed
is going to be a
just education of people in general
about copyright and and I know that
Creative Commons that's what you guys
have been trying to do and I think just
keeping along that path is going to be
really useful yeah a quick question
before we continue Mike do we have we
are we writing this we are we logging
all this now you specifically but that's
the one thing I forgot to check yeah but
I recruited two of them already so I
want to make sure that there's who's is
anybody writing notes taking notes on
this you're on it okay great awesome
awesome so trust Trust is one of the
things you mentioned trust I'll say one
thing you don't have to end you can
answer we can move on trust of what you
mean trust of the of that this is really
licensed under a license it is or trust
trust of what kind yeah so the fee to
the feedback I get when I talk to people
on the commercial side right who are
wanting to use images right for like you
know an advertiser it's like great i
want to go to flickr and get you know
the latest cool images that people are
posting and use that in my advertising
campaign and and then you know the
business side comes in and says whoa now
we can't do any of that because we can't
trust where those images have come from
right even if it is Creative Commons
even then it's like no we don't we don't
know are there model releases I don't
know right and so they end up going to
these ecosystems of trusts that have
been already established like getty
images right everything you pull out of
getty images is trusted because they've
gone through that due diligence right
and and you have to pay for that right
so if we're looking to make things more
Webbie that's great but i think you're
going to also have to then address the
trust issue in a webby context and i'm
just throwing it out there i don't know
what that will mean is there technology
to do that I don't know is it you know
social networks that can be used to to
play a role in there potentially so I
just see that as a need okay so trusting
the sourcing of the content the
licensing of the content and such yeah
for the use and I'd like to I'd like
say the same thing a different way which
is I think what we need is we need a
much stronger concept of safe harbor
around actions and i have blogged a lot
about the dichotomy between the
industrial model the model i'm using is
michael pollan's omnivore dilemma where
he talks about the industrial model of
breaking everything down into its finite
elements versus the sustainable model
where there really is a holistic thing
in soil is more than the component then
the sum of all the fertilizers and
chemicals and and other things and this
element of trust is potentially a way of
building it up in the industrial model
piece by piece what is the right what is
the use what is the context let's get to
lawyers and argue about it safe harbor
is a concept that basically says you
know what there is an actual community
norm that is acceptable enough so that
all of society can look at actors within
that safe harbor and basically say you
know what bringing lawyers into this
situation is just not going to be
productive and I believe that we will
fail if we try and reduce our efforts to
fit the industrial model even if that is
the premise of the whole legal system
and we will succeed if we cast it in a
in a community context where this safe
harbor and and other organic processes
have strength even when the individual
rights themselves cannot be properly
described or delineating so are you
linking this back to sort of the
original permission by default idea that
Creative Commons pitched at the
beginning so you have some permissions
by default not not only that but I think
that that you know in the same way that
that that Larry Lessig put on a call on
his blog to going and argue against the
the Sean Bentley arfin works active 2008
which is yet another example of trying
to reduce everything down to an
industrial element and then stick it in
some government controlled registry what
I think we need when you asked about
copyright to point 0 because we haven't
gotten to the Creative Commons part yet
I think we need to be pushing the agenda
that there are things that people can
expect to be able to do without being
pulled into a system and if they can
demonstrate that they're doing it in
some definition of good faith reasonably
well there's just no money to be made in
chasing them down around the small parts
okay uh there thank you can clap yeah
there was a question the question is not
what's similar to the question I'm
coming to this forum as a pure user of
Creative Commons licensing as a tool
that protects me as a webmaster from any
lawsuits that can that can arise from
the fact that people for whom we're
building websites are uploading their
content so for me I'm looking this as a
kind of one-stop source of getting both
explanation of what users need to say ki
allow people you know to use it in this
way or that way and put kind of some
legal protection and that this applies
not only to music but also once we're
moving towards scientific things like
science Commons is of huge interest what
is the patenting issues what are
scientific implications publishing cop
scientific articles these are my
questions yes and then one quick thing
if you can say your name before you
start what was your name Irina so for
people taking notes yeah hi I'm I'm ha
no Kaiser I'm an attorney I I think that
clearly we should for a copyright two
point oh we really should strive to
reorient the copyright system to what is
original design really was to
incentivize people to create more but we
have to take into account that the means
of production of creative works have
just changed dramatically and so we're
dealing with the situation where
currently which is mortgaging the future
dramatically in order to you know
realize some short terms in the present
and I think for a for a web 2.0 or for
copyright to point oh that just ought to
be different so the default should be
different we should go back I think to
an opt-in system we should go back to
what we should create a copyright system
that has much shorter terms we should
have a copyright system that clearly
exam
derivative works because I think I mean
personally I'm I'm a blogger and I I'm
an academic too so I take so much from
others that the non derivative in a
sense as legal as legal prohibition it's
just so extremely anachronistic that I
think that should be the default rule
should be that you know all derivatives
are permitted and I think in terms of
the safe harbor we should really move to
something like a non-commercial safe
harbor as long as it's non-commercial in
a relatively broadly defined sense it's
fine this is a little footnote about the
creative commons thing that one of my
issues with Creative Commons listed I
don't when I give away my stuff on
creative commons I usually say well it's
fine for non-commercial use but then I
add this long description on my website
what I consider non-commercial use
because it's really difficult to say
what that is and essentially it is if
you want to print five thousand or more
copies of something and make a lot of
money then that's what I consider
commercial but it's still non-commercial
to me if you show up at a conference use
my stuff and you get paid for it or
something and I think this will be a
very difficult line for us to draw in
copyright to point o a materiality
threshold for commercial use and I think
it ought to be relatively I that's very
interesting so some safe harbor for
non-commercial but some difficulty at
defining exactly what non-commercial is
but now yeah yeah please like there's
actually a bill on the Japanese floor
which is similar to what you're saying
which is that all non-commercial use
should be allowed permitted on the
internet without asking for permission
and all commercial use should use the
Creative Commons non-commercial license
that has that requires a certain royalty
to be paid to the license license or
there there are a couple of problems
with it but it's interesting Lee it's
the former head of the motion picture
association of japan who read all of
Larry's books and got converted and
decided to decide the champion this bill
obviously we have a lot of resistance
but that's they're trying to actually
jump past dmca because in Japan we don't
have fair use so we can't so YouTube for
instance has a lot of trouble in Japan
because of that and so instead of
allowing this kind of notice and
takedown they're trying to leapfrog that
into a kind of copyright two point oh
that does exactly what you're trying to
do okay great thanks I'm going to go
this side of the room and I'll be back
yeah we'll just a mention you quit your
name quickly Bren vivir from wikimedia a
slight danger about being really lacks
in the non commercial space is that when
one of those things then wants to move a
little bit into the commercial world you
don't have sort of the paper trail of
where to go to find out who to get
permission from and you know at
Wikipedia we're using a sort of open
source e share-alike license which of
course allows commercial use and that
includes things like say printing an
article into a book and then publishing
it for say people who don't have online
access or just for the convenience of it
so I mean especially with all these
open-source licenses that very
explicitly do not exclude commercial use
having a split between the
non-commercial world and the commercial
world means that then you end up with no
real way to bridge them and I just think
that's a little freaky yeah more on the
yeah definitely lots on the commercial
non-commercial split Mike you're I think
you're next if I'm missing you raise
your hand higher and I'll try not to
miss you see if we can take a slant
towards the registry to point o
technologies if at all if not it's keep
going well so that might Carol I'm on
the board of Creative Commons oh I want
to suggest there's actually a lot of
demand in the in the commercial sector
44 this kind of registry just to
facilitate transactions because even in
the US the US copyright database is
pretty useless for a lot of this so but
I worry about the project then getting
viewed by those interests so you could
say what's the purpose of the registry
if we're doing design implementation it
could be facilitate transactions so make
sure there's enough data to sort of
contact information and other things and
maybe some kind of liability prevention
but I suggest that that's too limited a
version one of the things we learned
with the Creative Commons license is
there a set of interests out there that
are not captured always by the law so
attribution right it's not required
under copyright law but lots of people
want attribution so if a organization
like CC is going to take on this project
we ought to be sort of pushing our
vision of what this is and rather than
being a map a property map I would
suggest if thinking of this is a
creativity map right and wanting to
create an interface that's cheap and
easy for people to use so that they can
register their creativity even if
they're not doing it for the purposes of
entering into commercial transactions or
to limit somebody's liability but to
just to be noticed I created this and
this is who I am right and i want i want
to get recognized for that so i would
some form of recognition publicity
function in the interface would help to
reorient this into a creativity map
rather than a property map so feeding
into the ego aspect of open source and
in some sense yeah any other hi mark
graham from oer commons yeah a couple
things this may seem obvious but a wider
spread use and adoption through greater
visibility and I think approaching this
it a couple of levels one would be at
the tool level where we work more
closely with with a number of common
tools not just the edge cases I mean yes
did the drupal's and the plone zand
other de jangles and all the rest of
that that seems obvious but more like
the vignettes and the interwoven you
know the other kind of systems that
people are using out there to create
content so that marking something up
when appropriate license is simply
pressing a button I was at a conference
last week up in the city about the
a Moodle which is the most popular open
source learning management system
software and is more than 40,000
installs of Moodle but there's nothing
in the Moodle user interface or metadata
for example about Creative Commons so
you know unless these things are very
simple to use people aren't going to use
them and then the second one is that
more at the institutional level so going
after you know the major publishers and
demonstrate some cases in which
materials are in fact marked with
Creative Commons I just noticed for
example that the norwich bulletin is a
newspaper in Eastern Connecticut is
published under the creative commons
license for people in Eastern
Connecticut that's probably the only way
they've ever heard of the creative
commons is on the bottom of the the
local newspaper so you know finding
those strategic ways that you can get
this meme this I'll beat this idea out
there to a large audience that's outside
of Silicon Valley okay since I don't see
any other hands up I think and the time
is right no I there's other hand okay
yeah sorry and then that after this will
transition to question number two I mean
just to follow up on that last comment I
think it's wonderful to there's a lot of
talk here about how to build these
systems but as we've seen with people
using flickr licensed content with
without some education around the
technology which i think you know as a
as a community we're not doing terribly
well at we've we've got a lot of issues
here and i think and i think you know
tying ourselves too closely to
particular technologies in particular
user models when our user base are the
the base of people who use Creative
Commons licenses is inevitably going to
change over time tying to close to who
we have right now as as consumers and
producers of CC licensed content is use
potentially problematic on something to
keep in mind so that's the second vote
for education of the user base which is
always seems to be something that a lot
of people believe is important right
yeah all right
where is it are we transitioning or is
it going to be in between here I'll
change the I'll change the slide but you
can you can say whatever you want
everybody else will be inspired to think
of the next question okay this was
actually on the registry of Brian Roe
legal intern at Creative Commons
although it does apply to this some when
we look at different technologies and I
think it's important that as many
different organizations and different
groups try to tackle this problem that
standards come up again and again
because as someone who may need to clear
rights on things being able to use a
central tool to go to each of those
different registries is much easier if
there's some standardization between the
information that's kept how it's kept
and then how it's pulled out later I
think it's great to have many different
registries working on those but if those
registries can work together in some way
to create some standards around that
information it would be more beneficial
long term so this is great great
transition talking about standards is
one of the possible technical efforts
that's needed here I want to bring a
couple of things together from the
previous question and this one if we
have these registries and you're saying
there's got to be many of them maybe
that's everybody agrees with that maybe
some people think no actually we need
one one big one I I don't know but if we
have these registries are they playing
the role of of trust to to sort of so
that I can trust that this is an image i
can actually use for commercial purposes
are they playing the role of the opt-in
system where they're just a way to say
well if you're not in one of those
registries you really don't have any
rights at all on this content to be to
make it a little extreme what what's the
role and and also in the what you're
saying here about the standards what
should those standards allow so you just
said they should allow you to just
search all the registries at once for
example are there any other anything
else that the standards might be useful
for here or that any other technical
effort might be useful for their just
crush everybody with that long statement
I think I crushed and I need to bring
the puppy back now okay
there we got a mic coming to you so my
name is Eric enzyme with UC Berkeley I'm
just wondering also about how some of
this fits in with larger sort of
ecosystem of the web and where this
might work with say you know people be
concerned about um search engine
rankings and things like that and how
you know we could use registries like
this if people are using providing free
content that's available it's being
attributed a lot how can that feedback
to those individuals so that they can
get some exposure on some of their own
web assets that they might want to be
able to promote by through the use of
these free content and how does that fit
with this concept of a registry or is
everything to be pointing right back to
that registry and then you know the
registry becomes like this big magnet
for all the google searches so it's a
sort of a wonder i'm just wondering
about how all that works together yeah I
have no answers I mean these are good
questions yeah please if hi okay yeah I
shoe Soraya yeah I talked okay so um
basically I don't think that a central
registry is antithetical to attribution
links to people's individual web pages
you can imagine I think it's possible to
imagine well maybe if you can imagine a
website listing every copyrighted work
if you can imagine that much then it's
not too much of a stretch to have that
website list what URL the person must be
attributed with and what name the person
will be attributed with and then when
you use the work you don't necessarily
have to link to that you can link to
them as they want to be attributed
done yeah consistent attribution could
be an incentive to work with the
registry okay let me let me push a
little bit here especially on the folks
who are building registries is there do
you have a model let me ask a simple
question do you need standards is there
a need for a standard in the way you
respond to queries in the way you
represent data I heard some mentions
that you had to come up with your own
XML model because you didn't find the
right one other folks are using it is
there a need for the registries to come
together and think about what a standard
API might be what a standard data format
might be is that is it yeah what I like
about the RDF approach and the CCL
approach is that it's it really depends
on the incorporation of these external
vocabularies I mean it seems like we
don't have a lot of consensus anywhere
in the metadata world except on you know
seven elements in dublin core and even
those are subject to debate so I think
for I mean what's nice about the rdf a
standard is that it creates the
possibility of a framework to sort of
allow the evolution of those of those
sort of namespaces to take place and
people we use what's useful and
eventually will wind up with some
consensus hopefully any other registry
folks want to comment no on standards or
admit yep right there great
yeah we've been registered Commons job
Enzo we've been aware of the the
possibility or the need to possibly
create standards especially as we aren't
the only registry service in the field
and there are going to be more after us
so I think it's with in everybody's
interest at least I think that's our
position to possibly come up with some
way of collaborating and some way of
creating standard policies best use
practices and yeah and I think would be
good for the whole registration system
are there any um you know processes
under way that that you'd mentioned that
we should be getting involved with I'm
not I'm not going to take a bunny out of
a hat here no not uh none that I know
let me throw some more do we need some
kind of Federation of the registries
some kind of way that we can do this one
search box that then goes to all of them
where the registries can autodiscover
each other and whatnot I mean I'm not
saying we should him is this something
that's is this too early for this is it
maybe yeah is Google enough but Google
doesn't really claim sorry no go for it
i will get a mic over here yeah at the
moment anyway I mean Google doesn't
really do a whole lot of you know
claiming that someone has is the owner
or someone as licensed has made
something available under a certain
license of course I guess to wendys
point we don't either we just claim that
they made that claim so my take is that
I think we're missing some half of half
the other half of the equation which is
the publishing an assembly side so when
we look at the way we consume media
right now it's very networked right you
know I go to a web page I click on
things I get lots of information it
quickly comes towards me but from the
published side it's it's less networked
I get one thing I kind of bring it
together it's kind of cut off
from where originally came from and it's
almost as if we need a revolution in the
tool sets to be much more semantically
aware to get to a point where it's
almost like semantic publishing so i can
bring things together but they're still
tethered to where they came from and can
go back there and get the information
that they need whether that's a registry
whether that's a personal registry you
know maybe each website has their own
registry to say this is my stuff here's
how I want it you know viewed and used
and then there are you know aggregators
which are people who then take that
information and offer it up in a broader
context and an ecosystem that's that's
more focus for people who want to to
look for specific things and they can go
into that context like like a music
contact store Jean Reynaud music context
to get that information and then bring
it in but you know that my point is
basically that it the registry is one
half the equation but then it's the
consumption side not so much the
consumption side but the production side
the publishing side that needs to be
enabled as well so you want to
semantically enable the publishers a
little bit more so that they can they
can be more connected yeah I mean I love
our tools to be using Adobe tools of
course any other thoughts on
collaborative technology efforts Luis I
think you want to say something like
maybe you want to say we don't need any
of this I mean standards are good
collaboration is good I mean I think I
mean there there's a bit of a chicken
and egg problem and I wish I knew how to
address that but it seems like you need
people won't create the publishing tools
until until users have something in
their hands that's going to make that
are going to make the publishing tools
interesting right and nobody's going to
write those user side tools until the
publisher side tools are there and I
mean maybe that's an interesting
question for this group to tackle I
don't have a good suggestion on that
chicken and egg problem but it seems
like I is there anybody from Firefox
here well I wants to talk about that
song bird is that right and that will be
solved with that yeah yeah I mean song
bird is part of it for one specific type
of content you know I don't know if
there's generalized solution or not
I'm just a lawyer no no you can't say
that I'm not lawyer yet but soon oh yeah
back on a process that we were working
on I was talking to believe it was Mike
from Creative Commons about the DMP I
don't know if anybody's where the
digital media project but they've set up
a proposed a list of procedural and
operational responsibilities for
registration authorities and agencies
and it might be a good starting point
for the steps that need to be performed
for setting up and running content
registries for an example in the music
industry there's something that's being
used as the global release identifier
the grid scheme has been established by
rights collecting societies and
registered Commons has adopted this same
same grid identifier scheme consisting
of 18 characters issuer issue issuer
code element release number element
check character element identifier
scheme element and we've adopted this
kind of model to allow other registries
to use it as well and so instead of the
grid it's basically an RC identification
element whereas another registry could
come along through exchanging API query
with other registries and and they could
they could also attach this grid element
as well again I'm not I'm not as
technically versed and what's going on
but so this is mostly for identifying
individual for giving an identifier to
individual works right so some standards
are emerging there some stands and other
registries could also use the system
that we've put in place that is is based
on the DMP process as well
ok what's the it so one thing I want to
get back to from the previous panel that
we had is that there Mike was Michael a
doubt this nice partition of the types
of registries some of them are pure
registries meaning you actually do a job
of getting people to enter their data
and you time stamp it and you sign it
and whatnot and then they are these sort
of opportunistic registries like Flickr
is flickering registry I mean they have
content they don't advertise themselves
as a registry there there are they there
are they a registry by by accident
should we get them to adopt one of these
registry standards yeah you don't think
wait I think resist is a system that can
certificated content okay so there's a
lobster Dave so trust is inherent like a
level of trust in in the the statement
is inherent for a registry what if they
started making these stronger sorry you
sure um I know we're sort of thinking
copyright to point o but in the current
state of affairs at least in the u.s.
registering with the US Copyright Office
does buy you something so there's that
there is a technical there's a legal the
legal piece to that that you need to
sort of weigh in and how you take that
responsibility that is legally
recognized I'll with the US Copyright
Office and move it to other registries
is a something to to be so so for a lot
of people in the audience who have a
vague idea that after 1976 registering
doesn't matter what's the what do you
gain from actually registering if you're
what it has to do with eligibility for
statutory damages and I am NOT
personally a lawyer and couldn't get
into the into the integral details but
there is a legal benefit to registering
with the US Copyright Office so or any
other registries are you guys thinking
of helping people register with the
local copyright the the your country's
copyright office if they register with
you is that a way to register with a
copyright office office to know well
copyrights offices is half shell their
own system and it's not but bus is more
simple in Spain comprising resist is
very very simple so doesn't allow many
features that with oh well sure sure you
have more features but if I register
with you do you help your users register
with you know copyright one point oh
also no no difference don't even see
Spain we don't have this is not
compulsory too sinister and when you
have no advantages legally but of course
in the practice yes
yeah I see sorry Wendy yeah yeah just
wanted to follow up on what I think is
an important point about the difference
between the government US government
copyright registry and other kinds of
registries that we might build that it
both gives rights to the copyright
holder and before you can file a
copyright lawsuit you need to have
registered your copyright as well as
giving you the eligibility for statutory
damages and it gives rights to the
general public that if they see a a
registration with the Copyright Office
they know that's reliable and they would
be protected in relying on that even if
somebody had made a wrong wrongly
founded claim to the Copyright Office
they would get the kind of safe harbor
that we were talking about earlier for
innocently relying on somebody's false
statements to the Copyright Office a
registry that we can construct couldn't
offer those things so what it can offer
is a chain of things that people are
willing to say about content and some of
those things might be useful and
reliable and some of them might not be
so we need to as we're thinking about
constructing those registries leave in
enough metadata so that people can
figure out what's the useful data that's
been put in there and how much do they
want to rely on any piece of it
that's kind of a big blind spot here
which is the the government copyright
registry to what extent has there been
any you know involvement between CC and
the Copyright Office in the US or in
other countries and to what extent if
we're talking about collaboration should
this be a collaboration between
government and non-governmental
organizations one of the questions on
the table is what does need to be done
and potentially what might need to be
done by CC although there's only we only
have so much power right but I want to
get back briefly because I I thought I'd
touched a nerve there for a second on
whether flickr should be a registry and
by that I'm you know we talked about
registry as having the issue of
statutory damages but as Wendy just
mentioned it's also the fact that if
you're on flickr then you might have a
license associated with your content and
it would be nice if that protected you
as a content creator from other folks
misusing your content is that do we need
to find ways to use existing web 2.0
user generated content repositories and
to bring them into whatever registry to
point o architecture we're talking about
or do we have to have a model where no
no you go to an official registry
company
so there are two applications people are
going to try to build using registries
one is they're going to want to know
what are all the creative commons works
that might be applicable to this purpose
and they're going to want to know given
this work is it a Creative Commons work
and in both those contexts they're going
to have the the the assumption that when
they get that list back it's going to
apply to them as a player it's going to
understand their own non-commercial
status whether or not they're actually
non-commercial and it and that this
technology will be able to make that
judgment so so the question of how
flickr how somebody like flickr fits
into that i would say that Dearden there
needs to be a specific program a piece
of software that that tells me what all
the creative commons works are in this
field and in any given thing and and and
in flickr is going to have to be in that
pool and probably if flickr isn't in
that pool it doesn't work and then the
other question is is this a Creative
Commons work and and I imagine if you
didn't look in flickr for a jpeg to see
if it was already in flickr and had a
license then again you'd be leaving a
big hole so what do you think well looks
like you're going to say something well
it's not you just raised a very
interesting point which is that the role
of the registry then is not in registry
one point oh we're trying to protect the
original authors rights and if you look
there it's to your own and you find
something your conclusion is going to be
I can't do this I can't use this work
whereas in registry two point oh you
might be using it to find works you can
reuse which maybe this is obvious but it
sounds interesting this is a new purpose
for registry right this is you're trying
to find work to reuse I think if that's
a primary value of Creative Commons but
I also think it's very hard I mean going
back to the woman who mentioned the
difficulty and under
standing a licensing status of something
that user the users had uploaded I mean
I think that there's no practical way
for somebody to start a new photo
uploading site and evaluate the
copyright status of everything that
comes up any yeah hi I'm Robert cook
from freebase yeah I was just trying to
put all these things together and do is
it's been brought up a few times that
flicker or um musicbrainz it seems like
aggregating metadata together and if you
view licenses a kind of metadata it's a
way of promoting your content so in a
way if you say you know this song is on
this album by this artist and you're the
artist and you apply the license at the
same time it sort of one-stop shopping
and if you think of license as a way of
being found if you have an open license
then publishing all that metadata at
once in one place is actually a good
thing makes you findable and I think
that's why flickers been so successful
in a lot of ways is that it's just one
stop shopping you not only publish the
metadata but the content as well and
then you have tags which allow your
content to be found and if you think
about the CC license you're using it's
just another way to be found so I think
that's instead of thinking of registries
as sort of a horizontal layer across all
different kinds of content it might be
better to think of it as something
that's industry or sort of media or
content specific yeah so going back to
the visibility issue that was mentioned
earlier that the registry has a way to
gain visibility and potentially to do it
in a vertical specific way all right I'm
going to transition to the next question
which is obviously quite important in
this stuff we talked about in all these
registries that are being built what
role should we we Creative Commons
absolutely not play or not maybe not
absolutely just what role would you
prefer we not play
I need to throw out some strong man to
you know yeah all right let's start oh
yeah so the issue of non commercial
licensing is a huge topic and in the
community of people who are doing work
related Creative Commons and going to
say it would be good if Creative Commons
helped to calm these fires in particular
I got to say Creative Commons is still
advocating non commercial licensing as
if there was consensus within the
community that this was the right thing
and so we would help if Creative Commons
would you know bring some clarity to
this issue and help a community to
resolve to resolve what's what should be
the right practice big are you are you
implying that we're telling people do
the wrong thing with non-commercial well
I'm implying that um I'm that that may
be true but even these are things that
Creative Commons should stop doing that
things we should okay um I'd like to
throw into that the whole lights and
scheme with the Creative Commons has
helped me a lot helped me build a
non-profit business model that works
rather well and they think it a lot of
respects the Creative Commons isn't
emphasizing the commercial aspect of it
enough I think CC plus is a good start
for that for actually saying hey there
is a way for transition from Creative
Commons content to non Creative Commons
content that's fully paid or what have
you I think there's a lot of people
especially when it go to conferences
such as the future of music conference
and there's a lot of thugs that's being
spewed about with regards to Creative
Commons licenses and I hear people on
panels and then somebody in the audience
says hey Creative Commons is that a good
idea and the people on the panel just
talk a lot essentially a lot of in
my opinion about it and I go speak up
and try and set them straight what
people aren't seeing is that you know
when you put out piece of content it's
an irrevocable license and they kind of
feel like they're signing away their
entire life
if their entire creative everything that
ever going to put out because they have
sort of a bad feeling about copyrights
about contracts with the recording
industry so but i think the creative
comments and that's obviously not
exactly what a common thug should not do
but i think the commons ought to
emphasize a little more that there is a
transition to a creative to a commercial
licensing model because there is money
to be made and i think the creative
commons is a great great way for people
to get their content out there and then
transition from that model into
something where a little bit more money
is flowing in their pocket and i think
that's not a wrong thing so encouraging
we should encourage the kind of business
model you've you found which is to say
you can do creative commons and
commercial stuff there's plenty of
compatible stuff kind of compatible
ideas there yeah if i might may combine
the comments said that Lucas made and
the gentleman from musicbrainz we can
easily actually solve the whole
non-commercial aspect by saying we're
only having the licenses without the
whole non-commercial issue and if you
want to make sure that you can use it
commercially then we're going to use the
CC plus licenses so basically CC could
encourage the whole either share the the
content or contact the the creator and
try to negotiate for the CC plus options
then you would have not so much issues
anymore with the non-commercial vs
commercial definition which is like a
big issue you can fit can you yeah joey
is mentioning that CC plus isn't
actually a license it's a combination of
a license plus potentially some I know I
know okay it's just that I think if you
if you remove the option of commercial
or non-commercial option which is a
definition issue which has been a
definition issue since the beginning of
the CC licenses and I'm I know you can
use it as a strategic advantage as well
I mean because there is not a consensus
about the definition but in order to
strengthen the commercial
aspects of the CC licenses you could say
remove the non-commercial option and
instead of that promote the CC plus
extra options yeah so why don't you want
to F well I have a quick question would
that do you mean that you would have a
baseline of a non-commercial license but
with CC plus to define the commercial
terms or baseline of an attribution
license no no not really let me just
define CC plus just so in my key you can
correct me when I'm wrong but CC plus
just means framework for a second
license or more more than licenses other
than the CC license that would apply
when the CC license doesn't apply so
it's most commonly used in conjunction
with the non-commercial license because
of non-commercial license just says here
are the things you can do in
non-commercial but we're not going to
say anything about the commercial use
and so the CC plus lets you say and
here's the license for the commercial
use so I don't really know what I mean
what would be the how could you remove
the non-commercial and also but then use
the plus I I guess I'm confused okay um
what I what I what I try to explain I'm
still trying to wrap my head around it
as well is that as far as I as I
understood noncommercial is not being
defined there's not a consensus
definition of what is commercial what is
not commissioned a commercial for
instance if I take a very concrete
example and in the Netherlands you have
the public broadcasters who get a lot of
money from the government still there
public broadcasters are these profitable
businesses are these commercial entities
or are they non commercial entities
because they provided public service
it's really hard to define that
definition for for organizations like
that these kind of entities but if you
if you say there is no such option as
commercial non-commercial you just have
like the GPL you have
either you share the material under an
attribution share-alike license or if
you don't want to share you just go and
negotiate the new license under the CC
plus options I think that would be a
good solution ok Mike I think you want
provide some clarification right sure
and if I have a brainstorm while I'm
talking I'll tie it back to registry but
I don't promise anything so actually
going back to what Lucas said I think
they're really he's really talking about
two different debates and one is what
does what does non-commercial mean if
you if you license something under a
non-commercial license what uses are you
actually prohibiting and permitting and
then the other debate is should people
be using non commercial licenses at all
and I guess jorn also touched on both of
those things and we realize both of
those are contentious on the the first
what does not what does non-commercial
mean it's an ongoing conversation we we
put out draft guidelines that are just
discussion draft guidelines a couple
years ago and we'll be doing some
academic studies on on what people's
expectations are coming up but
personally I am I think people focus on
this you way too much if you as a user
want to use content and you think that
you might have some reason to be
considered commercial user there's
plenty content that explicitly allows
commercial you so like stop stop whining
about what non-commercial means and find
content that doesn't have that
restriction on it but I'm not I'm not a
lawyer I'm not whining is a normal legal
term okay so but but on into on the
other point we've been careful over the
past year to draw some distinctions
between con between licenses that are
that our open source like in that they
they meet some definitions of freedom
you can look at freedom to find work for
one of those so with some branding that
sort of delineates between those that
are clearly sharing licenses or commons
licenses whatever you want to call them
and those that have restrictions that
though those people don't consider to be
truly contributing to the comments or so
that that would be the non-commercial no
derivatives restrictions but and so on
this unjust just to be clear that are
two totally separate totally separable
debates there and you don't have to be
involved in the debate just use whatever
whatever works whatever actually works
for you and on the CC plus point it is
very easy to think of the use case being
there's something under a non-commercial
license and I'm at the same time going
to offer some private license that
allows me to make a commercial use
however there are a lot of other East
cases for example something could be
under just an attribution license but
the service you're offering is it use it
without or you're offering a private
license that would allow use without
attribution or offer some kind of
identification although it sounds like
people weren't interested in offering
that share alike is another if you have
something that's under attribution-share
alike so permits commercial use people
may not want they might want to make a
derivative work and not abide by the
share alike and that's in fact roughly
like what a bunch of open-source
companies do with the GPL so there's
good precedent there although they don't
have something called open source plus
but so this is it effectively
effectively that's what it is so this
joins back to the point that was made
earlier the idea of doing a share like
that's what you were saying right share
alike license with a seat with a CC plus
in case you don't want the share alike
constraint basically that's right and I
mean even if never mind offering the
identification a lot of users just need
to
a signed agreement you know with paper
and in that that's another nice game so
another comment towards the
non-commercial bit and they lack of
definition I actually spoke with Larry
about this and this is actually a good
thing so the way he explained it to me
is that the non-commercial part simply
means as long as there's no money
changing hands you're okay to use it as
soon as money starts changing hands
you're not okay to use it however the
people that the copyright holders that
are defining the licenses at this point
should actually go and actually define
what is an okay non-commercial use so
you're talking about say the Netherlands
broadcaster that may be kind of a
difficult thing to put into perspective
what the creative comments is looking at
but I think in this particular case the
the Netherlands broadcaster can say we
see this this this and this as
acceptable uses that are considered as
non-commercial go don't bother us with
it everybody else needs to come talk to
us and that's largely the basis that
musicbrainz is doing it with as well
there's certain certain things where
you're free to go ahead and use it
otherwise you need to come talk to us so
this uncertainty doesn't need to
necessarily be a negative thing you can
actually put a little definition that
fits your context into the into place
that actually then take some of that
uncertainty out because you're in
control of defining what's going on so I
view it as a positive as not as a
negative all right so I take away one
important lesson which is that we still
need to think about how to explain at
least the non commercial commercial line
since that has raised a number of
questions we're technically at the end
of our time what I'd like to do is pop
up for a second and say if there are any
general thoughts closing comments things
you really wanted to get in we can
probably take one or two more questions
but we do need to wrap up about
registries Creative Commons I didn't
even have to throw any straw men but is
there anything that you anything more
you'd like us to do specifically in the
registry direction and if not we can
also wrap it up
alright I won't push them thanks
