talking about something a little bit
different I'm going to be talking about
actually building your own extension for
joomla and in particular the area of not
only just building the extension but
actually publishing it out to the
community one of the things that we had
found over the last year is we've
actually written probably six or seven
at least different extensions for
various different purposes but the vast
majority of the original ones were for
specific customers for specific purpose
and really once we had got him developed
and tested we'd use them with the one or
two clients we were doing them for and
that was kind of it and so as we started
creating the new one one called the axe
to web site manager this was the first
one we were actually publishing out to
the community and had to start thinking
about all of the other issues and to be
honest didn't really realize even what
those issues were as we were developing
them and what we have to do to actually
get it out there and to be able to
support it one of the big things with
this extension that I think we're
learning i'm going to say somewhat the
hard way in terms of the amount of code
we've written is that with a lot of the
early extensions we wrote we did it with
pretty much just straight PHP with
minimal integration into the joomla api
and they worked they you could install
uninstall them and everything worked
well what we are realizing the more that
we've gotten involved in the deeper
we've gotten into working with joomla is
especially with the way the API is being
written for one dot five is it actually
adds a lot more work to yourself to not
use their API because one of things is
I've been digging in and working with
the core team on the API is especially
in the areas of things like form
validation if you're asking for input
and different things like that a lot of
the default joomla api's take care of
the trying to stop out the sequel
injections and all of those things you
normally have to write spend your time
figuring out and thinking about a lot of
that's already been done for you so it
actually enables you to write your code
quite a bit faster so one of things I
definitely would recommend if you're
planning on writing extensions at least
maybe say more than one or if you're
writing a relatively complex one or if
it's again for the
enterprise space where security is a big
deal and you're really worried about
that definitely would recommend spending
the time up front to learn the API and
use that right from the beginning
because what you'll find I think is that
the whole process will be a lot easier
for you the extension once we had built
it we got ready to launch it was in the
beginning of August actually we were
planning to launch we had pretty much
all of the original code developed and
one of things we didn't know is we had
no idea what to expect after we put it
up on the extension site what kind of
traffic we could we get how we would get
it out to the community I sort of come
from the traditional business world
where you know once you've created
software created any product the real
work gets out there and trying to market
it and get people to even know about it
and so I wasn't really sure in a open
source community like this do you need
to do the same thing and so we weren't
really sure what to do finally once we
were ready to launch and it was actually
a pretty late night on a Wednesday night
we were finishing up about midnight and
we had probably out say we thought about
another hour hour and a half's worth of
work left to just get the installer to
work and we're running around scrambling
and we thought well let's just go ahead
and submit it to the extensions list
it's going to take a while from two to
approve it for to get up on the site for
anyone to see it and kind of that was a
bad we learned a tough lesson with that
because we literally went up probably a
few minutes before midnight so our first
download at like 12 03 and it didn't
stop there was one at 1205 1208 I was
calling Andy at 12 way going okay we
can't go to sleep we have to get it up
now we're starting to get a lot of
downloads right now because we're
getting picked up by people in Europe so
that was one of the things we really
hadn't thought about was although we
knew that joomla is really international
and and most of joomla juice is outside
of the US i don't think it really had
connected to us that as we were getting
tired and late at midnight it's 8am
people are getting online in other
places and you got to be ready right off
the bat so one thing definitely would
recommend is when you do launch it on
the extension site definitely be ready
right out of the gate for
happening the second thing also that we
learned from doing some experimentation
is one of the best ways to get initial
traffic is from the little list at the
top that's called new extensions I
didn't know how much that was actually
really used but a large percentage of
our traffic happened directly from that
so when people i think and i know i do
it i take an RSS feed of all the new
extensions and when I see ones that are
interesting I go check them out so but
in order to maximize your benefit of
that try to put it up after nine o'clock
at night on the east coast of the US as
strange as that sounds but we I think
the reason and having able to confirm
this is I think that site is hosted on
the east coast of the US the joomla org
site and because of it the server set to
east coast time so it flips over at nine
p.m. california time because of that you
then get 24 full hours on the new
extensions list before it starts moving
down because if you go on it later
points in the day you have less time
before it'll go deeper down the list so
again just a little thing that's sort of
help keep you up sooner because right
off the bat when you knew that's some of
the best time to start getting
visibility and starting to get traffic
and getting people to want to know more
about your extension as i said when we
launched it's been just about a month
and we've reached about 750 actually
registered users and about a thousand
downloads in the first month one of the
things that we were no surprise that was
also starting to see where we were
starting to get pickups beyond just the
joomla org site literally about a week
ago we were going in traffic it sort of
tailed off from the extension site and
all of a sudden we got this huge spike
and no idea where from couldn't find it
we had done anything new on the
extension site and so finally had to go
to Google Analytics and to try to figure
out where all referrals are coming from
found out we were actually picked up on
a site called joomla France org and we
were on the front page of joomla France
and we were getting lots and lots of
traffic directly from that so we had to
start using the google translation
service to try to figure out what they
were saying about us whether it was good
whether it was bad what the feedback
and surprisingly it works pretty well
it's an interesting translations they do
at times would you definitely get the
gist of what what people are saying so
that was the second place we got picked
up noticed also in that list got picked
up from a couple places in Germany one
place actually also in Denmark I think
also had us on there so we're starting
to see it kind of just all over the
world and that sort of led to another
thing that we learn now that we didn't
actually put in when we launched it and
we're now kind of making sure we do that
in a release candidate that's going to
be out probably in another week or so is
making sure it's internationalized right
from the beginning one of them to
definitely recommend when you build an
extension and I most extensions don't do
this and it's not really something
that's overly difficult it's just
something you kind of have to think
about from the beginning he's taking
anything that you're going to actually
echo or print to the screen that people
are going to read and move that to sort
of a separate file that's easily
updatable and makes it sort of modular
because if you do that you can actually
very easily put other languages in on
that file and very easily make it done
for other languages because one of the
things that we've also gotten is people
offering to do the translation services
for us so again one things it's also
very different than what I was used to
in the corporate world is instead of
having to think about paying for that
process of having to get it translated
we'd people in the community very very
willing to say you know are you going to
internationalize it if you do let us
know we'd love to help you and our first
one was literally Turkish of all
languages how was the first place they
wanted to translate it but we've had
ones from from Turkey from France from a
couple of other places so I would
definitely recommend that even if you're
doing a relatively small or relatively
simple component if you can it all
possible try to set it up to be
internationalized because I think you'll
see a lot more traffic just a lot more
use around it and the other thing that I
think that really helps for is unless I
would have really seen out there is
there's two kinds of extensions that go
out there's the one kind which is you
write something it's for a certain use
and you
just sort of throw it out to the
community you're not planning to support
it you're not planning to do anything
with it it's just sort of free code here
it is but you can have to use it however
you want to but if you want to actually
use it as part of a business model or in
some way to develop a community around
it you want to make sure that you
actually work with that extension and
really work with the community who will
be very vocal and really will be very
supportive in the beginning one of these
I was learning responding to a lot of
people was you got really really good
response from people and people really
responded if you just responded to their
emails and one things that I was really
pleasantly surprised about because we
did have a lot of bumps in the first day
or two was how friendly people were with
issues again sort of a very different
world than the corporate world people
didn't come sending you emails
complaining and being very upset with
your changes they would usually come
with here's a suggestion here's how you
might want to fix it or could you just
publish the problem you're having and
maybe someone else in the community can
figure it out for you and we've had a
few people actually trying to solve some
problems for us and it's actually really
helped to start sort of creating a
community around it and getting people
interestings i think one of the things
people respond to best I'm gonna know
for our own use it's been true as well
is if you feel like the community around
an extension is active you're much much
more willing to use it and you're much
more excited about using it to be honest
I think one of the reasons probably
we're all here about joomla and todd
even said it himself one of the big
reasons probably i would say probably
won the primary reasons that they looked
at it is the community because if you're
looking at open source really the
community is the entire project the
software is good but if you don't have
the community there's really nothing
going on there so that was one of the
things new but i think really got
reinforced will we walk through that
that process and got a lot of the
feedback the last one also was the
importance of things like videos for
demonstrations a lot of feedback and a
lot of people watching we were shocked
at the amount of traffic literally the
day we launched we were racing around
doing screen captures of the extension
and just recording it using software
program called Camtasia and then just
convert it into a YouTube video put them
up on youtube and then just did a link
to them right off the site use the
joomla extension to embed them directly
into our site and we were curious to see
how people really respond to him but and
we were shocked that it's almost a
one-to-one for the number of people we
see coming to the site almost a
one-to-one actually watches the videos
and when I look at the click path that
people are using on our site the number
what the number one place everybody goes
first is your features page and within
our features is where we have our videos
it's almost one hundred percent linkage
from there to them clicking through and
watching the videos a lot of things you
don't see on a lot of extensions I think
it's actually and it's even more
critical if you're writing sort of a
larger or a more complex application but
I think it's really still valuable even
if you're doing a relatively simple
module just to just show how it's
working and what it's meant for makes it
a lot easier for people to kind of get a
concept of what they need to do with it
and how to get it set up the one other
thing that I would say around this that
we haven't gotten direct feedback on but
one of the things that I believe is also
really important is try to also make
your extension very not even so much
developer friendly but designer friendly
and and what I mean by that is in terms
of trying to keep your design in your
style separate of the development a lot
of times we see when we're working with
extensions those things get completely
combined it makes it very difficult for
people who want to customize or if they
want to go in and hack it up and make
changes it makes it much much more
difficult and they have to have a lot
more skill to do it so you can try to
keep those things separate which I know
is going to be a much easier thing to do
in 15 and they're going to kind of force
you to a degree to do that in 15 but if
you can as you're writing the extension
that also I think will serve you really
really well with the community
with that that's just a kind of a
rundown in kind of what we've learned so
far I think we're going to learn a lot
more in the next few months but wanted
to just see if there were any questions
just about extensions in general yeah
ours is actually kind of a unique one
what we're doing is we've actually made
the extension open-source to keep it on
GPL friendly and within the way the
communities designed but are actually
tying in what it sort of call like a
client-server approach where we're going
to integrate into it the ability for
things like a backup service so not only
do you get the base services of things
like managing menus and doing those
things from the front end but having
like one clicks straight through to
backing up your site and taking that
back up off-site and ultimately not only
backing it up but moving into a
different hosting provider so those are
the kinds of services we're going to
layer on top of the core base extension
so we're really kind of interested in
experimenting with how that business
model is going to work because I know
that's a big one in the community people
are trying to figure out what the right
business models are and what a work and
I think definitely in some of the future
meetings will definitely want to have
some conversations kind of about that
and different ideas for people who are
trying to run different businesses
around joomla yeah
it's called extra website manager or ASM
for short yeah
in terms of 1.5 compatibility we've been
a little bit conservative as well and
doing our focus has been we got the
we're planning to do our sort of 10
version of our extension in the 10
platform which is where we are now
planning to stay there finish that up
probably I'm sort of seeing the
trajectory that joomla is on probably in
October we're going to look to actually
be 15 compatible but in legacy mode and
then pretty quickly beyond that he's
actually making native to 15 and then
after that the plan is all future
enhancements we make will all be 15 only
most likely
so the question is in terms of
difficulty in making the transition from
10 to 15 the short part of that answer
is we don't know uh-huh to be honest I
don't think it's going to be large it's
definitely not a complete refactoring
it's switching over to legacy to doing
15 legacy mode I think will be
relatively quick I don't foresee there's
going to be a lot involved there because
it's staying still pretty similar to
what you're doing 10 now converting it
over to 15 is going to be more a matter
of I think not refactoring it so much as
moving code around putting things in
different locations and more than
anything enhancing a lot of sections a
lot of the things that we knew right out
of the the bat that 10 is sort of
constrained in what you can do in terms
of layout and things like that that's so
much more flexible in 15 that is just
going to open up a lot of possibilities
that will probably lead to more changes
to the code things like that but to get
it actually in its core format probably
not a lot oh gods are telling us to stop
and although with the one probably
exception on our side is we have a part
of our extension that deals with being
able to move modules around on the page
from the front end and it's sort of a
kind of a drag and drop approach of
moving them that one is probably if
anything that will involve a lot of
recoding that would be the one mainly
because we add to it we had to customize
part of the core joomla code and being
the back code is completely changed
we're going to have to really dive in to
see where this stuff now resides and how
do we tie in with it so maybe a lot
easier maybe just be very different okay
your
ah great question something we've been
dealing with quite a bit the question
was dealing with compatibility with
other extensions there really isn't a
great way to do it other than literally
install it install your extension with
other extensions and see if it works and
literally what we've been doing and part
of its actually been through the
community we've been finding out as
people send to us oh you know it's not
working we can't figure out why we get
into their site we find an extension
that we haven't tested before and can
replicate it pretty quickly most of the
time I think so far i should say the
problems have had as much to do with
really two things dealing with PHP
sessions has been the most common
because virtuemart has been an issue
with that and JavaScript and actually
with some of the new rocket themes
templates has been a challenge mainly
just because rocket themes a lot of the
new ones are adding more and more
functionality into the template there's
just more and more things there that can
potentially compete so those have been
the two biggest things we've had to
figure out workarounds to and to deal
with luckily so far most of the time
when we've had compatibility issues like
that it hasn't been a hard thing to fix
it's just a matter of kind of looking
and experimenting and once you find it
it's usually like one line of code takes
care of it and also that's one thing
that I think will get a lot easier in 15
as well just because they're integrating
mootools directly in so for you for
those of you familiar with javascript
there's a framework called mu tools that
allows you to do like a lot of animation
move drag-and-drop move things around
making sliders and different things
because that'll be built directly into
joomla everybody who's building
extensions can leverage that already in
Joomla that's one of the biggest areas
for and so if you are actually using an
extension and running into problems with
it with you don't necessarily have to
really look at the code but one of
things you can look forward to see if
it's a problem is try to figure out does
the extension you installed use any kind
of JavaScript framework and the typical
ones are going to be mootools jquery
what we
the prototype I'd say those are probably
the three biggest ones because if you
can find a couple of different
extensions if they both are including
that it'll give you a good sense of
where the problem is and it'd be a lot
easier to get someone if you can't fix
it getting it to someone who very
quickly can make the change for you
because literally usually the only
change that's involved is putting in a
commenting out one of the sites that's
including the JavaScript framework and
as soon as that's taken out you're good
to go so to again a quick fix but that's
a very very common reason for
incompatibility
is
yeah it's the best way you're going to
find is either on the website of the
extensions that that you installed um
because usually they'll say somewhere on
the site what they've included and if
they've included something that is
JavaScript I'm and again and if you're
looking for names like those those three
or four names that's going to be a good
sign if they have a forum either on
their site or on the joomla org site um
you can do just some quick searches for
those names and see if that's included
so usually that's your best bet to just
do a kind of a quick way to figure it
out without having to look at any code
at all extension for Firefox Firebug
which makes it so much easier for
figuring out everything CSS JavaScript
yes I know yeah just repeat that for
this this suggestion was also if you're
looking for ways to look for this stuff
there's an extension for Firebug I'm
sorry for firefox called Firebug that
can definitely definitely speed up your
process and I would completely concur we
use it every day just for pretty much
just about anything related to your site
it's a great great tool
um in terms of how we how we communicate
with with customers for us we pretty
much do everything on our site in fact
we actually are using dock man and we
actually have them come and register at
our site and then download directly from
our site mainly just because it gives us
more control over the extensions it's
easier to use easier to do analysis of
what people have been doing communicate
with them in the future if there's been
changes things like that easier also to
integrate into the site one of these
I've found with the joomla code site is
it's not overly user-friendly and so if
you're not a programmer and you're not
used to those kinds of sites it can be a
little intimidating so we wanted to kind
of put it on our site and then we also
use something called fire board for the
forums on our site and we've been using
that and keeping checking with that it's
been pretty full featured and does
everything we need well great if we do
no more questions then I think we'll end
the presentation part and move into kind
of having an open round table for any
questions that people have any issues
that they have
