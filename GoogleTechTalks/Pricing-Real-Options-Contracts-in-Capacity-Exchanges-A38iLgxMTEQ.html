my professor at Georgia Tech he he's a
professor of information technology
management at Georgia Tech and he got
PhD from Wharton and he's got a bunch of
publications and a whole bunch of
different journals and such management
science journal of management
information systems european journal of
operations research design support
systems etc so without further ado DJ
whoo okay thank you can everybody hear
me yeah thank you see the incentive for
me to visit to Google is happy for my
teaching say I'm teaching this
electronic commerce classes are so we
have a lot of MBAs and as a google is a
must at each case so i want to come here
for a site visit to check out whether
you have free lunch here or not it's
really for the free lunch and also to
learn how to play lego but then i said
this evilution assessing can you do a
talk I said gosh you know what should I
talk so then I sent him three topics and
yeah he actually may be checked I heard
I he check with professor Hall errand
and then since you know what I don't you
obtain a pig to okay so actually I'm
going to do two talks here but it's
working progress its ongoing project at
the Georgia Tech so I like to keep the
talk of very informal and interactive
and you can ask any questions for me we
don't have any confidential questions it
is open research yeah this talk it's
about pricing real options contracts in
capacity exchanges it's a joint work
with Professor surgeon of the school of
industrial and systems engineering at
Georgia Tech so the motivation of this
research is is really the internet okay
internet has really revolutionized the
definition of a market and in fact has
created many new electronic marketplaces
Google is a must teach case and there
are others you know I won't call them
the rivals of Google
um see we have a proposal for you why
I'm here is I want to discuss with you
you know CeCe the a lot of innovators
here so here's the idea we have been
thinking for a long time okay so what's
the next we have all this new markets it
was the new ya thing we can do it's a
smart market for capacity trading and
the idea is of very simple okay the idea
is see I want to offer capacity as an
option okay it's different what then
they're doing now okay i like to use
this example as a imagine yeah it just
imagines that they're okay it's going to
source in for memory chips from a
supplier in china okay just imagine this
company called Fox talk okay I'm not
sure this is really true business but
here is a buyer and the supplier to say
i want to buy memory chips for the
moment what they do is either they sign
a domestic contracts but i have to buy
right for example let's say which a
particular contract this is a thousand
units of memory chips pay for me to
produce another dale computer then so
how much should I sign advantage with my
supplier Cena yeah if I sign a lot in
advance but in the process things are
change see I don't know actually my
market demand ok for January 27 could be
high could be low right and I don't know
what Intel is going to do in Silicon
Valley is keeping innovating so whatever
during the process you know say they
have a new release so if a particular
setup say about the dynamics change okay
so if you have a new release what do I
do with this huge in the stuff I signed
and I have to buy so therefore the idea
is what if we don't actually sign a
contract for extra stuff in advance how
about we sign this
to as an option okay and by next January
I could exercise my option okay if you
know I do need those memory chips okay
otherwise I could not exercise I can
choose not to exercise so that's the
basic idea so what I want to propose a
is a is a continuous auction of those
capacity options it's an auction of
options so that's the basic thing we're
doing and why this is new is because
right here we have two markets okay the
first market is we've got the contract
model market or options market or the
advance the market SE CAE your head
right I'm going to contract for the
capacity and for memory chips and also I
have a spot market see I'm a day let's
say January the first 207 when I need
the stuff i need to the memory chips
right so there's a price right there
there's a spot price so I want to
integrate those bows prices so you know
that's the beauty of the internet that
previously it's separated so now we
actually have opportunity to actually to
integrate those two markets right the
forward market or the options market and
a spot market okay the way I'm going to
integrate them is using this idea Kadri
options in from from finance so that's
the basic idea so we're going to
continuously so your auction those
capacity options okay and those options
in a really real options contracts that
can connect the four market or the
obvious market and the spot market and
so what's novel in this talk in our
country beauties we know we actually
have a continuous-time model of capacity
options trading so in electronic
marketplaces so if you are there no the
stuff you can go okay that's basically
you know that's all I'm going to discuss
yeah yeah this is energy it's a
precise example okay yeah let me again
using Dale as an example but it may not
be true okay I'm just doesn't like to
use some names to give you the idea
suppose I want to buy us a dram memory
chips ok say for the moment okay if they
could ninety percent you know of these
deals contracts in a say they're going
to give to a long term incumbent
supplier okay so this is somebody they
have been doing business for a long time
they know and for the rest of the ten
percent of those capacity okay or
they're going to get it from the spot
market or unifrom exchange okay it's
it's a very small percentage roughly ten
percentage the reason is there are other
concerns in my second talk we'll talk
about those non-price attributes like a
quality and they're also relationships
you can long-term relationships so the
trend in the industry right now is their
code called structured sourcing what
they do is say they want to be able to H
price because I don't know the price
next January so you know see I want to
be able to H the price I also to be able
to H my shortage you know by the time I
need it I want to make sure i can i can
get it and i also want to save costs
okay they are three goes you have to
satisfy 3 goes h price hey to risk and
also a safe cost so we're going to claim
you know we have a model we have a
contract actually can help firms to
satisfy all three criteria this is
another example is about the electric
power market yeah same thing but i'm not
to go over so this is the thing we have
been working with a Maya device that
what in a poor client offer yeah for
over a decade you know but the similar
idea so the commonalities that is the
following say I want to spend some time
to really lay down so the problem here
okay if I can tell you the problem I'm
done because then you can solve it yeah
so the problem here is again we have to
market so you have this contract market
okay let's just assume it's a year ahead
ok I'm going to a sign in as a with the
suppliers save in China okay for you
know see a large amount see those are
billion dollar contracts right eNOS it
could be a year head okay then we have a
spot market depends on what we are
talking about electrical power is
actually 10 ahead of use okay and but
for memory chips you can be just on a
day so you have to market the contract
market way ahead and then the spot
market so what we're proposing in
between so you can trade so let's see
again thinking about say let's say who
is standing this kind of contracts say
for example it's TSMC okay taiwan
semiconductor manufacturing company so
they are sending you that let's assume
that still Mia so tradable capacities or
standing into Intel those tradable
capacity options okay but you know in
between you may trade okay and see the
events are the following okay so first
of all the suppliers are going a bit
okay the contracts and also the capacity
okay suppose I have a big capacity let's
make it simple let's say a hundred okay
but I don't have to tell you I can see
108 so I have to decide agency see how
much to post into an ounce so that is it
because if i post 100 you may take 100
right but i may save some i may withhold
some of my capacity because there's a
trading going on so we are talking about
the business it's on a day okay so
there's a plenty of rooms you know say
for YouTube hi ok so the supplies what
they do is taking the bits those options
contracts the options has two parts
these are standard the first part is
reservation ve second part is execution
v okay you first have to pay to say TSMC
right in LC see less than two dollars
per unit I'm just making it to reserve
the capacity for you okay and on the day
so if you want to actually exercise you
know they buy this so you pay some
additional execution of your striking
this is also called a striking price
let's say a dollar or two dollars you
can extra okay to actually use the stuff
but if you don't want to exercise your
options contract you don't have to pay
execution fee and there they have to
decide in is it how much capacity to
actually the post okay then what the
buyers can be side is unison whether to
buy those kind of options Eunice and how
many options okay to contract in advance
so that's the bios decision and in the
process you know they could update you
know the you for machines they don't
know what's going to happen the other
day they don't know therefore than
january see what's the market looks like
okay so in the process both parties both
the supplier and the buyer they'll
actually going to update the information
okay then for they're going to adjust
their decisions how can this the
supplier just because you know he's new
adjust the reservation fee execution fee
also he has to control the rate of
release of the capacity is different
ways again how much capacity to posts
see you can think about every day okay
over the time and the same time is the
buyer they have to think he is in a say
whether should i buy or not okay then
also eNOS you have to think at which
rate okay to to buy yeah surprise
keeping posting so they have decided
whether to buy or not over the time so
that's energy in between what happened
okay and they actually they can trade
here that can trade the big framework is
they can trade yeah buyers can buy more
than an idiot then they can sell back in
as in the country because they have
different beliefs right between yeah
about the state of the word in all
different supportive in the buyers you
know say they have different needs
so they may discover Tennessee which
market is selling where say what you
know these firms there are global firms
see a particular product and if not
selling we're here in Silicon Valley mr.
Waring Atlanta or even better in China
so you know they actually knows you can
hedge actually across the world so
that's why you have training going on
then on the day at the supply decided
whether to sell residual capacity they
may have received capacity right on the
spot market or not okay and the buyer
has to decide they're going to decide ok
how much to exercise the so far he has
accumulated right the buyer came in all
this capacity options okay then on a day
so you have to you have to decide okay
how much do exercise you know from all
these units that you pay the reserve
capacity and also how much to buy from
the spot market you know so you don't
have to buy from those dudes are options
right you could actually in sourcing
entirely all your needs right from the
spot market if the small market give you
a good deal so are you with me so you
know that's the whole timeline what's
going on and Sam I'm going to present a
model that can nail down the idea is
only one supplier and one buyer okay
let's say how can we solve this problem
ok any questions yeah this is the basic
setup that's the problem we are looking
on um before we have to do this
continuous time let's say what if
there's only two period ok suppose
you're not allowed to trade ok you can
contract contract in advance a year
ahead ok and you have to market contract
market and the options market what's
going to happen ok we actually solve
this problem early on so it was yeah
with actually several researchers when
you Swiss professor ginger from ya huh I
think he's not at Hong Kong University
then professor Paul client offer
yeah he's now at INSEAD yeah yeah what
we do is see in these two markets let's
again take a look ok we have obvious
contract you have the reservation fee ok
execution fee and this capital Q is the
optimal contract the buyer is going to
reserve from your supplier and we also
have a spot market price PS right there
is open and and we have the mean of the
small market price and we also have a
measure about spot market liquidity so
this picture have to tells you ok the
solution for this to period is actually
very simple and a very intuitive okay
and what shows up here so if you travel
north is the price of the real option
okay and if you travel east okay is
tells you is the execution fee price we
did a transformation so this
transformation is because these are
options so on the day yup yup what
you're paying is the price it's the
minimum of the spot price and your
execution fee right so you're gonna you
know you're going to pay whatever it is
lower okay so that's that's the little
notation is the transformation so once
you do that transformation the optimal
solution use those straight lines you
know the 45-degree life the other way so
on see then we can tell you when these
guys they have incentives to trade when
they don't okay so all you have to do is
you do this index the reservation fee
plus the effective price you know this
art we call this effective price okay
equals to the mean of the stock market
price you have this 45 degree line so if
any surprise going to post a contract
okay and the bio does the calculation is
this bigger than the mean of the market
price they're not gonna buy because I'm
going to wait right see you know i'm not
gonna pay more than the mean of those
market price so there's a no trade here
and on the other hand see the suppliers
they also need some incentive to
participate they need you to pay me
something up front to reserve capacity
for you so otherwise you know i can wait
so why should i sell in advance ok to
you to the buyer so therefore it's only
that little triangle area ok it's the
trading area ok so this most part is you
know they they have an incentive to
trade for capacity options and this line
we actually can tell you exactly what's
the optimal reservation for the buyer is
actually very simple is this capital u
is the utility function ok you can this
u prime is the bios Williams we needs to
pay right you plug into this equation
you solve this one it's actually give
you the optimal capacity reservation for
the buyer ok so you know then then the
suppliers going to take this into
consideration ok this is typical of game
theory ok and then they say what should
I set my optimal contract ok and we
prove that the optimal contract is
actually for the supplier to tell the
truth to actually charge the production
cost a clean execution visa set the
execution fee exactly equals to their
marginal production costs don't make
money in that shrugging price setting
rather making money by raising your
reservation fee so that's even see
that's like an overview of previous in
the literature what we did so then this
point is actually the equilibrium point
equilibrium point so yeah and that's the
protection they see enough in the for
market you know see what's the price the
supply is going to set for reservation
fee execution fee and how much the
buyers going to reserve in advance and
on the day say what the what the buyer
is going to do is they're going to the
same point is going to compare the spot
market price was a station fee whichever
is lower he's going to do that
okay and if spot market price is higher
then they're going to exercise their
options okay and in fact they are going
to use all the capacity they have
reserved so that's what we did in this
to Puri model and in order for us to
actually to do this proposal to have an
industry exchange to trade we need to
solve this continuous time model okay so
therefore in order for us to actually to
go ahead and set up an industrial
exchange for capacity options we need to
answer the following questions the first
question is the same like this to period
okay so what is the buyers optimal
sourcing strategy taking this into
consideration what is the suppliers
optimal okay selling strategy okay our
bidding strategy right it's in how they
should how the supplier should bid right
yeah you can imagine on their electronic
bulletin boards how should the supplier
a bit and in the equilibrium okay and
what is the price of capacity options
then how does it compare with financial
options because New York Stock Exchange
you know we all know that okay how does
it different you know we also have
chicago mercantile exchange right so
they are form how do come here so the
price of real options versus the price
of financial options right how do they
differ okay when do they converge so we
need to make a linkage right to this
intellectual heritage okay then how does
this to markets price cool move right
now we have two prices right we have the
spot market prices keeping moving okay
statistically but you also have this
contract price right it keeps going
right what's the relationship between
these two right so how do they Co move
so we need to answer those questions and
also from the operational point of view
they want ask the question is okay so
what if the spot market prices really
volatile or
okay so then so it's this capacity
options more valuable see so into e to
do you think that's true right so why
would you like to buy capacity options
three options right if there are a lot
of risks right in a small market in
particular when you have a huge
volatility okay so that's the intuition
we need to check whether it's true or
not okay the second thing is so if I
sign is I'll be right with you if I sign
this okay we're here okay is that value
higher to the buyer or not so this is
called time to delivery okay social
unity is yet those kind of capacity
options okay so you start to you know
see the earlier I sign with the supplier
and the more valuable to the buyer or
not okay intuitive you may think it is
too but we need to check it out yes yeah
two questions is that confidential
model are you soon in any sort
surpassing where you can say stock up
when the prices
excellent question what I think he hears
announced orrible okay save you yeah all
the first question is do I assume your
storage okay if I cannot see all the
stuff can I can i store in this
particular model we don't assume that
they think about electrical power it's
hard to store so in particular so
there's a we are we're starting
non-perishables our cash Parrish burgers
again it's non storable okay second
question the other questions are
relevant given laughing oh okay yeah but
you can I can you actually can chinking
storage as a special case of a
perishable okay basically holding
hostage in the eye you know so yeah but
you nothing up yeah the feature of the
same conductor is you don't want to
store yeah is you yeah okay so those are
the questions in a way of chocolate on
the answer before we have to do the
proposal and this is again the timeline
I believe I already went over it this is
just a fall in the formal definition is
the same thing like that color picture
ideas i'm going to skip it again the
idea is the call option on capacities
i'm going to skip it too so this model
it's a simple one 1211 sapphire one
buyer the seller is that the phone
stacker work
leader and the seller has a fixed to
technology you know to B little B years
its production cost of your marginal
production costs capital case the
capacity okay it's the Intel's plant
okay for foundry okay it's the big one
you know you can't think in yeah power
plant they have a capacity in the short
term we cannot change because once you
build that big planet you know that
capacitor is fixed ok so both guys they
are trying to maximize revenues okay our
profit c4 to illustrate you know the
alma mater we're going to assume the
execution fee is to standing okay
because we have proof proof I believes
also true in the continuous-time saying
you you know the year yeah but the let's
just assume okay you're not going to
make a money execution fee now therefore
there's two things the seller can
control one is the price of the option
over the time and the second is you know
how I gonna release okay how many how
many capacity wanna post over the time
okay buyer is a utility maximize miser
say over time he's accumulating his
options those are actually not the
number of memberships he already
purchased is actually use the options
you know he has the right to purchase in
them but he has not even purchased yet
so basically he's not strolling anything
he simply purchased the rights okay on
the day to use but he's not going to
store all those memberships unity in his
own places or warehouses okay the spot
price nobody can control okay we're
assuming follows a stochastic process in
a no better control or the stock market
price you know that's like a global you
know the market price for memory chips
and I what we are doing here is really
we try to extend the early work with it
for to appear to the continuous time
okay um we actually have a formulation
of the problem then I'm gonna skip it
unless you really really
too but I want you here gonna close your
eyes but you know but we actually you
know you have to form this continuous
time model for the buyer and you
actually can solve it okay let me tell
you what the solution looks like okay
yeah turns out the solution is a ban-ban
solution the virus scan the bio whatever
gonna post it in the capacity and yeah
at the time okay at the time of the day
you want to actually to use it is the
exactly the same decision as already a
paper we published so so you know that's
the yeah that's the solution the seller
is going to take all this into
consideration is a very hard problem
this problem because I don't want to go
over because sure no only give me like
20 minutes though I mean it's either
there's no way I can finish up let me
tell us very hard thinks the whole world
is going to watching it William I to
mathematicians to work on this problem
yeah it's actually it's a very hard
problem tech to is a top mathematicians
it's a it's a hard problem but we have
some ideas they for the special case we
believe we solve it for one seller and a
one buyer okay i will also assuming that
execution fee is you know you're not the
n is going to be the same as your
marginal production costs ok so the
seller can this are standard the
solution approach you separate standard
okay and what is the say what is the
seller's optimal pricing this is a key
thing i want to tell you see that it has
connections you know this happen that
the price is that formula that for me or
let me explain to you what's going on
right over there it's the pricing of
real options is the difference between
two call options in the end of financial
options so you right here so the first
term right there you may not realize
that but for those of you who started
line is is actually the classical black
shorts modern formular so what's this
proposition says is that so you cannot
plug in a play so the price of a real
option is the difference of two options
lower its lower than this black shows
Martin formula so this is a key insights
you know what we discovered so it's
always lower so the first term is vsm
and there's a second term right over
there and what the what the seller what
I've want to do is they want to price
the options exactly equal to the buyers
marginal value of capacity and we can
prove there's a very nice things you
know the optimal office pricing
processes actually it's a super
martingale but the key thing is the cell
is going to price exactly the buyers
marginal okay valuation of capacity
that's why so they're going to post in a
exactly that and the buyer is going to
take exactly that so the opt-in work
yeah this one is accurate hard okay we
you know we think we get it out but I
don't put it as a proposition I put it
as a contractor to be careful because
it's a videotaped again I want
mathematician to work on this these are
the optimal rate of options in the say
we believe it's what it is going to be a
yeah it's epic yeah it's basically it's
acting maximum rates such that the
marginal revenue equals to margin
opportunity cost for the Sailor so
that's the idea behind it so we haven't
be able to formalize it I haven't had
time you know because I was not prepared
look at this talk put this together you
actually have the equilibrium solution
right over there so we I believe with
you know we get the major the major
things in a point out okay this is the
solution to my early questions not what
if so assuming this process is in a
geometric Brownian motion okay that's
standard ok we plug into a specific
process to say whether we can solve it
so you can see that so the first one is
the question is to what's the
relationship between the price of
options to versus the spot market price
okay what's has shown here
is so it's the same direction I'm sorry
the first one yeah same direction so if
the stock market price is higher okay
then your obvious contract is also
higher that's intuitive right also if
the buyers willing to pay more all right
that's all so intuitive right if the
bias women this toupees increases they
can also increase in the price option so
that's intuitive so there's no surprise
over there the surprise is the next one
next to and what shows up here is so the
first one is the volatility see right
here so you see as the volatility of the
market increases see the price of the
real options actor decreases this is
very counterintuitive it's different
than people think this is what's a new
year when we price in real options the
second thing that's also surprising is
as the time to delivery so this is
increases actually the price of the
reactions also decreases okay so this is
what surprising counterintuitive so
again the point we're trying to making
here you cannot do plug in a play you
can now say I and I just learned sorry I
just learned this your finest I open the
textbook and I want to set up a b2b
exchanges for capacities you know it
won't work say we have to show you even
for the simple cases you know see you
have all these you know they are
surprises so basically I'm see what i
have been done is we set up a
theoretical framework you know that's
the first step towards the implementing
of our proposal okay yeah I'll give me
asking a question who wants to do it ice
singapore singapore exchange actually at
one time declared actually you know to
the whole work they're gonna do it okay
in 204 but then you know they didn't do
it you know i actually I went to their
website that were checked they may
correct me if they watch your video tape
but I did want to sing up exchanger they
pull it off due to other priority then
Taiwan
exchange also trying okay to act a set
of exchange okay to again trade options
contract for memory chips you know they
made this you know the explicit they
even put it in their annual report but
they didn't do it but again so the I
don't know the exact reason they may
have have other priorities but I think
we need to solve all these problems
before go ahead to treat that because
it's different they are also other firms
i will name it they have business for a
little while okay yeah in this country
but they were simply borrowing exactly
from financial trading ok you deposit
okay then we trade I'll do margin call
yeah the the point I'm making here is
you know it's giving all these new
things here and we need to sort out you
can see the unique things okay about
training of this real options before we
actually going to do it okay to me it's
not surprising they have a business
phone for a while but not not anymore
okay so therefore but i think google can
do it but you have some more people than
the rest i actually already talked about
but the key point is this is the first
step in we have a feeling of framework
we we have this foundation laid out see
right now I hope he Nancy one forums we
actually going to do it yes sir could
you talk about the generalization
the case with two buyers where there's a
constrained under provision
orchid yeah it's already see I wrote a
paper with again uphall kind offer that
published in mentoring sign 2005 we have
you solved the case of multiple supplier
and the multiple buyer and with with
capacity constraints but again for two
periods and for convenient continues
time is very hard we have a Soviet so
but for two period we already solved
well I guess one of the questions I have
is with respective instance volatility
spot price right in a constrained market
I can kind of Intuit that curve for the
single supplier single buyer where
there's no implicit availability
constraint but where there would be
multiple buyers I'm not sure that that
you would Nessus that seems to defy my
intuition more in the case of multiple
buyers with strengths that doesn't
signify I think you have at some point I
know that you thank you for questioning
let me emphasize again so so what we
have here the contract market is it's a
small market okay the contract market is
invitation only so yes basically yeah
I'm kicking you using their opportunity
me or they say they only do business in
with a small subset of suppliers this
are they called long-term suppliers okay
like say six
okay 65 okay so it's you know use
constraint and the stock market is open
to the whole world okay small market he
knows a right here so nobody can control
so that's probably that's one of the
reason is why we have this result again
we are not trying to solve general
equilibrium okay here we're trying to
solve a specific problem for a specific
industry in particular we are interested
in those perishable goods okay like
electro power like memory chips after
fits into where we all want trying to
fit you know into the business setting
okay yes you can actually make it very
hard gender equality bill then but then
it's hard for me to show what's my
contribution because way back we haven't
all be helped no bill always today
already stuff for the problem with it
thanks yeah ok so then what oh yeah okay
yeah thank you make sure you take this
from Georgia Tech okay yeah yeah yeah
feel free to go should we move to the
next one your take a break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
