Sergio is going to tell us some more
about quantum supremacy Thanks see I'm
going to talk about the same thing that
John talked about this morning which is
great because he's playing set much
better than me so hopefully you'll
understand it and this is work with a
lot of collaborators who have done a lot
of work Sergei of edema smolinski
rambabu's mrs. mainly asked who happens
to be with his brother Nadine San Diego
Martinez and Harvard Nevin so what we're
interested in is what you impress Kelly
in this paper in 2012 called wanted
supremacy and our interpretation of
quantum supremacy is we want to with the
quantum device we want to perform a
well-defined computational task which is
beyond the capabilities of
state-of-the-art classical computer
computers and we want to do this in the
near term as soon as possible as a
matter of fact which implies that we're
going to have to do this without error
correction unfortunately and one
condition we're not necessarily implying
is we're not going to necessarily solve
a practical problem and as a matter of
fat in this Dalek we're not solving a
practical problem so are there are
several approaches to try to do this of
course one of them is the optimization
of a classical function so quantum
annealing which is what this conference
is about also related to that but not
the same is the algorithm by avian
collaborators this quantum approximate
optimization algorithm so here you would
like to achieve quantum supremacy by
finding a lower minimum of some
classical cost function that with a
quantum device a lower minimum that you
could do with a supercomputer there is
also a non Sibi level Hamilton in
evolution which is popular in ion traps
for instance the variational quantum
eigen solver basically the task of this
algorithm would be to find the ground
state
energy of a hamiltonian like a firme
mija bar of some molecule and the
algorithms are going to be talking about
they are sampling algorithms and the
computational task here is going to be
to sample from a well-defined
distribution so there are examples of
this in the literature like commuting
quantum circuits by Mariner and
collaborators Boston sampling Bayern
sooner or keep of and we're just going
to be thinking about sampling the
distribution which is defined by the
output of a random universal circuit and
there are several reasons why we focus
on this problem one of them is we
probably want to do this anyway so as
John builds up larger circuits we want
to test how well the circuits are
performing so this is related to
randomize benchmarking so what we're
going to be doing is in a sense
randomized with marking for complex
circuits not just two cubed gate or
single qubit gates but randomized which
marking of very complex circuit another
reason to do this is just pragmatic
because I think this is probably the
first thing we can do when we can
achieve quantum supremacy although you
know quantum annealing is on the run to
and this task my son of it strange that
we're doing a sampling problem although
of course Monte Carlos algorithms are
also designed to solve sampling task but
here the distributions are bit different
and in random Universal circuits
although is slightly artificial
distribution is actually related to
universal quantum computation societies
related to inch market and is probably
distribution war in a sample anyway so
there are several requisites we believe
or trying to solve that you achieve
quantum supremacy in the near term so
one thing we think is necessary is that
for your computational tasks because
this is going to be near term with high
fidelity qubits but not that many qubits
we want to have our computational task
which you can only try to solve
classically throughout the red
simulation of the quantum evolution
because
that if you try to do it the right
simulation of the content volution
that's going to have a Costas peninsula
in the number of qubits which means with
fifty cubits is already going to be too
expensive for a supercomputer to to the
50s just a very large number and so the
cost of other assimilation is potential
in the size of collaborative space and
this right away reminds us of chaotic
systems in chaotic systems typically if
you want to get a high-precision
representation of the final state of
aquatic evolution classical or quantum
you're going to need to simulate the
chaotic evolution in the quantum case
this is also true and is compound by the
exponential dimension of collaborative
spaces jim was explaining this morning
with the speckles in the laser so I we
think you need a specific fear of merits
you need to be careful when you're
claiming you are achieving quantum
supremacy and you need to really try to
prove as as well as you can that you
really are performing this task well so
do you need an aspic figure of Merit
that tells you how well you're
performing this Q mutational task and at
least we should be able to measure this
figure of merit to the quantum supremacy
frontier meaning this will become clear
later if the only way you can perform
the rotational task classical is by
doing a simulation of the evolution of
the quantum evolution then probably once
you are beyond the quantum frontier so
you cannot do this simulation anymore
it's going to be very hard to actually
compute directly the figure of Merit for
the Comte tional task and that's the
case at least as far as we know for
these sampling problems but it turns out
that this figure of Merit is going to be
naturally related to fidelity so that
will allow us to estimate if you're
married in an independent way and will
give us more confidence that we're doing
what we claim to be doing so because we
cannot directly measure the fear of
Merit beyond the supremacy frontier we
need to understand well how to
extrapolate if europe mate and is very
helpful to have predictions from theory
for what this fear of
it will be beyond the supermassive
frontier and that again is related to
fidelity and one thing that we like is
if there is a relation to computational
complexity well then that is good
because computational complexity Alyssa
synthetically gives you very strong
arguments that there are no efficient
algorithms for this task and that's the
case for random circuits does a new
result but to really satisfy the more
formal requirements of conventional
complexity which is to really violate
this Rancher string thesis if you heard
of that because competition of
complexity makes a Synthetica statements
as far as we can tell that will require
Corrections who are not going to
formally satisfy the requirements of
contention and complexity we're not
going to be able to say we're violating
the structures the increases due to
finite size but results in computational
complexity give us more confidence that
there are no efficient algorithms for
the test that we're trying to do so what
is the problem we have been studying
well we're just going to be doing a
we're going to be sampling the output of
a universal random circuit so the reason
is that if you have a circuit word
you're selecting your gates randomly and
initializing some estate and then you
measure that with the conditional basis
if you trace the evolution of the
quantum state through the different
cycles of these secrets because the
gates are random and is the universal
set this is going to give you a gothic
evolution so this is related to quantum
chaos and that tells you that probably
only way to do this is by simulating the
circuit itself the task is going to be
sampling from the distribution which is
just the probability of measuring bit
strings in the computational basis or
any other local basis but conditional
basis will do and the cost of doing this
thing is because you have to do their
simulation is basically exponential in n
but there but their assimilation name
generically implying methods which are
like transfer Network contractions or
extensions of clip or circuit by 10 sir
Neville contractions that means you need
the depth into the which is going to be
order scored an event where the cost we
order n if you are familiar with that
method and as I said before this is
going to be a good benchmark for quantum
computers and we have so many results in
competition a complex
so the experimental proposal itself is
what John explained this morning is
simply nice we're going to we have a
particular layout of two cubed gates
that we can apply this is going to be 2d
and we're going to choose some Universal
set of gates in our case is going to be
control C gates or the two cubed gates
and for single cute gates we have T
which is not clear for a square root of
x and a squared of Y and we're just
going to select a particular instance of
the set of random circuits that we can
implement we actually was negated a lot
of numerics optimizing the random
circuit so that converts to the aquatic
regime as soon as possible so that's why
they have their son rules but they are
mainly random in particular they give
you a Celtic estates and once you select
an instance you keep that instance and
you're going to do a large number of
measurements in the computational basis
with the same circuit sodium mentioned
this morning doing around a hundred
thousand measurements obtaining around
100,000 be the strings in one second
that will be good enough so once you
have a sample of bit strings which are
there going to be all different from
each other because this state is cut it
can is very delocalized you're not going
to see the same BTW string in the
computational basis twice you have to do
something with it to check if you're
sampling approximately from the circuit
you claim to be sampling and what we're
going to have to do is we're going to
compute this quantity is the log of the
probability according to the circuit
that I got whatever be the string I
found in the spirit so this is the main
limitation these quantities you're going
to have to calculate them you cannot get
them from the circuit you're going to
you know they will require an
exponential number of measurements to
estimate this and they won't be the
ideal probability see there we're just
going to get these probabilities with a
supercomputer so we use a super computer
and any simulation method like tensile
normal contraction or just the rats
running a simulation of the circuit to
really for all the bit strings that we
find in the experiment calculate this
real number they're just real numbers
and once we have these numbers then we
calculate this quantity here which is
really the cross entropy which is as the
our heads of these numbers that they got
from the supercomputer where the song
here is over the
BTW strings that i obtained in the
experiment and then we normalize it in
this way and there is some variation
which basically comes from the central
limit theorem of order 1 over the square
root of the number of measurements with
million measurements or a hundred
thousand measurements you really are
going to obtain a good estimate of what
this number is alpha and this is really
the cross entropy for reasons that I
won't have time to get into today but
hopefully the paper within their
capsules you can read about 80 view one
so we're going to measure these or a
bunch of circuits of different size of
different depth and with different
number of tickets so these are related
to three different simulation methods
that we can do and then after the point
where we can not do any simulations
anymore we're going to hopefully obtain
very nice curves for these numbers de su
DK is potentially in size depth and
number of tickets if you keep the delete
constant and that's going to allow us to
extrapolate this cross entropy beyond
the point where we cannot measure it
anymore so that's one thing we need to
do to be able to click on the supreme as
it is to be able to say we're doing
something that the classical computer
cannot do and the other thing we want to
do is we want to fit these two theory
and theory says well the reason why we
normalize it that way stock interest in
this story that this present rope is
really a fairly good estimate of the
fidelity of the circuit the reason is
that the aquatic estate is very
sensitive to error so any errors in the
circuit will completely destroy or
almost completely destroy discourse
entropy so with this normalization the
cross entropy so really just be the
fidelity of the circuit which you can
estimate by multiplying the Fidelity's
of your different gates including
initialization of measurement fidelity
so that's where this equation transform
is just a very crude estimate of the
fidelity which actually works quite well
it will you see the later paper by rami
for instance you will find that estimate
there for experiments with up two
thousand gates and n qubits issues to
work well so this is the layout of what
we want to do and I guess you're going
to have to be
me that this particular quantity the
cross entropy with this normalization
really is a good estimate of the
fidelity because of the sensitivity of
the Celtic a stake and this constants
here they just come from chaos theory of
random matrix theories their universal
constants up to up to variations of 1
over the square root of Hilbert space so
one thing I'm going to show you i won't
go through the equations but i'm going
to show you some numerics so the first
thing i wanted to show you i'm going to
be run out of time in a hurry is i guess
this is the main plot so this is a lot
less plane i guess we're not too bad so
this quantity this axis here is the
number of qubits we're keeping the depth
fix to 25 that's because at that time
transfer network contraction will have a
hard problem and we're deep into the
aquatic regime and we plot dramatically
this cross entropy so those are the
squares for different error rate of the
two cubed gates and these are there
Polly error rates of the to communicate
so if there is no error the way I
normalize it you should have a cross
entropy equals to 1 by normalization and
that's indeed what we see all the way to
forty two qubits these simulations
between 36 42 cube is they were done in
a supercomputer by mrs. polyansky there
I think the biggest simulations of
anita's that approaches kwanten
supremacy and you can see that it
converges very nicely to the value
predicted by random matrix theory and
then as you add errors then your consent
ropey decreases as its sole and indeed
it's following fairly closely the
estimate of the fidelity which is the
deadline and this is just the product of
the Fidelity's of all your gate so the
cross entropy is a favor of minute on
it's also you can say some kind of
fidelity of your circuit but the
standard fidelity so there were a lot of
the output with a stage of torn paper to
prepare so we close to the dashed line
and indeed that's very close to the
ability so this also stands randomized
benchmarking so i guess i'll go of it
faster where the next plot there might
be simpler actually jones of this plot
and it just tells you that if you drop
one single poly error basically destroy
the distribution that you're trying to
sampling from so I'm just order in the
distribution it will be as potential
because his erotic estates of this color
Porter Thomas distribution if I drop one
error I'm just our over the different
locations then this potential almost
disappears the song correlation let
because serves at the beginning and at
the end or not in the Celtic regime
quite done completely destroyed a
correlations this is another plot for
the TD sign aficionados or chaos
aficionados where you check we're
checking how many what depth do you need
in these circuits to achieve to get into
the category Jim so with this
normalization we'll just measure in the
entropy of that put a state and this
this is just numerics for random matrix
theory or quantum cares this is the body
just passed this dashed line and you see
more compelling very nicely so 25 depth
which is a constraint that constraint
answer another contraction we're deep
into the Celtic regime which is where we
want to be and maybe this will be my
final plot something that also has been
a study by a number of people in chaos
condensed matter deacon at the
participation ratio when the competition
the quality designs you schedule the
different moments converge to the
aquatic estate and we find as you would
expect by arguments related to hood
diffusion of entropy that the lower
moments here employed in ten moments
they all convert more or less at the
same time so again a dead 25 well the
tenth moment abnormal isolate so for
aquatic estate this would be one so
multiplying by a huge number this is for
42 cubed so this is 2 to the 42 to the
ninth power so these depth we have this
English participation ratio normalized
of this is just the participation rescue
excuse like 10 to the 19 but when you
get to Def 25 is really like 1.8 so
you're really converging very fast and
all the moments converts at the same
time and we ascended previous proofs of
the complexity of sampling which are for
commuting quantum circuits this is a
paper by Mick Bremen error and all where
they saw that well they saw what they
saw but anyway they
the proof gets a standard to run on
quantum circuit so basically the
probability to sample the probability
yeah the probability for BT string you
can represent it as a partition function
of a complex icing function and there is
a strong conjecturing complexity theory
that you cannot approximate the
partition function with an empirical and
there is a theorem that says that the
vehicle sample classically from this
distribution then you collaborate
semaine the partition function which is
a contradiction so this is what I am
suggesting the difference with an
approximate canteen and exhaust grunting
from here you derive a contradiction
which basically tells you that
asymptotically there shouldn't be an
efficient algorithm to sample these
outputs of random quantum circuits as
you will expect so that's nice and I I
guess I don't say that for factoring
which you know we have a strong evidence
I guess historical evidence that there
is no classical algorithm but this is I
guess a more formal proof so come with
alien time like yeah so I read the
conclusions or live there ok so my
conclusions so respect to from the plots
I sell which include errors I still have
mentioned that the one of the lines in
that plot which is still give you a
miserable croissant appear from point 1
we should really be able to measure that
more or less corresponding to
state-of-the-art fidelity's in the Santa
Barbara lab so we spare with some work
but we're supposed to be able to achieve
supremacy with circuits of 14 n qubits
which we don't think you can simulate
classically anymore and def 25 this
cross entropy actually give us a new
method to benchmark quantum circuits
because his proximity fidelity and is in
itself a fear of married that tells you
how well your secret has been
implemented thus important for us are
there is some interesting relations to
chaos and complexity theory and I think
the theory we presented here the cross
entropy the convergence to cause it
actually applies to other something
problems like committing when the
circuit was on sampling kotik
hamiltonians which might be another
route supremacy view calibrated properly
and some of it will apply to other
sampling problems because the cross
entropy sorry
the statistical fear of merida is using
machine learning for instance thank you
so i guess we have time for a couple of
questions so you considered random
unitary circuits right so we real
complex numbers their answer yes if you
do the same thing with just real gates
so you get an alternate orthogonal dress
or an immortal a transformation is it
easier to see or more difficult to see
the difference between the classical and
quantum so i will give you a different
distribution it will be as yeah slightly
different with slightly for
normalization we have already look into
it because it might be easier to
simulate I mean we have great with faces
so we are going to do the logical
computer is easier um classical computer
will be easy so I guess that's one
reason not not to look into it but I
think they're to your question which is
you will be harder easier to distinguish
I mean the statistics will work more or
less the same because the distributions
are very similar your errors will be
pretty much the same because the
fidelity of the gate probably doesn't
depend on having a complex or if it does
then there will be an interesting
finding yeah I guess we would be a
lantern ative to sort of extrapolate so
you usually gate without complex faces
like not including tickets is one of
those ideas and then you might be able
to contrast with a supercomputer
simulator then you start putting complex
faces you cannot get the probabilities
anymore but you would think that just by
changing the face the fidelity didn't go
down necessarily one one more here
how random does it have to be when you
pick the gates I mean how sensitive it
is that if your is not properly random
then it becomes simulator will you see
like the gates have to be picked
randomly but how close to pure that
properly random it has to be well I
guess that's a very generic question I'm
not sure they're there is their papers
for instance if you have only cliff or
and then you start adding T gate you can
do up to 50 decades for instance the
Clifford gates can be as random as you
want that won't give you this Celtic
distribution because cliff or doesn't
generate Celtic estates and is not you
know the porter Thomas kotik estates so
you will need at least 50 tickets if not
is similar well I guess in general the
intuition is that if it's not gothic
that means you have some symmetries and
if you have some symmetries that means
there might be a classical algorithm
that can exploit the symmetries because
you're not like exploring approximately
uniformly not never quite uniformly but
approximately uniform aquino at this
pace if you're not doing that the
computational cost might not be
proportional to to them because you're
not you know like spreading and a few
collaborative space so the more
symmetries you have the easier it will
be to the classical simulation and given
that the problem here is a fidelity we
want to try to do this with the least
number of qubits and the least depth
that's why we're trying to use circuits
which are as a spreader on as possible
generates a state the diarist karthik as
possible if you want okay i think i had
a question but i think his session chair
i'm not going to allow myself to ask it
and thanks 10 less thanks again
