welcome to the open source developers at
Google speaker series our guest this
evening is Tim Ansel and he will be
addressing us only topic of gaming for
freedom tim is a recent addition to the
Google engineering team and is also a
graduate of the University of Adelaide
where he studied both computer science
and philosophy should promise be an
interesting evening take away Tim hi I'm
Tim and i'll be talking about gaming and
foss for the next 45 minutes or so so
the first thing is I'm going to assume
you know what force is I'm not going to
get into any arguments about bf vs
freedom or which is the best known
source license or anything like that I
assume that basically its Foss and I
also going to use a slightly different
definition of computer games than most
people generally think of in the media a
lot of people think of computer games as
just the type of games you like the
first person shooters the big hundred
million dollar budget games I'm going to
include every type of computer game from
solitaire all the way up to arm those
big titles so that's my definition of
computer game and that's what i'll be
using when I say computer game so the
talks divided into three kind of primary
sections the first one I'm going to talk
about why you should all care about Foss
games whether or not you're a gamer I
also talked about how Foss games are
already really well-established and how
they're going to continue to be better
and better and I'm also going to talk
about um how to get involved and how to
make your own games exist if you're
interested in producing your own games
so Who am I well I've worked on Foss
games for about seven or eight years now
I started when I was in high school
which is pretty normal for the force
game developers I started with a project
called world for CH which was the first
MMORPG project I'm source mo RPG project
and then I founded a project called
thousand parsec about six I think it's
going on seven years ago and I've been
running that ever since and because i
believe so strongly in games i've been
running a thing called the gaming mini
conf and which is a one-day event a part
of linux conf day you which is one of
the biggest southern hemisphere
open-source conferences and i did that
in 2007 and 2008 and generally I'm
trying to give these type of talks to
give people more information about false
games so yes that's me so yes I am an
Australian that's a picture of Australia
because you're Americans no I'm not
Austrian I'm an Australian you know
kangaroos amuse those type of things
this talk is also very under
construction I've only given this
specific talk once before so I'm going
to try and use lots of animations and
other eye candy to kind of hide all the
things which don't work quite here and
haven't actually been well thought out
so watch out for kind of falling slides
so the real question is why i'm giving
this talk and this kind of slide
summarizes all the reasons i'm giving
this talk and i'm going to go into more
detail over the next couple of slides
some of the just to summarize some of
the things is
there's a real negative inside the force
community that games is one area where
Foss can't compete and I just don't
think that's true the clothes nature of
gaming consoles and gaming preventing
people from moving windows there are two
really important things that people seem
to forget and just that forces already
entered these markets and kind of
working really well and getting forward
and its people don't see this because a
lot of it is fairly secretive because of
the kind of high paced industry the
games industry is and lastly there's
just so many cool games out there and
unless you have been introduced to them
or know how to find them you can often
just not even see that they exist so I
personally think that force is the fire
games Foss games is the final frontier
for force we're doing pretty well well
we pretty much own the kind of embedded
and server market with making good
penetration into just applications with
Firefox and openoffice and games is one
area where people haven't really been
concentrating and the reason people kind
of say force can't compete in games is
because of the large budgets it's a
high-stress industry moves very fast and
when you look back at the early 1990s
these are all exactly the same things
people are saying about linux and foss
they'll never be able to create office
suite nobody will be able to create a
Linux that your grandma can use nobody
will be able to do this
apathy if you look at if you look at
foss now Firefox has twenty percent
market share in the world if even high
in some countries in some European
countries penetration of Firefox is
almost ninety percent mainly because
they can't get I in their own language
line-x revenue last year alone is
considered to be 35 billion dollars
which is ten percent of the software
industries earnings last year which I
dare anybody to say that is not
competing patchy runs seventy percent of
the internet these aren't small pieces
of software that arm don't do do trivial
things these are full complicated pieces
of software and games aren't that more
calm or complicated in games you don't
have to worry about the hundreds of
Microsoft file formats that you do when
you do an open source office suite games
you don't have to worry about the fact
that ninety percent of the web doesn't
comply with standards that you're doing
Firefox so there's no reason that you
couldn't compete in games so the
question often comes up when I'm at foss
conferences I'm talking about computer
games they say I'm not a gamer why
should I care I'm into force I'll run
line X I don't really care about games
there are lots of reasons that um you
should care and this is probably the
biggest one I don't know how many of you
have ever looked at the state of gaming
consoles but to develop for a gaming
console you have to go to the person who
produces the gaming console and request
permission and xbox and playstation have
things like mod chips and stuff like
that but to legitimately produce
a game for a console you have to get a
developer license and this is kind of
what media companies and people like
Microsoft would love to do to your PC
they would love to be able to say that
you can only run the programs that have
paid us a licensing fee on your computer
and I've done it in the case of gaming
consoles so this is why you should be
worried about open source games because
open source games are helping to fight
this problem because otherwise you can
only get this content on the closed
source platform so you're forced to use
it so this is why you should worry about
open source games because otherwise
you're going to end up with a computer
that you can't control the other thing
is if you can hear about linux on the
desktop a lot of people saying i don't
care about gains but i want to see linux
on everybody's computer and games online
XR acquired to see a high market
penetration of linux because at every
fuss conference i go to people put up
their hair i do a kind of survey and
they say okay who uses windows and a
kind of large majority put them up a
hand and i say who uses windows just for
computer games and like fifty percent of
the people in that audience still have
their hand up for that so it's
preventing a large majority of people
who would otherwise be completely false
on their desktop from moving to that so
that's why if you care about line it's
on the desktop you should care about arm
gains on line x
um so the thing this might seem all like
doom and gloom because like the closed
source nature of consoles and that type
of thing but force is actually already
going really well if you look at the mod
chips and the open-source homebrew stuff
where you could easily add in things to
the gaming consoles there are hundreds
of phos games that you can access their
emulators there are full blowing games
so we're actually winning and the great
thing about force is that it grows at an
exponential rate it works really well on
the network effect the more open source
games there are the easier it is to make
a new open source game which means that
there are more open source games which
anybody can see is kind of a feedback
loop which is going to make making open
source games much better and if you look
at the history of computer games almost
all the original computer games were
open source things like space war which
is often considered one of the well if
not the first multiplayer game to exist
on computers was totally open source
dungeon which is one of the first text
based computer games that consumed many
people's colleges back in the 1980s arm
was open while seven I don't know when
it was produced well that's kind of
before I was born so um that was an open
source game and was ported to many
mainframe platforms mud which is kind of
spawned off a whole swath of tech space
multiplayer games was an open source
game the whole kind of mud
schmuck and other multiplayer user games
text based user games all kind of have a
history from this and a majority of them
false based and the other thing is that
commercial games are already using false
this is kind of something that um people
often don't realize that all the
commercial games out there today use
some type of force the first line listed
there are games which have used a force
components directly in their software
things like Python are very common
pythons and M source language and they
embed it because they can get access to
developer resources and makes their
pipeline much quicker things like in the
handheld region things like lure and SQL
Lite are some of the smallest and
highest quality libraries that you can
get for the size they are so they used
in hundreds of games which need
scripting or an SQL type database and
the other thing is stable stability
really matters when you're running a
game if a game goes down you get angry
posts on your forums like seconds after
it goes down so a large majority of
computer game companies who run things
like online services do it on things
like Linux and FreeBSD because they can
get the stability that they matter and
they're also using force internally
things like subversion are very common
in especially the Australian games
industry which is a little bit low lower
margin so they can't afford perfect
things like perforce licenses and a lot
of them use subversion for media things
like
when you're doing media development in
your game you have a media repository
and there's no other revision control
system which can handle the quantity of
data they have they have like 200 and
300 gigabytes worth of binary data so
they using force internally if you look
at the Sony Playstation it uses a GCC
derivative for all their compilers so
force it's already been used in
commercial games and it's getting
increasingly more on there are even
large middleware companies which are
considering opening source their
middleware because they make money from
basically providing the middleware to
companies as a kind of service so
releasing their middleware would
automatically produce a whole bunch of
coders who would work on their middle we
improve it and also get the skills they
need to develop the next generation of
commercial computer games this is not a
not a pipe dream it is happening id
Software always releases their previous
game engine under open source there's a
really huge emulator and that type of
playing old games again which is growing
really well so now I'm just going to go
through kind of some proof of what I've
been saying um there are four games out
there which are in ative and their first
games out there which do have commercial
quality polish a lot of people say our
force games are just like
I don't know bubble bobble your casual
game their first person shooters out
there which have as much polish as the
commercial open source the commercial
first-person shooter games so west north
is a good example of a polished game
it's kind of the heroes of might and
magic and got things like a puzzle game
like fish phillips or nygma chromium
your top down shooter world a pad man
and warsaw which Warsaw is actually a
great story because it's become a very
strong competitive computer game it's
actually being in eSports tournaments
and it has a very strong following
because the type of game they wanted to
make it's very suited for eSports
there's lots of trick jumping and stuff
like this which actually makes it quite
a good game to demonstrate we're going
to put the slides up on the web so if
you need want to like find out more
about these games you'll be able to
download them and click on the links I'm
not going to spend too much time on this
section because um it will get out of
date if you watch this video a year from
now the type of games that out there
will change drastically there's some
really quite good party games out there
things like frets on fire stepmania that
it better or as good if not better than
some of the commercial counterparts
stepmania is actually used in commercial
arcade games that you go to like a a
coin-operated arcade you put your money
in you can actually play a fost game in
a commercial game faas games also vary
in ative
liquid wars is a very hard game to
explain but it's not like anything else
that's out there globul a Shinto is a
real-time strategy game that plays very
differently to how you'd normally play
real time strategy game you don't get to
control your units directly this is a
puzzle game that was written in
originally in a week and you have to
water your plants and the way you do
that is by placing these bricks which
cool one evaporates team this is another
very inert of hard core strategy game
it's very hard so I've never got past
the second level but you can do things
like change the arm shield strength and
where you want to target the ship and
stuff like that so these are the places
you really want to pay attention to
because these are where you can find
more games if you look at fresh meat
which is like a very large database of
UNIX and open source game of software
there 2918 games projects on there the
Linux gain tome has a massive amount of
very good games wikipedian Lee has lots
of them and serve as free gamer that
kind of if you want to watch new and
upcoming games is a great place to see
their blog post find out what's
happening
so now I'm going to talk about thousand
party because if it it's the game I've
had most involvement with and the game
that i can give you the most information
about and this is just the nice intro
movie we have for the game
so just quickly thousand parsec is both
a framework for building turn-based
empire building games and it's a bunch
of playable games that use the framework
it works on mac linux and windows and
the way it works is that's kind of that
any client connect to any server so a
server could be running a kind of start
wars or stop star trek rule set and you
can use the same client to connect to
either downloads all the rules and
configures itself so that you can play
that type of game it's kind of what I
would call the web of 4x strategy games
so thousand partake has been growing
very rapidly in the recent years but it
took a very long time to get started if
you look at this graph here for almost
up until somewhere around 2003-2004
there wasn't much activity and you can
see now like most open source projects
once you kind of get over this hump
we've grown quite massively and this is
like a download history and our web
traffic and that's pretty normal for an
open source game takes quite a long time
before it gets noticed before people
start playing it and being interested in
it before a project takes off and we
have about 150 k lines of code and total
of which about fifty percent is in C++
thirty percent is in Python and the rest
is in kind of Java and a whole bunch of
other languages we're fairly
cross-language we have support for C++
Python and Java and we have people
writing clients in those languages
so what helped us grow most in the
recent years is the google Summer of
Code last year was our first year that
we joined summer of code and we had four
students as part of the Summer of Code
the one another students did a massive
amount of work on making it easier to
make a new rule set if you want to make
a star wars game it's much easier now he
wrote an integrated development
environment for it and we've started
like our target audience being games is
pretty much young people although all
people do play older people do play lots
of computer games students tend to have
much more time on their hands when
they're procrastinating for exams so
we've started reaching out to students
to help our development and if you're
interested in finding out more about how
we're doing that I did a podcast with
Leslie Hawthorne who is the the host of
this talk and you'll be up shortly after
this talk and you can listen about some
of them more experiences and some record
so last year we won student committed 20
thousand lines of code in three months
this year we have eight students and in
the two weeks since summer eco started
we've already had two over two hundred
commits so I guess the next section is
kind of to explain how we kind of grew
this project because it's okay saying
okay here's our project here where it at
what you don't see is how we got to
where we are oh and the most recent
really cool thing that one of the
students is doing is this is what our
client looks currently it's very windows
3.1 very utilitarian it does work very
well but it's not very pretty the
student is using our library is to
develop a 3d client and this is the only
been working at two weeks and this is
what is produced so far a very 3d
environment that looks like much more
like a commercial game and we hope by
the end of the summer we'll have
something that looks as good if not
better than some of the current games
like sins of a solar empire or like
Supreme Commander and he's actually
leveraging the same client libraries and
stuff that support the kind of windows
3.11 and just before I move on we really
need people to help us play test we've
got coders we've got people doing
packaging we really need people to just
download and try the game and then tell
us what isn't fun about it or what
doesn't work so please come and help us
play the client is one click install in
Windows and Mac and we have dead
herbs forearm you bun to and debian on
line x we have e builds for gen 2 and so
there's some guys working on rpms for
all our systems so often when people say
i want to make a game this is the
general kind of post oh my god let's
make a really cool MMORPG and this is
the not the best way to make your game
so we do need you to help contributor
for the reasons I mentioned in the first
part it's also really fun to do um you
get to make games that work the way you
want to I'm not a person who's strong in
the dexterity I don't play first-person
shooter games very much because it just
it's a click fest I'm not I'm in too
much more strategy games so that's what
thousand parsec is it's a very strong
strategy game if you're into the first
person shooting trick jumping you need a
millisecond response time you can make
the game that way you don't have to
pander to the common denominator that a
lot of game companies have to do to sell
their hundred million units if you have
an itch community of 10,000 gamers and
around the world you can make the game
that they want to play so my first tip
for making a game is you want to release
as early as possible the first time you
have something that compiles and does
something non trivial this is a lot of
these apply to foss projects in general
but games it's particularly important
because nobody will play a game unless
they can actually compile and use it a
lot of games projects die
was nobody sat down and released it so
that's my first tip my second tip is
that release often are a majority of
people who will play your game won't
check out this subversion repository
they won't download the hundred
dependencies that you want so release a
candidate often that they can play with
even if it isn't a stable people are
much more likely to test a game and play
it if they can get access to it easily
which leads into my next point you
really do need to make it easy to
install thousand parsecs into a
one-click install for windows it's a
one-click install for Mac online it's a
little bit harder but we're hoping to
get into the distributions and we're
trying to release a like on a six
monthly cycle now so it gives people the
opportunity to actually play what we're
developing and this is a vital
importance because if you look at we
spent two years rewriting our primary
client and if you look at the graph the
moment we released 0.30 arm which is the
latest version of our client we had a
massive spike in our lease and every
time of relief done another release
after that we've had a massive spike in
downloads so releasing early make it
easier to download releasing off and all
tips to building your gaming community
and the other thing is that you need to
promote yourself projects don't continue
if they don't have other people working
on them you need to have go out and tell
people that you're actually doing this
cool thing
that's a lot what I try and do with in a
lot of context I'd go out there and I
just pick 10 examples 20 examples and
promote them so that you can you can see
what's out there lots of people don't
realize the quality of the games out
there they don't realize that they can
get first-person shooter games for free
that work on their windows or linux or
mac another excuse often here is that I
don't have the time to develop a game
when you look at thousand parsecs I've
spent seven years work on that imposter
and people just look at that and go
you're crazy i would never stick with
something for seven years but you don't
have to there are plenty of open source
games that came about from these
competitions there's a thing called pi
week where the each time it runs you
have to develop a complete runnable game
in a week that's where a lot of these
really infinitive games come from I'm
like that Nellie's garden I believe came
out of one of these competitions I'm not
exactly sure which one but I know it
came out of one of these and that game
is really interesting to play there's if
you don't have seven days maybe you just
want to spend a weekend the Lum ludum
dare um gaming competition is a great
way to get into it and you don't have to
have much in were in the terms of
experience to do this things like Python
and pygame have meant that a person
who's got a reasonable level of Python
can start doing game development in
under an hour pi day is kind of the
newest one and only ones for 24 hours
people have to make a complete game in
24 hours and people do
and its really I mean even if you don't
end up doing it I recommend checking out
these because there's a lot of really
cool interesting stuff and the best ones
always seem to continue after the
conference anyway um after the
competition anyway so python is really
the key to writing any open source game
quickly there people complained that
python is slow but it's not if you do it
right for the simple reason that all
your libraries are written in C++ things
like Eau de or your 3d engine do all the
heavy lifting and see puss-puss you just
write the game that you want to write
not caring about the 3d matrix that has
to transform the camera angles and stuff
like this which makes it very quick to
throw together a game I highly recommend
checking out Python for go there are
lots of stuff in the languages like Java
and C++ I haven't had much experience
with them and from looking at things
like the 24 hour programming game
competition there's hardly any games
written in other languages just because
it takes too long so if you're using
Python I recommend that you check out
piglet it's a very nice gaming engine
that makes it very easy to write again
the most impressive talk I've ever seen
was the guy by the two guys who wrote
this they wrote a clone of space
invaders in a talk they were giving a 45
minute talk they will had one guy
explaining what the other guy was doing
and the other guy just SAT there and
tightened and created space invaders
45 minutes it's up on the web if you
don't believe me you don't believe
that's actually occurred there's a video
over on google video just search for
piglet he'll be the first or second
video there and you can watch them
literally create a game before your eyes
it was really really impressive if you
don't the piglet requires opengl
hardware if you're more into the 2d
games or you want to talk something like
the old pc have a look at something like
pie game pie game I'm came before piglet
it's a bit older and is stl but it's a
great way to write a quick 2d scrolling
game or a like it's not for your first
person shooters it's for your kind of
older games but it's really fun to do
you can do plenty of different things
and if you go to their website you can
see what various people can do and it's
really amazing and i highly suggest you
check it out if you're into that type of
game if you're into 3d there are also
many ways that you can leverage over
source projects that already exist you
don't have to write your own 3d game ah
3d engine to do a game things like Olga
3d its of that's what our new client
with all those 3d graphics is written in
it's written on top of ogre 3d and that
guy had has only had about two weeks
worth of development time to put
together that very specky looking arm
game things like crystal space also very
good at doing computer games they also
have like ogres just a rendering engine
where's crystal space has all your like
network
your physics it means you can put
together again very very quickly and
then there's things like ear Lich and
nebula device again they have different
targets but they do provide full support
for wide variety of things I even
believe that nebula device has been used
in a number of smaller commercial games
in Europe it was released by a
commercial game company who was using
their engine to do commercial games so
you can do really advanced stuff with
these things so that's kind of the end
of my presentation I'm happy to take
questions from anybody and or just stand
around discuss your favorite force games
or whatever the audience wants questions
there's a mic behind you if you want to
ask a question can you stand up at it
either I can repeat the question if it's
just short questions come on don't be
scared um I have heard about I don't
know its name yep so um there's a game
according to this guy down the front
called ultra star which is a clone of
singstar I know there's at least a
couple of games which do very similar
things to sing star I don't know how
good it is but yeah
yeah yep playstation xbox wii yeah what
would it take to get open source to the
gaming console is it monetizable would
it ever happen the question was i
mentioned that game consoles are closed
at the moment and how whether or not you
could get own sauce on these and how you
might go about monetizing it and stuff
like that the biggest blocker to the
open source on the console is the semi
freak it's that the microsoft then that
we have started producing their kits
where you can create your own game and
you go through a QA process and then if
they like your game they'll publish it
on there like xbox live network the
thing about using these is that you can
only do it on their console and they
have fairly draconian in what you can do
if you want to make a satire game about
something that quite vested in they
won't let you do there and they won't
they basically get a lot of rights you
want otherwise give away so that's the
biggest barrier to open source because
it kind of tempts people that you can
write your own games for xbox but you
don't get you can't write an open source
game for xbox at the moment the great
thing that's happening on the
playstation 3 at the moment is that sony
have come out and said they support
running linux on their PlayStation 3
they don't give you access to the 3d
accelerator on the PlayStation 3 so
you've only got access to kind of the
hard drive and the like cell processor
but there's some pretty cool things you
can do even with that limited platform
and I kind of I hope it's so nice
tarting to see the light that there are
a lot of you can leverage a lot of this
to let people produce games for your
console which lets you sell a sell more
consoles and once you sell more consoles
you can sell more commercial games and
how you monetize it is a question I
don't really know but I think there are
a lot of games which you could
distribute in terms of a client-server
model where the client and the server
both dopant sauce but the content on the
server is closed so things like the
quests that our server has or have the
media like the graphics and stuff like
that the game has and then that's what
draws people to you subscribe to a
service rather than selling a piece of
software and I think there's a lot of
potential in the MMORPG kind of market
and anything among those type of lines
it does mean somebody else would come
along and set up a new MMORPG with a
whole bunch of different storylines but
competition is healthy and you means
you'll get more interesting games
because the barrier to entry is lower if
you tomorrow turn around the and decide
that you have this really cool idea for
an MMORPG if the Middle where is already
there you can put together for probably
fifty thousand dollars in terms of cost
which makes a much lower bad entry which
means we get lots more games at the
moment games are costing hundred million
dollars they're on the same price as
like Hollywood which means that to make
money off them you have to sell a
hundred million units which means that
you
have to sell your game to everyone you
can't sell it to a niche market because
there aren't a hundred million people in
that niche market so I think once we
start seeing them sorts take over that
area providing you the tools to produce
content there's a lot of interesting
things that could happen in the air yeah
I do think so the question was the arm
that with open source the gameplay is
the advantage do you ever think that the
open source will catch up in that eye
candy air and I think yes it will it
might take a well it will take a while I
think people said the same thing in
terms of eye candy on the desktop in
things like 3d desktops and compositing
and Linus has shown that it can lead the
way in that area it had some of the
first true compositing long before Vista
was released and it still does lots of
effects that you can't do on vista or
mad cause I think that we're Foss can
really go forward is in kind of
generated content once you get to a
certain level of detail having an artist
craft by hand no longer becomes feasible
because there's just too much to look at
so you start having computers assist the
artist in creating the model by doing
things like motion capture and stuff
like that and the price of all these
things is really dropping I can purchase
a high-speed camera for ten thousand
dollars now which is good enough to do a
variety of motion capture type things
and that's dropping
considerably sony released a
high-definition camera on the market
recently which used to be costs like a
thousand dollars and that's now like two
hundred dollars which is once these
tools become available and once the foss
community starts using them i think it
will kind of start having this network
effect once you have this person solving
how to do excuse me I'm skeletal
animation and this person figuring out
how to defer in real time you then
combine the two which you can't do in a
commercial setting because you have to
pay him some money because he developed
the fur thing and once we start hitting
that the network effect really kicks in
and I candy will have to be better on
foss because of that um you basically
put like a single color on various
locations on your body and then yes in
two cameras to do like more than simple
stuff but yeah you put the things on and
then the person moves and then you map
it to your skeleton in a character I'm
not an expert on motion capture and it
does remind me of a fost library though
called lib cal.3d which was one of the
first libraries ever to do skeletal 3d
animation combinar combining so like
when a person's walking they do a motion
capture of somebody walking and emotion
capture somebody running but people
don't like when moving around in games
they don't move but only two speeds they
move at halfway between this so you
can't have a artist generate a hundred
different animations of somebody moving
at different speeds so this technology
was developed which allowed you to blend
the two animations and from my
understanding lib cal.3d was the first
library to do that fairly well
and it was actually you for a long time
it was used in commercial games for this
because there was nothing else out there
that was affordable and did it as well
so that's an example of where Foss works
really well so yeah I think we I think
the network effect means that force
winds full stop it just might take a
while to get there to be able to modify
the game but then take a network game if
somebody modifies its client to see
through walls so roles to a change the
behavior and everything it's infinitely
easier to do it with so the question was
what about cheating you've got the
source code you can modify it to do what
you want so hence arm you can cheat you
can do things like remove walls um this
is the classic argument and I think
people have already proven that security
through obscurity doesn't work anyway so
the thing games have for it is that
games tend to only be around for a
couple of years so that there's not
enough time for people to figure out
what's happening I think Foss is going
to have to take a different route and
develop games we're doing that type of
thing isn't an advantage and other
things you can do like you could have a
server for first person shooter game
which only tells you your location so if
you removed all the walls you can't see
anybody else because the server's not
giving you that information in real-time
strategy games the way you you stop
people cheating is by doing a
simultaneous simulation you record what
people's import is and then you play it
back on both the other person's computer
so if this code isn't identical to this
computer it slowly diverges and then you
get um different outcomes and it knows
somebody's not being correct this is how
commercial games even do real-time
strategy games because it much allows
much lower latency and means you don't
have to transmit so much information so
yeah there are ways around this and I'm
actually looking into in my spare time a
way to do achieve manan open source
environment without with being able to
modify the client so in a lot of
computer games you can when you kill
somebody a hundred what kill enemies a
hundred times you get a gold star or
something like this which appears on
your profile on a website somewhere that
says this guy is really cool he has
killed a hundred people or he solved a
hundred puzzles or he's done something
like this and what I'm really interested
in is trying to figure out how because
the person's can look inside the code
they just go on for hundreds even Saul I
do is post this request to the server
and it posts the request to the server
and he gets a hundred achievements so
how do you solve this problem and I
think I may have figured out a way using
a kind of um PGP type system of a sphere
of trust like where you don't upload
your own achievements you upload
achievements of others so when you see
somebody do a headshot you upload the
fact that this person has done a
headshot and then you can use this that
you only upload information for people
you trust and they're Devils in the
details but I think I've got a way to
solve this and it will be released in
open source so that any open source game
can then at these feature and they'll be
able to have this type of achievements
in their games which is
clients in one nearly 50 each other yes
but but it does help because if you have
enough people the Cheetahs will come
glom rate in a part of a network which
nobody else trusts so you've got a chain
of trust do you track this achievement
is determined on arm the fact that you
trust him who trust him who trust him
and it is the same type of network of
trust type of thing I haven't worked out
the details it might not work but I'm
going to give it a try with in the next
six months I'll be interested to see
what happens even if it's a failed
experiment I don't have much knowledge
of how country how the web of trust
works in pgp so I'm going to learn lots
about that and the great thing is pgp is
open source so I can reuse a lot of that
which means my barrier to entry into
cryptography is lower than somebody who
has the doors and commercial setting
which is what I really love about false
yeah where's your picture come from um I
just recently started here at Google
I've been here for two weeks I've been
working on thousand parsec for seven
years and I started that back in uni or
is it high school oh that's only free
time I've never been paid to work on
open source games that's kind of what I
hope to do one day in the future for now
not yes and I'm not in the kind of hole
starving person I kind of like my food
so yes I'll work continue to work in
other areas until I can solve that
problem but it is happening people are
at least three people I know who start
off and forth now we're
in the commercial games industry doing
various foster so I yeah it it's
happening and I think it's an exciting
time because we're kind of back in the
equivalent to the kind of 1995 in terms
of line it's on the desktop type thing
so we're still growing and we I think
there's lots of really cool things
happening and I think like lights and
desktop is finally starting to come true
I think from now on that we'll we'll see
some interesting things so yes yeah a
lot of game series like to keep it quiet
because they think of it as a
competitive advantage oh sorry the
question was are there any large game
studios contributing the force in the
same way the kind of IBM and other large
industry industry things are
contributing false and I think people
are our games still have this kind of
idea that they can hide things through
secure obscurity and they don't like to
advertise the fact that all our
infrastructure runs on linux and
subversion and we're not paying the X
thousands of dollars to perforce so
that's money we get to keep and there's
lots of kind of and the high churn in
the games industry most games companies
don't last very long which means that
people tend to move don't have the time
to establish this I know the a lot of
gaming universities have started to
establish a lot of like using
the source because they can't afford to
buy unreal tournaments middleware
because it costs a hundred thousand
dollars or something like that for a
license so i've been using things like
yoga and stuff like that to teach the
students the concepts so that they can
then go along and use it and there's
lots of cool stuff coming out of
academia there's also lots of cool stuff
can from academia in a totally unrelated
direction using games for education like
there's a big problem at the moment with
getting women into computer science and
there's some really good stuff going on
at carnegie mellon about making computer
programming fun in terms of more
interesting to different people to
access it and uh yeah Alice that's a
Carnegie Mellon's written this engine
which supposed to make writing games
much easier and you write it like a
script in a movie or something like that
rather than programming and then after
they learn all about all these concepts
you then kind of turn around and say oh
yeah now you know how to program because
they do learn all this stuff they just
didn't realize it there's stuff on I
don't know how well it works and Alice I
haven't had much exposure to it but
there's a really really strong one chord
um I think it's ren pie it's actually
very very popular among among like in
japan at the moment because lots of
people it you write us kind of a it's
kind of like text-based adventure games
but with graphics so you write a kind of
script of how you want your game to game
to progress and there
these games are really really popular
among certain groups and I believe like
the penetration of that in females is
the community is eighty-five percent
female and if there's a huge amount of
non-english stuff going on there as well
games tend to be segregated to the
English markets because of the cost of
commercial computer games they cost
fifty sixty dollars so you need to
produce them in English because there's
only so many people who will be willing
to pay had that much disposable income
so yeah it's there lots of interesting
things coming out of education with our
PC there's lots of interesting kind of
game stuff coming up on the old pc i'm
specifically even using pygame pygame
works on the OPC and there's some
interesting things happening there
there's just such a wide variety of
things that are happening there's a
really good story about a guy who used
he has an autistic son so he developed a
game using pie gang for his autistic son
to play there aren't that many autistic
people in the world so this game is now
really popular among this niche
community because of the open source
stuff he was able to produce this and
they can access it it's like a
commercial game company wouldn't come
along and say there's X there's this
really niche population I'm going to
produce a game for them because they
won't see us being profitable whereas
forces began to provide this so I think
it's probably time to wrap stuff up step
correct Leslie
I'm quite I'm gonna be around so feel
free to come and check to me personally
or argue with me with stuff you don't
agree with or correcting me on like
various things I've got wrong and I'm
not perfect and there's just so much
going on that I'm sure everyone in this
room has seen something in the force
world that are yet to come across I've
been doing this for I 89 years and every
foss conference I go to there's at least
two or three projects I go wow I
wouldn't think that's possible wow I
didn't know people were working on that
I didn't think people could work on that
so it's pretty cool time to be involved
with it thank you very much for
listening to you and I hope you have a
good afternoon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
