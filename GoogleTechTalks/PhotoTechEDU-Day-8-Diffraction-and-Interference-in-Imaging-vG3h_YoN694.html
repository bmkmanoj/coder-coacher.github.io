tech of photographic technology and so
my name is rom Clement I did the third
lecture on ray tracing and today I'm
going to talk about diffraction and by
pursuing the math of diffraction we'll
talk about diffraction gratings and how
they're extremely useful for
spectroscopy which is the analysis of
the light so diffraction before talking
about diffraction we need to know a
little bit what light is so light is an
electromagnetic waves made of magnetic
field H in an electric field E and in
everything that we're going to do here
we need to have an understanding of
what's the intensity of light is so the
intensity of light is the time average
of the pointing vector but in everything
that we're going to do today we will
consider the wave as of the light as a
plane wave and basically the intensity
intensity of light will be proportional
to e square or to the amplitude of the
light square so that will be a lot more
easier to compute the total intensity so
just a couple of assumptions to simplify
all the math we will consider that where
we are in a linear media I'm a genius
and isotropic as I said before that we
are far enough from the light source so
that the light is or can be considered
as to be as a plane wave and with all
this difference assumption and assuming
that we don't have charges in the media
or that we don't have current in the
media the Maxwells equation are a lot
more simplified so first experiment that
probably a lot of you has seen at high
school is
the young experiment so using a source s
and two holes s1 and s2 you know in a
sort of sheet of paper if I'm looking on
the other sides of this sheet of paper
with these two openings on the screen or
on the wall a couple of meters away from
this sheet if this holes are actually
slots I have this variation of contrast
on my wall so stripes of black stripes
and white stripes so the if we do the
mass so the intensity which is
proportional again to a square is not
only the superposition of i1 and i2
which would be the intensity from the
electric field e 1 coming from the
source s 1 plus the intensity from the
source s 2 with the electric field e 2
but there's a coupling j12 in which
there is a modulation of the two of the
two intensity and so Delta is what is
cold or is coming from the difference of
optical path which means that a distance
s 12 p where p is the point where i'm
looking at in in my in my screen is
different so this distance minus s1 is
different than this distance ministers
to so everything that we're going to do
in mainly for diffraction is based on
this aspect which is that because I will
have a slightly different optical path I
will create constructive or destructive
interferences and I won't go into many
details but in the case of the young
experiment it is very very important
that in order to have interferences that
we have the same wind wave length that
we are
the same sources because the source s 1
and asked to seems to be different let's
say on the right side of the the drawing
but they're actually coming from the
same source s and it is related to the
notion of current career and slant of
the search but again I won't talk in too
many details about that so what's
diffraction diffraction occurs when the
wavelength of the wave so it can be
light of course infrared ultraviolet but
any phenomena which can be a described
as a wave so when this wavelengths has
about the same size as an object then
diffraction can occur so it for very
simple case is just a very tiny needle
hole in a sheet of paper where we can
have diffraction for the visible light
or even an open door in a wall would
generate diffraction for a wave which be
which would be around 100 mega mega
Hertz and so we'll seeing much more
details the expression of an accurate
expression of the angle of diffraction
but as the as the first feeling what's
happening is that the angle is about is
proportional to the wavelength over a
where a would be the aperture or the
diameter of the hole so I don't want to
scare you with the math that just to
give you a feeling of how a diffraction
is is computed so i have a i have an
opening i have an aperture in a in a
sheet of paper for instance i have a
point source p 0 which is again assume
pretty far from this aperture so that
the incoming beam of light is is
parallel and that and that
the plane waves and I'm looking at this
aperture at from the point p which is so
they're there for behind behind this
aperture and so the amplitude of the
wave Fred view from this point P it can
be simply expressed as the integral over
the the over the aperture of the
incoming light so in our case we will
consider that's this pupil function is
equal to one when we're inside the
opening and equal to 20 so the first
example which is done very often because
it can be computed by hand is just a
rectangular aperture um so of with 2a
and hate to be and so if we're computing
the amplitude so you over this aperture
so we're doing the integral over the
surface what's happening is that the
intensity which is proportional to the
amplitude square is the product of the
sinner c function so sin as x over x and
so looking in 3d to this formula or
expression of the intensity so we we
have a pretty important peak in the
middle but then as we can see also on
the on the left pictures on the picture
on the left we also have secondary waves
in these two directions so that's that's
diffraction and that's pretty far from
what we could have let's say presume
where we would have believed that well
it's a rectangular aperture so i should
see a pretty well and very sharp
rectangle in in my on my screen or on my
wall or in my focal plane but
unfortunately because this aperture is
pretty small or is about the same as the
wavelength of the light
I have this this pretty big pattern if
we're looking at a circular aperture
which is the most common case because
most of the optics usually are our
circular the expression is a little bit
different it it is to j1 which is the
Bessel function but it has them the same
let's say characteristic so a very clear
spot in the middle and then we see a
first ring of a flight and then the
third one and so on and so forth so yeah
this is just to see the difference
between the two so it's normalized of
course 2214 the maximum but the
secondary peak in the case of a
rectangular aperture is about less than
five percent of the total and the second
one is about it's less than two percent
it's even less for the circular opening
or circular aperture but as we will see
it the problem is how how to define the
spot this is just another illustration
of so they're slightly different but
it's it has the same same characteristic
one big pick in the middle and secondary
pics on the sides so um we this is this
is the sort of this is a problem because
we were for instance let's assume you
were using a telescope and that we were
looking at a star so which can be nearly
considered as a perfect point source
instead of having a perfect tiny spot in
my focal plane I have this shape or the
this profile of intensity so how can i
define my or
or let's say when do I say that I can
consider that the remaining energy or
the remaining intensity is it is
negligible so the first first peak
contains already about eighty four
percent of the total intensity the
second one about 91 and the third one
not about 94 but this is probably not
sufficient if we want to if we consider
now the case where we would have two
stars so I have here I'm looking for
instance I to start with which has the
same intensity and here well they're
pretty well they're fairly well
separated in my in my focal plane but
now let's assume that they're getting
closer so same intensity for these two
what's start to happen is that so I have
a first speaking in the blue curve for
my first star and then I have a second
peak and mud which is my second store
but in reality the intensity is the sum
of the two so now I start to have let's
say a minimum local locally between my
two spots and things are getting I mean
the my total profile is growing are my
minimum local is increasing up to the
point where well now the toll is only
one peak so there's no way for me to to
tell that there was there is there was
initially two stars and not only one
store so if I just go back here can I
say that I have to
a peak or two stars well it's not that
that trivial because we need to take
into account this is the continuous
domain but in reality i will have a
certain special resolution of my film or
or a certain size of pixels so if I keep
going of course the peak is growing in
intensity up to the point where my two
initial profile of spots are completely
merged in the total intensity is twice
the initial of the two so there was a
lot of people has worked on this problem
in the past in order to define a
creature equatorial criterion which
would allowed us to tell or to say that
yes we can say that there is two spots
or no beyond this point we cannot so the
first person who's talked about this as
far as I I found was a bee who so gave
this criteria which is that so the
angular aperture theta off the peak or
let's say under the the angular aperture
theta a b which is equal to one point
2196 lander / DD being the aperture of
the telescope of the aperture of the
objects so if i go under this angler or
this angle i will not be able to tell
that there is two peaks relay did had a
different approach which was a lot more
based on the best cells function and the
airy disc the airy disc is the first 0
of the Bessel function so let's say it's
the middle of the first black circle
that you've seen previously oh and the
result was
nearly the same if not if not identical
so this is this is the Rayleigh
criterion so as you can see what's
happening is that the this the middle of
the first spot is precisely located in
there 0 of the second spot and so the
total intensity or total profile of
intensity in the raid Kirk red curve has
this this a local minimum local right
right right right in the middle um but
this is not the only criteria Sparrow
came with another one which is based on
the so minimum local of the two peak and
so when the total when the sum of the
two peak is slightly flat or perfectly
flat just as for this optimum then
what's happening is the angular
resolution is point 94 so it's less
drastic than the relic criteria and
there is a fourth one which is the
Houston criterion in which in this case
is based on the fool with that health
maximum so again it's a little bit it's
a little bit different than previously
but generally speaking you have the idea
that using this criterion I have an
angle under which well and if I go under
this angle there's no way for me to tell
you or to get more information so as I
said before this is the continuous that
previously that was the continuous
domain so we could tell that indeed we
could see that they were indeed two
small peaks in this a total bigger peak
but we need now to add a sensor and
therefore special resolution so let's
start first with
first answer so this is this is one
pixel in the second one and the third
one and so what's going to happen here
is that the my pixel in the middle is
basically going to collect all the
intensity of light containing the two
peaks where is the the otherwise will
barely get this let's say secondary and
tertiary peaks and if I count my
electrons at the in my CC do in this
pixel I will have a lot of electrons in
the pixel in the middle but nearly
nothing in the in the remaining two so
when I will just display the picture on
my screen I will just see Bailey 0 and
then a peak in the mill so there's no
way I can extract the to the to peak or
say that there's two peaks so if I now
take smaller pixels so one in the middle
would collect a certain proportion of
the the two and unfortunately finally I
will have a larger peak but again it's
going to be one peak so again I need to
decrease again the size of the pixels up
to this point where i will have
basically three pixels at the bottom of
my two peaks and the one in the middle
would be slightly less than these two so
that I will be able to tell well there
is a first pick and then it goes down
and then I get it a third peak so I
basically need to have three pixels
contain within the within the two zeros
of or between the 20 of my total
function which is so the sum of the two
two spots and this is what is just cold
the knickers cataria so
the optimum is when I have two pixels
inside my era disk or so two pixels for
my inside my peak my main in principle
peak and of course if I'm we don't want
to be under or oversight over sample
because if I'm under simple under simple
it just means that I have a very very
good optical system and I'm not using
the appropriate sensor or CCD or I could
get a lot more information and a lot
more resolution if I was using a ccd
with smaller pixels on the others on the
other hand I don't want to be over
simple because it means that I have too
many pixels and inside my area disk and
maybe I should get a another sensor with
bigger pixels which would just just a
second which would have so maybe bigger
pixel and might be cheaper or I would
might be also have a shorter exposure
time yes that should i box yeah yeah
yeah that's that's very true so yeah
just a very very quick example just to
explain that it is not only do two and
diffraction is not only do because i
have an aperture and diffraction also
occur when with straight edges so for
instance in this case if I following in
the w direction the intensity profile
what's happening is so very very far up
behind behind my straight edge so it's
completely black so I don't have any
light but as if I go down
than my screen was going to happen is my
intensity of light will increase or I
will have some light behind my straight
edge so yeah so right right here i will
get for instance climbing right here as
seen on the curve here i will have so
twenty twenty-five percent of of the
light and then i will have a certain
oscillation of the intensity and then it
going to converge to two to one so the
math a little bit tricky but it's it's
an it's interesting so now let's apply
or look at diffraction gratings and how
they can be very very useful for
spectroscopy so i guess i'll try not to
spend too much time on on this light so
spectroscopy is the analysis of light
and as I guess everybody's has already
done this before if I'm using a
perfectly white light just a simple bulb
and if I'm using it so a prism I have a
rainbow going from the red if not ultra
red down to the violet if not also
ultraviolet so this is called continuous
spectrum but um if we're looking at a
star or if we're looking at the sodium
lamp or mercury lamp of the spectrum of
of such such a devices is not continuous
it is it has very very well defined
lines which are very very very very well
define collars and what we're seeing is
actually the total in the sum of this
different different colors let's say
that the emission spectrum bah
so the opposite of an emission spectrum
would be an absorption spectrum where I
would have so white light but between my
instrument my spectroscope and this
source of light I can have a gas and
this gas will absorb certain wavelengths
precise wavelengths so in a continuous
spectrum I'll have absorption lines or
black black lines and by analyzing this
black line I will be able to extract
information of of my gas so the
constitution of my gas or the molecules
amount of my gas so here on this
drawings prisms can be used for
scattering the light and obtaining a
spectrum but we can also use different
devices called gratings which are based
on diffraction to do the same thing and
to obtain the same thing yeah I won't
spend a lot of time on this slide so
it's the concept of emission and
absorption so items are capture or
capturing or emitting energy and if the
level of energy is sufficient enough
it's it can be light and by changing the
level of energy of the electrons we are
releasing very very or atoms are
releasing very very accurate in terms of
wavelength or level of energy which is
equivalent photons so in in spectroscopy
we're very very very interested in they
are now in the analysis of the lines all
because a line is a is a very very well
if it's if the line is thin enough we
can determine very very well the
wavelength and from the wavelength we
can
extract the energy of of the photons and
from this energy we can extract the the
type of atoms or the type of molecules
from which this photons has been emitted
or absorbed and that we can do also a
lot more than just sitting this is the
position of these lines of the wave
length of this line by using by studying
their distortions so we can extract
depending on the level of resolution of
the spectroscope but the thermal
environment of the source the pressure
the magnetic field the electric field as
well as also the velocity of the of the
source but as you can see for certain
type of soaps such as the Zeeman effect
for the magnetic field we really need to
go to a very very high resolution of the
spectroscope and in order to have access
to this type of information we really
need to scatter the light a lot in
although in other words we really need
to have a very very very long
spectrogram in order to see and to look
into very very tiny details the lines
yes yes so great tales so I'll just show
you pictures of what they look like in
reality but the principles of gradings
is is kind of simple it's it's so it's a
repetition of a pattern and this this
pattern all because of this repetition
we will introduce very very tiny
difference of optical path which at the
very end will induce interferences and
and well and we'll see how to extract
information so in the first first case
that the top left it's a it's a sine
sine wave spectroscope they're used in
holography we can also find a kind of so
shape of the spectra for for certain
great gratings I'm sorry or even this
kind of step step gratings at the bottom
and yeah very very common example of
gratings our CDs or when CDs and DVDs
are not gratings but because we have
this repetition of this lines on a CD or
DVD or also on credit cards Holograms we
we can see the I ride essence on on this
devices so this is for instance what
gratings are look look like so on the
left you have a reflective grading so I
will explain on the next slide so how
they made but they're usually about this
size you can also find smaller smaller
one a couple of centimeters square and
they're also Muslims I'm glued on a very
very quite thick piece of substrate or
glass just to just well it just to be
very very flat and stiff you can also
have a second type of great things which
are transmission gratings where most of
the time they look like just us just
small slides and so the way it's working
is so the light or in the case of a
transmission gratings is coming from one
side and is as and it's to go through
the gratings and the light is diffracted
according to certain orders i will
explain later what an order is and the
case of her
effective gradings it's the same thing
but with with reflection so a reflective
gratings are made of so the the grading
itself so the shape of the top itself is
usually made with a mold and so it's an
epoxy layer and then the epoxy is glued
on a thick substrate or thick piece of
glass and then the coating is added on
on the top and what is quite useful to
is that we can tune using so when it's
called the blades angle we can tune the
angle of the waves so that we will focus
more the light or more intensity in a
specific order but again I will talk
about the what's in order justjust later
yeah so for in case of perfective
gradings the cost is about a couple of
hundred dollars it's a lot cheaper for
transmission grading but it's harder to
get a higher number of lines or grooves
per millimeter and they're also lower
they have also lower efficiency so again
I don't want to scare you it's just too
I'm just trying to give you a sense of
what's what's happening so let's do the
math for transmission gradings um if
we're assuming so transmission grading
made of n slits or n slots each slot
sizing up an aperture s and the distance
between the slots is is d so if I'm just
considering two beams all because the
second beam will go through a different
slots I introduce a difference of
optical path delta which is proportional
to the distance between these two
thoughts but also proportional to the
difference of the incident beam in my
diffracted beam so if we sum everything
I mean all this variation of amplitude
and difference of phase for this for eat
all these amplitudes or I'm sorry for
all these beams the functioned I mean
this function is is appearing so the
total intensity is proportional to this
function times I 0 where I 0 it's just
the intensity of one once slot so I've
just copy the previous formula so I have
one function which is the products which
is due to my end slots which has this
this shape times the initial profile of
the offer also it's a slot so it's a
rectangular aperture with a very very
long let's say with vs hate and the
total of these two leads to this
function where I have what is go here
the order 0 so the maximum of intensity
in the middle but then at a very very
well-defined angle which is lender over
D and unfortunately might be hard to
read it I have a second I mean I have a
second peak and added another angle to
lender over D I have a third peak so
call respectively the order number one
and the order number two so what's very
important here is that at a very precise
angle lender over d i know that i'm
looking at a specific wavelength or at a
very well-known wavelength and
so so so in if I'm increasing or
doubling this angle i know that i will
also looking at the same wavelength so
this is how things are working for
transmission gratings on reflective
gratings so if you want to use gratings
these two formula are there the
references it's it's working it's
working all the time so if I'm just
looking at the transmission gratings
what's happening is I have an incident
beam of light with a given angle theta 0
and if i'm looking on the other side of
my gradings at the order theta zero i'm
just looking at the straight straight
light which is which has not been
deflected so i have basically the image
of my source um but then because i have
one two thousand gross per millimeter in
this in this grading what's happening is
if i'm looking on the side of also be
behind my behind migrating if i'm
looking on the side i will start to see
a first peek of light assuming that I'm
that my pointers only have one one
wavelength at order which is called the
other one and if I keep going I will see
my second order so order 0 but this the
the phenomena is completely symmetrical
so if I'm just going back to my order 0
and moving by another angle but on the
left side I will see my order minus 1
and order menace to UM as well and the
same system is sem phenomena is
occurring for the reflective great
greetings so this is the simple case
where I have or i'm looking at a source
which has one wavelength but now let's
assume that
I I am looking at a source whose
wavelength is what is within the visible
spectrum and just let's consider that I
have two wavelengths so lambda 1 400
nanometers and lender to 800 nanometers
so if I'm looking at my first order M
won my first wavelength so blue which
would be very very blue actually is I
will see it at 12.3 degrees my second
wave lengths will I will see it at 14.7
now if I'm looking at my order number to
the first wave lengths of the blue one
will occur at 14.7 so very very close to
my red line and my second wave length
will be at nineteen point five degrees
but if I keep going and look at the
third order well it's getting pretty
annoying because my first wavelength is
at seventeen degrees so my first
wavelength is before my red wavelengths
that I had in a previous order so what's
happening here is that I have another
lap of my orders so if we're looking at
the graph of the other at the top so I
have my first order and then my second
order but we can see that the third
order overlapped the second order as
well as before and things are getting
worse and worse and worse and worse so
you would say it well what's the point
of looking at the second or third order
if I know that I will have an overlap
well the first thing is if you can have
or if you can extract information in the
first order can be just better to do the
same with the second and fourth order
because you would have three
measurements and at least you will have
three mirjam measurements on the
positive side for the most part is
positive orders if you do if you
multiply this by the number of
measurements you can have negative
orders you just have more measurements
but the second things too that you can
see here is that the width of or the
length of the second order is bigger
than the first and the fifth is a lot
bigger than the fourth of the third so
in other words my spectrum in the higher
orders is a lot longer and I can extract
a lot more information because I I can
see a lot more details in this spectrum
oh the small problem we have on top of
that too is that unfortunately the
intensity of light goes down well then
the order number is is increasing so
this is just for instance an example of
what you could see using it transmission
gradings and in a telescope so in in the
focal plane you would see the order 0
which is straight light coming from from
the star so it's not defected so it it's
the image of the star but then I to give
an angle or a given distance once you're
using a I mean a lens an optical system
to to focus the image you can see the
order one and while you can barely see
the order to but actually it's it's
better on my screen and so on and so
forth and in this case for instance you
can see the big advantage of blazing
because there's you can see that the
intensity of the order one is higher
than the auto- one so it's by tuning the
shape of the grooves well if we can put
more intensity in one order versus
another yes I'm sorry was it your
questions okay so yeah this is this is
an example of a spectroscope that I I
made a couple of years ago so for its
for telescope so you're putting this in
the back of the telescope your I was
using a call
which is just a zoom to make sure that
the beam of light which is going to
reach yeah so so yeah maybe I should so
the light is is entering here is going
through the collimator and is diffracted
with this reflective gradings and then
the light is converging I mean using the
optics to to the ccd sensor which was in
this case the modified webcam cool
pulled it down to decrease the noise so
yeah the very important thing is first
of all to use assist to the collimator
to be sure that the incident beam is
perfectly parallel on to to the to the
reflective gradings and the second thing
is that you really need to have a very
very stable rotating system just just to
be sure that your reflective gradings
when you will turn it to look at the
different orders so first order first
and then second or order will remain
perfectly parallel so yeah I mean the
procedure to to to extract once you get
so this for instant in this case so you
see a because we're using it because
it's a star so we have this line in
inside or or matrix and we need to
correct it and align it binding it and
then import it into a software in order
to normalize the spectrum in intensity
but also because the angular dispersion
is not linear we need to adjust a little
bit the spectrum and to extract the
restaurants of the instrument and this
is for instance what you can get by
stitching
different different spectrums of the
same stars same star obviously but you
can see that using us I think it with
1200 groups / millimeters in the system
here that you've seen I've been able to
I think the resolution was something at
three angstroms so you're able to tell
that well I don't have a zoom but I was
barely able to tell that there was to
peak of the sodium I mean these two
peaks in the sodium are very very very
common on sodium has two so two peaks at
90 and 96 so so six tension of
differences between these two peaks so
it's pretty cool to be able to tell the
composition of the outer layers of a
star just using this simple simple
device as well as to be able to tell
that there is no 02 in this store which
is pretty normal because this is the 02
from from the atmosphere and there's
there's also another one so the first
thing I would like to highlight is that
diffraction is just it's just coming
from the wave approach of light so
that's the reason why it's also working
for sound a perfect point will be
unfortunately always diffracted because
we have an aperture because in all the
devices that we're using well there is a
finite aperture in all the optical
component that we're using that so the
diffracted pattern is cold air disk is a
lot more specific to circular apertures
but it's most maybe ninety five percent
if not nine ninety nine percent of
optical system are circular but it's the
shape of or the the intensity profile is
oh it looks all
is kind of main peak in the middle and
then small a small of a wave that the at
the bottom and so it's not only true but
it's very very true for telescope for
instance that diffraction will usually
size the aperture of your system if you
want a given resolution you will need a
certain aperture and this is coming
directly from from from diffraction well
and diffraction can also size to certain
extend the special resolution of your
system I mean you don't want to be under
or over sample so you may you may use a
given sensor just to fit the area disk
of your of your optical system so that's
about all the bad news about diffraction
because diffraction is annoying the
fraction yeah I mean it forced us to
have eight meters telescopes to be able
to tell that well in this nebula there
was not two stores but there were ten of
them 100 of them so it's big and swings
more expensive but on the other hand
diffraction is pretty cool as we've seen
for gratings and it's very very useful
and I would say that the beauty of this
is that so it's tiny grooves yes indeed
we r 1000 lines per millimeters but
what's very amazing is by using this
we're able to extract on information
which is the in the order of penang
stream so it's a factor of 1000 which is
gained in terms of size and set of
scales so that's yeah diffraction is bad
the diffraction is sometimes some some
pretty good okay
in the time series analysis we run into
a similar thing we call a windowing that
and we reduce the side lobes which is
pronounced here
center-weighted
fine window to the state
which center
that produces the assignment
optics
I I honestly don't know I'm sorry
advertising of labs can be considering
whether in the spectrum exactly what do
you mean by appetizing aquatherm attic
yep
in the concert beyond what we want to do
is roll off Patrick still fundamentally
different
solving special
but a lantern safe trip yes you survived
perfectly sharp
but i don't think that see
what's not in purple if you can
I have to do it
place forming the apertures you know six
or eight or some variable number roughly
hexagonal is the multi-mode function
mountains and queen the perfect
spherical and square case or traditional
lenses I'm not sure instead of what you
showed the diffraction pattern we asked
the side load behavior for a round
aperture foursquare yes for for hex or
octagonal aperture on it be roughly
founded between those spherical yes yes
yes with with a lot more direction with
edge x in six directions yes yes well
you think yeah but Matt the math can be
can be done
yeah the annoying thing is that okay
regardless of regardless of the
secondary Peaks that which does not
contain that much of energy the main
issue is that well this first peak has a
certain width and this is what is
limiting my the resolution assuming that
I will find the appropriate sensor with
a system with us very very small pixels
which is something I might not be able
to find or if I can find this very very
small I mean sensor with very very small
pixels I won't get enough photons little
bit easier for traditional photography
once that happen sure where we really
need to start worrying about diffraction
effects compared to lens traditional
land few metric optic admiration
arms relatively small yeah i mean i
didn't do i didn't do the map but i
found i found on the web in very very
obvious example where yes indeed as
you're saying in most cases cases right
now in most SLR cameras the era disco is
a lot more smaller than the pixels so
the pixel are usually a lot bigger so
far but if your start to use 500
millimeters lands you may run into into
this type of problems i would say that
if the current optics in digital cameras
are that big or have this diameter it's
not because of diffraction is just
because if you have regular lenses
you'll get more light and therefore
you'll reduce your exposure time
you
