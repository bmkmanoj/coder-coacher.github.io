and and this project is more about
people than trees but trees are really a
centerpiece to it and these trees have
been there they're in the in the
mahogany family of hardwoods they're all
over Africa and they're called different
names in different places but the Mvula
tree in particular has been a cultural
icon for a lot of folks there in eastern
Africa so it has a lot of deep
significance for bringing that back into
those communities so then as the Year
the year kind of comes comes into
fruition and they've got they've got
funding for project that they've
identified and they've been a part of
something that isn't isn't just even a
handout but it provides a dignity and
investment in their local community in a
way that can make an impact so there's a
lot of opportunities to take that
platform and do other things with it as
well but um well we'll go ahead and
share right now this is a couple yeah
I'd love to hear I don't you wanna say
anything now um I mean I programmed the
site and I think the coolest thing for
me so far and I mean we only met about
two months ago I'm just kind of like
they told me the idea and we're like hey
this is what we're thinking about doing
you know how can you help it's not as
much even what we've done so far but
like what I think can be done moving
forward and you know coming into a
project where I really didn't know a
whole lot about it but I knew I knew
quite a bit about Uganda through
Invisible Children which I guess there's
some going on here later today before
that which is another group that is
involved in Uganda and I looked at this
is an opportunity where I could get
involved with something and actually
like you know see the kind of like
benefits of my labor
pay off you know pretty pretty quickly
and so you know looking at something
like this you know there's a lot of like
technology that I use on a daily basis
that I wouldn't think would apply to a
project like this but the more and more
we get into it there's there's a lot of
things that could be done to to kind of
bridge the gap between you know third
world country but a country like Uganda
that I've never been to or even been in
that region in the world but you know
you can affect lives over there that's
the coolest thing for me so far but yeah
you watch the videos will show a video
to back with a little background music
it explains the story of the Mvula
project and then we can dive into the
site a little bit more and
and I think this groups I mean everyone
here is probably a technical group right
and I don't know how much you want to
see in terms of what what we can do with
Google Maps or what what we can begin to
do but that's probably more something
you know you guys are know a lot more
about then than I do that's for sure
we play the whole things from last year
the there's a cube Oh group is a
non-profit 501c3 that does a lot of
think tank start-up ideas and this was
one that kind of germinated last year
and a few people actually bought trees
there wasn't a full website but it was
it was more of a PayPal sponsored tree
and make it work and a couple hundred
trees were sold in about two hundred
that had been been now planted in the
ground this summer they've only had four
died which is amazing we weren't quite
sure how all that would turn out and so
then that was part of the impetus to to
say we've we've got you know kind of a
new website and facilitating an easier
process for folks to sign up sponsor a
tree track the tree and and so the
videos that you see are actually people
that are involved in the project locally
in Uganda
one guys drove six hours from the
Department of Forestry to come and and
sit in for a video interview and and is
excited about the project
if not you can always watch these at
your leisure
I'm happy to be here today and tell you
about the memorial project it is a
project that will go a long way to
change the thinking of the people of
Uganda and the kibo group thought wisely
to come and teach us how important trees
are misleading electric one tree planted
in Uganda two trees planted in elements
have got a positive effect on all the
population of the world
it was in great abundance in the past
wasn't respected there was a lot of
anarchy in terms of exploitation of
resources and the moola tree also fell a
victim
and so the bulla project one is intended
to put back the treasure that's dying
out but then also use that as an avenue
to do something more for the village
I'm excited also to hear bottom of the
project and I'm waiting I am ready to
planted those trees and we are happy to
do that
even if you'll never be there but you're
helping so that says a medium Ito nature
vida
that means that the young trees are the
forests and when you look at a tree
it grows excess like a child so this
this is a long term relationship that
the children of Aranda are now
establishing with their brothers and
sisters in the United States it makes a
lot of difference it makes sense it's
something that is appreciated and I
think more projects he's going to help
our hearts revive I think I see it
coming out as a success as a big success
story and we shall grow grow like a
memory and we shall be big in future
it's great it's a good good overview of
the project the the second one down
below which we don't we don't need to
play that right now necessarily and but
it'll describe before to watch at your
own desk or whatnot how the project
works which I described the mechanics of
sponsoring a tree planting a tree and
how that would function so that you know
no one argue that planting the trees is
a great cause
supporting these local communities great
cause and and really just the ability to
bring some things like you know GPS
Google Maps to allow it to be connected
to folks in in more resource available
areas that feel like hey I could sponsor
tree rather than dying buying a dead
Christmas tree how to buy a tree in
Uganda and and make an impact in
someone's life so that's that's the
really the the primary message of what
what the projects about and then I know
we want to share a little bit too about
what what what are some of the ideas
going forward what are some of the
opportunities that but what do they be
to get involved or get connected or see
where things could take off - oh yeah
let's do that
you grab the mic yeah drive through it
walk through real quick and I guess this
would be kind of the interest that the
Google part of it which I'm sure it's
something you guys have all seen before
but basically you you come in you know
as a regular user to the site and you
would go sign up to buy a tree and just
because this is kind of
general stuff I would go in and buy a
tree I'd get the idea of a tree you can
go in here and register the tree when
you buy it true there's a drop-down of
projects that you can write you can
associate your tree to yeah so you can
see you know you can pick which child's
to which organization you want to
support and you can pre you can learn
about these projects before you can
follow them without having to buy a tree
you can follow the trees without having
to buy a tree so once you get inside and
you've added a tree you can go and kind
of follow that tree and there's people
on the ground that are you know checking
these trees all the time and you know
one of the things kind of the next step
for me is to build a you know kind of a
an interface for them to be able to
update the trees from Uganda so that you
know people are getting live updates on
the on a pretty frequent basis as
opposed to just getting a satellite
image which isn't going to be as
prevalent and then you can view you know
things about the project you can click
on each project and view you know kind
of same same stuff see what other trees
are involved with that project see how
many you know trees potentially that
projects trying to trying to achieve for
that year to to meet their you know
their fundraising numbers kind of thing
but the cool part
you know I guess for the Google side of
it is that basically we've mapped with
the GPS coordinates each each location
of the of the schools of the trees and
it was kind of like astonishing for me
especially since when we started this
the satellite image was pretty far out
that on specific cities and locations
we're actually able to get down and see
the actual schools and trees so it's
kind of hard to see right there but you
know I've never been to Uganda and I've
never you know experienced any of like
what Roy has but it was kind of cool
when I was working through this to to
get a familiarity with the layout of the
cities and and the country just by you
know clicking through the maps and
things like that with the
the cheese we were finding and then the
same goes for the trees if I click on
the tree and the trees already been you
know the trees been planted or the trees
been tracked then we can do the same
thing and get down to a pretty close
level it's like one tick from what a
Roma would be and actually see the tree
so over the course of you know however
long the tree is going to be alive
people can follow this and at least in
some respect you know depending on how
often that stuff's updated and you guys
would know a lot better than I would you
know you can kind of follow the growth
of it and then at the same time you know
the people that are using the side are
updating the images and the information
on the tree as they're getting planted
so more or less that's the basics of it
will be more detail about the projects
that you could be attached to the
project at that preschool and have a
little bit of correspondence and updates
in terms of what they've accomplished
and the tree stuff would would flow as
well questions about the functionality
click through that makes sense
yeah it's actually low it was actually
lower when we started working and
talking about this project the question
is did we know that the resolution was
going to be high in the areas that we
were looking at and the answer that is
actually when we started looking at this
project about two and a half months ago
we were in my office and you couldn't
get that close even just one out yeah so
when they first kind of told it to me I
mean I thought it was a cool idea when I
first heard it it was like wow that's
that's kind of you know creative and
then I started thinking well the
satellite image is not gonna be very
good at all and you know we kind of
thought well at least if we have the
coordinates when they do get better you
know will kind of be what we be it will
have the functionality in place already
and then you know literally we kind of
started working through it and people
started clicking around all the cities
that they were familiar with and we're
like wow there's you know there's
buildings that they'd you know been to
and that kind of stuff so it's pretty
it's pretty cool to see it kind of
update so if you know anybody that can
upload the latest images like from the
last pass that would be great yeah you
yeah
yeah it's definitely very specific
because for example in one of the main
cities Jinja there's like really really
really good coverage but then as you get
further east there's there's nothing so
it's spotty but it's good enough that
most of the places that I think we're
gonna be involved in are gonna have at
least some level of detail you said
about a hundred mile radius right about
a 25 24 25 square miles from Jinja but
then you have you know Kampala and then
basically that whole road that goes up
into Century Uganda is completely mapped
as well as the one you can kind of see
that I don't I don't have that's
downtown or well the other the other
kind of one of the future things that we
had talked about is MMS is big in kind
of Africa in Uganda is being able to set
up an API where someone could actually
take when the guys out on motorcycle
with his clipboard check and the birth
you know the trees making sure they're
okay or whatever they could actually
snap a photo and be able to send it in
to the site and the site would know what
to do with it and actually post it to
the appropriate because every tree is
given an ID the day it's planted so yep
and in terms of other organizations and
how this could grow to right now the the
relationships on the ground in southern
Uganda are are very well developed and
usually that local readiness is the
hardest thing to do in a project like
this so the fact that that was already
there and and what's so amazing and
really kind of captured my heart is that
they're they're in very needy
communities they're in very rural
communities not so much in the cities
where a lot of the NGOs that
non-government organizations are located
but in in local villages and that's
that's the folks that will impact from
this most directly and that's where the
relationships are so it's about 50/50
kind of local villages that that have
projects that are identified that would
support about 5,000 trees right now and
then the idea of expansion to any other
organizations as well so and that's and
that's out there but if we if this
platform became a multi organizational
platform where folks could say hey we'll
do a Christmas tree campaign this year
and and it's a it's an environmental
group or its Armstrong's nursery it
could be can really be any anyone that
feels like this is a worthy cause and
then how
the the backend fulfillment taking care
of in what's built on the site but yet
it would be somewhat of a co-branded
experience where they could they could
you know integrate that with their own
site begin the process and then hand it
off for all the tracking and fulfillment
on this end and then the scalability
factor would go up significantly and and
another organization we mentioned
Invisible Children there's um they work
in northern Uganda where about ninety
ninety percent of the populations in
these what they call internal
displacement camps control the where
they're there they have a peace
agreement they're getting ready to move
out back to their villages and what a
great way to help offset that first
years financial burden and help them
reform of their own local communities
and and kind of fun part of that return
back to really an agricultural society
that would take a while to kind of ramp
up the the the economy that they're used
to so it might might be able to become a
platform that other organizations could
use and and become a little bit broader
as well so I just wanted it yeah and I
mean we talked we were talking even on
the plane topo ideas of kind of school
for a school so a school here in the
states could kind of get on board and
commit to sell a certain number of trees
so that they could help build a school
in Uganda and so we would provide a way
for them to kind of put this information
on their site whether it's the
beginnings part of the signup process or
the beginning part of purchasing trees
so they would actually be purchasing
trees through this local schools website
but then as as the process gets further
in the purchasing process it would hand
it off to mabui but the idea that they
could commit to you know raise you know
sell hundred trees through their school
so that they could build a school in
uganda money-raising with the side
effects putting these trees on
and go yeah absolutely question is uh in
goal what's the purpose in terms of
agricultural is it economic development
and I'd say it hits a lot of those
things that's what's interesting is it
intersects a lot of interests obviously
the the local interest of the people
that it directly affects in the projects
associative is a huge thing but the tree
itself and reforesting that that
particular type of tree hasn't hasn't
been a concerted effort it's definitely
not a crock tree it's no no financial
benefit and having these trees which is
part of what makes it work people aren't
going to be incentive to cut them down
and sell it right away it's it's a
hardwood tree that that takes a long
time to mature but but does grow quickly
and if you've seen them in person
they're just these towering they're
magnificent trees and so the UM
essentially even like the king of the
boo saga tribe and southern Uganda came
and met with folks at malooley project
and said and we are excited about this
project because of the cultural heritage
of the tree so the fact that it
intersects kind of a cultural heritage
and reforesting the trees that that
during the kind of colonization years a
lot of those trees have been cut down so
that's a huge huge impact is being able
to bring these trees back in significant
numbers it could make making the
interesting effect as well and just to
kind of add to that um there is a
gestation period for the tree once a
planet but it does need to be taken care
of and so that's kind of how the idea
came about that they would a person here
could buy a tree for forty five dollars
and that money would go to the villagers
and the children to take care of that
tree during that period at which the
tree could kind of live on its own and
so then that money could be earmarked
for a certain project like the village
might say that we need a well drill or
we need a school or whatever and so
Mvula would come in and kind of help
them plant the trees but then as they
take care of the trees for the first
year is it a year as they take care of
the trees for a first year that's the
year that they get paid for kind of
taking care of the trees and the other
thing that I love about it is the
sustainability of going over there and
really kind of giving them an
opportunity to kind of make their own
way and and and earn the money to kind
of build the school and stuff I think
there's a lot of like local pride in
that and being able to say yeah we we
were able to take care of these trees
and that's the result of this is that we
really
to build a school or drill as well I
don't know if that answers your question
the money is not absolutely Perico much
that going to the tree the money is
going into the communities it's both as
well yeah it's both because there is a
cost of obviously planting the trees and
that kind of thing but the idea is that
the money goes to a specific kind of
project and we look at the trees
individually when we sell them but
definitely as a project of you know this
group of trees is going to raise money
for this specific project yeah is one
grand organization there is one grand
organization for each each project right
now there's one grand organization
that's under the umbrella of kibo group
which is the nonprofit that the Lully
project sits under and the folks there
on the ground are the ones with the
relationships right now with about 50
different villages and local communities
in southern Uganda so that's that's the
on-the-ground readiness that's there so
those relationships are ready to go and
and people in that region know what
they've done some other things in like
Jinja the town they've got a local
coffee shop and they bring in people to
help with agricultural planning and crop
rotation and irrigation and so that they
have a presence there that's it's been
for 12 years so that's a real ripe
organization down the road it could
easily be expanded to other
organizations that also have local
presence and local relationships and
this could really become a platform that
we just extend the technology and the
and the backend services to allow any
one of local relationships that fits the
criteria of you know it really in Africa
there's a lot that would that would fit
that
is a big grant organization that's
absolutely what we did was a couple
months of work and and we volunteered
our time and the question was is the
ground organization their efforts are
significantly more valuable that's the
part that you can't easily reproduce the
thing that's interesting though there's
a lot of ground organizations out there
right now we're disconnected to one of
them that we know intimately and and are
using to get the first 5,000 trees done
but but this could be a platform for
other ground organizations as well so
you're absolutely right
one of the things that I remember too is
because I like I said I just kind of
jumped into this couple months ago is
when we were kind of going over this
with the people that have been involved
in a while it was they're excited
because it was kind of like they had a
tool to help them do their jobs better
on the ground and fulfill these trees
and and and kind of you know I don't
unless I get the word out but but take
take what they were doing to like the
next level and that's that's basically
what I think we did more than anything
was was gave gave the people on the
ground the tool to do what they need to
do out there and again that's why I was
saying it like that's why I kind of I
got involved is because I can do you
know a little bit of work and you know
then somebody that that does this for a
full-time job out in Uganda can take it
and run with it and and actually make it
beneficial and expand on that a little
bit we are kind of Phase two of the site
is really to work with the people on the
ground to help them with their processes
of how they manage the trees how they
manage even the money side of things of
making sure money gets to the right
projects and managing the projects in
inventory and you know when do we need
to go out and check this group of trees
and stuff the second part of the site is
really kind of a staff back-end that
will manage all that because we already
have the data we're already putting each
tree as an ID each project has an ID
it's already in there so now how do we
expand that into kind of a staff
dashboard that they can access from
Uganda and see okay we need to go out
and check on this group of trees or we
need to make a payment to this village
because they're they fulfilled their
year and so that's kind of kind of phase
two phase three is really kind of all
the wacky ideas that we have for
expanding it but phase two is really the
staff part of it
yeah absolutely so there's a team of
folks on the ground in Uganda they're
both some some folks in the US but a lot
of local leadership that has been in
place here for a decade and and they're
organized where they would employ a few
people that are on bicycles and maybe
some motorcycles too to do the kind of
monthly or quarterly inventory the trees
when they're initially planted they they
actually spend a lot of time working
with that the local community to
identify projects make sure people
understand what this is about there's
actually a process by which they
identify the local the places where the
trees will be planted and make sure it's
an approved kind of ground it's it's a
school it's government property it's
private property there's there's a
actual kind of document they explain to
prepare for that planning process so the
community understands the message now
that and now that a couple projects have
been planted and there's bank accounts
open with money that there's a lot of
people to go okay now I get it and so
that's that's a little bit of the prep
and then the planning event actually
happens we give them all the same
planning date even though it's scattered
over you know multiple weeks and then
and they're grown in a nursery they're
in local Uganda that that is being built
out and the folks at Department of
Forestry have helped with that they've
and and so there's their planet of
saplings and they're they're staked with
a with an identification number and
they're also a GPS coordinate and a
couple of those I think you know wander
off and turn into toys for some kids or
something that the stakes but but either
way there you can identify where the
tree is with the location
any other questions
why
so why trees yeah that's a good question
you know the white trees um
these trees are very significant there
we don't quite get it here because we
plant trees from nurseries and yeah
doesn't mean as much these trees are
very culturally significant so you kind
of go there you get that part and and
trees from from a u.s. perspective to I
mean it's a it has a lot of
marketability to it it's simple I get
the message
I can be connected to a tree I'm
sponsoring a tree but obviously it's
it's goes way beyond trees and it's that
was one thing I really liked about it is
it like it's kind of like why trees it's
like why not it's simple I mean it's not
overly expensive and like who doesn't
want to plant a tree if they can if they
can help and if you can plant a tree and
help you know the visual agriculture of
Uganda but at the same time and probably
at a much bigger scale help the
communities and help the schools and and
all the people it's like it's a simple
idea that that um you know the trees
kind of like ends to mean I guess but
but it also has the benefit of your
planning a tree as if you were planning
it and you know San Jose well and I
think I think the prot the project was
dreamed up quite a you know quite a few
years ago it just kind of happens to be
a coincidence that it's around the same
time when everybody's talking about
going green and you know green is a huge
huge thing right now the guy that's not
here mark could probably expand on that
a little bit cuz I think it was his kind
of initial idea his brainchild but it is
kind of just a coincidence that it came
around the same time I think this idea
to kind of touch on what we talked about
earlier I think this idea has been kind
of kicked around quite a bit and they
have kind of the infrastructure to do it
on the ground but they've just never
really had kind of the way to get it
back here and really make it a reality
and that's what's been fun for us is I
mean I look at you know designing the
site I mean it was a couple days of my
time and now I get to impact you know
Uganda which is pretty amazing and I I
mean Dominic probably is the most time
invested with the programming but again
relatively a couple months of time to be
able to make such a huge impact it's fun
to really be able to do what we do best
so that these people now can kind of
make it happen on the ground if you
could plant a tree and watch a child
grow
it's kind of the idea you get both
that's part of the pre-planning planning
checklist so there's each trees there's
either signup form if it's private
property and public property has been
established as what what the parameters
are to plant trees there so a lot of
locations that make a ton of sense are
around schools public areas parks you
know beltway's and corridors for for
traffic around those things and and
interestingly these trees don't do well
when they're planted in tight clusters
so at a hard time figuring out how to
bring them back in in large numbers and
dense areas so really an effort that is
spread out throughout you know more
rural areas makes a lot of sense they're
scattered and they'll be scattered in
like areas like I mentioned or even
along private property oftentimes what
happens is they'll go every other one
along a property line so if you know 50
years from now these huge trees are
there and one property owner says you
know I'm gonna I'm gonna cut a few these
down because I need charcoal or I need
then then some of them are on his lot
and and that may happen but but that's
kind of part of part of the ristic that
happens they do they do and they also
buy and say the purpose of the project
and the thing about about African
culture that's different not not that
the whole continents this way but
specifically that the spot in Uganda is
the the community aspect of things and
it's not about as much individual rights
as it is the community and the purpose
and and so when the community
understands the value of this project
and how it's going to impact the
community you'd have a harder time
cutting down that tree for an individual
gain and and get away with it so that
it's self policing from that standpoint
this example like you say this project
was ongoing already right there was
already an ongoing if the tree thing
doing last couple months if the tree
things didn't last oh I see well they
did we did so chivos been around for a
while this ideas been kind of
germinating for a while without a real
presence online or the mechanics thought
through of how to how to get people to
sponsor trees and have the fulfillment a
little more automated they did they put
up kind of a PDF style website with the
paypal address and you can sponsor tree
and it was really you know people's
friends and family that were close to
the project and about 200 trees got got
sponsored which gave them the ability to
plant a couple hundred trees and so now
this last few months has been preparing
for doing something on a larger scale
and it'll probably launch on Monday so
we're you know we're you're hearing your
hearing at first you can absolutely
please write notes on a port number too
so it'll be module a module a project
org and the other thing that stink too
is so if you're buying Christmas gifts
and what do you give someone who has
everything you know what it's kind of
the the American Christmas giving you
know debacle here what do you do
so you sponsor Mabul a tree and and you
gift it to them they get to name it it's
kind of cool they get to track it maybe
there's a Facebook widget someone writes
that you know updates the the other
thing that's neat is you actually get
something in the mail that's a slick
little two-dvd mailer it's got it's got
a little bit on the DVD you can show
someone and it has a shrinky dink
ornament that you can you can put on
your fridge your Christmas tree and it
ties into the the number of acres that
are lost per year per month per day and
and how the Foresters shrinking and what
you're doing to make an impact to
reverse that so it's it's you actually
get something so if you if you want it
as a gift or you want it you know you
don't just get a google coordinate on a
map and get something physical
oh really
we'll do it again for you so stickman
okay she raised her hand in the back and
read she knows something my idea is uh
is is we like if if and when we get the
chance to travel out there I'll take a
camera strapped it to it like a helmet
hop on a moped and we can get I guess
Street View yes street view perfect so
that's kind of like you know that's
phase four has nothing on a motorcycle a
few African that's good question
um yeah actually I don't know why I
never I never pulled up Google Earth to
look at this stuff up either I was just
working with the map stuff and that's
kind of where I focused on and there's a
lot to be desired with a lot of this
stuff but it was kind of the first pass
and it is great and it personally for me
and I think for the three of us we love
to be involved in something when it's
when it's early when the need is the
greatest because it's not yet organized
enough to even represent what its needs
are and it also has a lot of opportunity
for creative people to be involved so if
you you know if you wake up in the
middle of the night and say hey I got an
idea I mean that's that's absolutely
open game or if you know of anyone that
you think we should be connected to or
an organization that that you think
should hear about this feel free there's
lots of room
excellent
this organization beyond right now the
the local readiness is in southern
Uganda and that's that's what we're
ready to deliver five thousand trees
through and then there's other
organizations that were affiliated with
that if we have the readiness on our end
we could extend this this to them as as
a tool for them as well I think that's
also a long-term goal is that this this
does kind of expand into other areas of
Uganda and other areas of Africa as well
should we wrap up the the video segment
and then we can talk about things in
detail great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
