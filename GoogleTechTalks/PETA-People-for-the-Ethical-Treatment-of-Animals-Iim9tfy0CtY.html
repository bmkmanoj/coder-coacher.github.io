organization in the world more than 2
million members and supporters Ingrid
Newkirk has spoken internationally on
animal rights issues from the steps of
the Canadian Parliament to the streets
of New Delhi India where she spent her
childhood she founded PETA over 30 years
ago and is responsible for the biggest
animal victories in the history
including she stopped the Department of
Defense from using dogs and their wound
labs
she stopped General Motors from using
live animals in the car back in the car
crash test
she helped past the first anti-cruelty
law in taiwan she's responsible for
moving over a thousand companies from
testing on animals to cruelty-free
methods
she's the author of over a dozen books
on ethics and animals and the subject of
two documentaries on her life and PETA
one the BBC and one on HBO called I am
an animal and with this I'll turn it
over to Ingrid Newkirk thank you
thank you all very much for coming and
for listening wherever you are out there
very nice I'm delighted to be at Google
it is certainly a world and we'll be
lucky if we retain any staff who have
seen your campus
I'm as baby said I am president of PETA
which means that I'm an animal rights
activist and for those of you who are
confused as to what that means I'm going
to give you George Carlin's definition
George Carlin said animal rights
activists are the kind of people who if
they find cockroaches in their home they
develop a spray it doesn't kill the
cockroaches it just fills them with
enough self-doubt that they have to go
somewhere and think things over and I
actually love that example because in a
way animal rights is being about about
being kinder to even the least familiar
perhaps the animals that you call ugly
or haven't thought much about or all of
them before we get to animal
overpopulation the dog and cat crisis
and why we do what we do I thought that
I should give a little primer on our
philosophy because sometimes people get
confused by it and it's really easy it's
basically if you don't want something
done to you then please don't do it to
somebody else who has feelings like
yours and that means it's the Golden
Rule really that's all it is just
extended as I think it should be to
every other living being and you don't
have to love animals to get that one of
my favorite examples is when Princess
Anne in England was made a sponsor of
the Royal Society for the protection of
children somebody said to her well this
isn't really up your alley is it and she
said well I'm happy to do it because you
don't have to love children or
like children to know that they
shouldn't be treated badly and I think
that's what animal rights is all about
what we do I think without giving it
much consideration is we treat human
beings as if they were gods and we treat
all the other beings on the face of the
planet as if they're trash and when you
think about that there doesn't make any
sense because we are certainly all in
this together if you took biology 101 if
you weren't flirting or looking out of
the window you know that we are all
animals it doesn't really matter what
sort of package we come in all of us
feel pain we all grieve we all feel love
and joy we all want comfort and we're
all afraid of dying badly don't know if
you can really see this the detail on it
is so beautiful in real life the proud
father and the proud mother looking at
the baby gorilla who is thumping his
chest some animals are smarter than
others just as some human beings are and
some are actually smarter than we are
for example chimpanzees beat out college
students in tests where images appear on
a screen and you have to remember them
all and then punch in watch you remember
when the screen goes blank and then in
2008 there was a stunning a feat the
British card champion for remembering
the order of an entire pack of cards
within 30 seconds which is really
something was beaten by a chimpanzee and
now they both barred from Las Vegas
but it's not just the animals that we
think of as being smart like chimpanzees
who are smart it's not just the dolphins
I think many of us have seen the videos
of dolphins will actually attach sponges
to their noses when they go down onto
the rocky ocean floor to protect
themselves
you see these thought processes but it's
not just those animals it's not just
dogs like the one I don't know if you
saw dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson was on one
of the shows recently with a dog who has
memorized he's been taught he could
probably do more he's been taught the
names of twelve or thirteen or fourteen
hundred toys so Neil deGrasse Tyson had
the dog come into the room the toys are
in the adjoining room and he would say
frog and the dog would look at him and
then go next door and out of this
mountainous pile bring him back the frog
and then Neil deGrasse Tyson would say
octopus and off he'd go and he'd bring
the octopus back so he had this enormous
human vocabulary so what Neil deGrasse
Tyson did was tried to stump him by
putting a toy in the enormous pile that
the dog had never seen before
and then when the dog looked at him
deGrasse Tyson said whatever it was
rutabaga and the dog cocked his head
obviously had never heard that word
before went in the room came back looked
at him again deGrasse Tyson said
rutabaga dog went next door and brought
back the only toy that he didn't know
the name of and I always think they
probably know much more than this it's
just that we don't bother to figure it
out they have to figure it out Chris
Evans is the University professor and he
specializes in the study of ethology
which is animal behavior he makes a very
strong case for the intelligence of
chickens said chickens exist in stable
social groups they can recognize each
other by their faces which sheep can and
many other animals can we just don't
think about it they have at least twenty
four distinct cries that we humans have
recognized including cries that tell a
chicken if a threat is coming from the
sky or it's coming from the ground these
different alarm calls and they're very
good at solving problems and overcoming
obstacles so professor Evans says he
goes to conferences and he talks about
these attributes these abilities and
people he says always think that he's
talking about money
he's Anton and he says no inconvenient
as this may be I'm talking about what
you may have had for lunch these arms so
judging individuals any individuals by
their intelligence is a sticky piece of
business because as we all know there
are different sorts of intelligence you
talk about someone who's perhaps
uneducated but they're street smart and
in a certain environment they can
certainly do better than someone who is
a PhD and something like metallurgy or
astrophysics Jane Goodall is the world's
foremost authority on primates and she
once overheard some people who were
laughing at the chimpanzee Michael
Jackson used to have bubbles
you may remember bubbles this was at a
party and bubbles was there they had
dressed him in a tuxedo
they had plunked him at a table he had a
mug plate and a knife and fork he could
drink from the mug but he was struggling
with the knife and fork with those hands
and they were laughing at him and they
were there not meanly just saying well
he's almost human you know he's subhuman
he's struggling here but he
not up to par with us and good ol said
to them hang on a minute you know she
said if you and a chimpanzee or a bird
or a squirrel were placed in a jungle
somewhere in their environment and you
didn't have a GPS of a computer you
didn't have anyone to ask no street
signs you didn't have any clothes it
wasn't a supermarket all the things that
are the jungle who do you think would be
the superior being not only who would
survive but who would run circles around
you each to their element it's not just
intelligence there are other differences
that have been used through the ages to
justify prejudices because that's all
they are and I think we have to do our
best to get away from all prejudices our
society has done terrible things in the
past we all know we've institutionalized
people with disabilities the quest even
Hawking would be if you had been born
100 years earlier we have enslaved
others simply because of the color of
their skin or because we had the power
to that's the key element
we've given pox infected blankets to
Native Americans and much more the
circus
used to actually tour with pygmies and
Eskimos that people could go cat and
laugh at the highly civilized people
were the Gorkhas and the laughes we have
a project for the Animal Liberation
project which tours the National Mall
and university campuses that points up
some of the similarities between what we
have done and in some cases still do to
humans that we shouldn't and things that
we still do to the other species the
main point is of course that the package
an individual comes in should be
absolutely irrelevant if you burn a
pigeon with a cigarette
but they hurt just as if you whip a
child or a horse they both hurt they
feel it so no matter the color they race
the religion the gender the shape the
species they're all individuals and that
I believe is the heart of what we have
to remember in our treatment of others
so while the animal rights movement is
about animals it's really about us it's
about human beings and how we conduct
ourselves and if we can overcome the
things that we have been taught that
aren't fair the dalai lama who i quote
in my one can make a difference book
gave a talk once i loved this story he
was outdoors and he has a wonderful
sense of humor it was evening and the
moon appeared and the Dalai Lama said do
you see the moon up there and everybody
looked and said yes and he said isn't it
beautiful
and of course everybody said yes and he
said yes but you don't live on the moon
you live here and our job is to make it
beautiful here and I thought that's a
little bit like our job it's very easy
for us to condemn another nation for
bludgeoning seals or for hunting whales
or for eating dogs for example but
what's different and difficult for us is
to look at our own plates our own habits
the things we do and decide I want to
make it beautiful here not just in some
faraway area so kindness is a virtue
that must be a virtue in principle and
in practice take what we do to animals
and laboratories
once upon a time and it hasn't been very
long ago we used orphaned children we
use blacks in the South and civil
experiments we used Irish immigrant
women in sexual experiments for
surgeries we used anybody who is human
we could get our mitts on and today we
can get our mitts on the other species
the animals by the way I am delighted
google has a new science project and no
invasive experiments on animals are
allowed and I am just so thankful we
have whole human DNA on the internet we
have vital human clinical and
epidemiological studies that are crying
out for funding while we're busy giving
cocaine to monkeys in labs there is a
six-month to a year waiting list if you
are a human addict and you need to get
into a treatment program but you don't
have the money and it isn't just the
experiments themselves which are need to
be examined so thoroughly it's the fact
that studies have shown that the fear of
the animals in the lab is a factor that
deserves attention animals adrenaline
their pulse rates their heartbeats
go through the roof just when the knob
on the door turns or they hear footsteps
walking down the passage because they
know nothing benign is going to happen
to them somebody is there to take a
biopsy or a blood sample or I'm going to
show you a very short video here of
what's done to animals in one of the
indy largest testing laboratory in the
world it's called cove ants and we were
there undercover to shoot this video
there is no sound but you can imagine
the sound and better quality video is on
our website peta.org if you can't see
this very well you could just see they
are tattooed the heartbeat of that
monkey and imagine being stuffed into a
plastic
or strapped into a metal chair the panic
and the fear is phenomenal the workers
in this lab also screamed at the monkeys
slammed them into the metal cage bars
and more when Co vents found that we had
that video they went very swiftly into
court in the United States and in the UK
to get us to be barred from showing it
but as you can see luckily we won I have
shown that at scientific conferences all
over the world people have the right to
know I think it's that simple and yet
fortresses are being made out of
laboratories and farms now there is even
legislation pending in Iowa to make it a
crime to film in a farm without
permission so I think these extra
protections are not what our society a
free and open society should need people
can choose you can buy shaving cream
floor cleaner
anything you want that is not tested on
animals that's tested in humane ways so
we have a compartmentalized view of
animals some we love dearly and we would
defend as we would defend our child we
don't even think about that then there
are others like Chile who is an orca a
killer whale who was taken from his pod
from his family when he was 3 years old
in the waters off Iceland and shipped to
SeaWorld in Orlando Florida where he has
remained in a concrete box basically
only not even able to swim the length of
his body for a long long time you can
see him on Google Earth you can look
down on him and see him in his concrete
box never able to smell anything or meet
any other orcas just his life given over
to entertainment I don't think you can
see this picture of the circus
okay it's she's absolutely sad just
she's in her little dress waiting to go
into a traveling show and here is a
picture of a Ringling Brothers elephant
baby this is what they do they take them
away from their mothers when they're
very very young and the mother stands
and watches so she remembers what
happened to her and the mother that the
baby knows that the mother can no longer
help they tie them down by all fours and
they beat them you can see the man's
holding the bull hook which is like a
fireplace poker with a metal hook that
they jab them under the ears under the
backs of the thighs in all these places
where you can't see them bleed and some
of them as they grow up have heavy
scarring this is how they're charged
with the bull hook tying down an
electric shock for the for the circuit
for the ear circus the circus would like
you to believe that they trained with
peanuts but they trained with the bull
hook and the electric prod I'm going to
just show you a little tiny snippet of
training behind the scenes other
trainers being trained on how to deal
with elephants behind the scenes
there's much much more and when you see
them an elephant holding another
elephant's trunk tail they use the
trunks and hold the tail and they're in
a line never forget they break their
tails deliberately Ringling's elephants
have broken tails the pain of that is
extraordinary and when they make those
elephants hold the tail of the elephant
in front of them then what they do is
they jab the elephants the lead elephant
so everybody has to move up and that's
what makes them move is the pain and the
fear of the bull hook but when you think
about it what do animals need they don't
need very much they don't need the right
to vote even though in the past they
might have done a better job than we did
they don't need supermarkets plastic
bags skating rinks shopping malls fast
food restaurants they don't need really
much at all all they need is to be
allowed enough basic food basic water
shelter from the elements or allowed to
have it their homelands allowed to exist
and they have precious little of that
with our construction and what we do
many of the others in
society view them as hamburgers handbags
tools for research amusements these
kinds of things and what they need is a
little respect and the greatest respect
of all for most of them is just to leave
them in peace I have something else that
Li Lama said that I love which should be
our motto which is no matter which
religion you have or none the best
religion of all is kindness and while
I'm quoting I'm going to throw in the
American Indian poet Joseph brew chock
who wrote the old man must have stopped
his car two dozen times to climb out and
gather into his hands the small toads
blinded by our lights and leaping like
live drops of rain and I kept saying you
can't save them all except it get in
we've got places to go
but leathery hands full of wet Brown
life knee-deep in the roadside grass he
just smiled and said they have places to
go to and that would be a wonderful
thing to remember so that's the
philosophy and I'll give you a little
bit of the nitty gritty people ask me
what is the most important thing you can
do if you care about animals and you
don't like what's happening to them and
I have a whole book of ideas you're very
welcome to take called making kind
choices but the most important thing is
to go vegan the nags that we are most
people don't hunt
most people don't wear fur but everybody
eats and in fact it's quite horrible to
think about this but the most frequent
interaction most people have with
animals is three times a day when they
sit down to eat them and in America we
are now eating a thousand chickens and
our excuse me a million a million
chickens an hour that's an awful lot of
individual birds if you
ever known a chicken they have
personalities there are absolutely
wonderful animals vegans by the way are
also called pure vegetarians which can
be confusing I never use that term it
sounds as if you have to go to church
and you can't drink beer so I just say
vegan so I'm going to offer you a few
reasons to consider this proposition
I'm Elysia Silverstone and I'm a
vegetarian there's nothing in the world
that's changed me as much as this I feel
so much better and have so much more
energy it's
but wait by the way if any she didn't
like the PETA ad they are gonna hate the
new one from the Beef Council
Wow that wasn't the other one was
another one jimmy kimmel sure that's
pretty good huh it always amazes me why
anybody else why you're vegetarian and I
always think it's like being asked why
you don't support rape or why you don't
support murder because actually the
animals are killed they don't want to go
and it's pretty bad
if you've also ever seen them the cows
having their horns removed without
painkiller or their beaks cut off if
they're chickens or if they're pigs
having their tails cut off all without
painkiller
you can only describe it as torture but
here is another video that is a few
reasons to go vegetarian reasons reasons
to become a vegetarian vegetarian
number one because heart disease begins
in childhood number two because a
vegetarian diet reverses heart disease
number three because eating meat and
dairy makes you act number four because
you shouldn't have to lie to your kids
about the food that you eat number five
because in every package of chicken
every package of chicken there's a
little poop poop number six because meat
is filthy and bloody number seven
because no living feature wants to see
her family slaughtered
number 10 because mad cow disease is in
the US
number eleven because it's violence you
can stop we can stop
number 12 because no one should have to
make a living by killing
number thirteen
because it takes a small person to eat a
defenseless animal and an even smaller
person to eat it
number 15 because the grain used to feed
them could feed them
you need more because they're
defenseless because when animals stir
pain they scream too because they don't
want to die because they feel fear
because no matter how you slice it
don't flesh because Commerce is no
excuse for murder because everyone wants
to be free
because eating fish doesn't make you a
vegetarian because mine doesn't make
right
so those are just a few reasons
every summer Peter goes out to festivals
and we serve vegetarian hotdogs
of course you can now get them in all
the ballparks and so on but it used to
be quite a novelty and when I fry up
these are whatever these hotdogs people
come over they always say what's in
those things because it says vegetarian
hotdog and you say vegetables and they
say oh I don't know about that it's
usually ma'am I'm sorry that's usually a
man who wrinkled their nose and say well
I don't know about that you say well do
you know what's in the regular hot dogs
you know the skin around the rectum the
nose between the toes and they go yeah I
think I'll have one of those change is
hard people resist change people don't
want to change I was in the airport
there was a little cup and it said
afraid of change leave yours here that I
need that for our animal rights movement
before we move on to why we do the
things that we do with naked people and
what-have-you which was one of the
questions so I thought I would cover it
and two dogs and cats just allow me
please to give you a few facts about
factory farming since that is the most
important thing it takes 22 hours in
chicken hell for a chicken to lay just
one egg lights are on all the time and
that egg is mixed so casually into
cookies and cakes chicken hell means
thousands of them packed into a shared
perhaps seven chickens to the size of
space the size of two itty-bitty
computers meaning that they can never
stretch even one wing they can never
even take a single step they stand on
sloped wire floors which you can just
imagine how that would be for 20 minutes
or 10 minutes they stand on them for
their entire lives
and in fact their claws grow around the
wire factory farms make every second of
their lives total misery when I was
seven in my family we stopped eating
veal my mother had been to the
supermarket and she protesters out there
protesting how veal is produced but what
I didn't realize is that the veal
industry is created by the dairy
industry I didn't connect those dots not
everybody realizes amazingly that a cow
has to be pregnant and give birth in
order to give milk they don't just give
milk this is for their baby that they
produce this milk and people also say
well they don't kill the cow for the
milk do they but yes they do the cow
that who is kept for her milk has a far
worse life than the cow who is kept for
beef because every single time she gives
birth to a beloved calf if that calf is
male a tractor comes along attaches a
chain to the calf's hind leg and drags
him away from her that mother loves her
baby the way any mother loves her baby
and cows will go ballistic trying to
follow that tractor lowing stamping
wanting her baby back
she is artificially inseminated on a
thing that even the farmers call a rape
rack when her baby is born and taken
away she is rien pregnat 'add and the
reason the baby is taken away is because
we want the milk to make into cheese
toppings for our pizza and our burgers
or to drink that was meant by nature for
that child but with the child out of the
way then we can package it and send it
to the supermarket and when she is worn
down when she's older than the beef cow
and she maybe has mastitis or pinkeye or
whatever she's her body is just broken
from this
constant overuse then yes she's killed
she's kicked and she's electric shock
down the ramp into the same store to
house the beef cow goes into honey by
this time she's in worse shape then then
he if the cruelty argument isn't enough
maybe the revulsion factor should be
they always say that that's a key
element in what we decide to do meat is
decomposing flesh and 60 minutes called
that liquid in the bottom of the packets
in the supermarket where it starts to
defrost fecal soup if that isn't
advertising I don't know what is and if
you ever go to a chicken factory farm
you can smell it before you get there
the same with a dairy farm that has veal
calves feel calves get a disease called
scours which is a diarrheal disease
because they're not on their mother's
milk and you can smell that the stench
of months of accumulated waste in the
factory farms burns your eyes if you
walk in the door your eyes start to
sting which is why people don't spend
any time in them they wear a mask they
go in they remove the dead but the
animals are in there at ground level all
the time in fact some of the pigs are on
slatted floors and they have when they
lie down all that waste comes up from
the bottom and I have been in
slaughterhouses by the way not only for
horses and cows and chickens but also
for dogs in Taiwan and most people are
stopped about dogs in a slaughterhouse
being strung up but may I tell you that
as frightened as they are as much as
they struggle and they try to get away
and they must be thinking this can't be
happening to me how how could you ever
imagine the scenario that you're facing
it's the same no matter the animal it's
just the dogs they all want to get out
of that place it smells like hot death I
used to smell when I first became a
vegetarian a chicken roasting in the
oven and think oh that smells good
go to the slaughterhouse you will never
forget what it smells like
it's the smell of hot death that's all I
can say so I recommend to anybody who
thinks oh I can't go there just spend a
couple of minutes I make a link on my
email to Paul McCartney's video glass
walls he always said if slaughterhouses
had glass walls everybody would be
vegetarian because if you were eating
other things you would see crops being
picked you would see fruit being picked
from the trees you would see things that
don't stink you would see things that
are pretty but if you're eating and if
you if storehouse had a glass wall you
never restaurant had a glass wall you
would never go there so I awesome please
look and like Biz Stone Russ Simmons
Ellen DeGeneres even President Clinton
now except for a little fish it can't be
that hard to do so moving on one of the
questions that came up that I saw appear
was people asking why does Peter go
naked against fur and perform other
antics that some people find shocking
and here are some of our ads I'll show
you this is Eva Mendes we have whoever
that is his name escapes me and that one
and we have he just changed his name and
another one so we do these ads all the
time and we do it to be provocative
we're like Dante Rosetti I suppose the
painter who was once asked why does he
do make a spectacle of himself and he
said why make a spectacle of myself that
gets people to look and then I can talk
about my serious work and that's us at
PETA we
learned that the press is like your cat
if you talk seriously to your cat your
cat will fall asleep your cat will walk
away but if you wiggle your little
finger under the door even though your
cat knows it's just your finger you
can't resist coming over and having a
look so that's the wiggle of our little
finger is to do something that the press
just can't resist every social movement
knows this coca-cola knows this you have
to get press attention or your message
doesn't get out so by being provocative
we get thousands upon thousands of
people to come to the website to see ads
like the ones we just showed and then
you know maybe they can't look at the
goal but they can look at the gorgeous
and then they get an education we did
this commercial for the Superbowl let me
just say that actually the Superbowl the
the channels the the network's get
millions of dollars a year obviously
from meat and dairy advertisers and
they're not going to take our little
pittance once a year and we knew that so
we came up with a provocative ads that
we knew they would reject and this is it
so as a result of that commercial 1
million 118,000 393 people visited our
website peta.org within 24 hours all of
them stayed and learned something about
animals and a lot of them downloaded
either chew on this or watched meet your
meat or watch the Paul McCartney glass
walls so that tactic works we have
decided it is true that sex sells
it's not all naked there are other ways
in which we get attention we ran this ad
which is Ricky Gervais sand pinkk
talking about skins hello excuse me guys
Co and when they came to the website to
see that they stayed to watch this hi
I'm Martha Stewart I am a big believer
in freedom of choice but I also believe
in making educated choices especially
when our decisions affect the lives of
others I used to wear real fur but like
many others I had a change of heart when
I learned what actually happens to the
animals let's take a look now I want to
warn you that some of these pictures
will be very disturbing and you may have
to look away but at least listen to kill
the animals without damaging their fur
neck breaking and electrocution are
recommended by fur trade associations in
Europe the United States
Canada and is outlined in many manuals
and guides anal electrocution as
demonstrated here by the secretary of
the Canada Fox breeders Association is
also suggested poorly-trained for
farmers such as this one in Illinois
often don't get it right the first time
and continually reelect recuse the
struggling animals in China the number
one fur producing nation in the world
animals are swung by their hind legs
into the ground breaking their necks or
backs but leaving them fully conscious
as they are skinned alive so people go
to an education came for one reason got
an education we have people working in
all sorts of places including in China
where 70% of the fur in this country
comes from and you can imagine how hard
it is for them to stand still and not be
detected shoot the video including
here's a slide of a rabbits you can
barely see it on this projection but if
you could you would see how dismal life
is for these animals on fur farms this
Donna Karan we have a campaign against
her for using a Chinese rabbit fur in
her collection and it's not just the
mammals there is things I think that
would make you sicker than you can
imagine for exotic naked skins they do
the rabbit pelts lined up outside diem
and here's one of our exotic skins ads
and here is them skinning pythons for
bags and shoes and belts and here they
are again of course nobody cares if it's
a snake you don't bother to render him
unconscious before you take his skin off
well that's that overview of why we do
what we do but let me talk to you about
dog and cat overpopulation we have a
program in lower Virginia and the
poverty pockets of North Carolina
where that picture was taken to help
dogs who are outside on chains their
whole life winter and summer one of the
things we do is help sterilize them
because we not only there but all over
the United States we are facing a dog
and cat overpopulation crisis it's not
just a problem it's a crisis every year
over 25 million dogs and cats are born
in the United States alone that's 7
times the number of human beings born 8
million are abandoned and put out under
the streets that's more than the
population of Switzerland dogs and cats
just thrown away every year because they
are inconvenient they are left at animal
shelters every day of the week and in
California alone you see nearly a
million animals taken into shelters
every year a million that's over 20,000
animals a day the five city shelters in
Los Angeles alone receive 80 thousand
animals a year who are unwanted and you
may think while finding a home for one
animal I could do that maybe I could
find a home for two animals if I really
push my luck I might be able to find a
good home for five animals
but with these figures if you do the
math it's totally impossible to find
homes for all these discarded dogs and
cats which is why shelter euthanasia is
the number one cause of death of dogs
and cats in the United States and it's
not the fault of the people who work in
the shelter's those who not only do
their best to comfort the animals who
have nowhere to go but have to deal with
the people who are throwing them over
the counter saying you're not going to
kill them are you these animals don't
know where their families disappeared to
they're extremely confused they're
depressed and many of them have
behavioral problems because they're in a
panic you know if you have a family who
suddenly left one day we'll put you in
prison
we're in a strange place yes you'd be a
little disturbed and that's what the
shelter workers have to do have their
jaw only 16 percent of our animal
companions come from shelters the rest
come from breeders and pet shops and
someone down the street who had a litter
so 16 percent from the shelter's means
the rest of them are going to be put
down no kill shelters don't solve the
problem at all
if they're not among the many who are
being busted for hoarding I don't know
if you've seen the hoarding shows on
television they're hoarding shelters in
hoarding them in hideous conditions in
small cages without proper care they may
be helpful it's true because they can
take a small population and look after
them but they're not working at the root
of the problem no kill shelters quickly
reach their capacity and then what do
they do they have to close the door they
have to say I'm sorry go to the open
admission shelter that we that's down
the block
don't come here we have no room for you
and even so in no-kill shelters that
have reached capacity it's very common
to see cages stacked up to the ceiling
and animals who have no life there in a
see-through box year after year turning
in circles here is a no-kill shelter we
just busted
so if that noise is uncomfortable can
you imagine living in it day and night
year after year and that's what we face
we have just busted another no-kill
shelter I think it was called life for
animals or something down in the
Carolinas and it's thank you it had over
300 cats living in small cages who were
there for up to seven years we took many
of them away and they were unable to be
saved over a hundred them had to be
euthanized right away because they had
dental disease tumors all sorts of
problems that couldn't be fixed because
of neglect so what has to be done is to
get people to adopt anyone you know only
adopt here's an ad that we have that
says breeders kill shelter dogs chances
another reason not to buy a dog from a
pet shop is because no matter what
you're told the chances are that that
dog came from a puppy mill and you may
have seen specials on ABC about puppy
mills this is something farmers have now
in the Midwest behind their homes where
the animals are kept up on wire and they
have no life they're exposed to the
elements and they're used just to churn
out puppies that are then shipped to
these pet shops you'll have to turn the
volume down or we'll get more complaints
but here is one of those puppy mills
constant confinement rise the dogs
married some began to bounce off the
walls literally others pace not just for
short periods of time but constantly
deprived of proper exercise and
companionship this is the only life they
know their whole world is confined to a
small cage for many of the dogs that
inescapable reality sends them spinning
endlessly in circles
although the speed at which this dog
spends further into madness seems unreal
the tape has been shown at normal speed
it's insanity and that's where the
puppies come from
so as for dog breeders those are pet
shop puppies no matter how kindly a
breeder feels towards the animals or the
type of dog or cat that they breed there
is no such thing anymore as a
responsible breeder it's just so grossly
irresponsible to breed more litters into
a world where we have animals who are
being put down because they have no
homes that's the problem we have to face
we have some very pointed videos because
people aren't paying attention and I'm
going to show you three of them I think
we have to turn the volume up a tickle a
bit but here are three of our very
pointed videos that make people pay
attention to this issue that's a great
point Cindy and that's why it's
important for us to continue to dock the
tails crop the ears and create that
clean load it's so important I'm sorry
sir I think you got the wrong meeting Oh
does the American Kennel Club yes but
you know we're blinds right yes and
breeding to achieve a master race well
master pedigree
honey we need to talk about sex yeah we
think you should be having its we nail
everything you can if it's got a pulse
you should be wrapped around it but if I
get pregnant we you should pop out all
the kids you want yeah we can leave them
in the shelter dump them in the street
really not important little girl's gonna
get some so we ran that last ad when
Britney Spears sister forget her name
now but when she announced that she was
pregnant at 16 we ran that in the in her
home state and within four hours we had
over 18,000 people come to peta.org and
learn about spaying neutering which
appears right after this ad on the
website spaying and neutering is
absolutely the single most important
thing we can do to combat the
overpopulation crisis we run three
mobile spay and neuter clinics they go
into little income area areas we spay at
low cost to no cost they're all
subsidized we do over 12,000 animals a
year and if you think about it it's not
just those 12,000 we do its if even half
of them had just one litter and even if
none of the animals in that litter were
went on to reproduce which is all
ridiculous because they all would have
multiple litters and go on to reproduce
we are saving hundreds of thousands of
animals from being homeless every year
and I think that's the key finding a
home for a dog one dog is a lovely
lovely thing but paying for somebody who
perhaps can't afford to spay or neuter
their animal saves countless more over
the years ahead
you have saved far more than that one
placement a dog or a cat is a lifetime
responsibility they're not accoutrements
to our lifestyle even though they're
sometimes treated that way they're not
arm candy the way Britney Spears and
Paris Hilton think of them they're not
toys there are other lives there just
like us and their happiness is in our
hands because we've domesticated them
they can't look after themselves anymore
they can't find water if they want it
they can't go and turn on our taps
they're not free even to go outside to
urinate if they don't have permission
from us so I ask people please if your
dog wants to go out don't put it off go
now you're the only hope they have make
sure that they have clean food and water
think about what they want what is their
life yes I watched a man on his mobile
phone walking his dog and I see this all
the time and he was so engrossed in his
I'm sure
earth-shattering conversation or vital
appointment and his dog is trying to
lift his leg and the man is just
barreling down the street and his dog on
three legs his tripod him down the
street after him I mean how little
respect how little an animal needs and
he can't put down his mobile phone so
there was he recently an RSPCA study
that found that 63 percent of dogs of
people who have dogs in their home keep
them inside too long when they need to
relieve themselves
and many people do not even provide
clean water or a bowl a special bowl or
a bed for their animals I believe they
should be on your bed but that's it
god knows what else they don't do so
please if you have an animal at home
remember when you come home you're the
Beatles to them that is the highlight of
their day so don't just ignore them when
you go to work don't leave them with
their legs crossed for your eight hours
or however many it is be like this
gentleman here and bring them with you
they have no other life so each of us
also has the power to end animal
overpopulation the dog and cat crisis
please get our literature get our videos
do whatever you can to tell people never
go to the breeder never go to the pet
shop that always spay and neuter and go
to the shelter and finally if you see
this one John McEnroe actually talking
about John McEnroe very helpful so I'm
going to leave you with this long
thought don't be relieved yet we should
be in awe of animals it isn't because of
the animals that the Sun is searing into
the earth bringing starvation to the
peoples of Africa it isn't because of
animals that the ice caps are melting
that no one can drink from our waterways
that sparrows are dying that frogs are
disappearing that penguins are found
floating dead in the Antarctic
even in places as pristine as Alaska
until we came along millions of animals
from walruses to beavers to birds to
insects to Eagles songbirds foxes lived
there for millennia without despoiling a
thing
turtles navigate by the Earth's
electromagnetic field birds by the Stars
an albatross was the first individual to
know that the earth was round not a
human being
dolphins use sonar and we copy from them
ants construct boats to cross mighty
rivers the Congo is disappearing yet the
animals know that in just a few square
yards of the Congolese jungle you can
find wild mushrooms yams different kinds
of seasonal fruits the bark of a tree
that contains antibiotics a bark that
tastes like garlic edible vines even a
sapling that cures a headache in those
jungles are millions upon millions upon
millions of animals of all kinds yet
unlike our cities their ground is rich
with vegetation the forest canopy
provides shade the rivers are clear and
the food is abundant but it will all be
gone not because of them but because we
humans have so much greed not need just
greed we tear down their homes and their
resources because we want more rubber we
want more minerals more logs more lumber
more of everything animals are great
role models we should look at them and
listen and watch what they do they eat
what nature intended them to eat they
remain healthy they use natural
medicines gorillas actually grind
volcanic soil into ash and they swallow
it to rid their bodies of toxins
starlings
use aromatic herbs
they weave them into their nests so that
they can keep their young free of mites
cockatoos in the jungle eat clay to
prevent cancer something they die of not
in the jungle but in captivity if the
great loneliness of being kept in a cage
unable to fly doesn't get to them first
we should be in or animals have cultures
they have languages elephants
communicate subsonically at frequencies
that we can't hear and many animals do
that rhinos use breathing signals to
talk to each other and tree frogs tap
out their messages on logs even the
tiniest insect produces two higher
pitched sound for us to hear without
instrumentation and it's now thought
that cows communicate with facial
expressions they can read but we don't
have a clue about studies have shown
that prairie dogs use nouns and verbs
they have different words by which they
can tell each other how many people are
entering a field and what sort of people
whether it's a man it's a dog it's two
people it's a crowd it's people they
know it's a bulldozer and yet they are
being bulldozed and they're being
vacuumed out of their dens and sold in
pet shops and they die in people's homes
because people do not know how to take
care of them and they die in their
hearts of the great loneliness of being
separated from their family their loved
ones their friends their villages and
what do we do we go into space we have
SETI we train our telescopes and our
listening devices desperate to find out
if there is intelligent life in the
universe there is intelligent life in
the universe it's all around us but what
do we do with it we experiment on it we
eat it we cut it up and we make it into
clothing and shoes it isn't easy to
change society
in Washington DC where Peter is
headquartered there is a college for the
death called Gallaudet Gallaudet college
for the Deaf and years ago I would
always remember this they were furious
the students actually went on strike
because the governing body would not
appoint a deaf president every time
there was a new president it was a
hearing president and the deaf students
have had enough so they walked out of
class they had sit-ins they were just
uncontrollable and so the governing body
appointed a deaf president and the
leader of the student revolt wrote an
editorial in The Washington Post which I
kept I'll never forget it he wrote when
slaves rose up against their masters
whites weren't ready but the slaves were
when women demanded the vote men weren't
ready but women were and hearing people
may not be ready for us to get a deaf
president but we are ready and I thought
to myself yes human beings may not be
ready to afford respect to all the other
living individuals on the face of the
earth but by god they're ready and i
hope we can do something to make that
happen for them thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
