introduce our next topic and we're going
to have a few speakers come up and talk
about some of our educational efforts so
first we have a project that Alfred
mentioned briefly an Android app
inventor or young Android done by
visiting faculty Hal Abelson and Ellen
spertus now just go through everything
quickly and let everyone go one after
another and then Mitch Resnick is here
and I asked him to briefly talk about CS
for HS and the workshop that was held at
MIT recently and then finally OB
Greenberg will be talking about YouTube
edu and educational efforts there so
color Sean Sean yes hi I'm Hal Abelson
then appeared with Ellen spertus and as
Alfred mentioned this morning we're both
visiting faculty here and uh it's just
great I guess the one thing I wanted to
say about visiting faculty all of you is
the very hot when you in the culture
here the very highest status thing you
can be is an engineer so I think some of
you know what it's like to be doing some
sort of computer science things say you
know in a large medical research center
right and you know that you have no
class everyone will say well here's this
great thing you've done you know you've
you've proved P equals NP equals NP but
what are the doctors think and at Google
it's always what did the engineers think
and it's just wonderful wonderful
culture to be in any way what we're
working on we're part of what's called
the young Android group and we're
building a programming platform called
app inventor and app inventor is
inspired by two observations the first
one is that there is a real
discontinuity that probably started
about two years ago and may go on for
another two years about what it means
what it can mean to experience
computation it's like in 1980 when
suddenly there was a discontinuity and
computing could have something to do
with with graphics for most people
Larry talked about computer science not
being sexy so I won't get myself in
trouble by trying to talk about sex but
what computer size is right now is
dissociated and the difference between
the revolution we're going through right
now is that computing no longer has to
be on abstract things that are going on
or deep concepts like what's the
difference between a private class and a
protected class in Java but it can be
about your life and the way you walk
around and interact with you that's
happening right now that's one
phenomenon the other one is that Google
is building Android which is open source
so if you see the great things that's
happening in all sorts of mobile phones
it's tremendous and there are lots of
applications but they're being viewed as
consumer products right not only are
they unclosed architectures but you need
Steve's you need Steve Jobs as
permission in order to distribute your
application and the great opportunity is
that there are now open source mobile
platforms that can link to the web that
can link to your social networks and
what I'm going to show you is a very
quick demo where we've said what would
it be like if it were really easy to
make mobile applications so let me let
me start with wild you a hello world in
the system here's a little application
let's start it there is the kitty and
pet the kitty actually is my kid here's
a little application now go to the next
go to the next one okay so this is an
online developing up it's an online
development environment and what you see
here our pallet a suite of applications
that you can add to your phone and these
things are boxed up is what we call
components
and so here what we're going to do is we
just grabbed out a label that's going to
be the label that says pet the kitty and
they're on the right over here there are
the properties that you can play with of
this label and we're changing the text
of the label to say pet the kitty and
we're just for fun we're going to change
the font size of the label to be larger
and and I guess that's all on it will
change the background color of the label
to be something and the text color to be
something okay okay so this is a little
bit like like the standard kinds of
graphical interface as you say
okay now what we're going to do is pull
out another component which is a button
so that's going to be the button that
you press in order to make something
happen and we're going to tell this
button to look like alright we're going
to grab its image and say this button
should look like a picture of my cat
there we have a very primitive you see
this isn't making a faithful rendition
of what's on the screen so you have to
push another tab to actually see what
it's going to look like on the screen
but we're getting there this would work
very much in progress ok and now
remember when you pet the kitty it's
supposed to go meow so you need a meow
so there's another component which is a
sound player we're going to tell the
sound player that the sound you play is
the kitty meow ok so there's the way our
application looks so the model in this
is you you set something up for how it
should look on the screen and then
you're going to put the logic in so the
logic of this program for those of you
who've seen alice or even more scratch
this will look very very familiar in
fact this project 0 is a tremendous
amount to miss Resnick and scratch and
reduction to ask Mitch to talk in a
minute so what you see here now we're
doing the logic so you see all of your
components here and we're going to drag
out from the button a thing that says
what you do when the button is clicked
all right so there's our event handler
for the button we're going to say when
the button is clicked you tell the sound
to play and then just for fun we're
going to make the cat purr so we're also
going to just say when the button is
clicked you tell the sound to vibrate
the phone it's
this comes from scratch and like Alice a
sort of puzzle piece codeblocks version
of putting things together and we're
going to tell it to vibrate for 500
milliseconds half a second okay so
that's the complete application and then
what you do when you've built this
application is you you say compile it it
builds a complete ordinary application
and then puts up a barcode and then you
can download this thing to the phone
over the barcode alright so that's hello
world but of course see how do I stop
this one that's cool it's coming up here
how do I get out here okay but of course
the interesting thing is not that you
can put pictures of cats but this is
actually a phone so here's another
location that's done the same way except
this time when you press the button it's
going to make a phone call and it's also
linked to your data on the phone so when
you say add somebody it goes to the
contact picture on your phone and picks
out the context which is where it's
getting the pictures and the phone
numbers from and of course the phone is
also location sensitive here's a tiny
tiny little application where you push
the button that says where am i and it
tells you your latitude and longitude
which should not be surprising because
the phone does that but this is the
program and here's a more complicated
program that actually is kind of like a
game of telephone because the phones can
of course talk to each other over over
the web and talk to web servers and this
talks to a little web service that
maintains a group and you play a little
game so that should have an image of
where we're going we are this project is
in development and I think it's
interesting about this project is that
it's kind of done collaboratively with a
bunch of university so we're
experimenting with about a dozen
universities in the fall and this will
evolve we may take on more in the spring
all of us on the young Android team
we'll be around at the cocktail party
and the dinner if you want to talk about
what you might do but let me introduce
Ellen now who is not only a visiting
faculty member at Google but also going
to use this in about three weeks at
Mills thanks he'll he'll mentioned a
great thing about Google is that the
engineers are the most important and
that's true another great thing is the
egalitarian ism it doesn't matter where
you come from what degree you have
everybody's code gets reviewed and one
of my biggest thrills was getting to
review Hal's code and finding an
abstraction violation so Mills College
is a women's liberal arts college nearby
in Oakland California it's not an
engineering school what our students
care most about is just a social change
they're usually protesting something I
know all of you are familiar with this
graph those of you who don't teach of
women's colleges may not have focused as
much on this number the latest
statistics are that only three out of a
thousand college freshmen women wanted
to major in computer science so imagine
you're at a school that is fewer than a
thousand undergrads so it's important to
attract other students and you know that
would be true even if a lot of people
were interested in computer science
because my goal for this goes beyond
students in some parts of the world the
people's only internet access is through
their phones and if we can make its own
on computer scientists can create phone
apps that can have a huge effect so I'm
teaching a class this fall called
technology for a better world and the
idea is the students usually see their
cell phones and technology used for
entertainment or commerce but it can
also be used to change the world so with
Kiva that supports microfinance between
the developed and developing world one
laptop per child could have a huge
fact WikiLeaks that lets people
anonymously upload documents to fight
corruption by government and local
officials and corporations and as I've
said cell phones are having a huge
effect on the developing world that was
pleased to see there's an ICT group and
I think that I'm hoping that this will
appeal to students so I'm going to start
with a hails kitty application and the
next assignment can just ask students to
make small changes to that and make a
better application because whenever you
see something you think how would I have
done it what don't I like about it how
can I make it better so take American
Idol you could create one button for
each of the contestants and you press a
button and it calls and votes for that
person he'll mention the location sensor
you can make it so you go somewhere and
it shows a picture relevant to it
there's there's so many things you can
make it play a video when you go to a
location press a button imagine that
when you're going around a museum or
walking long historical trail so they're
really few limits of what you can do so
that would be introducing the students
to the technology but the term project
would be to design an application that
can help people who aren't being well
served by technology and either
implemented or create a prototype over
the semester so I hope that students
will understand better what computer
science is about which is valuable even
if they don't go on to take more
computer science courses see the
computer science is about helping people
and think about technology some you know
the computer professionals for Social
Responsibility old slogan technologies
driving the future it's up to us to do
the steering so with that I'll turn
things over to Mitch
as alfred mentioned this morning google
has been supporting this initiative
called cs4 HS to support computer
science at the high school level so I
talked with Leslie earlier in the year
about MIT getting involved in this and
we ended up this past just a few weeks
ago running our first CS for HS when I
first start talk to Leslie about it I
said it really was excited about
participating in cs4 HS we just with a
couple small caveats the 1st Cav it was
I really didn't think it should just be
about high school but to me it seemed
important to get started earlier on so i
went to stretch it so it's not just high
school but also middle school even
elementary school teachers because these
ideas felt important enough it was
important to get young people started
early and the other small problem was I
didn't think is exactly right to focus
on computer science so as cs4 HS was
fine it's set for the cs the HS and what
i meant by you know the cs was at least
the way people traditionally think about
CS in pre-college with the thing about
the AP course to prepare people are
going to major in CS and they may become
computer science professionals i have
nothing no problem with that but in my
mind it's important to reach everybody
as some of it as allen and how we're
also mentioning that these ideas are
important for everybody regardless of
what they made rent or what they do and
luckily Google is supportive enough to
say yes go for it and to try stretch it
in both those directions to reach a
broader audience about teachers all
different levels and to think about how
computational ideas can reach you know
people of all different areas of
interest and see how they could apply it
in all different areas so in fact it
gets captured somewhat in the subtitle
of what we called our workshop we said
it was cultivating computational
thinking and computational creativity in
the classroom so it's drawing on Ginette
wings ideas about computational thinking
about their certain core ideas they're
important for thinking all different
disciplines and also computational
creativity about enabling people to
create things computationally and our
main approach this workshop it was not
about having a bunch teachers come in
and listen to lectures about
computational ideas for several days
it was much more focused on learning
through designing to get everybody
involved in designing and creating you
know with computers because we found the
best way for learning is actually by
creating things on your own and it was
really towards this end of trying to
help people develop a fluency with
computational media that when we see it
really there's so many people especially
the next generation growing up are very
comfortable with going and interacting
with computers in all sorts of ways but
very very few have what I would call a
fluency and again with the analogy to
reading and writing we don't say someone
is fluent with language if they can just
read a street sign but you know it's
only if they can write we want people to
be able to you know right even if
they're not going to become you know
professional journalists or authors but
to build either write a report to be
able to write a shopping list to write a
note to a friend computation we don't
expect the same things and we should to
let everybody really become fluent to
their creating that was our real goal is
to help support these teachers to then
support students to become truly fluent
where they can create their own dynamic
interactive media so not just
interacting but designing creating with
computational media so for doing that we
really were basing on our scratch
software which how mentioned this is
software which we've developed over the
last few years we support for the
National Science Foundation then more
recently from others where our goal was
we think one of the reasons that the
programming hasn't you know that most
people aren't programming it is partly
you know we need to make programming
more accessible more meaningful and more
social by more accessible we want to
make it so that get rid of some of this
syntax which sketch in the way make it
easier so it's this building block
metaphor as how mentioned so you can
just start building up programs as
easily as putting different blocks or
jigsaw puzzle pieces together so you get
to the core ideas more quickly more
meaningful letting people do things that
they care about again is how was saying
too much of computers dissociated make
it where people can build things they
really care about again here we were
doing a lot of things with giving access
to media to manipulate media manipulate
images photographs music sound and put
together in different ways and also more
social to be able to share your what
you've created so right when the
application scratch application became
available two years ago we also launched
the website
where you can very easily just by
clicking on the share button at the top
of the interface your project
immediately goes to the website so right
now in the scratch website there's a new
project coming up more than one a minute
there's no more than 500,000 projects
shared by kids on this website so it's a
type of YouTube for interactive media so
instead of sharing videos you share your
own dynamic interactive creations
there's all different types of things on
the website art music stories robotics
simulations games so people do things
all different ways and then share a
tremendous do all types of collaboration
sharing more than twenty percent of the
uploads are remixes of one another we
repealed download take the code of
someone else's projects and added so
again at the cs4 HS workshop we did it
was helping the teachers learn to
support these types of activities using
the scratch software let me show you
briefly some of the types of projects
that the teachers were working on so
these are from the workshop so again
this is the scratch programming language
the application where you just snap
blocks together to make different things
happen let me show you this was a
product i'll put in well to start
playing it so this was like an
introductory project we asked them to
just do something use images to
introduce people to the workshop so here
gets sewn here with mixing they took a
picture of their daughter put it on the
dancing body took a photograph from the
media lab and made it so welcome so it's
again mixing lots of different media
together in order to do so to welcome
animation but in the process learn to
think creatively you know reason
systematically by putting these blocks
together in different ways so you
actually see could also it's very
tinkerbell you just take this away so
this the project eyes forever change
costume but do that that's making this
character dance around let me just show
one more example from later in the
workshop when they were sort of
experimenting with games this is a
project will put it in full screen mode
here this was a game that one of the
teachers created that's I'm Nellie and
the arrow keys to move the character
back and forth and they can launch the
fork trying to get healthy foods
yummy so good food I sort of gain points
I've hit a less healthy food so again
not so much that this is you know the
greatest game of all times but the idea
is again to be able to just very quickly
put together but to learn core
computational ideas as you put together
these different means of personal
expression so through these different
types of projects you I think what we
were seeing was is partly to get people
learning some core computational
concepts everything conditionals
variables synchronization threads vent
handling all come about you know but in
a very very clear clear way we found it
that it's much better for interest in
these core concerts in fact even though
we designed this for 8 to 15 year old a
number of universities are starting to
use it in the first few weeks of
computer science classes because it's a
good way to get these concepts very
clearly a course across or even for a
whole semester you know oftentimes for
non computer science major so part of
our idea was to get these core concepts
across but also to develop
problem-solving capacities and putting
this program together design capacities
defending also just social emotional
capacities about collaborating sharing
persevering with during frustration so
it wasn't just about learning core
computer science concepts the ideas of
how to sort of address difficult
challenges and problem solving in and
design and learning how to go about
doing that so again we're really excited
about you know the results from it we
had a group of teachers who we got very
positive feedback at the end about how
they can make use of this in their
classes in a variety of different ways
in K through 12 and we're excited about
continuing to work with Google in the
years ahead to see how we can support
this in it and a broader way thanks a
lot
hi everybody my name is Obadiah
greenberg I work on the strategic
partnerships team at YouTube I'm here to
talk to you today about YouTube edu I
know were a little pressed for time so
I'm going to breeze through some of
these first slides but I really just
wanted to set the stage with YouTube
about YouTube's mission in that I think
what differentiated it when it launched
a number of years ago is that really the
community decides meaning that it's the
community it's a complete meritocracy
the community decides what videos are
the most popular which ones they want to
engage in and therefore make it to the
home page and you'll see that this same
ethic is I carried over to what we're
doing with our higher education partners
just a general sense of scope hundreds
of millions of views daily hundreds of
thousands of uploads daily and I pay you
if I asked how many of you folks have
seen youtube video apply be pretty much
everyone upload probably a few less and
again just a sense of scope is there are
now 20 hours of video being uploaded
every minute which is something and so
you know in this kind of ocean of video
I want to talk about what we're doing to
really help surface the incredible
higher education video that's coming on
onto YouTube so you know a lot of folks
they think of you too even today still
think of lonely girl you know 15 or you
know cats playing piano things like that
we're hoping that myth has been
dispelled over the last couple years to
some of the important partnerships we've
struck with looks like the BBC the the
you choose campaign and so on but it was
a couple of years ago that we formed our
first official partnership with higher
education university this is you see
birthdays channel came out you might
have heard about it made quite a splash
primarily because they were putting up
so much video i think was about 150
videos to its start but a number of
those videos were course lectures all
the lectures that make up a semester of
semesters so essentially we're doing
course casting and not just making it
available for their community but for
worldwide audience since then we've
struck we have relationships as a number
of colleges and universities in the US
Canada and actually around the world we
there are actually hundreds of schools
now who have an official presence on
youtube so then we realize that okay we
have all of these great college and
university partners but folks are still
having a hard time finding them and the
schools are saying you know we really
want to be among our peers so we had
some stated goals for a project called
you to be to you to help showcase these
these partnerships so one is just to
promote the discovery of this incredible
video on YouTube and to showcase it in a
way that we felt was new and exciting so
the ability to see kind of what channels
are the most popular what videos are the
most popular and start to detect some
trends as to why to build a community of
peers again these schools are kind of
depending on if their rivals are not or
colleagues whatever they sort of see how
they how their popularity is our
relative to the others and it's not even
necessarily a factor of the quality of
the video itself as much as what is what
are the savvy ways they're using to
promote those videos on their site and
elsewhere and then finally provide a
platform for reach and tool for research
so we already talked about reach in
terms of just kind of the the size of
the audience in in the world who are
watching YouTube but also tools for
research being a lot of the analytics we
provide about about the videos which
I'll touch on in a later slide so this
is you to be to you this is just a
screenshot you can find it at
youtube.com slash edu and essentially
what we have here are by default the
most viewed videos in the most viewed
channels and then you can click in to
kind of drill down in subsequent pages
it's fascinating to watch this on a
daily basis and see some video start to
kind of jump up into the most viewed
slot and there also some other
interesting things that are fairly
unique to YouTube edu that the rest of
you to youtube doesn't have so one is
well right here we have disappeared
erector e of all of the schools so if
you're interested
and posting your lectures or tutorials
whatever you might be interested in
posting and you want to be part of your
University's program go to the directory
first and see if your school is already
part of YouTube edu if they're not then
you know talk to the appropriate people
on your campus that kind of AV folks or
public relations folks and it's also
possible that they have a channel that
is in development but just has not been
added to the directory yet this is just
a shot of our most viewed videos this is
I think maybe a month old this
screenshot and this is also an
interesting feature of YouTube edu where
you can actually search within the
YouTube edu corpus this is a search on
physics and you're getting just physics
anything with physics and the metadata
from the schools that are providing
video to YouTube we have a lot of MIT
and berkeley and stanford here these are
the most subscribed channel a
subscription means that a viewer is
watching the video and they say i want
to subscribe so anything new that one of
these schools posts comes into my inbox
because i want to stay up on what this
provider is is posting what's
interesting about this slide is you'll
see the most subscribed and again this
is about a month old it might have
changed but MIT Berkeley Stanford and
this is actually IIT these schools are
all posting not just news clips not just
kind of Public Affairs clips but full
courses so this tells us hey the YouTube
community and people in the world are
really appreciating and valuing this
open content and it's these open
educational resources that these schools
are making available so these are just
some screenshots of some of the courses
that are being made available from
Berkeley has about I think a dozen of
course they have many more on their own
local site mit is up to I think about 50
in a range of topics here we have
Stanford another range of topics and IIT
which a lot of people don't realize that
they have about over 100 full courses
engineering courses on their YouTube
channel right now
it's quite amazing and what's also
interesting about most of the schools
that are posting OpenCourseWare is it
does tend to be primarily engineering
computer science up and can't forget
Kyoto University either and what's
interesting is now you know you're
really seeing that we have
opencourseware zits a global movement
you know globally these schools are
forming YouTube channels and what's nice
is that with YouTube it's not all about
people having to go to youtube to see
this stuff or go to the YouTube channels
but also that with the embedding
function you know a little snippet of
code people can add these videos to
their local websites so here's the
famous last lecture at Carnegie Mellon I
think when this thing first went viral
Oprah talked about or something like
that I think there were some issues with
supporting all the viewership locally
they posted it to youtube embedded the
video on their page and I've been happy
ever since and this is of course MIT
OpenCourseWare site which they've
started now to replace their old
realplayer where people had to kind of
often download a plug-in and so on and
so on and see this video now write in
line their lectures are playing it's
also interesting i mentioned some of the
analytics tools i know this is small but
these are two of the more popular videos
in youtube edu today one iit and MIT and
I you know as as an instructor you can
actually see some of the trends of
viewership how people are arriving at
these videos where they're being linked
from where they're being embedded from
and so on so there's an amazing
analytics around each of these videos
you can get a sense of you know within a
particular time frame who is who is
watching from where and what's also
interesting is you can also find out
what parts of a video so we're talking
maybe an hour lecture you can find out
what parts of a video the YouTube
community are are interested in relative
to other videos of this duration you
know you drag this slider around and you
see a dip here where it goes kind of
more above average and then you can
analyze that and say okay what is it
about this part of the lecture that
people are finding interesting right so
it's like a great feedback it's like the
world's biggest focus group or something
another interesting feature actually
Yale has come up big we're starting to
post a full courses which is awesome
this is a literature course this is a
lecture looks like it's on on the road
and when captions are made available we
do support captions we have a feature
called auto translate and here are
translated from English to Chinese and
now you have subtitles so this is also
really exciting just more in terms of
again you know open education and that
that worldwide reach and you know part
of that I mean it's really this idea
that you know with all of these schools
