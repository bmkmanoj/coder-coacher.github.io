our energy seer any energy seminar
series it's called grep green renewable
energy and policy seminar it's gonna be
held by monthly and Mountainview on
Thursday afternoons and we plan to
invite a mix of internal and external
speakers to talk about green energy
topics so this will help us this will
give us the opportunity to stay current
on research policies and initiatives in
the energy industry so if you if you're
at google you can see the up scheduled
upcoming talks that go - energy -
seminar and you can email John Fitch or
myself Alice Ryan with speaker
suggestions if you have any so with that
here's John thanks Alice glad there are
a good handful of you here today it's my
pleasure to introduce our first speaker
Karl little is somebody that I worked
with at Parc and he's a wonderful
researcher a wonderful person and it's
great to have him here along with a
couple of his colleagues karl has a
background in material sciences and has
worked in companies such as Applied
Materials he's worked at Parc for
several years now doing lots of great
research work on printing processes and
systems material science as well as some
renewable energy topics and I know for a
couple of years Karl has been looking at
this concept with some other colleagues
there so I'm not gonna say much about
the process except it's basically how do
we get atmospheric co2 to do something
good for us possibly make a liquid fuel
so with that it's Karl
thanks John so John's warned me that I
run the risk of preaching to the choir
and that I should probably zip through
some of the first slides a little
quickly but you know I think that this
is something that I remind myself a lot
and the fact is that that we all are
making decisions as to how we allocate
our limited resources in what directions
we can't do everything simultaneously
and I think that it always is good to to
really look at where the priorities are
why we're doing what we're doing and and
also to to
mind ourselves how urgent it is so I
will I will just try to highlight maybe
some of the points that are sometimes
less noted but I will run through that
well let me just have one slide at the
beginning to show a little bit of what
Parc is is is interested in and/or is
involved in in terms of renewable energy
several years ago
probably our most successful
collaboration in this area was with soul
focus it still continues at some level
although they now have their own
facility here in Mountain View and they
are a concentrated photovoltaic
manufacturer and they are starting to
put some large installations in in Spain
and and Parc helped contribute and John
also or contributed directly to both
their their generation once concentrated
photovoltaic system and their generation
2 system which which is in development
right now and this is just an example of
how where park technology in this case
the ability to do to do optical system
design and analysis has aided in
renewable energy and we're looking to
expand that into other parts of clean
technology okay well why so as I said
why we're doing what we're doing so
these charts are familiar to to most
people this is this is from the South
Pole just I use that one because it's
about as far from civilization as you
can get and shows you how how well the
atmosphere mixes and where co2 is going
just to pull out from this is annually
we're emitting about 22 Giga tons of
anthropogenic co2 every year from fossil
fuels or from limestone cracking and the
annual increase in the atmosphere is 15
Giga tons the rest is going into the
oceans ocean acidification is is going
to be a big problem this is another one
that that has always always amazed me
and scares me and that is the lifetime
of co2 it's it's it's a multi
exponential lifetime the it takes a
several hundred years for the ocean
invasion for for a lot of the co2 to go
into the ocean and to acidify it of
course but it's real you're really
looking at things like rock weathering
and a reaction with with available
carbonates over thousands if not
thousands of years to get down and it
actually never all goes away you reach
you reach a steady state which is going
to still ten to 20 percent of the co2
that is emitted it just remains in the
atmosphere the other thing that to note
is and I hear this a lot is about the
biosphere about how sequestering carbon
in the biosphere the entire amount of
carbon that's in vegetation today is
approximately 600 Giga tons the amount
of carbon that's in fossil fuels is
estimated to be about 5000 Giga tons the
the biosphere while you know on some
level is useful it's actually not a
viable sink for for the carbon that
we're talking about this is one of the
the slides or pieces of information that
got me thinking about fuels um because
we at park had worked on photovoltaics
we have interest in working on other
forms of solar electricity and what will
that actually do for us this is data
that is generated by Lawrence Livermore
they have a program that's looking at
different energy alternatives and this
is taking available government
information and mapping where the energy
is coming from and going in the US and
this is I think this is becoming in fact
I've seen this slide of other places so
people are starting to look at this
quite a bit and this is showing for 2005
and showing where the energy is coming
from in this case it's nuclear for
electricity but other than that for
fossil fuels we have coal natural gas
and oil and you can pretty much track it
to the application coal is almost
entirely going to electricity generation
so as we as we if we are successful and
actually make renewable energy of the
predominant method of electricity
generation we will dramatically decrease
the amount of coal that is consumed
however we won't really decrease very
much in terms of natural gas and not at
all really in oil
unless we can utilize that electricity
in ways that isn't being utilized today
right so we have to be applied to
industrial applications where they use
things like natural gas for for heat
sources or in terms of transportation
and there are there are areas where
transportation fuel option is going to
be very difficult for electricity it
only gets worse this is a projection to
2050 just it
your projections so it's unlikely to be
true but it'll take a lot to to change
it this is this is something that I hear
from time to time about especially now
that oil prices are going up quite a bit
and gasoline prices as well and you know
what about what about the end of oil I
mean the oil resources are now are
limited and we are seeing evidence of
diminishing supplies lack of new oil
fields being discovered for instance
won't that necessitate some alternatives
that's that's perhaps true but things
like coal gasification are available
there are ways today that we can take
coal and you can through different
methods you can turn it into liquid
hydrocarbons you can turn it into
something that looks like diesel or
gasoline it's energy intensive and but
there's a lot of coal out there and it's
very inexpensive and so and given that
the US has the dominant share of coal in
the world that says this is likely to be
a viable alternative as oil it becomes
more expensive in fact there's some
argument to today whether you know if as
the technology develops with it wouldn't
be cost competitive today if it
generates a massive amounts of co2 just
to get the fuel itself takes about two
parts co2 for every part of carbon that
you have that you put into the fuel and
then of course you're gonna burn it too
so you're getting about three parts co2
for burning it when if you for petroleum
we get about one part co2 for equivalent
energy and there's oil shale tar sands
methane hydrates all sorts of things so
what can what can we do about it
well everyone and this is where it gets
to how are we going to prioritize what
we're actually doing and if you look at
the three applications so electricity
generation heating I mean all sorts of
heat both for industrial and for you
know commercial and for other other heat
applications and then transportation I
coal is is clearly the the worst in
terms of the co2 generation given the
amount of energy that it produces for
co2 emitted it is by far the worst and
should be I think our number one
priority and so work that we are doing
in order to enable solar electricity
geothermal and other
and other methods is it's very important
in addition to that transportation is
something that is sometimes overlooked
it's it's almost all petroleum if we're
in Calif in some areas it's it's a
significantly dominant player in this in
the co2 emissions it's 40% in California
for instance it's it's less in states
where which have more coal-fired power
plants and and that also I think believe
believe needs to be addressed in
addition to to where we're working with
coal efficiency it's low-hanging fruit I
mean we're in this country we're like
this big fat person you know we've been
we've gotten you know free food for a
long time and we've gotten use to it as
the the things change there are there is
low-hanging fruit that we can go after
cafe standards for instance you know
there's there's there's so much that we
can do in terms of efficiency but that
again that's just doing using the same
stuff just making it do do more than it
does today and then your alternatives
and I mean this is by no means a
complete list I'm just picking off some
some things that I think are instructive
artificial photosynthesis is something
that's being kicked around it's that's
pretty far out but that's essentially
trying to use sunlight combining it with
co2 from the atmosphere directly in some
kind of chemically controlled fashion
with novel catalysts and such in order
to to to create fuels that that's pretty
far away sequestration now sequestration
has been talked about for some time I
was just at a workshop for a D we
FutureGen it's actually called the
restructured FutureGen I don't think I
ever really want to be of associated a
program that has it would restructured
in it I mean something went wrong the
first time
but it won't be complete until 2015 and
this is supposed to be the first major
installation of carbon sequestration in
this country the targets are not
aggressive less than 50% of the energy
of the power plant can be used for for
capturing and sequestration of the co2
so that's a 50% penalty that would be
successful and capturing 80% of the co2
emitted and that would be successful and
and again the the project is not even
scheduled to be done until 2015 and
there's a there's a several year
evaluation period after that so this is
not
soon you know and and we are going to
see lots of Coal Fired power plants come
online in the next 10 years and
essentially none of them was
sequestration biofuels my not to talk
about that maybe this is good this but
there there are challenges that exist in
that area you know arable land
consumption price of food and food and
such this I want to highlight this last
one electricity for transportation so I
touched on it before if we are actually
able to take excuse me the electricity
that we use for transgenerational EE
even renewable electricity and use that
for transportation now we can now we can
tie into something where we're already
making improvements so that allows us to
take advantage of those those
improvements in in renewable electricity
generation but there are some some
issues we need better storage technology
batteries charge time capacity
reliability lifetime cost a whole slew
of issues that need to be addressed and
are being addressed in it and I trust a
trust they'll continue to improve and
then there are some applications that
lean a long haul Freight air
transportation that are just going to be
very difficult for for electricity to be
used it needs to be converted into some
other material that that has the
attributes of what we've what we know
works and what we've gotten used to
working so you know I'm good what I'm
putting forward is the idea of using
synthetic fuels so synthetic yesterday
of question
trains trains for instance yeah you can
do that now this is just in this country
it's just the capital cost associated
with putting that in putting that into
place I mean we've built up a rail
infrastructure that didn't use it
we've disassembled a lot of our rail
infrastructure because of because of
various reasons to put that into place
it's a capital intensive project and no
but there is nothing wrong with with
with with electrifying the rail network
and making use of that but there there's
a lot of infrastructure that would have
to go along with that but it but there's
you know other kinds of Freight that you
know long haul that would if you're
gonna restrict yourself just to rail
transportation that potentially could
work and I'm not discounting that but
there are other long-haul applications
that are better it's in either
inconvenient or costly in order to to
use electricity for so synthetic fuel
synthetic fuels it's been around for a
long time people kicked around this idea
for a number of years about how to how
to take electricity and convert it into
into a fuel I mean hydrogen is if a
synthetic fuel if you will if you can
electrolyze electrolyze water you can
create hydrogen that's a fuel it's not a
particularly good fuel in terms of being
able to be transported and stored and
that's and that's an issue but again
there if you know I point out that for
some applications it's gonna be
difficult to use electricity you know
there's some of the primary sources of
thermal energy in industrial use using
natural gas for instance it's going to
be difficult to use electricity to you
know electricity just doesn't convert
particularly well it's got you know
carbohydrate carbon fuels have
incredible energy density and power
delivery so this is if you calculate how
much energy is going through a gasoline
nozzle it's like 20 megawatts it's hard
to charge a battery with 20 megawatts
for instance and it's got a lot of other
attributes that we all know about this
this is a high lighting technology for
one way of doing it one way of
converting electricity to a hydrocarbon
we can electrolyze water today as I
mentioned and about about 70% energy
efficiency it's not bad converting
converting water to hydrogen you can
actually take that hydrogen you can
combine it with co2 under
some controlled process conditions which
are aren't aren't that difficult and get
a very high yield and good energy
conversion efficiency to a hydrocarbon
in this case methanol so it's about 50
percent efficient from electricity to
fuel and what I highlight here here's a
there are you know I don't know Oh
hundreds of papers that detail this
process at one level or another this is
a paper from 2000 that they did a pilot
a reactor in order to do that hydrogen
and co2 combinations some some very
basic catalysts what coppers zinc
zirconium aluminum silicon catalyst beds
and they were able to show very good
conversion this is a picture of a plant
in Trinidad that runs a very similar
process this is a process for converting
natural gas to methanol which is almost
identical process conditions and and
does it very efficiently today yes no
they do not this is assuming that you
have a have a supply of co2 so that
that's another issue that you would have
to address and what the cost of that is
so for this particular plant I mean
they're taking natural gas in there and
they're actually able to make methanol I
checked the price yesterday about a
dollar 58 in large quantities per gallon
and that's with natural gas which which
has increased recently the process for
doing this is not expensive the it's all
basically the cost comes in all in terms
of the energy that you're putting in and
in this case in the form of hydrogen and
there are other ways of converting
converting co2 to fuels they do not they
use they use a natural gas so they're
using methane right so they do they do a
they do steam reforming and then they
combine it with with a essentially water
gas shift reaction and then making it
useful so so all the energy they need is
coming in on the natural gas itself they
don't have to put in any extra energy
but but that just points out that you
know the reactor costs transportation
cost etc all of that is is basically the
same in that plant and there it still
with natural gas prices able to make
methanol pretty cheap but that's
actually if you converted on an energy
basis that's almost what we're paying
for for gasoline today
you know we're getting to the point now
where you know if the oil and natural
gas prices become too dissimilar you
could you start getting in place where
you can start arbitrage energy and you
can start converting one form into
another and it'll be interesting to see
if things like that start happening
that's the higher heating value of yeah
there is there is a shift that's true
that's right giving yeah yeah fifteen
percent is probably within the the error
that I trust most of the efficiency
numbers anyhow so you know I bet you're
right that's true it's no that's that is
that's a dollar fifty a gallon of
methanol if you wanted to convert
methanol is about half the energy
density of gasoline so you bet you
double that price you're getting about
about what gasoline but then again it's
not gasoline if you wanted there is
there are processes to convert methanol
to gasoline or it's gasoline like mint
like materials and they're they're going
to add you know maybe twenty to thirty
percent on the price of whatever you
make so that's why I say it's close as I
said this is not a new idea this is I
picked this one from George Ola Nobel
laureate at at USC and he's advocating
methanol use but he you know he there
are patents that go back three four
decades or patent that that highlight
the idea of taking carbon free or some
other kind of renewable energy
converting it into hydrogen
hydrogenating co2 in this case burning
burning the the the fuel in not
capturing the co2 but then extracting it
again from the atmosphere that this this
approach has the advantage that you
don't have to worry about mobile
emitters you can you could discharge it
at 30,000 feet you can discharge it
wherever you don't have to capture it
you use the atmosphere as your free
transportation mechanism getting it back
to your plant again so you can you can
use it this is the this comes from a
1992 paper looking at the conversion
efficiency they they actually use the
lower heating value anyhow well whatever
it's 50% efficiency and they're in there
and
and I'm not going to go through that in
a great detail now this this is an
interesting way of looking at things so
if you start talking about arbitrage in
energy part of the problem is everything
is indifferent its own units if you
start to discount the conversion
efficiencies and just look at the energy
value and what it costs in terms of all
the different sorts of energy what what
is the what does the marketplace look
like and one of the things that you
notice on here is that gasoline is
really expensive it's it's interesting
in that if we if you take a price of
three dollars and 80 cents a gallon
about 80 cents of that is for marketing
distribution profit other overhead and
about $3 of that is for the crude and
the refining so it's really not that
much overhead on top of it it's it's
it's all in the cost of the crude so
given that $3 a gallon for the
fundamental cost here it is very high
retail electricity if you take 12 cents
an hour a kilowatt hour that's about 350
a gallon of gasoline equivalent
wholesale electricity which of course
varies widely depending upon time of day
and other other factors but it but you
know $36 a megawatt hour I chose for
convenient figure we're talking we're
looking at about a dollar twenty five
gallon gasoline equivalent so the kinds
of conversion efficiencies that I was
throwing that I've thrown out about
fifty percent that that looks reasonable
even for we have today yes
it's megajoules of fuel right so Phil if
I take if I can take at 100% it's always
its terms 100% conversion efficiency for
this chart right so if I can take
electricity at wholesale and converted a
hundred percent efficiently to gasoline
I'm gonna get a dollar twenty-five you
know in terms of the cost of the energy
that's in there and then then factor in
on top of that you know capital costs
operation other kinds of operating costs
and and in efficiencies and that's going
to get used to something higher but
fundamentally you can't do any better
than that because you know this is sort
of the the lower end of what you're
gonna see but but the the the nice thing
is is that if we're looking to replace a
transportation fuel this is good news
because you know we're we got a target
that's not as hard to hit if we were
talking about replacing coal we're in
deep trouble it's 20 cents for the same
equivalent of energy I mean it's dirt
dirt cheap it's dirt it's coming out of
the ground and it is so cheap and this
is what's frightening it produces a
factors of you know two or three more
co2 than other forms of energy and it's
really inexpensive and it's the only
reason that's getting more expensive now
is because there's more demand for it
that's from 2005 no and it's and it has
not been it has not been even back then
I took it from when I I had updated this
chart for everything - except for coal I
updated natural gas wholesale from 70
cents 75 cents a therm to a dollar it's
going up recently so back when I did
this based on previous numbers it was
not it was not that yes yeah right yeah
it's it's good it's cheap and it's an
it's going to station there is some
correlation between the price of other
other energies and coal I mean you know
oil or petroleum products are used in
the manufacturer or the harvesting of
mining of coal but most of the
correlation that you see in the price of
coal and oil is just because of
competition some sources can use either
one price of oil goes up there's more
competition for coal so the price that
was naturally going up because of the
marketplace
it depends on what you're looking at if
you're looking at the general
marketplace like what the utility
company - utility company the basically
wholesale in that case what they're
actually charging each other you know in
a state of California you can actually
look at what what it what what the
wholesale price is given time of day
because the because it's regulated it is
as low as twenty dollars a megawatt hour
I'm sorry yeah that's right you can't
write it can be quite high as well right
no yeah and agreed I mean I've put up
the range here because it's there is a
range now and and to try to get the
exact number what it really costs to
generate that is a difficult figure I've
seen it I've seen a number of 50 from
every my talk at every they threw out a
number but they made again this is
highly proprietary information that you
that you're not going to get disclosed
very easily but you're right you know
and I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that
that is the number so if you're more
comfortable with with 80 then you're
gonna double this number right and then
there's some of the other other
renewable energy numbers on here as well
solar then I just threw out this number
of six dollars a watt I mean it's it's
it's certainly higher with rebates maybe
it comes down to this six in some cases
but even at six dollars a watt installed
you're still looking at something that's
about over $4 a gallon equivalent wind
is actually pretty good there's again I
don't have good numbers for wind if it's
this dollar comes from the three cent
four year for six it's it's double that
yes yes
no again right that's that's right I
mean you can't arbitrage them easily you
know easily there's always in
efficiencies and problems associated
with doing that but you're never going
to do better than that right so this is
this is the limit as to how good it can
get so in terms of in terms of scale
this is this is essentially 100
megawatts mate makes about 35,000
gallons per day and that's it that's an
interesting number because that's about
if you if you look at all the refineries
in the United States right about in the
middle is about about 30 to 40,000
gallons per day capacity there are some
very large ones that do hundreds of
thousands of gallons per day capacity
and there there are a lot of small ones
that do less than that but that's about
the middle of the pack and that and that
is essentially running about a would be
a hundred megawatts of electricity 100
megawatts of solar is something on the
order of maybe four square kilometres if
you're doing solar for others of course
nuclear is different there's there's
efficient the efficiencies I have
already went through in terms of a V
electrolysis and the hydrogenation co2
extraction is also an important factor
in here and I'll talk about that in a
little bit about what kind of costs that
that is it's associated with that so
this is this is somewhat useful but
again this is looking forward so it's
you know the numbers the numbers are
only as good as we make them those are I
made them in this case but trying to
look at what kind of price you could
actually get if you were going to try to
do that with to that technology of
technology available today and then
going into the future capital size for
electrolyzers electrolyzers actually is
that is a big area if hydrogen is
involved in the in the manufacturing
process this is this is a big
opportunity electrolyzers are enormous
if you were gonna make this so-called
medium-sized refinery it's gonna take 30
Hector's just for the electrolyzers
alone they're enormous and they could
the cost of them of course is also an
issue the operations cost is basically
the cost of the electricity plus it plus
any
it's on the unit co2 capture again I
will talk about this but but your if
you're doing atmospheric capture you're
probably going to have a fairly large
system because the concentration of co2
in the air is quite low and then and and
figuring out that the cost of that but
the bottom line is if you do looking at
current technology that's these two
columns you're gonna see about about
maybe eight to nine dollars per gallon
of gasoline equivalent for doing
something like this today and then in
the future if we were able to actually
improve the efficiency of co2 capture
improve the electrolyzer technology it's
possible we could see maybe four dollars
a gallon with profit and overhead
something like $5 a gallon fuel
something like that and so it's it's
it's it's possible and I have a list of
assumptions and if anyone's interested
in what goes into this calculation I'm
more than happy to sit down with people
and go through it and you can see that
where the strengths and the weaknesses
are and that so what what are the
challenges to doing this as I said all
the technology exists we could do this
today we know how to do every step in
the process of converting electricity to
something that looks like gasoline or
diesel fuel but what what is it really
take in order to make it a viable
alternative a commercially viable
alternative well the first and most
important thing is we need enough carbon
free I should put quotes around that
whatever free means it you know
essentially carbon free electricity in
order to run this process otherwise
we're just we're just producing co2 in
one place and then and then making a
fuel and and we're essentially doing the
same thing as coal coal gasification we
we do need electrolysis units with
improved efficiency it they have to be
more reliable maintenance cost has to be
reasonable in the capital cost half it
has to be low because electrolyzing
water today for hydrogen is is not at
the at the level it needs to be we do
need to have industrial scale capability
to convert co2 to fuel if we get the
hydrogen we need to do that now that
this I think is probably the the the low
the
easiest of all the the requirements we
know how to do it from natural gas the
process to do it from starting from co2
and hydrogen is nearly identical I think
that this is probably something which is
within within our the the reach of the
technology today alternatively we could
create processes for converting
electricity directly to the fuel you
know bypass the electrolyzer step let's
figure out how to do it directly you
know if we take co2 some electric add
allylic process for doing so there are
processes that do that today they are
not very efficient they're there they're
in their single digits at best and
selectivities are not good they tend to
make more hydrogen and they make fuel
there are a lot of people in academia
who are starting to work on that at park
we're we're looking to participate in
one of the do II requests for funding
opportunities where to actually fund
work in photoelectric photocatalysis and
Electrico Tallis's to try to look into
that but this is this is almost
certainly decades away from from even
evaluating whether it's going to be
feasible or not government policy that's
this I'm not gonna talk about this but
but incentives for carbon neutral fuels
I mean that's that's going to be
important I have not heard anyone
mentioned that transportation sector
will participate in any of the
cap-and-trade systems that have been
talked about right carbon tax is its
potential it could participate but for
cap-and-trade you know this is really
only looking at fixed installations
transportation is sort of as given it's
off the hook
and won't participate and that's a
problem if you if we want to do anything
about the transportation contribution
and finally you know where where do we
get this this this co2 and that that's a
great question you need a relatively
pure source of co2 for any conversion
process so where does it come from I get
asked a lot well there's that you know
power plants have this huge problem
they're they're they're looking to
capture the co2 and try to put it into
the ground and sequester it you know
what about if we take it if we have a
process for converting it to fuel why
don't we take it that and that may be
useful in some some short-term scenarios
but if you if you think about it in
terms of where it came from and where
it goes fossil sources of carbon have to
go back to where they came from if you
really want to maintain carbon
neutrality otherwise they're there into
the atmosphere into the environment and
they're going to stay there for a long
time so if there's a power plant which
is capturing its co2 and and then giving
it or what it or be even being paid for
it or selling I don't know what for the
to to someone who's converting it to a
transportation fuel it's going to get
burned it's gonna get bad end up in the
atmosphere government policy will
eventually not favor the program like
that because if they're if someone's
getting credit for this carbon and then
it's you know as a captured carbon and
then it ends up in the atmosphere
something's wrong you know you can't get
paid for the same thing twice or paid to
do something that you end up not doing
so government policy is at some point
going to fight figure out that there's a
problem there and that and that's going
to be an issue you know if a if a power
plant gets paid to capture and sequester
the co2 and then gives it to you and
says I have to forfeit my capture credit
that that's not going to work
atmospheric captured now this this
actually is something that is that it's
not talked about nearly enough this this
is this is an opportunity I believe
where we can actually see some dramatic
improvement in solar electricity
utilization for fuel the thermodynamic
minimum energy required for carbon
capture is tiny it's about 20 kilojoules
per mole it's a fraction of a penny for
millijoules or equivalently a pennies
per gallon so doing it doing it close to
the theoretical limit or even some you
know an order of magnitude above the
theoretical limit still is not
contributing much to the eventual cost
of fuel how can how can you get it this
is this is a good question nobody really
does this today because co2 is
essentially worthless no one no one
tries to extract dirt from the ground
you know no one develops technology for
such things but it can be done
NASA does it the Navy does it for
submarines they try to take co2 out of
the cabin atmosphere because it's toxic
and they need to get rid of it but
they're willing to pay a lot more in
those applications in this case we're
not but there are ways of doing it you
can
do it cryogenically you can you can cool
air down to the point that the officio
two condenses you there kept many
chemical methods for scrubbing
electrochemical methods for for
scrubbing as well and they all have
their strengths and weaknesses and and
my diamonds the vast majority the the
biggest weakness is that they're energy
intensive they take a lot of energy and
would add too much cost to the the price
cryogenic is fun to look at it turns out
if you get down to minus 40 C 140 C you
can condense it coal this place in the
world of ever mentioned measured was
minus 90 I was thought about if you just
find a place you could do it in
Antarctica and maybe that'd be kind of
cool but no pun it doesn't make sense
he's still going to be energy yeah any
problem of energy chemical extraction
works that's how people generally do it
today if you want to get co2 out of air
you can use chemicals like calcium
hydroxides or other or carbonates or
such and you can actually extract it the
problem is it's in very energy-intensive
usually you've got a the the absorbent
bed you got to heat it back up again to
crack it and get the co2 back out very
expensive sometimes they pump on it they
pressurize it on one side and they pump
on the other this is how natural gas is
purified a lot of the times because it
has a lot of co2 in it
electrochemical concentration nASA has
done this so does the Navy it's actually
much more efficient but much less
reliable because it's it's an aqueous
process and the membranes tend to dry
out and if they dry out they're dead and
then you you know it's it's a very long
service call up to the space station so
they can't they don't want to do that
they're willing to actually just pay
more money to buy something that's
reliable even if it costs a lot more in
terms of energy but that's something
that I think has some promise for
terrestrial applications if energy it
cost is what's important so let me let
me get to a little bit of what we've
done at park we don't have we don't have
a government or otherwise fun a funded
program to do this so this is something
that we've done as a smaller scale as
I've done it in in my group as an intern
project a couple times in order to look
at this to see can we use modern methods
to do very efficient co2 extraction you
know try to try to address that that leg
of the of the stool holding up
this the this technology of synthetic
fuels electrochemical extraction is one
of the methods that we could do in the
lab it's scalable and it's fairly easy
to construct what I show here is just
the the general idea this is a
upper-left here is a plot of the the
solubility of co2 as a function of pH if
you can create a membrane that sort of
rides up and down this curve one side
it's a more basic than the other you can
actually generate something a membrane
that has sort of differential solubility
you can make a pump that will that will
actually pump co2 across that's actually
what a fuel cell does a fuel cell
essentially runs a more basic on the
cathode side and more acidic although
it's still basic it's more it's it's
less so it's more bate more acidic on
the the anode and it will naturally pump
co2 across it this has been done the
papers that have done this many years
ago they weren't really worried about
efficiency getting up to more modern
levels of efficiency in terms of the in
terms of the current utilization or
Faraday efficiency could get you down to
energy consumption which actually makes
sense you could actually do this in a
way that that was cost-effective for
fuels so we create we built a cell in
our in our lab so the little silver
singing and toward the middle of the
bottom middle here is the fuel cell the
rest of the equipment is just analyzers
humidifiers to check the humidity
sensitivity of the process and and and
then you know just data acquisition etc
we synthesize our own air so we can
control all the different compositions
it's essentially a fuel cell I'm not
going to go into the technology too much
except to say that it uses traditional
gas diffusion layers and membranes for
doing the electrochemistry but the key
here is we're trying to optimize the
system so it conducts carbon carbon
containing species and not anything else
if it's most fuel cells actually have
our proton conductors and that's fine
for for fuel cell applications are what
we're actually trying to optimize though
is that the the carbon carrying
capability of the system in order to be
to extract
co2 from from air in order to do that
we're looking at different membrane
materials polymer materials carbon
carbonate electrolytes room temperature
ionic liquids it's a new class of
material that had that is very
interesting for electrochemistry
essentially zero vapor pressure so we
may not require any humidification we
don't to worry about solvent loss pH
buffered membranes because remember
we're trying to you know we're
essentially running this because we're
you know we're controlling the pH across
the membrane itself to help with that we
one of the one of the materials that we
have used is a traditional iron exchange
membranes these are used for in in
industry scale for water purification
desalination some manufacturing
processes we were we were able to see
efficiencies as high as about twenty
twenty five percent for atmospheric
conditions and that's and that's
reasonable I mean the literature values
for efficiency for where previously
we're in the single digits
so we by using more modern materials
we're getting we're getting to some more
interesting levels we really want to be
up close to a hundred percent to make it
energy-efficient the kind of removal
rates that we can get depending upon the
conditions is anywhere from fifteen to
twenty five percent of the incoming co2
can be extracted at reasonable rates
this is for for us of course a small
membrane in our lab and this is this is
sort of the native state of the state of
affairs in our lab right now what we can
do we're doing somewhere around forty
percent efficient extraction of co2 so
again we're about or maybe about a
factor of four or five higher than the
previous literature values so we have
improved the efficiency of extraction
we're getting close to the point where
we might be able to to see something
that is you know if this were scaled and
could maintain the efficiency levels
that we're seeing here it might actually
be cost-effective we'd probably be
talking about something on the order of
just in terms of energy consumption
maybe about fifty cents per gallon added
costs to the price of fuel if we use
this technology but III think we're
still we're still a ways away from where
we want to be just to let you know it
seems like we're hitting a plateau it's
you know we're gonna need some kind of
breakthrough to get higher than this so
one of the one of the things that we're
we're looking at is alternate
technologies that might even be more
energy efficient
this is thanks to John Fitch down here
at the bottom corner John helped me make
this for a deal we proposal just before
shortly before he came here but this
would be using an idea of electro
dialysis electro dialysis is a very
efficient way of extracting ions from
solution it turns out that there are
ways of extracting co2 even from air
using aqueous carbonates the problem has
always been regenerating that solution
once the co2 is captured dialysis is
something that hasn't been looked at
there's one paper I have found on
someone that's looked into this and
there are a couple there are a couple
fundamental problems but actually I
believe there and they are not well like
a fundamental was the wrong word there
are two problems that were noticed in
this they're not fundamental and it can
be addressed with some improvements in
in the design and operation and I
believe that this could could get us to
the the energy efficiencies that we need
in order to work I don't want to talk
too much about dialysis it's it's used
in a lot of industries for for
acidifying solutions or in recovering
acid wastes and base wastes and things
like that it's it's it's a well known
technology it's just never been used on
a scale that we're talking about here
and and in applications where energy
efficiency is so critical but the bottom
line is you know if we are able to to
run them in ways that have been
demonstrated from in the literature but
and be able to scale that for this
application we're looking at like 30 to
50 kilojoules per mole and that that's
only a factor of two or three higher
than the theoretical limit and that's
that would enable this technology to be
used for atmospheric capture and then
potentially for fuels so this is the
this is the last slide I have in the
main presentation you know what's what
what do we need to do again this is for
transportation fuels primarily I mean
we've talked about efficiencies what
we're what we really need to do to
address the problem that I think is
hanging out there
with coal and and as a source of energy
but for fuels co2 in the area of co2
capture we need to get higher
selectivity than what we're getting
right now improved rates so basically
this all feeds into efficiency we need
to get better efficiency and and it's
possible that that catalysts and buffer
materials may work alternatively elect
electrodialysis as I mentioned at the
end I think is a really exciting
technology and one that were that were
actively trying to engage partners and
and funding agencies to go after to
develop for this application fuels
electrolysis is a huge opportunity
there's it's just amazing how little
little energy has been expended in that
that I mean the if you look at the
commercial electrolyzers they don't
produce a lot of hydrogen and they are
they're like two meters tall eight
meters long and and and they they
consume that and their and their capital
intensive as well alternatively I think
electro catalysis and photo cassette
tells us directly taking the co2
reacting it and you know you know in an
electrochemical potential or
photochemical and directly converting it
is is likely to be important but but
again that's pretty far off we know how
to do this being able to scale this up
is something that I think could could
meet it meet the time horizon that we're
looking at it and better okay so that's
it thanks for all your attention back
yeah it we have actually and there is a
lot in the oceans it's true but the the
concentration is such that it actually
it's almost as energy intensive to take
it out of the ocean as it is to take it
out of out of the air the other thing is
that is that depending upon where you're
getting your energy you really would
like the capture facility to be
co-located with what it where the energy
is being generated so that you can
create the fuel the easiest thing to
ship around is the fuel we actually we
know how to do that we've got
infrastructure for shipping fuel so so
we want to really be if it's solar we
want to be in the middle of the Mojave
Desert right you know the the solar
facility there that if there's co2
capture facility there
everything's co-located solar actually
is interesting because it has the
advantage that that for electrolysis you
never have to use the inverter right you
can just do DC to DC conversions there
are actually efficiencies in using
utilizing solar for this application
which are really interesting and then
and that's what you'd like to co-locate
but yeah it's funny the Navy has a lot
of patents in that area where they're
looking at trying to actually make fuel
on board an aircraft carrier for
instance you know extract co2 from the
ocean but when you look at the how
difficulty how difficult it is in terms
of energy and such it's it's not much of
an advantage to do it from the ocean
right you you could you could and you
yeah it doesn't really make a lot of
well it really is just a numbers well a
numbers game in terms of what's it worth
right
how much is somebody going to pay for me
to take this co2 and put it into the
earth and sequester war yeah even if
there was you know the dialysis you know
the potential for being the best even
those numbers look like it's probably oh
you know just for the capturing and
pressurization more than what you're
getting today like you know forty fifty
sixty dollars per per ton or something
like that yeah yeah and now and those
and those you know I'll be honest if
those numbers are you know pretty
aggressive when you're talking about
doing you know factor of two or three
better than thermodynamic limit you know
you're you're you're pretty good you'll
be hearing about me if I'm able to do
that I think you know so let's try over
here yeah yes yes yeah yeah
yeah yeah they're right even but so I'm
no expert in the it's really almost
Chemical Engineering right of the the
heat flow and the efficiencies involved
in doing that we do have well okay
right yeah yeah we have had someone
looking at look into that a little a
little bit and we we did the analysis
for something closer to two room
temperature in a temperate climate right
and what that energy would be consumed
and and what would be lost during using
what kind of inefficiencies you might
get that didn't look too good we could
take another look at it you know III
would love to think about something like
that but it but you're talking about
there your limited just by the
inefficiencies in the system right what
is the inefficiency and because that's
where you're going to be losing all of
the all of your energy in the
consumption of that up that's right yeah
exactly but you know you're still
talking well in the imitate in the in
the the case I mean I was being sort of
facetious I suppose but you know
building at Antarctica you're talking 50
degrees in any place that you're really
you know thinking about doing this
you're talking about you know hundreds
of hundreds hundreds m per ature
difference that you're having to heat
and cool and any little inefficiency in
that system could really kill you if
you're talking about only extracting
that small bit of co2 out of a very
large volume of air one thing I didn't
mention if you know for the for the
refinery size scale installation in
order to get as much carbon out of the
atmosphere in order to generate tens of
thousands of gallons of fuel you're
processing something on the order of
like two or three cubic miles of air
every day so any little enough
inefficiency in a system like that will
kill you
it's dominated by the cost of
electricity for sure maybe you and I if
you're interested I can go over it with
you but even even if you're looking at
some fairly aggressive price targets
like $30 per megawatt hour for
electricity
you're still pretty much dominated it's
the majority player in even in that
situation but then the capital cost is
getting substantial and and for the
future cost I was projecting of like
three or four dollars $5 per gallon
that's assuming some pretty substantial
improvements in terms of the cost per
per unit area of some of the membranes
that are used for separation or for the
for the cost of the electrolyzers for
the cost of the electrolyzers I used
some de the goals for their their
projects they're running as part of the
hydrogen economy and those are
aggressive as well
well yeah you could yeah that's that's
another potential right yeah you could
you could also do that it has to play
into government policy because that's
going to be very important so whatever
whatever
I mean if rational government policy you
just have to think about does this make
sense I'm not gonna irrational
government policy you yeah you just
don't you don't know what it what's
gonna make sense yes no it is not it's
logarithmic because it's based upon the
Gibbs free energy of mixing and so
that's based upon the the the ratio the
logarithm of the pressure difference so
if you if you double the the pressure
the incoming partial pressure of the co2
then you've really only improved by what
log of log of 2 or so it's it's it's a
it doesn't really benefit you a lot it's
almost as hard to capture the the co2
from a power plant the exhaust which is
like you know 3 to 15% as it is to take
it from the air except for the practical
considerations such as you're just
processing a lot more volume of gas
yeah if it might it might address some
of the practical issues like for
instance water loss some of the methods
of capture er aqueous based and so a
water loss is a big deal so if you can
reduce the volume of air that you're
processing by a factor of two that's
that could be a big deal because some of
the costs are linearly related to the
volume of air that you're processing
while even though the efficiency itself
may not may not improve that much yeah
absolutely know those when you can
piggyback on something that you're doing
already now now things change now you
can start making a cost effective even
today that's one the I guess the problem
in that case is that you're just not
processing enough air right
another right we actually had one of the
one of the interns have worked on this
came up with I think a great idea one
technology that's being discussed in
order to to handle some of the day/night
issues associated with a peak energy is
cute forgetting the word it's yeah
compressed air energy storage right
you're actually using underground you
know caverns and such in order to
compress it well if you're processing
that much air and compressing it already
you're doing a pressure swing on it
every day and by doing that you take out
the co2 it doesn't cost you anything
incremental cost of co2 extraction in
that case it's minimal and and you are
processing maybe not a cubic mile but
some substantial fraction of that
everyday if you're gonna do that in
there and there's that's a good
opportunity well they are they are they
are I mean even the ones that are that
are going today are talking about yeah
even the ones going today are in the
hundreds of hundreds if not thousands I
that's right that's right the problem of
course is it's just not enough developed
underground capacity for it right now
the one that the one in Ohio or they
keep threatening to build it but I don't
see anything yeah I can't let me just
before you the other one I can come in
on that yeah I agree it really almost
put in a slide here on idealism and I
think that it there's something in the
core of my nature that bothers me about
working on that but I agree I mean I
have a similar response to sequestration
I think that as it for a temporary
solution it's it's it's it's a very
laudable thing to be working on but I
have a fundamental problem with with
this you know at some level but I think
it's important you know it's you know if
that's the technology that's gonna come
online first
you know sequester everything I you know
that's that's I think there's no
alternative in that case but you're
right if you can reuse the carbon and I
atom twice and we reuse it once use it
once and then and then use it again and
and then it just you know forestall you
using petroleum or whatever yeah you're
you're correct that's variable and
certainly the marketplace will dictate
that you know that if if they can get
the co2 essentially for free from a
power plant and and then use it for that
that's the way to go why why suck it out
of the air when someone can give it to
you pure for free
yeah I am I am I am this give me an
opportunity to talk about this field
this field is filled with Kooks now I'm
not saying Klaus is a kook
alright that was being recorded on I
think that he's done a lot to this in
this environment but there are you know
I I'm I'm my coop too I think in this
case you know there are a lot of people
in here that that like myself and like
Klaus that whose backgrounds are
actually not in this I mean I think that
we come into this and and we try to self
educate ourselves in these areas and we
have what we have but we have a long way
to go I guess that's what we're I'm
really going with this we have a we all
have a long way to go in this in this
environment and so that that's that's I
think the the thing that that Klaus and
his company is suffering from is that
they're they're technologies that
they've put forward there's a lot of
background work in the field that they
are they are either reinventing the
wheel or or or you know running into
problems that have been run into before
and not solved and and and maybe there
are fundamental reasons whether or not
solve his technology is in a way is
interesting it's just energy intensive
he actually has proposed doing dialysis
but but doing it in a way that isn't
very energy efficient and is essentially
the energy consumption and dialysis is
related to what pH delt difference
you're going from if you're trying to
take a basic solution with carbonate in
it and then acidifying it to get the co2
out you know just like you know baking
soda and water kind of thing to get the
bubble to co2 out if you go from like pH
14 very basic to pH zero you're
expending a lot of energy you know
essentially one you know 1.2 electron
volts per per mole per per atom or
molecule in order to get it out and
that's essentially what what you run
into with some of the dialysis
techniques that they've been proposing
what we're we're looking at here is
managing the pH in a way that is is able
to to get around the energy expenditures
in a process like that I will say though
that his that being the initial
technology that they were proposing
which was I believe
using metal hydroxides and then actually
cracking them thermally has been I think
that's been abandoned I don't think
they're doing that because that that
clearly was had a huge energy problem
and so they have made some progress but
you know when when when people like you
know BP and and and folks like that
start getting involved instead of people
like me and Klaus and then I'll know
that we're getting somewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
