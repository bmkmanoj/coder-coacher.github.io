McCulloch and also Thomas Hart Ono and
the three of us have been humanitarians
as we call ourselves for working on this
technology called Ouma user managed to
access and so just a little bit about us
and the hats we wear Thomas is the Ummah
working group spec editor so he's been
working on our protocol specs I've been
a founding and it's chair since its
inception my other hat is that I'm a
Forrester Research principal analyst
serving security and risk professionals
and ma che has been involved in
Newcastle University efforts along these
lines and he's now at Google as an
intern working along these lines and
we're going to share a lot with you
about kind of a new wave of access
management we also tweet at WG if you
want to follow us and get news that way
so oh the other thing is that we are
starting to do some tweet chats and
we've got our second one coming up on
March 14th so if you follow hash Uma
chat on March 14th for an hour we'll
we'll distribute these slides in PDF
form and they all have links throughout
them so that you can click it and learn
and whatever you want but we hope that
you join us for the tweet chat so we
thought we'd just take a very simple
approach today
to what uma is all about what is uma to
show you some demos give you some
reasons why you might want to consider
uma Nate uma enabling apps and various
Google functions in fact and we're happy
to take questions and offer answers and
offer you questions in return pretty
much at any time we'll just make this
interactive right okay so before we
actually talk about what user managed
accesses we thought we'd talk to you a
little bit about the street identity
project which is something that Google
is involved in and demonstrates a user
authorized way of sharing information
that's trusted about that user with apps
that the user wants to use and it's
basically an OAuth enabled solution and
when I just bring up matcha to talk a
little bit about Street identity into a
demo so hello everyone thanks for
joining so I'll show a simple demo that
shows how Street identities house
specific use case and we'll then try to
show how OMA
well tries to solve a more generic use
case so in street identity the main idea
is to allow an application and retrieve
some information about a user some
verified information that can be stored
not at Google now that the actually not
at the identity provider but rather at
the attribute provider so we'll show a
demo how Google facilitates the process
how it facilitates how it enables the RP
to easily get access to information
about the user in a very secure way so I
think we can switch okay so since it
works let's take a look at the ad
assignment process to an example web
application so we're currently want to
log in as a using our Google account to
a specific RP so we go to the RP we see
the sign-in button we click on sign in
yeah we select the account and actually
the RP right now asks for some
permissions so it's a typical open ID
connect flow this is the approval page
where I need to consent that the RP will
be able to get access to my basic
information it will have access to my
email but it also will be able to view
my verified street address information
and this is something that's new in this
flow I allow access and well I get
logged in this is the user info this is
the information that the RP gets so
there's nothing new in in this
particular flow but if we go to another
application that possibly has some
interesting data about myself or can
have some interesting data about myself
we log into this application and we see
that there's a new permission that we
can grant to this application which is
view and manage my verified street
address information so as a user I allow
this interaction to happen and I see
that
well this application already for
example has my very
right street address I save it to Google
and the next time I go to the RP I'll
select the account and I basically for
example get access to some sort of a
premium service because not only that
DRP get access sorry get information
about the user but it also got
information about the address so we've
got some sort of a verified address from
the AP that it knows if I go to Google
so there's some sort of a console and if
I log into the console I can actually
see that Google does remember my
verified address it doesn't sorry it
only remembers the pointer to this
address so it doesn't hold the address
per se which means that well there are
there's little privacy implications in
these terms so it only holds a pointer
and even RP wants to login
it wants to log me if I want to log into
the RP than the RP only gets
authorization to access a specific
attribute from an attribute provider and
this is a very let's say specific use
case so enabling to get access to a
verified information it looks like all
of it doesn't let's say necessarily
change the user experience and we can go
and see how this is not enough in the M
now so Google is our only acting as a
sort of broker so it does not attach the
trust it only gives the RP information
that there is some sort of a verified
information and where this location is
located where does where this
information is located and it's up to
the RP to obtain some sort of a token
and this is where Google comes in it
grants this token to the RP the RP can
later go to the actual application that
holds the data so the data resides in a
single location it doesn't get
registered to Google it's only just
yes yeah the RP has to be willing to
accept the issuer of that trusted Wall
Street address in order to proceed no
it's it's mostly just relying on Google
to broker the users authorization of
sharing the information so the Google is
functioning as the kind of the
authorization broker and the attribute
provider is functioning as the issuer of
trusted information you know and the
consequence of this is really I think
kind of huge because for a long long
time people have worked on a conceptual
model where you have an identity
provider you have relying parties you
have attribute providers that are kind
of supposed to be first-class citizens
but we've never come up with a suitably
internet scale solution for how to
actually broker the providing of that
information and so this is an example of
it working with simple simple things you
can find about the home like oh oh off
and open ID connect and obviously
agreements that the RP would would trust
I think is in this case it's I don't
know what the what the provider is but I
know that Google is working with Verizon
business and others who have that kind
of information because they send bills
to real street addresses nope it has to
trust is the extent that the user works
through Google to say yes it's okay for
you to know this and that's it yep the
user has to trust it yes the nature of
trusted attributes is that they
effectively function as reputation data
right so let's say you know user can't
choose their own credit score but if
they need to provide a credit score to a
third party you can imagine them working
through Google say to tell Equifax yes
it's okay - there the credit score you
know about me with this third party that
needs it because I'm doing a mortgage
loan application so the nature of
trusted attributes is that they're third
parties supplied and not user supplied
because yeah yeah I mean what's
interesting about that is that you know
if there are multiple issuers that a
relying party will trust
a piece of information and the user now
that you start to have an echo system
you start have a market and where those
data that data comes from but it's still
driven by who trusts the data that's
right that's right
so I think we've established have you
plugged me in again so that's a picture
of street identity which is using again
o auth and open ID connect and a notion
of claims that you know identity claims
that are identifiable in some fashion
that you could ask for and get and then
judge whether they're good they've been
signed by the right provider that gets
you thus far and no further
one thing we've learned is that privacy
is obviously not secrecy privacy should
be about selective sharing and I always
think of like you know if you go to the
doctor because you've got this terrible
problem with a wart if you don't tell
them about the wart and where it is you
can't get your problem solved so it's
not about not sharing at all there's
this wonderful quote this is actually
from some years ago a paper by an Kovu
Kian who's a privacy commissioner in
Canada was very influential and she had
this wonderful quote from this privacy
in the clouds paper about all the kinds
of things you should be assured to know
if you're gonna have to share
information you should know how it's
going to be used and who it's going to
and what purpose it's gonna serve and
all those things and what folks were
working on uma believe is that's all
great but we know that there's something
not very empowering about mere consent
and what we want to do when in kabuki
and says determine how the data will be
used and so on we want to use the other
sense of determine which is have control
over and that's what we're actually
going for with uma which sounds like you
know that's a lot to bite off we've
actually made quite a bit of progress
though and that's what we're here to
show you so the price for sharing and
access is really too high and there's
three different problems we see over and
over one one problem that we see the
future version one problem that we see
is that we have to provision a lot of
data about ourselves directly into say a
local account somewhere that we want to
set up
at a some web web 2.0 vide or whatever
it is so we're typing in data and we
like to describe the problems there is
two one is you're typing it in by hand
annoying type time-consuming prone to
lying if we don't feel like doing all
that and by value which means the the
data goes stale there's thousands and
millions of CRM systems that work in the
world that specialize in holding data
about us that they think is very
valuable but it's not particularly
because to the extent that it's volatile
it loses value second problem is okay
we've got Olaf in the picture and by
consenting to have you know the
client-side connect with the server-side
on our behalf using some API maybe
scoped you know to some degree we tend
to be installing fairly large pipelines
and this is a fake example of you know
installing the Kanye West connection
where the Kanye West app is going to
kill your children and it's like allow
or deny well you know if you deny you
don't get whatever the great Kanye West
services that's that's the dilemma that
a lot of people are faced with the third
problem is that when we do share
selectively we've got some interesting
examples provided by for example Google
Calendar where we share between friends
and family it's a royal pain and it's
not very secure so we have ways of doing
sort of friends and family lists you
look at Flickr for example and it's got
it does have friends and family kind of
built-in Ackles that you can populate
the way that you're sharing with them
typically involves a secret URL well
that works for data that's not very
sensitive it doesn't work for let's say
health data or tax data it's just sort
of not good enough security security by
obscurity so now let me introduce you to
oh ma uma is a web protocol that is
designed to let you control access
emphasis on control not just consent to
access by anyone to all your online
stuff from one place it's a it's
actually a set of exactly one draft spec
at the moment we've gotten boiled it
down to an uma Cora spec doesn't have
any encumbrances on it as far as we know
it's undergoing multiple implementation
efforts and ma she's going to share with
us several of those today
it's currently doing its work under the
Qatar initiative kind of incubating it
there and we've been submitting IETF
internet drafts as we go with the hope
that that work will get picked up either
by the OAuth group and a kind of next
effort or by maybe a different group
we're not really sure yet but we're
being completely open about this we have
design principles that talk about being
explicitly OAuth base to the extent
possible for its technical value and
also for its kind of a mental value to
be honest with you we have goals of
being as restful as possible to be
generative in terms of allowing for and
then you know unexpected reuse in the
future and that that's a link there you
can see that Thomas Howard Jonah's name
is ensconced in the name of our ID and
we're just entering into a kind of
virtual Interop testing phase so we're
getting to the point where we have
enough implementations of each of our
entities in the protocol to test against
each other and see how it goes so what
could you do with the street identity
use case if it were luma enabled you
know a lot of people said to us well why
are you doing is Uma thing when OS right
there and we'd like go off we're using
OAuth quite a lot we're actually
embedding it in several places in our
protocol but here are things that you
may want to do when it comes to true
access management that you can't do with
a self authorizing function that OAuth
provides number one centralized how you
manage sharing your street address and
whatever other data content API is
access to your services that could be
hosted in a lot of different places so
centralized authorization hub is one
second you may not want to share your
address with an app you're using that's
separate from the app that holds your
address you may want to share that
street address with somebody else
entirely
like we talked about Alice to Bob
sharing as opposed to Alice - Alice so
the street identity demo you saw was
Alice sharing with herself or any one
person sharing with themselves using
another app one of the ways to describe
both is it's letting two apps talk to
each other about you when you're not
present they're doing on your behalf so
we're talking about Alice to Bob sharing
Alice to employer sharing Alice to bank
sharing maybe even Alice to government
sharing if we get this right so that's
another benefit
third thing is by virtue of the way that
we control sharing with policies that
drive how the authorization hub kind of
acts as your authorization power of
attorney you don't have to be present to
win and that is to say if you want to
share with Bob Bob can come along prove
what he needs to prove to show that he's
suitable to deserve authorization for
access and you don't have to be present
you can be sleeping you can be in an
emergency room you can be windsurfing
whatever finally because we're now
putting a person in the position of
offering to the world data and API
access products if you will you now have
a different role in sharing it's no
longer a matter of the apps work it out
ahead of time and you have to consent
now it's you getting to CERN to set
policy which might include things like
legal contractual constraints so you're
in a position not of accepting an offer
but making an offer of access so just
like when you go to a site and it says
click I agree if you want to use the
site we want to flip the tables and if
somebody wants access to your stuff even
if it's a big company maybe they should
click I agree so I want to bring Thomas
up here to talk a little bit about some
of the use cases that we have been
gathering so you want to talk a little
bit bit about project age data in some
other use cases so the the healthcare
use case is actually very popular we
hear it all the time just to illustrate
you know and a good example we had a
visitor at MIT from Australia this is
John zyk he was scheduled to come to
visit us some months he had to go to
conference in Mexico he did he got sick
he got so sick that by the time he
landed in Florida he had to be
hospitalized for seven days and he
actually never made it to see us up in
Boston so the dilemma was that I mean he
could sit there in a you know with the
laptop and so on but the the doctor in
the emergency center in Florida needed
access to his data back in Australia you
know his PCP
a physician and a couple of specialists
in in in Sydney Australia so you know
we've got the situation where he needed
to explicitly give permission to those
three guys in Australia to release data
to hospital and the selected specialists
in Florida right so this is this is what
that that case is is that diagram is
referring to the other use case that
we're hearing what I could call the dot
dot e-d-u use case is that it's actually
to give you a real example at MIT
we've just had this very successful
mobile app competition basically we're
taking people who have zero programming
experience giving them three weeks to
write an app either for Android or for
iPhone and and we've got some pretty
cool you know examples like you know
fine free food meaning that you know
fine an event on campus that's big
enough event that you know they'll have
a table with with free food and and
direct me there so that I can on my way
to my lecture I can grab you know a
sandwich and go to my lecture that's
that's got some security implications
like you know you could turn that into a
what is it they young a problematic
scenario but the yeah yeah so so so so
so we've got a growing number of apps
being developed and for each one of
those cases you know the students have
had to go through difficulty in getting
access to data so for example if they
want to access maps of buildings that
have to talk to the facilities people
and so on and so on so MIT and other
universities as kind of slowly moving to
this Web API model whereby you you have
all this in a uniform API out there and
depending on who you are you can access
data behind those api's but you need
some access control regime installed
that would allow you to allow the data
owners particularly MIT itself to
regulate access to the data so that's
that's the students accessing MIT data
if you reverse that again you have cases
where a student might want to give
selected information about their scores
at MIT to perspective
you know input employers you know in a
hiring season they want you know they
want to do that
another one that we heard recently is
there's actually project being put
through internet to is a student that's
gonna enroll it's gonna try to apply to
five different universities creates an
account on the college board and then he
or she would like to have selected
portions of this SAT scores available
through these universities for a limited
amount of time so the user is actually
four actively saying yes you know MIT
can see this Stanford can see this Yale
can see this and so on and it's going to
be up there you know the token the OAuth
token is going to be you know valid for
like a week so that's that's the you and
it's actually that that second case is
actually a real use case that is there's
being written up as a as a grant
proposal and you know it's when I heard
it the first time said gee you know in
you know street identity technology is
kind of needed here and on top of that
you know do something more complicated
than just sharing SAT scores is also
needed particularly for the the first
edu use case where you're actually
sharing real data we believe you know
uma is is is is a perfect fit so so just
just to put a little color on that so
what we're hearing is we've got
individual use cases truly user managed
access to data offering that access to
others so that we don't have to have a
login to every system and be present to
authorize we're also hearing what I
would call enterprise class use cases
you know enterprises have long had these
access management models that basically
you know constrain access and you have a
subject and a verb and an object and you
make policies and you do all these
things what we're doing is a very
lightweight user reachable method of
same and we're finding a lot of folks
saying you know I could use that in the
enterprise like let's say I want to use
a bunch of cloud services but I want
those cloud services to they're hosting
data and services on the behalf of this
company and its employees I want it to
call back actually to get authorization
decisions from some
authorization hub that I dictate so
those are some of these cases we're
seeing so let's talk a little bit about
technical details we'll start to drill
down and we'll show you a demo and you
know ask questions or push back whenever
you feel like it so this is a sort of
classic uma architecture diagram for us
we've had it for a couple of years now
and so you've got an authorizing user at
the top who is controlling access
through an authorization manager as a
kind of proxy I said you know kind of
power of attorney for the user
protecting any number of protected
resources at hosts and those resources
can be its Web API soar just URLs and
take you to HTML whatever it is or maybe
its identity claims and so the user will
be managing that information as they
would if it's photos they're protecting
that's the photo site that they like to
manage their stuff at and then you've
got requesters now you may be saying
well this looks an awful lot like the
OAuth participants the participants in
the OAuth dance and you'd be right so
what you're looking at really is a
slightly more formalized model where
you've got enhanced versions of the
OAuth resource owner that's our
authorizing user you've got an enhanced
notion of a resource server that's our
host an enhanced notion of an
authorization server which is what we
call the authorization manager before
they came up with that name when they
did wrap an OAuth 2 and finally a
requester which is a kind of enhanced
client now who's that guy at the bottom
right the requesting party why do we
need him well when you're sharing with
arbitrary third parties oh I've got away
with not worrying about legal liability
because it's Alice on both ends alice is
permissioning access on Alice's behalf
when it's on Bob's behalf well maybe Bob
is taking on some liability and you want
to make that enforceable so that if in
effect that person is clicking I agree
or that organization is clicking I agree
or maybe maybe they're agreeing to keep
this information under embargo or under
NDA or maybe they're agreeing maybe they
have supplied you a receipt for five
dollars that they've paid for this
information you want to know that you
can sue them if something goes wrong so
we needed this model we have a trust
model that takes into account not just
the technical layer but this kind of
liability layer now of course Oh auth
doesn't say a thing about how the
asme RS the resource server and the
authorization server interact so we had
to solve that we had to go there we had
to sort of figure out how to make them
interoperable because we're centralizing
the authorization server function and so
what we've done is we've defined a
protection API that the authorization
manager presents to any host and guess
what it's protected by this API it's
protected by OAuth so we have an
embedded instance of OAuth that allows
all these hosts to get introduced to the
authorization manager and do things that
that protection API wielding their hosts
access token which is just straight
OAuth with me we found a lot of interest
among some authors just because they've
wanted to separate these functions and
currently they're proprietary and you do
see a lot of deployments where you'll
have a bunch of resource servers all
calling back proprietarily to one
authorization server you know in the
back office like AOL might have a
hundred apps I mean you guys have the
sort of the same situation you're gonna
want your security token service your
authorization server to be more
centralized and people tend to deploy it
that way and they've got some kind of
proprietary stuff we made it
standardized now when it comes to the
actual act of requesting access Booma
couldn't use OAuth as written to solve
the problem of not just oh we've got
this API we have developer documentation
we design scopes that sort of go with
the API endpoints but you have to look
it up it's not machine readable we kind
of had to make that all machine readable
and we had to prepare for it not just
something like one or a few endpoints
what if you had a thousand photos and
photo albums that you want to protect a
lot kind of doesn't scale for that so we
went in a slightly different direction
and what we have is it's more of a
formalized token upgrade approach to
adding permissions for some requester so
if a requesters is you know approaching
some host to get access to something
that Alice controls she's got lots of
stuff there she controls that requester
can go back again and again and prove
that they're suitable for access to more
than just maybe one endpoint or whatever
it is maybe it's the next thousand
photos
this is just a bit of a summary and you
know the PDF will be available if you
care to stare at this but we've been
finding it pretty useful to convey the
the similarities and the differences
between Roth and open ID connect and uma
in this fashion so really briefly I mean
oh ah that's kind of the the core
technology for all three and uma
actually exploits open ID Connect as an
option for how does Alice write a policy
that that actually says Bob at gmail is
the only one who can get access to this
calendar well bob has to prove that he
owns Bob at gmail guess what open ID
Connect does that so we use it for that
purpose and we'll see a demo of that so
a couple of quick comparisons if you're
not very familiar with open ID connect
what it adds - oh ah is that it is a
single sign-on and identity and
attribute sharing API that's meant to
have a login session semantics on top of
OAuth the rest of these comparisons are
with uma and o'a so I can't actually see
it very well so this this is you know
I've been saying Alice - Alice sharing
is Roth's
wheelhouse and open ID connects
wheelhouse and uma goes Alice to Bob
Alice to Starr if you will
next is the the model by which you
engage in privacy enhanced interactions
it's not just a matter of consenting at
runtime it's a matter of setting up
policies which means that you're a more
empowered offeror of data and service
access so that's actually a very big
conceptual switch and it's also a switch
in the way the protocol works in oo-ahh
than an open ID Connect you kind of have
to assume that the authorization server
is local to all the resource servers you
care about because its proprietary uma
has gone and and defined that that that
separation between the two servers and
also a way to introduce one to the other
so that you can centralize it which is
big-oh auth of course works by its
really authorization by authentication
proxy right you know if an authenticated
client
comes approaches the the protected
resource and a user that the protected
resource knows says it's okay you let
them in there's no opportunity for doing
true claims based authorization by
virtue of the separations that we've
made and the way that you set up
policies an authenticated identity is
just one kind of claim you can ask the
requester to wield or prove to win
permission for access this is something
I actually thought I'd never see in my
lifetime I was actually really against
claims based authorization as a concept
because there was this you know Kim
camera would talk about it and he just
sort of wave his hand around
well authentication is just one kind of
claim and now I'm becoming a fan because
now I see how it can actually be done
using more modern technologies finally
OAuth really specializes in protecting
web api's and open ID at connect
actually specializes in protecting
identity claims and uma just says
whatever if it's kind of web accessible
we protect it okay onto demos okay so I
wanted to present the demo of how the UM
a works what what the user has to do in
order to share data between a house and
the requester and what others use what
other users can do to apply for some
access so we will be operating on three
different applications so this will be
very similar to street identity but it
will be lets say a slightly extended
version so it we will show how we can
share our betrayal data and how we can
centralize management access management
for that data so currently I will show
how I can share some data and actually I
will show how I can how I can share some
data as as a user Bob so this will be
sharing data between two different
applications as you can see I'm logged
in to actually Facebook as Bob and I
will show how I can create some data on
a house and how I can
actually then later access that the data
from a requester in a secure way so
there will be some authorization
happening and you will see you will see
that in the flow there is actually yet
another application called Smart a.m.
and this will be the authorization
manager that actually manages how the
host shares data with a requester so
let's go to let's go to a host we simply
have to login with in this case our
Facebook account
and we can see that there is some
personal information that the user has
on a host so this is his full name and
also birthday and we will now as the
same user login to another application
so let's do the same flow let's login
with our Facebook account in this case
and this application should well get
access to the data that we store at the
different at the different application
so we do not want to enter our name
again and again we don't want to enter
our birthday information instead we
would like to simply grab it from the
attribute provider so from the host that
has the data it and it should be the
authoritative source of the data so
let's take a look what happens if we try
to grab a name for a moment there's no
discovery process of this please note
that this is just a demo we need to
provide the actual link to the to the
API which exposes that resource if we
try to fetch it we don't have the the
permission to do that this is because
the resource the name has not been mi
enabled it's not shared outside of the
host application so if we go back to the
application we can see that there's this
share button when we click it we see
that the house gives us an option to
register with our application with any
authorization manager so a component
that should take care of our security of
our data for the demo we will be using
the smart AM application in this case it
could be a very simple similar user
experience to what happens with the
sign-in process right now but for the
moment we're just inserting the the URL
of the of the application and if we
click introduce the application actually
redirects us to to the authorization
manager and asks for some specific for
specific set of permissions there's a
very basic permission like know who you
are at smart I am but also actually it
asks for some uma specific permissions
this is mostly the ability to register
resources for production so what
resources should be protected for that
user it also there's also a permission
for validating access to different
resources and some additional ones
if we click on allow we get redirected
back to the host and now if we click
share we see that a resource has been
protected has been registered so we know
that whenever there's an access to to
this request
there will be an uma flow executed for
the user make a quick comment so in
OAuth you know you have this static
developer documentation for those
endpoints what we've just done is
dynamically register think of it as an
endpoint a protected resource endpoint
at the am so it knows how to respond if
some requester comes asking for that
yeah so basically during this resource
registration what we did is that we
taught the authorization manager what
kind of a resource we have or operations
there are on this resource so it's a
more of a dynamic way of telling the
a.m. what kind of things it can actually
protect so if we go back to the
requester application and if we try to
access the name again what happens is
that we get redirected to the
authorization manager which informs the
user that this application is actually
trying to get access to some data on our
behalf we can also see what kind of
permissions it wishes to have to the
data we simply click on continue so we
approve such access and what we see is
that the data has been fetched from from
the actual host if we again go back to a
host and actually click on settings we
see that there's a new application which
has been authorized to access that data
also if we go to the authorization
manager and if we go to a history we can
actually see that we've access the data
using a very specific able are using a
very specific specific application so
this was a scenario of sharing data
between different applications but we
also show how you can
share the data among different users
so I'll just switch to a different user
I'm logged in to Facebook as Alice for a
moment and I want to log in to the
requester application again I log in
with my Facebook account
and I would like to get access to Bob's
full name so I would like to get this
resource and to have this resource
stored in my application so also click
on fetch again there's no discovery so I
need to provide the URL but if I click
on fetch and this resource as we know is
protected is that I get redirected to
the to the authorization manager which
tells me that the application that I'm
using tries to get access to some
protected information however I do not
have access to the information because
Bob did not authorize such access
however I can actually request access to
the data so I click on continue and the
request or application informs that such
access request has been recorded if I go
back if I go back to the - Bob so - user
Bob if I click on my share data I see
that there's my name I see that no one
has been authorized yet but I see in
here that there is an access request for
the data so I click on grant access I
select permissions that I would like to
apply for this particular individual I
click on confirm and there can be some
notification for user Alice and if user
Alice goes back and tries to fetch the
resource again you can see that she gets
access the resource I also show how this
happens once you pre establish a
relationship so if you define a sharing
settings in advance so let's go back to
user Bob we can again maybe register a
new resource let's register to birth the
information let's go to settings let's
have some people that's a Dallas let's
select the application that you can use
to to access that resource so for the
moment we you can either create contacts
by yourself which means that the open
and the connect flow comes in and but
you can also integrate with such
services as Facebook or Google I think
it's worth pointing out so smart a.m. is
an actual implementation it's made
implementation choices and providing
some very nice features like the the
notification that somebody tried to get
access the generic sort of a protocol
underneath doesn't really know about all
that stuff but it does know that you're
gonna apply policy and whatever the a.m.
offers as policy choices so ackles would
be a really good one by email address
that's why open ID connect it so
powerful because it helps you prove an
email address among other things so I
don't think we will actually have time
to show the open ID connect flow but
what you can't do with smart I am as
well is that you can just define a
policy that a specific user with this
email address should get access to a
data and then the authorization manager
requires you to provide a claim that you
really have that email address so
otherwise you need to login to the to
the authorization manager so let's just
again add this person we can see that
birthday has some output right contacts
there's Alice you can see the
permissions that she can use this
application you can see the the
permissions for this application for
Alice and if we go back to Alice and if
we try to fetch birthday then you can
see that access is immediately granted
so there's obviously a lot of or maybe
not not a lot of but few calls in the
back channel that you don't see where a
requester tries to get the access to the
resource and eventually has to upgrade
the token to get access to this resource
and only then the host would release the
actual resource to the
to the requestor what's I think worth
noting is that if you go to the
authorization manager and you can see
that there's the resource is protected
you can actually also see all your
contacts and if you click on a specific
contact you can basically see what kind
of resources it can access so we
immediately see you centralize the way
you grant access to different data the
other thing is this history where you
see how people would access the data
since the authorization manager knows
and can record when the host asks for
what kind of permission is associated
with a particular token that it gets
from a requester once access requests is
taking place so what I mean
authorization manager to the data yes so
the question was were if an attacker
compromises one of the systems that we
have for example the IDP or D AMS of the
authorization manager where this would
give the attacker all the access to the
data so for the moment the a.m. it is a
single point of failure basically what
we implement is that we base our system
on let's say birth tokens and these are
tokens which get fully generated by the
M which means that yeah if the attacker
can get access to the tokens it will
eventually get access to the data you're
right about that and and really it's a
if you compare apples to apples with
OAuth today I mean if your if your time
to live strategy around your token
length validity is really long as it
often is with native apps you're kind of
hosed and we should stop doing that
actually but the good thing about the
OAuth pattern that we're using is that
you can revoke access by one sort of
channel if you discover its rogue right
without disturbing some of the others
and that's one of the benefits so it
doesn't actually you know if you if the
if all if any of the systems that you're
using if you're logging into an AM with
just a password for example and you know
Bob is logging into some other system
was just a password you're subject to
all the phishing constraint you know
problems that you might have otherwise
any kind of redirect protocol is going
to be susceptible to that it kind of
argues for strong and some of the more
you know esoteric identity assurance
standards and that's actually one of the
things that we hope to be kind of a
mixable with we do if we've often said
you know we don't want to boil an ocean
we're just boiling this small pond and
we're actually relying on a bunch of
other work like some of the trust
framework work for example where you
could actually set policy to say Bob has
to log into Loa to strength and now all
of a sudden maybe it has to use Google
Authenticator or something and you don't
have to necessarily know how to do that
it's just that the token that comes in
has to prove that it's that strength
so I often think of the the former
congressman from New York who had the
verified Twitter account where I'm sure
he proved he was really the congressman
when he got the account but it's just
password-protected so it means nothing
so all those things get you know their
reach gets amplified by this so if you
actually trust an issuer to say this is
a citizen of the UK and only citizens of
the UK can get access to this
information if they spoof that issuance
you're still hosts but at least you can
turn it off if you discover it you can
also perhaps sue who it was because of
the the trail the audit trail you've got
yeah so right loss law enforcement
access so one of the things about uma is
it's a discretionary access control
system if somebody gets a subpoena and
goes through a back channel to get to
your data who Emma's not kind of
involved in that the same as I mean
anybody using let's say your average
wham system today if they get subpoena
they have to cough up data that their
policies never said they were supposed
to reveal right cool
should we move on you want to play plug
in this one again oh yeah so actually I
need to acknowledge the work the others
done on this project so this
implementation of the of the
applications and the smart I am so this
is the yeah actually you know my
colleagues at Newcastle University so I
say at the peak there were five of the
the team was had five members but
currently there are three active members
working on this project again this is
just a recall of of the of the scenario
that we that we had for smart I am so
there was a host that had the data the
requester that was aiming to get access
to the data and the smart a.m. which
actually centralizes how the data is
released two different requesters and we
used Facebook as the identity provider
for the moment but
it was still brokered through a
component called social Mac - which
integrates well with maryam and aims to
provide let's say more seamless user
experience otherwise establishing every
relationship requires well quite some
effort but if the IDP integrates with
the with the am and in this case if
there's a broker that integrates with
the m then the process can be slightly
simplified so just to let you know of a
couple of other implementation efforts
that we know of we've got folks who are
at the uma table working on this one is
by Fraunhofer ISEC and they're using a
as an example they're using a
photo-sharing model and i think they're
planning to open source network and is
it dotnet based in that case you've got
python and java implementations that you
plan to open source they've got a dotnet
implementation they're working open
source and then a third implement a
fourth implementation is involved with
some work in the EU
that's called task three actually the
new name is and and trust assurance and
the idea with the the base of that is
that users should be able to audit
access that was made to their stuff but
more than just audit they're actually
putting in the Summa connector so users
can put in place policies and actually
control it and not just on it wioa
enables so shall i just run through this
and you can sort of fill in we wanted to
sort of give you some food for thought
since you guys create apps since you run
an identity provider for starters you
know every web app that gets stood up
today pretty much like it doesn't do its
own billing and outsources it to charge
a fie how much cooler could it be if you
could also outsource all the users
sharing preferences kind of setting
stuff to a central authority that you
trust to do that it gets you a lot of
probably liability protections sort of
privacy check marks all kinds of goodies
like that and it takes away some
functionality that would have been hard
to do this is why we're seeing social
sign-in today because authenticating is
a kind of thing that you'd like to
outsource and people are doing that so
you can provide sophisticated protection
and sharing not just sort of cobbled
together protection sharing that's only
good
your app you can actually leverage the
work done by others you can ensure that
the protection of really sensitive stuff
is not stupidly protected with secret
URLs you can build trust more readily
with users and we're trying to make it
as easy as possible to integrate these
features not using kind of the heavy WS
star methods of the recent path past but
rather you know things people like to
use at least to a first approximation
why if you're an identity provider
should you care about this stuff well
we're now seeing with open ID connect
and street identity and n stick the
national strategy for trusted identities
in cyberspace and other similar efforts
we're seeing this notion of attribute
providers as first-class citizens as
they should be and we're finally getting
some tools for doing something
interesting with that so if an IDP wants
to remain higher touched than ever wants
to provide more services than ever but
couldn't possibly be the native
authoritative repository for every piece
of data every service of interest to a
person this is a way of doing it
open ID Connect is a nice adjunct to
obviously you know Google is working
with the Open ID Connect folks it seems
like it's going in that direction
uma provides all these complementary
pieces of functionality Alice to star
sharing we see opportunities with
trusted attributes user-generated
content API is whatever it is that you
want to share that's on the web so we'll
just conclude now with a reminder that
we've got the tweet chat coming up and
if you're willing to stay we can take
questions I think we're good till even
before we can hang out here any other
questions comments interest jumping on
board deploying yes
how could this be a service how can the
authorization page oh how could the a.m.
be a service that really works
it's we we've this is actually the first
question that we've run into since the
very beginning which is isn't the user
experience gonna suck basically in a
nutshell and one of the things you'll
notice about the flows we just showed
even with street identity is it involves
a lot of logging in and permissioning
right the login and consent flow is not
something you really want to do more
than once in a sitting and we're
constrained to be doing that for now
until the discovery and introduction
piece gets a little bit better but the H
data that project H data flow that we
showed I know it was a bit of an eye
chart but project H data org is a real
thing it's primarily run by mitre
it's an hl7 project and they have this
problem of they're building a restful
api and a data format it's actually an
XML data format for health records they
have a component in their architecture
that they call the Dazz which is the
discovery and authorization service
which if you remember old Liberty
Alliance days there was always this
discovery service sometimes called disco
once you have the ability to register
things with the a.m. there's a lot of
things you can start to do silently and
once you have the ability to set policy
once a person has the ability to set
policy there's an opportunity to
shortcut all of those logging ins you
know the kind of thing that that much I
was showing had a lot of sort of smart
a.m. specific optimizations essentially
if you want to collect trusted claims or
any claims at all from the requester or
the requesting party they yeah think of
it as them having that log in to the
a.m. and provide data right so there
kind of
to do a login if you want I think of it
that way really the more important way
to think of it is if they want access
they've got a cough up some claims and
this is a way to get the claims right so
I kind of don't care about the
requesters process for what they have to
do and what we'll work on next we've got
human operator of a requester app flows
and the next thing will be web service
operated autonomous web service flows
where requester is just a web service
maybe it's a crawler oh I found your
demographic data off of your site let me
can I can I get to it well if you pay me
five bucks yeah so the experience the
user has we acknowledge there's
opportunities for a lot of optimization
and I know how hard it's been even to
get to the NASCAR stage and the account
chooser stage so that I think is really
nascent even in the authentication world
so I acknowledge that that's definitely
something that needs needs work but I
think I think if the value is there
we'll get there do you have a comment on
that before when then we'll go to you
actually yeah maybe one more comment to
this like if the ADP would be extended
let's say with the am the entire process
would be really greatly simplified I
understand that the approval page is a
huge problem in here because it has to
well
show lots of different informations like
if I as as user acts who want to get
access to some other guy's data then you
need to provide some more information
than what's at the current approval
pages however we we try to insert this
some sort of a broker again between the
IDP and the a.m. that we have right now
because previously when we only had a
separate components like the IDP was a
separate component the M was a separate
component we would get through a lot of
different approval pages and this had to
these were very problematic for users
now we are able to basically issue if
the application decides not to use for
example an IDP directly but to use it
through our proxy it actually gets a
token that's powerful enough to be
executed against the a.m. as well which
mean is that well it's a sort of nice
user experience it gets much more much
better actually and much easier for user
to understand that he's just giving
access to
one more service and then it doesn't
really the user doesn't really need to
know that if he presses share that
there's some information flowing to the
M you immediately get redirected for
example to some sort of a page where you
can set policies so it's very much
simplified if you can insert some sort
of or if you can connect the IDP with
the am either for a broker or directly
one last thought I'm sorry to delay
getting to your question but there is an
opportunity and this is another one of
those we're boiling a small pond not the
whole ocean kind of thing there's an
opportunity when you have standardized
api's and standardized scopes and
standardized claims for more
standardized user experiences around
those and one of the things we had to
invent was we call it scope metadata I
think and it's it's basically a kind of
machine readable description of scope
OOP see what did I just do sorry it's
kind of machine readable scope
descriptions can configuration data if
you will and it's just a simple little J
something it's not very exciting but
it's tantamount to like real it's the
first thing you'd want an API developer
documentation like what's that what's
that is it swagger that cool sort of
annotated restful api documentation that
you can generate you know it's the
second you get it machine readable you
can start to have standards and at first
we thought well we're just going to be
very pure we say we have to be restful
and the only kind of API we're gonna
support in uma is you know restful crud
you know or like you know get post put
delete well that didn't last because you
know the world runs on proprietary API
is that are providing added value you
can't dismiss that however once you have
the ability to describe your scopes
you're on the way to and we allow for
this in uma a host choosing to implement
a standardized API and pointing off to
scope descriptions that don't live with
it and that presents the opportunity for
standardizing the interfaces for
checking off things and you know doing
policies around them the same as with
Open ID Connect and the opportunity to
standardize claim your eyes so that when
you say birthday you know you mean that
kind of birthday and not something weird
you know it's kind of successive
approximation around standardizing those
things and UX
opportunities come along with those
those levels of standardization that's
my hope we tried to standardize that and
totally failed so like you know and I
know that the the entire oweth universe
was burned by the scope conversation
right all right there just comma
separated strings and you know that's
what they thought was good enough
we actually determined that wasn't quite
good enough but it's scopes can still be
anything you want you just have to kind
of register them yeah yes yes let me
repeat that so the idea is that you can
sort of subscribe to standardized
policies that the e FF came up with for
example so right now the way we've
defined the a.m. it's unlike the more
sophisticated enterprise systems like
you know exact or something where you
have a standardized way of going and
looking up federated policies we don't
have that because it's all currently
internal to the a.m. so it's a policy
administration point it's a policy
decision point it's a policy information
point as far as anyone's concerned those
api's it could become a client to an API
that serves policies and we haven't gone
there in v1 I would love to go there in
future yes absolutely yeah then you can
start to do I mean this this starts to
make kind of big data around your own
stuff doable for a person you know with
the right API so I'm very excited about
all those possibilities and thank you
