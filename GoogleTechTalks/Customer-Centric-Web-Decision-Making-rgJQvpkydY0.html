I work as a senior managers for research
and analytics at into it which is just
holler out here and I'm going to talk to
you about how do you make customer
centric decisions on the web and
everything to do with decision-making
around websites and what is it that we
do it into it what's our mindset and
strategy and I'll end with about six or
eight points of view that I have around
how to do this well and you can clap or
boo and we'll see how that goes so these
things are supposed to start with the I
me myself slide you know I'm supposed to
sell books or consulting and I have
neither sadly so so I thought that I'll
still use the two minutes and I'll share
with you something I these are my kids
nominees three four and a half and
chirag is two and Dominis name in Hindi
means lightning and and we called her
domine because I wanted her to be really
strong and secure and ultra feminist and
all that and and she's achieved all my
hopes and dreams at the age of three I
was hoping would happen by 18 or so and
chirag is two and a half and he has this
amazing sense of curiosity and
wonderment and perhaps it's that age but
he's he just makes me want to be him and
and my kids are the reason and that I
have all the passion and the drive and
they mean everything to me and I thought
that i'll use my slide for that purpose
so there you go so I work at this little
company called into it it has around 2.3
billion dollars of revenue and the great
thing about into it is that it's
actually a collection of a lot of
different little companies that into its
purchased over the course of years and
we do things that you've never imagined
we have we do payroll we do credit card
processing we have software for
construction businesses and everything
can imagine for small businesses soup to
nuts the interesting thing about into it
is its number one and number two in
every business it is in is roughly owns
around eighty percent of market share
every one of these
businesses so it's it's a delight and a
joy to work at a company like that I'm
sure you know the the interesting thing
about enjoy it is that it has 67
websites the last time I counted in
December and I bet you the number is
more like 90 now we just simply King
County track of them and I'm responsible
from the corporate function to do to
create provide platform operation and
strategy around web research and
analytics so that's a little bit about
my role and I'll stop selling now so you
go to a lot of these presentations and
you walk away from them like me that was
interesting and my goal is not to have
that happened today I I want to move you
down hopefully I'll challenge you some
of your thinking and so you'll think
that and that's okay hopefully I'll move
you up because I like that like that a
lot more so no more no more interesting
stuff and any and there would be no good
analytics person without gold so I do
have goals and so I usually have the
numbers flipped but is such an
intelligent audience that I'm going for
a higher bar so I have like two slides
that in my mind now represent the
challenge that we have at web analytics
or at least what's called web analytics
and here's the first one it's a quote
that somebody posted in the yahoo
analytics group I'll let you read it
this this is all really true you guys
sell stuff but people who have to use it
this is exactly how they feel and the
interesting thing is to me it's all
constantly fascinating and so how long
it takes somebody to figure this out in
a company that I go to something we'll
figure this out in six weeks for other
people the journey is continuing after
six years so it's like fascinating to
see this journey unfold but the bigger
challenge with web analytics is
represented by this slide this is one of
the industry-leading tools some of you
know may know what it is but what i did
is i just took screenshots of an you get
three options when you get into the tool
you know path traffic commerce and then
i took one of the ones on the top and
and then I what I did is I highlighted
six completely random metrics and this
we get so we're six completely and
utterly randomly metrics you get at
least eight to ten options each this
tomb has achieved even more feature
since i took the screenshot so a times
six times a gazillion metrics in the
world it looks like the beautiful thing
about somebody gave me a t-shirt google
+ xt sure at metrics and beautiful thing
about this slide and the t-shirt is if
you're a half competent website every
one of this number over time goes up and
to the right over time as long as you're
half competent so revenue pageviews page
errors people hating you everything goes
up and to the right over time the google
i'm 60 shirt stays at the back to the
right up into the rock so in a world
that looks like this how do you actually
know what are your critical few metrics
this is a huge challenge it's amazing
how many times I asked people to
question why your website exists and
they cannot answer that question even if
they do it's five paragraphs long if you
cannot answer in five seconds and ten
words while your website exists you
cannot answer this question you should
simply turn off your analytics
application
more importantly than that people
believe that if only they had enough
data I'm sure there are really really
smart people here at Google who will who
you know use lots and lots of data and
make the data sang for my personal
hypothesis is that no matter how much
you torture all this data by the way
there is no other thing in the world
that throws off as much data as the web
that's beautiful you take a Google
Analytics tag you put it on your side 15
seconds later you're in business
megabytes and terabytes of data spewing
out at you in this world no matter how
much you torture all of the data you
cannot ever ever figure out if you're
doing right by the customer and most
people who do web analytics think that
this is possible and I think that it's
not possible this leads to my
controversial conclusion that
traditional web analytics as we know it
is dead and the sooner you come to grips
with it the better it is and so what is
what's going to take the place over
antics is something I called web
insights very subtle nuance so let me
explain to you what the world of web and
what insights looks like this is the
world of web analytics you measure page
views and heads and screen resolutions
and Tom exit pages or god forbid you'll
measure daily unique visitors and you
can diagnose if you live in this world
because after you do all the stuff you
had no idea what action to take it's
very very difficult for you to live in
the world of web analytics and go to
your stakeholders and recommend actions
this is how the world of web insights
looks like some suggestions of metrics
remaining you need to click in city lies
its primary purpose task completion
rates visitor trends vs a multi-channel
revenue impact and the way you know that
you live in the world of web insights is
that no matter what report you look at
out of every open part of your body
actions come out
this is I another you live in this world
so let me tell you briefly the solution
that we have built that into it and it
starts with this mindset and it's called
the Trinity at the center of the Trinity
strategy is the desire to have
actionable insights and metrics and as
you can imagine the treaty has three
different components the first of which
is the world of traditional web
analytics everything you can do with
click stream analysis you click density
segments patients or internal search key
metrics all of the things you can do at
clickstream data in order to understand
the intent of your customers on the best
day if you torture all your clickstream
data all he can do is understand the
intent of your customers the second
prong of the 20 strategy is outcomes and
it's amazing how many times we struggle
in order to figure out why our website
exists and what the outcome should be as
a standard interview question by the way
fieri with me the standard interview
question outcomes revenue conversion
rates problem resolution timeliness but
no matter what reason your website
exists there has to be an outcome and it
cannot just be conversion rate I have a
blog on my I have a post on our blog
today it's a stop measuring conversion
rate or obsessing bacchanalian right but
the thought for the Trinity is perhaps
the most beautiful and a college
experience it includes things that we do
at our company around measuring customer
satisfaction at Promoter scores doing
multi-varied a/b testing lab testing
follow me homes our company founder
Scott cook is really really beavs in
cells this strategy called customer
driven innovation and and we follow
humbly along his path trying to figure
out how is it that we can get into the
heads of the people who are browsing our
website without invading their privacy
in the end for us the Trinity mindset is
around around trying to do all of these
things in a way that you can understand
the customer experience so well that we
can influence their behavior that leads
to the win-win outcomes vote for us and
our customers
and it's actually we aren't done studies
and things and we often leave money on
the table because our focus is customer
satisfaction and net promoter if quicken
deluxe is the right product for you at
forty dollars we want to help you figure
that out and only by the forty dollar
product and not quicken premier home and
business which costs eighty dollars
because you will buy quicken deluxe
today and come back for quicken premier
home and business in two years if you
buy quicken premier home and business
thing you will never come back to us
again so I'll show you some screenshots
of how this time would be stranded what
this strategy means in reality the first
ones doing behavior analysis for us we
use a little tool called trick tracks
it's from a little company in santa cruz
and the great thing about click tracks
is its infinite power to do segmentation
on the fly really fast hyper aggressive
segmentation of the data and so
everybody does cite cite overlay he
society over like I click density
analysis but everybody gets i overlay
the beauty of click tracks is like its
segment data to figure out how what
various different segments of people are
doing on my website not in aggregate so
the red numbers you see on the top are
people who end up buying on our website
and the green numbers are everybody else
so they go in and actually see if people
come to us from google from yahoo
overture sem campaigns what is it they
do on our website in reality we throw
this up into a marketer and they can
really begin to understand what is going
on on their web pages on their website
in a way that no table or graph in excel
can do not just this you can actually
figure out really simple basic things so
in many back on many companies i'm sure
even at Google a lot of people obsess
about the homepage I rightly so in your
case obviously but we want web analytics
to tell people they're only six point
eight percent of the site traffic sees
the homepage stop obsessing about it if
forty percent of your resources are
working on the homepage it's probably
not a good idea you also work with click
tracks to build innovation small small
features like this one which tells us
for our top keywords right exactly on
the page but it what keywords are
driving the again
traffic and the beauty is not just
everybody but what I've chopped off here
is worth the drive purchasers words the
drive repeat be a repeat visitors words
to drive something that I want to get
down on the website in a real easy an
alleyway of course you can do the simple
stop for the people come from where did
they go the interesting thing is these
kinds of graphics can actually tell you
that for us at least for this particular
campaign that we were running msn was
higher in terms of conversion even
though you got lower traffic in Google
so we can actually go back and preach
that you should have oh you know multi
search engine strategy might be a good
thing spend money on Google that's good
because they have in here but definitely
trying multi-channel stream not only
ecommerce segmentation is pretty easy to
do this graph you see of this page you
see is actually a screenshot of our
support website nobody's their bond you
actually don't you're not in the
acquisition generation business in your
support website you create sucky
products more people come you create
great products nobody comes so should
you measure unique visitor trends over
time for this website probably not a
good idea what you really want to know
is of all the people who come to their
website I don't like using this but this
is too high but you actually really want
to know of people who actually see the
content we want to see how many call in
the phone versus people who did not and
that is beautiful can't run hugest of
fans of segmentation you really want to
understand why your website exists what
its goals and objectives are and then
throw an application at it that allows
you to segment and find insights this is
you know this is my Lots not slide on
this one but this is a sort of a three
thousand page website that is modeled
into four stages some of the boxes
represent pages other boxes here
represent entire reams and reams of
content a lot of people do path analysis
and I think we do plat analysis because
in the world the log files from 10
billion years ago he was somebody
somebody probably nitey stood up and
said look every time somebody clicks I
can actually put them in the right order
tada that analysis was born
the interesting thing is on most
websites less than 1% of the traffic
actually uses the same path so what kind
of decision would you make from it
completely I don't waste time I will
express a lot of opinions you can
disagree we have this I'm not selling
anything remember like I call this macro
usage analysis report because in a very
brief screenshot you'd actually
represent what a 3,000 page website
looks like not only that it actually
tells you what content is being consumed
on the website and how much but the most
beautiful thing is the darker the color
of blue on this slaw on this screen shot
the more influential that pages in
getting somebody to a goal even if 99%
of your site traffic follows the exact
same path wouldn't you die to know what
page in there was most influential this
attempts to do that and it's so dumb in
its logic it just says which page
convince more people to go on how simple
and yet extremely beautiful and we can
also validate that the pages were
putting up are actually helping our
customers oh this is just so pretty and
I just throw it in but I it actually
also tell you if people don't do what
you want them to do on the website what
is it that they do so in a way you can
actually play with all this data and
model customer experience exactly is the
customer experiences not as Brett Cosby
might want to have it be
yeah very very powerful so the next one
are ours is probably quick because you
probably know this but we built actually
a really large data warehouse called
Polaris it's our nickname for it
standard starts the most hilarious
Oracle and would start what pilaris does
is using standard ETL tools pulls data
from all of these sources that you see
here our tanks are revlon's our oldest
database the other metadata sitting
around the company our corporate data
warehouse and allows us to see
end-to-end view of the customer
information so we can actually measure
we did this couple years ago we can
measure cost per click you can measure
cost me unique visitor we can measure
cost per order and every sub nuance of
the cost per order automatically it's
just a random example but allowing our
data to it's simple things like actually
sitting on the same metadata as the
retail channel is allows us to actually
go out to our senior management and put
retail and work together and mean the
same thing because very soon I think
people are going to figure out that web
is just boring all the web they're going
to want to measure success on the web
exactly is the deuce of the other
channels having the strategy sets us up
for success for that and you standard
brielle client sir you know standard
business intelligence tools slice and
dice create reports that look like that
simple ones end to end the beautiful
thing is because so many of our
e-commerce websites it's on the same
platform it means to be a lot we apply
the same metadata and definitions and
everything computations for all our core
kpi's we do it for quickbooks everybody
else gets it happy birthday you do it
once and everybody else can use it but
more importantly what it allows us to do
is actually allow these creation of
these sandbox type environments this is
JavaScript on top of Rio to allow our
end users to slice and dice the data
anyway which way they want it without
actually having to create every gyration
in every computation of every report
under God's green earth so this report
for example this little screen shot
replay so like 30 our reports but it
allows our marketers to go in and pick
the channels that they want in this
particular case channels and do very
quick if then analysis for revenue and
visitor trends for the last 24 months
oh and people like having their own
metadata so we actually have a finance
person who likes to see the world
exactly as she prefers this is a real
acronym so she can go in and click her
own numbers on C appliance you can get
the world view of the world exactly she
prefers she's really important so she
gets her own stuff but the last part of
the Trinity strategy is customer
experience oh and I'm a huge fan of
doing multivariate and experience
testing I'll touch on that a little bit
later we also do lab use abilities
downstairs from where I sit in building
one we have eight usability labs with
one-way mirrors and cameras on your
faces and your computer screen and it's
a joy and delight to see customers if
you've not seen lab usability study with
real people I highly recommend it's very
entertaining plus it is a great learning
experience real people are amazing
now we also do follow me homes so we
actually will pay to go to your house
and we'll give you 300 bucks or your
office and we'll sit and watch you use
interact with our software or our
websites sometimes task-based sometimes
totally unrestricted but the primary
thing one of the things we use that is
truly scalable and include we do is we
use the acsi the American Customer
Satisfaction Index it was developed by
the University of Michigan and we
partnered with a company called for see
results that has license this technology
and applied it to the web so the ACSI
currently measures half of the US
economy so trillions of dollars of
revenue and instead of building one
methodology of our own we just use
something that exists at the end of the
day I what the easiest I allows us to
measure is a satisfaction score as a
result of he experienced how satisfied
were you based all in a standardized
methodology but the great thing about
the ACSI is for all customized elements
that we have of our customer experience
in this particular website it allows us
to measure satisfaction rates for all of
those elements this is a great way to
take people out of the equation
especially company people and put the
customers back in because this is tell
this is customer rating all of these
features and the model we created the
customize data model for every one of
the websites because it is always
different every website exists for a
different purpose hopefully but the most
beautiful thing about this is this
little column here there's a very
complex multivariate regression model
behind this and it actually calculates
correlation between any of these things
and changes to these things and it's
uber impact on customer satisfaction and
so to translate real quick people are
not really happy in this website about
transaction cost 69 is the lowest score
so if you thought because we can only
sell full price now if you knew that you
would jump in and do coupons or you
would give discounts or you would do
those kinds of things but in reality
what this model is telling us is that
the correlation between transaction
costs and you being satisfied from your
experience is 0.4 so people are not
really happy that we charge you full
price but that's not the reason they're
unhappy and then you can begin to go in
and figure out what are the things
we should be working on there will have
a statistically significant impact on
customer satisfaction not this customer
satisfaction but future predictive
behavior so you're likely to come back
you likely to buy from us you're likely
to recommend us to your friends and
neighbors and co-workers and everybody
else so in the end you can actually find
pockets of information pockets of things
that you need to figure out in order to
actually in influence customer
experience in order to make a lot a lot
a lot of money we're in the case of our
support websites figure out how do we
actually do things for our customers
that result in them not picking up the
phone and calling us because it's very
expensive for them to do that and for us
another great strength of using this
model is that you can benchmark against
best of the best so these two different
benchmarks use the ACSI ecommerce index
this is all of the companies will check
people's expectation about what a web
should be amazon ebay barnes and noble 1
800 flowers on and on and on and the
next bend in index we use is the a CSI
tech index which contains apple HP
gateway all these scores are by the way
available to anybody to see the index
course at BAC SI orj so you can actually
go and get trends and everything else
and we can compare our websites against
everybody else in terms of changing
mindsets there is nothing that is as
powerful as this because you can take
yourself out of the equation and you can
go out and say look here's somebody
who's figured out how to do this here
are the benchmarks here all we're doing
but the this is probably one slide I
would love for you to remember if you
remember anything that I say to that so
one of the great points of viewing
usability is that if you do surveys you
only ask three questions we ask a lot
more we do ask the three big questions
and the first one is why are you here
and the next one is were you able to
complete your task today and if not why
not three simple humble questions
and it's amazing how the answer to the
first one is always a surprise to
everybody who owns a website people are
always surprised when the fig see the
answer to the question why are you here
because amazingly it turns out that
people don't use our websites in the way
we intended them to be used it's always
eye-opening for people to figure out Oh
what are all the things that people are
doing that I did not expect them to do
not only that but then you can go back
and say are you able to complete a task
yes or no so lose yes the Reds now isn't
it amazing that for regardless of
whether this is an e-commerce website or
a superb website that's such a large
where people can't complete their task
is a very old dated slide but we go one
farther naturally go in there exactly
how many people are in each pocket so
I'm none of our websites can you do this
we simply don't do that at all and yet
seven percent of traffic actually is
coming for that purpose but we also
trend it over time so our number some of
the numbers were back actually getting
better I think that before people get
into implementing web analytics
solutions on their website as a
compliment to a cohesive web strategy
they should have this slide for their
own website they should be able to
figure out what other reasons people
come to my website for and are they able
to do those tasks and is this what I
want them to do but even after all so
primary purpose task completion trends
primary purpose task completion trends
and the beauty is this actually sits in
a nice little database so you can go in
and slice and dice the data any which
way you want in this case we can
actually slice the data by frequency of
visits and you can figure out insights
from there so the data is infinitely
sizeable and that's the beauty is you're
applying such complex statistics and
mathematics on something as soft and
fuzzy as voice of the customer
all of these great stuff is is to get
this if you are not able to complete
your cast today why not so all of this
hardcore regression that's going on
behind the scenes is still not to jump
to action actually all of it is to
actually simply figure out segments of
this content what is it people are not
have your customers not happy on the
website and in the end veedu Pareto
analysis we do VLC categories you know
all of these things that keep testing
and experimentation on our websites and
that drives changes and if you follow
this methodology there's nobody you're
going to fail because you're driving
change and your strategy your website
your experiences based on what the
customers identify us are your problems
okay so one of the great things about
this this strategy and mindset is not
simply that it exists in silos but
actually all of it is tied to each other
st. between simple database terms we
have primary keys that pass back and
forth everywhere completely and utterly
anonymous completely one hundred percent
anonymous as we care about privacy or
customers a lot but you can actually
take pockets of people who give you
certain gratings on your website then
you take their date software session
identifiers and dump it into click
tracks and see what did this what they
saw why did they click on our websites
where did they get lost or you can
actually stick all of the people who
completed a certain outcome and throw
that back into your survey tool and
figure out what is it that these people
say about our website what was the
convince me to buy content on our
website if they need a bind if they
ended up submitting a lead they ended up
doing something else so the beauty of
this mindset not comes in the fact that
the FCC logs but we have three different
tools that work and play ball with each
other it's supremely powerful so now a
few points of view I call it the
strategy in action and the first one is
that data quality sucks and if you want
to do great things on the web you should
just get over it because at least for a
conceivable future without violating
your privacy good data is hard to come
by it's just simply a manifestation of
the world
11 today and there are many many many
different reasons for it infinite number
of reasons and you get you you whack one
mole and the next one comes up and then
the next one in another next one methyl
ethyl so someday some smart person
sitting in some cubicle in building 40
or 41 will figure out how to do this
well until then it's really really
important that you don't get stuck in
this world and be unhappy that's not a
good thing my own recommendation is that
you should assume a level of comfort
with the data whatever is your comfort
level actually I could look at all of
the google analytics data for my blog
and I say you know what trust it around
sixty percent and you could look at it
and say you know what I trust it three
percent and it's totally okay it's
really really okay I'm not going to try
and change your mind for the beauty is
if you have some semblance of confidence
in the data start taking action that's
really important if I had sixty percent
of the day it confidence on my data I
would move from here to New York do
drastically crazy things you only have
three percent content data will probably
change the door knobs and that's okay
you're starting to take some action it's
really because people get stuck you try
to figure out why the data is all wrong
once you start driving some action fine
micro niches where you can actually
segment data out and understand what is
actually going on so I'll take all of
the keywords Avinash there are driving
traffic to my blog from google and over
time and look at the DNC why is it that
this particular theta doesn't seem to be
looking really good and over time I
think you're you'll get more and more
comfortable with the data and you
understand its limitations and you'll be
able to actually increase the country on
the three to five to 14 to 20 to 80
you'll never have a hundred percent
comes in the data on the web at least
for the moment but that's okay because
over time consistency is great and
absolute numbers don't matter at least
not on the web not as much as we like
the next one is experiment or go home
it's the original title was experiment
or die and then I was counseled to
change the title and I'm i like the
hugest of fans of experimentation I just
absolutely love and adore it because of
all of the benefits that come from it
but the reason you should experiment is
because customers complained they don't
give solutions actually it's a good
practice in doing usability never to ask
customers for a solution because they
have no idea you just want them to
articulate their problems really well as
well as they possibly can but the other
one is the company employees don't
represent customer point of view you you
and I are too close to the company even
if you actually use Google every single
day and every browser you open is google
and you have google toolbar and gmail
and every google offering under God's
greener you're not representative of a
Google customer and I of an into a
customer and yet it's amazing that of
all of the website that exists out there
company insiders actually dictate
experience in the higher up you go from
the stronger the dictation becomes
the other thing is that the most
phenomenal website experience is still
tomorrow the web is changing around that
is constantly evolved it's always
changing and somebody else is coming up
with you next Ajax web dude auto blah
blah blah that's going to make the world
a better but the most important reason
is that I think that eighty percent of
the time company employees are wrong
about what the customers want so I love
love love experimentation this is an
example of a simple ADC test very very
simple one and the point of view is that
one of them is drastic at least two of
them are drastically different than the
other there's a simple test and and what
we learned from this test was amazingly
interesting things but one of the
biggest things that we learned from this
test is you should not measure single
goals for ABX tests that you're on or a
multivariate test for experienced
testing that you run measuring single
most tools out there today will measure
single goal conversion rate somebody saw
a paid to give you a lead or exactly the
website from this place or that in this
particular version this is simple this
is the simplest test you could run in
your life singer page three different
versions it cannot get any more complex
than this and yet in this case one of
the words you do better for revenue
another one better for customer
satisfaction if you do experimentation
and testing and you should because
there's no better way to change minds
that always try and measure multi-goal
they will differentiate you from your
competitors and the other thing that
experimentation in testing is really
really good is that there are no such
things as bad ideas from and it allows
us now to very cheaply create different
versions of a page run multivariate
things on our website without ever
having to go back to and the admin of
our building and say your idea is
terrible and going to the founder of our
company saying your eye gaze fabulous I
should that's the real case here one of
this is this from a company founder and
we can actually put everything up all
apples to apples democracy pervades and
you can let the customers tell you what
they want and they've done really
deep tests where we present completely
and utterly different versions of our
websites deep as you keep going deeper
and deeper and it's amazing what you can
learn if you haven't didn't this is this
is the most awesome thing because you
take your opinions out of the game and
you let the customers decide I don't
think that you really care about this
but dashboards are great focus on the
critical fear but the one thing I want
to take away from dashboarding things is
this this is especially as you go higher
up the chain of command you don't want
them to think too much if you have
dashboards that have massive amounts of
numbers in them and it means that she
has to think that's not a good thing
because if she starts thinking she's
going to ask a lot of questions and it's
okay but if you consume a lot of time
and you will have to give her all the
background own take 90 days so as much
as possible present data metrics
everything all that is golden but try as
much as possible to bude this little box
how is it that you want to fix things
any shortcomings that exist on your
website today preet you the data so that
people don't have to think too much you
don't hide the data I'm not advocating
this is this is a version that
represents segmentation that you can do
every single metric here is segmented
and because you're not supposed to read
it I will hide it and the best practice
for creating dashboards is only have
eight metrics eight or less metrics on a
page in a font size that is 11 or higher
I really like this one because it brings
together some of the things that we've
talked about but most of the time when I
work with web analysts in our company
and other companies they always sit in
this abstract world of cookies and tags
and this is the language they actually
use but in reality real people visit our
websites not TV's and movies and chopper
IDs and our challenge especially I think
this is my challenge as the person
sitting in the web analytics and
decision-making team to figure out how
do we get the human into the equation
and one of the ways we do this this is
real these we create personas and you've
heard our personas before but probably
not from a web analytics team per se but
this is for one of our website that it
exists for advocacy and that's that's a
made-up name but simply actually
profiling the core customer segments in
this manner age group and how long they
have used what makes them feel confident
in efficient what did they need actually
fundamentally changed how we were
running numbers through click tracks are
mature or Google Analytics or anything
because suddenly it made all of those
clicks all the more real you see all
this data put into experience design
usability testing creating better
navigation structures but this is
fabulous way to bring customers to the
table especially for a web analytics
team if you're actually doing web
analytics one of my recommendations is
that if you're analyzing a particular
experience of your website you should go
try that experience yourself because an
amazing you know where people will just
sit down with the tool actually not go
and look at the website and see what a
customer is looking at and it sounds
fairly simplistic but it happens amazing
we have to process is great
my mind one tip here is that for
whatever analysis we do try and figure
this box out we often do trends we
actually present insights we say what
actions we take but it's rare for us to
go back and see as a result of this
trend what was the impact on the
customer or the business this is a
fabulous way to connect with your
decision makers you put a line here that
says we lost 10 million dollars it's
fantastic in terms of taking action this
is an example of a repeatable process
that we've created at Intuit we follow
six sigma and process excellence whereby
we have regularly scheduled processes
that review data look at the insights
present those get by and take actions
and the last one some of you might have
heard is my 1090 rule and so the goal
for any company is to create get the
most fabulous value from an analytics
implementation so this rule by the way
the only two longer which this rule
doesn't work is Google Analytics sadly
but for everybody else's replies and the
rule says that if you actually spend ten
dollars on the analytics tools and
professional services they in order for
you to get maximum value from this
implementation you have to spend ninety
dollars and brains because in the end
people are priceless
it is very very hard to find people who
can actually take all your terabytes of
data and find one bite of inside that
will add millions of dollars to gravity
because most often what happens is we
provide our admin or a junior in turn
access to google analytics and expect
them to drive change and so if you buy a
web analytics tool and use it in your
company make sure that the ratio looks
roughly like that it's not that omniture
is expensive I'm going to have massive
amounts of data that will give you great
insights but you also need six of Brett
he's really smart to actually extract
value from amateur or web trends or hvx
or click tracks whatever tool you
implement so i will send this out later
but you know know your critical few
segments during the primary purpose
you're wrong people matter so there's my
blog and na and this is this is a quote
I stole from our company founder Scott
cook he uses this very often and I
really like it and I put it at the end
of every presentation because I think
it's very apt
well I'll be very happy to answer any
questions that you might have
yes in the generic terms so the cushion
the question was how does our group work
with the other group set into it so I
report to the VP for the web at into it
and he's in the marketing functions I'm
a marketing person supposedly and we
have a jaded organized with many
different business units this is all
public so you're cooking QuickBooks
turbotax master builder you know pro-tax
things like that so for a while actually
the central team we had we own
everything soup to nuts a-actually that
the first thing is we own everything
into ends so the tags that going page
the server that collects the data from
the tags it's its in-house secured by
our firewall it doesn't go to another
third party analytics person and
everything else you saw end-to-end
business analyst user researchers
everything warranty the team 47 so for a
while it worked very well that we did
all the analysis for the business unit
because the scale wasn't there people
are not asking all these questions they
worked fine for a little while now we've
evolved your model where we want to
create a center of excellence into it in
our team we don't want to do all of the
deep down work for all of our business
yet so in a very strategic way we're
staffing each business unit with senior
business analyst or seen user researcher
whatever the core skill set is needed
and they'll dotted line into us but
they're actually in the business unit
sitting in that building going to their
staff meetings living and breathing that
particular business in its business and
yet they tap into our platform and our
strategy standards benchmarks everything
else so they don't have to worry about
capturing data 51 about analyzing data
and tying it back to the needs of that
specific business unit is i cannot get
close to all these 67 websites in
multiple multiple business units so
that's the that's the sort of structure
we've evolved to now
we'll see how it goes but but the
process is we'll get somebody and will
will help hire the business and somebody
would say brainwash it's a good word I
GPS change mindset and then they'll be
the business unit partly very closely
with us but executing for the business
so actual was if you looked into
analytics for mobile web and the great
answer is near and it simply it's able
because they are at the bandwidth to go
that far I'm always on my blackberry
like buying everything but we've found
that we're not detecting too many xrays
int IDs and a four percent I would be
worth your while to go that far but I am
i love i love i love my blackberry on
with the high I mean Bonnie and I'd
really hated the fact that black name
doesn't work in volume how dare they so
I think it's going to be a plaque home
for the future that sadly we here and
invested enormous amounts into that but
what we're having great conversations
with a so Fox in Japan and it's kayla
speech in London and they're doing
something really interesting so there
are solutions if you want to do stuff
around mobile there are three solutions
out there that are doing very advanced
things but we ourselves have an invested
much in ikea sorry
Oh
yeah so of the three things to our
outsourced to attract cyclic steam
analysis is sort of a external solution
we've purchased and the ACSI survey
based methodology something also we've
purchased but the data warehouse would
build ourselves and the rationale is
extremely simple we don't want to invest
in something that somebody else is
already smarter about we'll never get
that smart like it is impossible for me
to get any smarter at analytics then
brat and Google and it's just not going
to happen what is that does to these
metrics inform your media spend and then
to what extent are you measuring the out
yeah i mean the answer is not as much as
we would like to i said the moma taking
on a scale of one to a hundred probably
70 AD maybe at most for some businesses
who are fairly advanced so for example
some more business units who do very
cyclical business intense amount of
business in three months it's hugely all
these aren't excuse me from every piece
of dollar that we spend by me have many
many smaller business units where we
never made quite as much headway it's
very much a jury in the wrong but the
interesting thing is the challenge now
is not tools or metrics the challenges
mindset as it is just just evolving the
thinking and the mindset and decision
making so they can actually make use of
the strategy and platform here there's
nothing lacking in terms of technology
as you there should be no more features
added to any more tools out there please
thanks
oh yes yes of course
no it's okay
yeah so both from the day our house and
in the tools that I mentioned either we
have built-in solutions that will
measure signal and unless you get
ninety-five percent of higher degree of
confidence we won't consider that to be
a good in binding result on the day our
house side we have our built-in sort of
computations into brio that will allow
us to measure statistical significance
we always shoot for ninety-five percent
or higher confidence and before so for
testing when they run tests we try and
look at the historical trends and do
only do tests that we can run long
enough to get a signal so we'll actually
compute how many people do we need in
each pocket in order to get a
statistically significant ninety-five
percent or higher result and then also
sometimes it turns out that we want to
do this really really cool test on
google keyword called a carrying
software and but they want to target it
to solo a customer segment that will
take us nine and a half years to get a
signal that test doesn't happen so we
put all this start before and then the
right models are already incorporated so
forecasting automatica does this off the
bat will tell you when the signal is
there so we use curves things
yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
