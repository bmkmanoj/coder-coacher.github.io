developer
locate with Google and today in this
tech talk we have a van so my cell and
ludovic do bust who are coming to talk
about x wiki an open-source wiki in java
and groovy that they have built ok so
I'm ludovic to bust and Vincent is here
with me so I'm the CEO of X wiki Vincent
is the CTO and now we are going to
present you x wiki an open-source wiki
so quickly presentation of the company
xwiki was created in 2004 both as an
open source project and as a company
first version of xwiki came out in in
February 2004 the focus of X wiki is to
build large-scale structured wiki so
what is exactly a structured wiki will
will see a little later just quickly it
is not only managing content but it's
also managing structured data and also
external data coming from outside
applications so I'm Ludovic I'm the CEO
I'm I used to work at Netscape from 96
to 98 where I worked a lot on
collaboration and publishing of
information it used to work with
document management system and then I
worked in a French startup net value
which was in 2002 acquired by Nielsen
night ratings which is the leader of
Internet measurement using various
method and especially panel based
measurement and in this company we we
used a lot of Java technology but we
also needed to work on our collaborative
tools and this is where in two thousand
we discovered the wiki as a concept to
share information and it it replaced our
document management system was a great
success and this is how i was introduced
to wikis following that I I wanted to
work on on wiki and open source and in
building X wiki
to introduce more advanced features on
top of standard wiki was was the
objective Vincent our CTO is a has
joined xwiki a year ago and is a is a
longtime open source committer he's an
Apache PMC he has created the open
source project cactus cargo worked on a
few books on J unit and maven he is a
maven committer and he has drawn xwiki
to to take in charge the evolution of
the open-source platform we are
distributed development team about 20
people now in five countries we have
contributors working on on various
extensions of a cookie we've been
participating in the google Summer of
Code thank you google for three years
and we have had a few project and
actually two of them are part of our
demonstration from that from this year
xwiki has about 15 releasing in three
years it's not it's now in version 11
it's been in production with our beta
version for about the mid-2004 our
distribution model is both is very first
open source lgpl license giving a strong
freedom to to users to actually use it
and package it in their in their own
systems and extended but we also
distribute as packaged software with
subscription services and as a hosted
services and service and software as a
service offering xwiki has more than
5000 active wikis out there in companies
on our hosted services and that we host
ourselves and now we currently have
about 100 enterprise customers including
very big ones we have total in France
this is a one of the top five companies
in the world when you look at market cap
and we have users like air force very
very big companies include
tech companies mantra violence company
is also using its wiki for that
community so we this is this will stop
the slide where and we will focus on
demoing the different solutions so
Vincent is going to demo the the wiki
and what structured wiki is and how you
can develop application with with this
structured wiki and then i will i will
show additional applications and until
showing how far you can go actually with
building applications and not even
realizing that your have a wiki under it
vincent yours ok hi everyone so are you
are you all x we key users yeah you
familiar with wikis yeah anyone familiar
with judd spot here yes ok so Lex wiki
is an advanced wiki ms tran spot an
application what we call an application
wiki so what we're going to do in the
demo is we're going to start slowly with
a first generation wiki but we'll go
quite quickly over that because you
probably all familiar with that and then
we'll quickly go into the recording
capability of X wiki and how we build
small application with it and then we'll
show extensions of X wiki and advanced
applications that no completely are
complete full fledge applications so
first in term of default wiki so I have
a my machine here a local version of X
wiki I'm running the the same content as
on the X wikidot or website which is our
community website for open source
development and and we're going to look
at the features here and see what we can
do with that X wiki so let's start
slowly page anything that's the typical
feature I'm just going to show you maybe
some different things that that we do so
that's a typical page which we can edit
for example we can edit in we WYSIWYG
mode so we have a wiki mode and a
WYSIWYG mode in in WYSIWYG mode we have
no no normal editing as you may find in
other wikis
interesting thing that we've noticed is
that it's usually quite hard to create
links in wiki so for example you don't
know to what you want to link to link to
exactly so you have forgotten the name
of the page so we've got a wizard for
doing this for example so if i highlight
a keyword and then i click on the link
keyword then you see I have a dialog box
where I can click create links to wiki
pages to web leadings file attachment
and so on and in here I can browse
should buy space I can do a search if I
want to find a page I have the recently
viewed pages recently modified pages so
it's very easy to actually create a link
to any place and see we have the links
here okay so that's a typical editing
nothing nothing fancy here and let's go
back to the features so we can do a lot
of other typical things like like copy
rename documents so that will rename all
the backlinks leading to the page that
you're renaming we have version control
of course so versioning all all the
pages including versioning attachments
we have a powerful right management
where you can actually set right at the
page level at the space level and also
at the wiki level and four and we have
about five rights you know the rights to
view to edit to delete and a special
rice for programming because you can put
programs in in scripts in pages so we
have a right to restrict this since we
can do them for things I have an issue
here is that it's not responding our why
okay good okay one interesting feature
that I wanted to show you is the ability
to skin xwiki and so an X wiki skin is
actually a full replacement of
everything you see so you're actually
able to modify everything you see on the
screen it's a I'm going to show you some
example to how far we can go in most
wiki's you are able to do some skinning
but usually you're are quite limited in
exactly what you can change here you can
shut the whole UI actually the whole UI
is itself based on an X wiki core which
provides an API and the full UI is based
only on that API and it's all located in
pages in documents so you have the
ability to edit the documents and modify
completely not the layout of food waking
so we have some users who have done all
sorts of of customization on wikis so
for example this is a wiki use as a
merchant website so this one's called
best vault we it's it's aggregating data
cells data from different vendors such
as you know amazon calc you and others
and displaying them here so you see that
doesn't look any more like a wiki
actually if you didn't know that it was
a wiki you wouldn't you wouldn't guess
but if you but for the person managing
this website you know they can go in
when once the login then they've got the
ability to the same easiness of
modifying data and adding new stuff to
to the wiki and including doing this
collaboratively yes by using it only as
CMS manage their site now that's a
public website do they expose some
weekly features their users as well in
this so in this example they doing babe
it will be some some favorite or this
kind of things comments below things
like that okay and we have other example
just to show you the skinning feature so
this one it's it's an e-learning website
called karoke org and it's again it's
the layout is completely different it's
just good to show you and we have a few
few others and we're going to show you a
few other applications afterwards
showing this feature so let's go back so
now so this is this is what we call
first generation we G have some issue on
this page doesn't load deeply well so
now let's the next step is to go to the
second level which is the programming
part and see how we can customize
further a wiki with ex wiki so in terms
of development features advanced what we
call advanced features so we've got the
ability to put script in pages and we
supporting two scripts languages one is
velocity and the other one is groovy and
I'm going to demonstrate that on a very
simple example actually this website
that you're looking at has a lot of a
lot of velocity scripts in it to perform
various kind of small applications so
for example we have a what we call codes
on here on this website that lists
contribution from external contributors
about code snippet which are portion of
code that can be put in pages in script
we've got macros we've got plugins
applications where it will describe this
concept of applications a little bit
after and I'm just going to show you
something for example this page here
lists all this code snippet that you can
find on this wiki and it is dynamically
generated it's not
if i'm going to edit this page and you
will see that there is that are coded
we're actually using the xwiki api to
perform some search on documents and
then aggregate that data on on a page so
if i did in week in wiki mode I'm going
to yeah if you is it too small here can
you read that so you see we're starting
with some some wiki syntax here this is
a title and then some text and this is
where it comes becomes interesting so
this is velocity so we're doing we're
doing a query here so this is using HQ
and hybrid query language as the syntax
and what we're doing is we're looking
for all documents which have a an object
of type snippet class attached ok and
then we are calling this API search
document on this query and then for if
there are some elements then for each of
them we're displaying in as a list ok so
this is completely generic and here is
it just one example but you've got
access to the full API so you can do
things like this me the links of that
page the backlinks of that page any
document that I've been created by such
person at that time matching this
keyword or whenever you want to can
dynamically create new pages in
scripting you can access to the macros
directly for getting RSS feeds for
example whatever you want you have a
full access to the full to the full API
here and so this is in velocity you can
have the same in in groovy
so I mentioned some object attached
webpage so this is a powerful feature of
X wiki is we have the ability to attach
metadata to documents the normally
document typically is just some text
possibly with some attachment in X wiki
you have actually you have the
possibility of adding objects and I'm
going to show that to you in a moment
and the object can be just anything and
it can be for example it can be a tag I
know if you want to tag a page that it's
a tag object that you can attach to a
page this is our we deal with rights
also then if you want to set right at
the page level that will be a right
subject attached to a page in our
example of of snippets we had a snippet
object attached to a page so this adds
metadata to page and to the pages and
then we have with the API we can
corridos metadata to display them inside
the run when the page is rendered so for
example the a snippet that i was showing
to you before it's actually so this is a
sitting this this is a snippet and if i
look at the the content in Wicca mode of
this page you would say that what we're
doing here is with just including
another page and this other page what's
called snippet class ship is a page is
generic and that knows how to render any
document that has a snippet attached to
it so in that way we're able to create
structured data by creating a snippet
class which has some properties i'm
going to show that to you just now and
then using that in different places so
that people can actually enter structure
data and be displayed as structured data
for example if i go to that that snippet
class and i edit it
so what I'm editing here it is actually
you see some it's a form here and it's
not the standard wiki it's because
automatically X wiki has detected that
this page add an object attached to it
so it's showing us into the object
editor deform editor sorry directly so
we can edit the content of the form so
this is if this feature allows us to
create a lot of mini applications in the
in the wiki so before I show you other
applications I want to want to show you
how to define a snippet class for
example and we have
we have a class editor allowing you to
easily create new new classes in the
wiki
so in our in our case it's the country
is the snippet class
so you remember when I edited that that
page there were different feels and so
we finding the fields here though there
was an explanation field and this is the
definition of it so we have it it's it's
a text area 75 characters by five lines
when I edited I was editing it in text
mode because it says text here I could
have rendered it with a WYSIWYG editor
and then there are all the other
properties there was language code
results and so on and it's easy to add
properties you know can just type a
property here and we have different
poverty types so we can add a number can
a string text area list dynamic list
coming from database so you've got a you
know the possibility of praying
structured data about almost every every
type of data and so you create this
source a snippet class like this is it
just a simple page but you've edited it
with the class editor and by doing this
you know xwiki knows it's a it's a
special page that has a class inside and
then when you go into any other page you
just attach an instance of this class to
your page and and just instantly and you
got the ability for users when they edit
the page to enter data following the
model here yes Patrick
the class is for only one so document
can have 11 class however when you're
using the class and instance of that
class and document and you can have
several objects of that eats em class if
you want for example the comment is an
object so you can have as many comments
as around very freaky that you she did
refer to put a good sleep girls I will
you come on our comments each of them it
can have it as leopard object and it can
have comments object and it can have
right subject we can have any of them
okay everyone so you can have several
classes yeah but what wins it meant was
document can have only one classics for
the definition part when you want to
define its unique in terms of definition
but yes the document can have as many
classes associated with it we call that
have having as many objects as you want
of any class type okay here remain one
that you use for well that's the include
that is a that is in the content
then we'll design how you regulate you
can actually do a sheet that will render
multiple classes in the same view yeah
so I'm going to show you some other
example of small applications that we
have in this wiki so for example if I go
to the news area see here I have a blog
and the blog is actually a small
application built exactly in the matter
as the snippet that I was showing
earlier it's not it's not hardwired into
the xwiki core actually next week across
as just the API and everything that you
see all the applications like no to blog
the photo album even the search or the
creation of RSS feeds all of these are
actually just pages that are using the
API so for example in this blog if I
look at this blog entry here it's a and
if I edit it you will see that it's a it
has actually an object attached to it a
blog when we call an article object
attached to it and which has some title
category and content and and some
extract and if I look at the content on
the in term of wiki you'll see you will
find what we've seen before I'm just
including a generic page that knows how
to display a blog actually I can edit it
just to show you it looks and this is a
generic page and again using velocity to
access the content of an object attached
to a page and to display it so easy
using some deep class here you know
posted by so you see you again we using
the API for example to get the local
user name on the dog creator formatting
the date and so on okay so this allows
us to have this this blog feature for
example
sorry we have I'll show you just one
other one more and then we'll go to more
advanced things so this this powered by
X wiki page for example allows allows is
a small application it allows users of X
wiki external users to actually
contribute how they're using X wiki so
we've got a ticket table and always the
the project organization how they using
X wiki and people can just add a new one
so if I want to add a new project here I
just click here and and and then I go
into a you know the form edition mode
where I can enter information by my
project how i use it i can even replace
the image and so on so this is a small
application not going to save it here
so you see we have a few and and if I
click on one then I can view I can view
it what's interesting again is that all
of this is just built in pages so you
can do any type of query that that you
want to display the way you like you
have full control on what you want to
display inside inside the wicked now we
have one interesting feature also is the
ability to packaged applications and to
import and export applications so an
application is just a set of pages and
we can group them together export them
so that in your wiki you can actually
import external applications which are
set of pages that do something like the
blog thing is an application the search
feature is an application and all of
them can be application so you can
create so you can have some kind of
admin person more advanced in term of
scripting for example you create
applications and then others can just
reuse them for it for example so I'll
lead Allah lettin a little weak come and
show you some some few things that we've
done with this google summer of code
that extend next week
so what's really powerful about this
approach is that there is nothing
actually in xwiki that you cannot do so
through not yet cannot do without the
the web interface everything can be done
through the web interface defining new
classes defining objects scripts
presentation and there is nothing that
actually almost nothing that cannot be
done in terms of you I so you have full
control so so you you don't have
limitations by using such a tool and you
can do everything through the web
interface and the second thing that is
really important is that everything is
in the same storage concept per page and
the page is a is a is a well defined
object that can be exported many ways it
can be exported in XML it can be stored
in multiple ways and what this allows
it's pretty interesting because you can
go further than you can for example
think about replication and things like
that because the entity for everything
is pretty simple and when we talk
replication we're not only talking about
replication of the data we're talking
about replication of the application and
its logic so you have a wiki where you
actually can modify your application and
you could replicate it to to another
week and another use and that's pretty
interesting so now what I will show is
one of the google Summer of Code
projects that we're done this year which
is a an integration with Google Docs and
Google spreadsheet in particular well we
love google spreadsheet and we don't
have enough time to actually build the
spreadsheet inside xwiki so what we
thought is well let's see how we can
mash it up and use that together and so
what we what the objective was is okay
let's sync we have a table in the wiki
and we have a little macro that allows
to do some small calculations but there
is nothing like the spreadsheet you I to
actually work on your spreadsheet and
decide what calculation you want at six
like that so I have this this
little content so I actually installed
the the the plug-in yesterday on the
plane wiki it's not in the standard
distribution so I installed a few jar
files and an activated the plug-in and I
I get this running so if I if I edit
this page now what I see is that I have
a I have a table so wiki syntax table so
with four lines and i have a total
number and actually then the numbers say
zero here and let's forget about that
part it doesn't really matter if I if I
go back and I have two buttons that were
added by the plug-in so this first
button is edit so I will click on edit
here and so there is a security page
that will ask us to give rights to
transfer data from the from the ex wiki
server to the google account and and we
we load the data in the in the
spreadsheet and so this is going over
the network and we need to wait a little
bit until that happens we would like we
would have loved to do that a little
faster but there are some improvements
needed to do that so then I it
automatically opens my spreadsheet
application and I get this actually I
see that I don't have I don't have that
in most i have this number like I can
actually say some of this and I can i
can insert a new number here i can say
italy
200 and I can save and close yes when
you when you granted access what did you
do exactly just Google document well
when I when I when I clicked on that
granting button it a try it transferred
data so the server execs wiki server got
a token from the granting and use that
token to send the extra key data to an
existing spreadsheet unfortunately
because of the API we could not create a
new spreadsheet so we have to have a
predefined spreadsheet that we reuse all
the time so legit need to exist we
cannot create new ones at this point
well no we looked at it and it was still
not possible I mean there's some cases
it's the problem is we can actually do
it we can create it but it's not
available right away unless you go and
spreadsheet so there was a slight bug
about that so that stopped us from doing
that but I mean the api's are pretty new
and it's kind of normal that that we're
learning through through that phase the
thing is we were able to do the complete
process which is very interesting but
there are there are improvements to to
actually put that all in production if
you want that fast on big spreadsheet
for example so actually so I click back
when it closed my window and I click
back to say reload and it reloaded the
data from the spreadsheet and I actually
see so here my line additional line is
here and I see that I've actually my
calculation that is here and so what we
did here is that we not only store the
number but we also store the calculation
the the function so now what's
interesting I can change the number here
300 can save so now what happens is that
my my my total did not change and so my
total is actually wrong here but I have
this little button effects and I click
and it will actually automatically go to
spreadsheets to
and this actually doesn't even need a
google account for the user the google
account is for the server that time so
you have only one google account one
spreadsheet and you can do these
calculations you send it to spreadsheet
you calculate you get the data back and
so if i went a little bit i will have my
table come back here and i have my my
calculation which is good again now
what's interesting is that we can
continue a little bit the mash up here
and we can use a feature that we have in
nick's wiki which is called a chart
wizard and and i can actually create a
data source so i can say i want the data
source hear of this document in the wiki
i can say i want this data choose a
table but not take the whole table just
part of the table i can tell it to
ignore non digits that can be useful if
you have for example financial numbers
and you put a dollar sign or a que sign
to count for 100,000 so here i have my
data source then I say next I can say I
want a pie I want it 3d I say next so
here I can say financial results and I
can play a little bit around with the
colors changing the color so there is a
whole wizard allowing you to do that I
can just sit finish here and and hear
what happened is that a macro was
inserted in the page which is editable
but also the the macro called looked at
the table took the table transform it to
xml data and gave it to a java module to
render the chart and make an image and
put the image in cash and this all
actually happened in half a second which
is pretty fast and this is live actually
now so I don't need to actually reuse
the chart with it I can just change the
numbers here 700 or 1500 and I can save
and my 1500
he shows up on UK here so this is live
data automatically we can even imagine
going further their the route here we
could get the data from the database
generate the the wiki table and call the
chart wizard to to render that we can
also go in Google Docs spreadsheet edit
the data save it and restore it in the
wiki and the charge will change of
thematically so now this is a this is a
bit of mashup what's really interesting
about these mashups and why we're
interested in wikis about about mashups
between data and things like that is
that what we believe is that what's very
important is putting data in context
data without context does not mean
anything in content without context does
not mean anything and that's what we can
have been successful at Winkies I've
been very successful at putting data
into context links linking them giving
access to content and linking to another
content and that's that's really
powerful and if you look at mashups you
can do the same thing with daytime you
can do that with the enterprise data the
existing data lots of companies have
data sitting in erp or CRM software that
nobody actually access is easily and
once you you give them you give a nice
way to access that in the wiki you you
can have very powerful things happening
so that that's the google doc so this
actually is a pretty simple application
in terms of X wiki features it's mostly
plugins and using the chart and these
different modules in X we keep now I'm
what I want to show is a much much more
advanced application that is using a
quickie feature and that is using a an
interesting part of X wiki that we
haven't talked about is that this the
model the data model which is the wiki
pages the icky pages which is as I told
before a very well defined model well we
we gave it we gave access to it not only
through the scripting API in the wiki
pages
but we also gave access to it using Ajax
and we use the google web toolkit for
that and we mapped we map the almost the
whole API on our documents using google
web toolkit so and this application is
is actually using that this application
is a is an RSS reader which has the
objective of being used by by by
companies and groups of people to work
together so it's a collaborative RSS
reader it has not the objective of being
a personal RSS reader web RSS readers
like Google Reader much better that it
has the objective of being a
collaborative one where you can actually
work together on the same content and
where you can a tag and mark information
and what's more important is that you
can actually diffuse it you can send the
data out once you have found what the
interest of information is and for
example you can generate pdfs emails or
new RSS feeds based on the interesting
information so here what we have is this
is a UI that is loaded inside the wiki
it's a folder everything that is in the
box here from here to here is a google
web toolkit application fully
internationalized you can actually
internationalize it using a wiki page so
you can make a russian version by
translating one wiki page and what's
happening is first we have a we have a
feed feed feed reader feed plugin which
gathers feeds and creates wiki pages out
of them so every single article that is
retrieved in the in using the feeds is
one wiki page and is made accessible
through the through the google web
toolkit api so the google at tokyo api
allows you here to to look at the
different feeds it allows you here to
look another article so you can talk tag
the article here give it an interesting
tag or give it a comment
the comment will appear you have tags
here for example we have recorded every
block cetacean that the ex wiki project
gets or every press cetacean that it
gets what's interesting that you can
filter so for example here I click and I
say I want only the articles that have
been marked as interesting and this is
shared so everybody shares the same list
and so in our company different people
come and tagged interesting article
every day and and what's important there
is that we actually is sending it out so
here we can build a press review so i
can say i want to build a PDF but i can
also make an hour says feed but i can
build a PDF here of the interesting
articles so this is actually the
sameness that we see under here and so i
have that and then i say next and i can
generate this PDF and the interesting
part is that the PDF is fully generated
using a wiki wiki script so this part is
actually not Google what took it the PDF
is generated by the wiki engine which is
PDF capabilities and we can heavily
customized that so if you want a
different PDF look it's very easy to
actually change that you can change the
script to to have a different PDF look
so this is your PDF that that shows that
this tool has actually been used in the
presidential campaign in France for to
track everything that was said about one
of the candidates and you can send that
out in in the different teams here we we
can see that oya we don't see it because
it we don't have the yeah here we can
see that we we make a call every few
seconds to know if there are new
articles that arrived so that's an ajax
called also so we can search of course
in there we can also do text and Isis so
for example here I can run so that's
using annex wiki plugin that's analyzes
text and it's going to find the most
used text in the inner articles that
were marked as interesting and so that
takes a little bit of time to
to be calculated that's calculated
server-side live and and then showed in
the culture so for example here of
course we're tracking a lot of things
about wikis so the most in most
important words our wiki X wiki and etc
to finish and show so this is this is a
google web toolkit API that is used
another application that is using this
google web toolkit api is a quickie
project cricket org which is education
it allows to create educational content
and reuse content so everything is
stored in wiki pages and individual wiki
pages can be reused in complete courses
and there is a google web toolkit
application that allows to to view the
course in a in one tree and have a very
easy to use interface to manage your
complex course which which can be 20 or
30 pages which can be a big tree of
information now the last tool that yes
what is the code look like
do I have a sample I had that here don't
think I can access that sickly basically
it is get me get me the list of document
that I give you a query and it gives you
a list of document objects and the
document objects have have exactly the
same API isaacs wiki so get object get
property and well it's not exactly the
same one because you can you can't
actually do exactly the same one for
example we have one new API which is a
search documents but get me give me all
the content in one shot because you in
script basically what we do is give me
the list of matching documents and then
for each document I actually asked for
the document because that's efficient in
GWT you want to only have one one query
over the internet so so basically you do
ok give me the list and give me the
actual document so it's it's serialized
in JSON and then you have a Java object
the java objects is a little bit
different then the Java object that we
used in on on the server side first
because it doesn't make kovacs it can't
it's only a data object it's pure so
it's a pojo and and it also has some
helpers for example their stuff that
usually we only do when we when we want
for example fabricating a URL of that
document in view mode okay what's the
URL of that document in human usually
what we do is when you need it you call
that your app and we will put the HTTP
we'll see what the circuit engine name
is and then we lads will add that stuff
now in in GWT what we do is that this is
pre-generated on the server side and put
in the document object because for the
sake of efficiency but it's pretty
similar so it's get object get comments
number and things like that yet so too
long to go to code actually here so the
last thing we wanted to show is another
google summer of code project
which is an eclipse plugin what many
people have told us including in our
team is that why it's very nice to be
able to do everything through the web
interface it's very powerful because we
have one server everybody works off the
same server and we can build an
application and read in very short time
but we lose a little bit of productivity
compared to two IDEs especially with ID
is having refractory and all these
features and opening a web page is a bit
long when you editing code so what we
have been working on is an eclipse
plugin so you can actually connect to
your wiki so here you you just ask it to
connect to the wiki you say this so it
asks you which spaces you want just tell
that you want all spaces and then you'll
have your you have your wiki here so for
example my google docs page that I was
working on here I can double click on it
and I have the content and here i can
modify it I just say save and I can go
back here and if i go back sufficiently
i can reload and i have 500 instead of
300 that shows up which is the number of
modified here and what's interesting is
that i can actually go offline so i can
tell ok get get me all that space so
when it's green it means i have it
locally so i can actually go offline
here and log out so here are my flying i
can make modification save so if I
reload here I don't see the modification
and here if I now if I synchronize I
screen again and it has synchronized my
application so that that's pretty
powerful in terms of time one to edit
the the content of the wiki and this is
a direction that we will enhance so that
we can have code completion and coloring
syntax coloring especially for the
different scripting sin taxes that we
have to to help out
just to finish other things that we're
working on in the future is a we have we
have to research projects one of them is
we participate in the nipple MOOC
project which actually had a tech talk
two weeks ago here which is semantics
semantics desktop and aims to bring
semantic capabilities to desktop
application and also including wikis in
the loop and now we're part of that
bringing its wiki and semantic features
and the wiki also bringing the content
of the wiki to the semantic application
so what does it exactly mean it it means
that if you're if in your pages you add
semantic markers to your content for
example you type a name and you you mark
it saying that it's a name the semantic
desktop application will be able to
index the wiki and extract the
information what's interesting is that
extra key already has a lot of
structured data its object and
everything so a user is well defined it
it's wiki so it can provide that right
away to the semantic desktop system
provide the structured data so you don't
even need to add the markers on users
you also have the you already have the
information so you can mix and match
both system and the semantic system can
include that so we're part of that
project and working on integrating the
wiki with that the second research
project that we're working on so nipple
MOOC is a european funded project and
the second project we're working on is a
french research project where we are
working with inner ear and other labs
like tara company and what we're doing
is a peer-to-peer x wiki and mobile
access so the objective is how to give
more access to wikis in mobility
situations and and on on when you're on
the road one of the main problem is what
we realize in terms of business is that
wiki's have groats very well in tech
teams and so lots of people say oh it's
because the wiki syntax is complex and
so WYSIWYG is a solution to that but we
put with your wigan it still has a very
good inroads and tech teams will still
not as
notch in the other teams and what you
realize when you look at it you realize
that tech teams are not moving that much
they're almost always in the in the
office always connected and when they
are not connected they always know how
to find a way to connect Wi-Fi let me
find a Wi-Fi network and everything what
you realize that the sales team they
they're always on the road and they're
not connected and they don't know that
much how to connect themselves and and
that's actually a big problem for wikis
is that you cannot access that content
easily yeah we thought about it the
thing is for us Google gears does not
enough capabilities what we think is
that when you look at the rendering of a
page it's pretty a lot of work and you
would need to do that all in JavaScript
to actually use Google gears or you need
to add extend your plug-in what we think
is that we need we need more of the
logic we need more the logic that the
wiki can do on the server side we needed
more on the desktop side actually we can
already install Linux wiki on the
computer that's what we do here and
since we can replicate this we have
already XML API is where we're very
short from replicating and this is what
the project is about well it's the
project is even more about it's not even
about replication because if you have a
stand a server it's pretty easy to
replicate what we want is serving as one
of the objective is is is complete
surveillance replication so peer-to-peer
the and that's much more complex and you
need the advanced theories to handle
that to make sure that whatever the
merging happens it's going to give the
same result in the end and this is what
inria is working about and they have
technology for that and so we're working
on integrating that with ex wiki so
basically one of the main objective here
with surveillance is ax is that you can
even imagine two CEOs of companies
sharing a common wiki without even there
I teaching him having access to the
content so they can talk about merging
the companies without giving every
access to everybody
in the IT team that because that's what
happened with most of the
infrastructures is that you you have at
least somebody that can access that
content in case of a problem and and
well the best way to not giving access
is only keeping it on the computers of
the people that should have access to it
and this this is what server less
replication could do for example yeah
we're going to make suppose I mean it's
not it's not because we can do server
ties that we will always do service it's
of course when it's easier you can you
can actually keep it with us with a
central server so we want to be able to
do a bit a bit of all the systems so I
think that's about all so if there is
any other questions
well thank you very much and thank you
very much for hosting us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
