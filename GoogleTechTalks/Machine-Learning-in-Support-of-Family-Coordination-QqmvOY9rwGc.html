explain Who I am and where I came from
before coming to the research questions
that I wanted to talk about so before I
became fascinated by research I spent
seven years with an interaction design
practice and during that time I had the
fortune to work with many wonderful
collaborators that I had a very small
practice until one day I received a
phone call that I'll never forget it was
from someone at America Online and I
said their name was was John Lennon and
naturally I was very suspicious and
called every one of my friends and said
I'd like to speak with John Lennon and
of course they all said he's not here
right now so anyway after midnight I
called the office and found out that
that that that's the there is in fact a
product manager at AOL called John
Lennon and he just found my work over
the internet and that was really my big
break and then afterwards I felt really
fortunate and was able to work on
advanced development of a variety of
projects and so just really quickly the
AOL project turned out to be a 30-second
short where I was hat animated their
logo and then American Greetings who was
also on the project got upset that I
didn't animate there's so then i worked
for SBC ameritech on their first
generation IP telephony product this was
sort of the maybe 10 years ago the
beginnings of what has been called
convergence today but this is something
that's probably hard to remember because
this was a product that only made sense
when your internet blocked your
telephone line so anyway it's not in use
today but it was a big product at that
time and I also was able to create a
product for example with for TV Guide
and this is something which helped
parents and children communicate about
the kinds of television they were
watching and so we created this view
meter in collaboration with a child
psychologist and this is I think the
thread that connect my work is this
fascination with technology the way
people communicate and families and that
really brought me to my boo I'm sorry I
have one surprise for Patrick Barry in
the audience who is at my on the same
team as me during our masters project
and we worked on a an email prototype
that was immediately obsolescence with
an email and in the body of an email
client and create a lightweight task
management system apparently I have a
few more and and then I also worked on a
tangible email device for senior
citizens that tried to replace the
metaphor of the computer with something
that they understood the book and here's
the actual prototype that got built on
the Builder I love to make things by
experimentation ok enough of a sort of
an introduction let's really talk about
the subject of interest today which is
about family routines and coordination
so I became interested in routines
because as a subject they exert and I
think undeniably strong influence over
so many things that we do every day for
example let's just see in the room how
many people took the same route to work
today that they take every day yeah
pretty much of it so maybe they'll task
the other way did anybody not and are
you having a non routine day Johnny
okay so a non-routine event so i think
behaviorally there are the social habits
of routines exert very strong influences
on the things that people do and yet at
the same time if you look at the
subjects that as computer scientists
we've considered within the domain of
modeling routines are I think a lot less
present and I think we have had two
strong cautions that have pushed us in
this direction I've listed two of them
in very small type at the bottom of the
screen so I'll help elaborate them the
first is from anthropologist Lucy
suchman in her ethnic rafi of office
work in 1983 and I think Lucy said that
maybe routines don't even exist but if
they do exist they'll be really hard to
model and then in the ubicomp community
Peter tomia and his colleagues at
europark came out with a beautiful
documentary or ethnography of home life
in 2002 that really gave some strong
cautions about even if routines did
exist that they'd be hard to understand
so even if that they're hard for people
to understand let alone for machines to
understand and so I think again placed a
very strong caution against the notion
of computational modeling routines and I
feel like this has caused us to avoid a
topic that has huge potential and I'd
like to re-examine how routines might be
used and I think if we look at the grain
size and understand enough about the
domain we really can find that some
routines will be succumb to the advances
in computational modeling and then I
think for people interested in design
families there's this huge question of
so what what do we do with this
information
and I'd like to try and answer both of
these questions today or at least take a
stab at it and then have a conversation
with everybody in the room about the
ways in which the work can continue so
in order to do this I decided that I was
going to focus on the logistics of dual
income families and demonstrate that
routines could be modeled in this domain
and that we could do something with this
information and I think this I chose to
Dueling from families for several
reasons first if you ask oh I'm sorry
looks like I've given a little
foreshadowing of some of the answers so
if you ask what's that does it break it
dang so if if you do look at the kinds
of things that I'm going to show that we
can do with no supervision and just
using a mobile phone as a data collector
that bill you said 90 but them that you
can without a really complicated model
since when parents pick up their
children and drop them off with about
ninety percent accuracy which is you
know a pretty nice number in the sensing
world if you then try and look a little
bit more further and say what about if
we could predict who's driving to any
given activity well again simply with
observables and at an unsupervised model
and using realistic online learned data
you can get an accuracy of about eighty
eight percent and I'll show why that is
a little bit further on so if you then
say well what are the things that we can
do with that well really simply parents
are constantly in communication trying
to make sure that they know who's
getting picked up when so like a very
simple example is if you're able to
detect when a pickup or drop up has
happened that a parent is interested
just let them know so this is just a
conceptual idea not a literal design but
hey if you're looking for this
you keep calling one another we can let
you know literally automatically
similarly if we can predict what
activities are happening at what
location and who's driving then we can
automatically generate a view of the
plan and so this is something that while
happens intrinsically in many families
every day is really articulated and in
fact the fact that they are not
communicated expressly is one of the
causes of many communication problems
that I'll get you or many coordination
problems i'll get to and lastly if you
start to take a more sophisticated
approach with what you can do with
prediction you can forward chane what
your information is about the current
state of the world and pick up some drop
offs that you know are going to happen
and create a view a flowchart view like
this that I call the family time flow
that really shows not just what everyone
is doing but what their intentions are
as both predicted and expressed by them
and I think a mixed initiative way it
would be the right approach this okay
well that's we're going to get to that
in the end let me just take a quick
minute and say why I think this is a
subject worth looking at at all so in
order to to come to this idea I spent a
year with 22 dual income families and
did a variety of both ethnographic
studies and design activities with them
and I think the main takeaway for those
parents with children this is not really
the news but managing all the details
for the rides for children can be
difficult in other words all the places
everybody has to be with all the stuff
every day on time is a challenging
problem and one that causes parents
actually quite a bit of anxiety and it's
a good problem to choose for the purpose
of studying routines because families
actually rely on
teens so they're a big part of their
everyday lives and then it's a hard
problem because life's not always
routine so what are the consequences
when parents aren't on top of things
well first is this experience of anxiety
breakdowns lead parents to feel like the
day is just out of their control and
it's a experience that causes parents
often to not be able to engage with
children or to be a little bit irritated
when they are because they got to focus
on getting kids to the place they need
to be or fixing plans instead of
enjoying watching a soccer game so
parents accommodate for this by staying
in communication very frequently and I
think the worst case scenario every time
I see this that it makes this slide it
makes me sad is the the worst-case
scenario is that kids get left at
activities so this is this is a real
phenomena there's a nice study if you're
interested in it further listed at the
bottom by Israeli anthropologists neezy
and mr. Keeney that studied the
phenomenon and actually an economic
model that they tried to incentivize
parents to make it happen less and it
interestingly happened more and then
Chuck Dara did a actually about a four
year long study of dueling from families
in Silicon Valley published a book in
2009 the whole first chapter is about
this anxiety so it's real and I've
considered a worst-case scenario but
it's also one that I think we can create
a new service that hasn't existed before
to be able to address so let's think
about this what can be done about this I
think so in order to answer this
question I spent six months prototyping
with dueling from family
but this is not the kind of thing that
you can prototype at a desk with paper I
think it actually requires a very
different kind of prototyping and
there's a really important reason here
for that and it's because families
coordinate in the real world and so
assumptions that we're going to make
about something that a system might do I
think you'll find might or might not
hold true in the real world as their
remotely coordinating experiencing
stress or experiencing just their
ordinary social roles so let me explain
what I mean by this I spent six months
with 18 families and developed a design
method of experience prototyping called
user enactments I'm very excited that
user enactments is now part of the
curriculum at mhc-i curriculum at CMU so
user enactments are a way to first try
and create as low fidelity and I mean
low fidelity a simulation as possible so
this is a car what you'll notice is it's
a desk with a chair it's hard to see in
the projector but the steering wheel is
actually a lamp in fact what's in the
middle of it is a light bulb and so it's
just we unscrewed the light bulb put a
piece of round foam board over it
screwed the light bulb back in maybe
that was unsafe and then it in front of
it is white board and we just drew
traffic on it now this seems implausible
that you could create realistic
scenarios in this kind of situation I'd
suggest you try it because it's amazing
how with such little effort and you can
create scenarios where for example we
had a mom in this seat and her daughter
next to her and we we had the husband
hall and try and explain that he needed
to her to change her plans and the
daughter was speaking and the mom said
hush hush honey mommy's driving okay so
it really it affects people and
especially when you put them in a
situation where they're with their
children and you ask them to pretend
they're in a hurry where they have a
responsibility that's hard for them to
accomplish so anyway here's another
example of a user enactment here the
walls again this is a home just foam
board here we're taking advantage again
of a wall then the far wall is a
whiteboard and I've just drawn on it in
appliances in marker now I've
highlighted them in this image because
it's a little bit hard to see but
basically we drew a refrigerator on the
whiteboard and were testing here having
a person interact with a smart calendar
and so if we wanted to bring their
attention to a particular date and test
the smart calendar well you can go build
a calendar prototype or you could put a
calendar on the wall and shine a
flashlight at it and it's a it actually
works pretty good at getting a sense of
how parents as you can see the home is
telling them that there's a conflict and
we're just shining a light so again
techniques like this when you work with
families I think have a couple of really
important qualities and I think this is
shouldn't be a surprise that we're
trying to create situations where we
make parents feel like they're more in
control but what user enactments and
experience prototypes accomplish that
ordinary prototyping does not is they
reveal that not just functional problems
so in other words if you look at the car
and try and figure out what's stressful
you'll probably especially if you're a
computer scientists think the answer is
this but I think one of the things that
you'll find is that there are social
role
that these problems exist within and
there's an interaction between
functional needs and social roles and
it's really important when you're
designing applications for the home to
understand that interaction and so I'll
just give you an example with some some
storyboards that we've drawn of other
user enactments so here's one that I
don't think is is that is a very
complicated scenario so in the first
panel the daughter gives mom a piece of
paper from school and it says you have
to bring snack on the 24th so mom puts
it on the refrigerator but of course it
just disappears in the mess of other
things on the refrigerator and then what
we've shown is a few days before the
event the smart refrigerator makes the
note more obvious and this serves as a
reminder so here we've got this
functional need mom needs to buy snacks
for the kids there's not really a
conflict with a social role in when you
test an application like this but what
if your idea is about something that's a
little bit closer to home so for example
one of the things that we saw parents
regularly say is you know getting little
kids out the door in the morning is
really hard it's a struggle it's one of
the biggest causes of stress it'd be
great if they could if this can happen
faster so we envisioned a cyber pet that
lives in the children's closet and helps
them get dressed in the morning now as a
design idea I think it's important to
just throw many ideas out there but what
was what you can learn from testing
something like this is that even though
a situation like this might solve a
functional problem of helping a child
get out the door faster in the morning
parents will also tell you after they
experience this
that you've stepped on their toes as
parents and so you've solved a problem
but you've forgotten about a social role
and I think parents derive pleasure from
and meaning from their lives when they
get to be parents and when i get to be
good parents so if you take away this
ability well maybe things are a little
bit easier in the morning but i think
you've actually created a very different
social context and i think this is the
kind of thing that individuals are going
to avoid so i'm not suggesting that
anybody go out and build cyber pets that
live in in closets but that when you do
have ideas that interact with issues at
home that this kind of prototyping
technique is a way to surface those
issues really quickly so what kinds of
problems did happen so in order to
really get a sense of what happens at
home and what things we might be able to
understand i worked with five families
in the local area over six months and
gave every member of the family a
blackberry mobile phone and collected
gps data on it on their movements and
then every other night of member of the
team or myself called the family and ask
them where all the places that they had
been what were the activities that
happened who made the pickups who may
have the drop-offs were they on time or
not so a lot of information and for
those of you who've done interview
studies 528 phone interviews is not a
small number of interviews to give
that'll that'll put some miles on the
car but so this gives us an exquisite
ground truth now just to remind
everybody from the machine learning
perspective I'm going to use this ground
truth to evaluate
the models i am not going to use it to
create a supervised model so having this
kind of data allows us to gain not just
a rich perspective of what happened but
to gain real examples of anomalies
instead of having to synthesize them and
inject them so one of the things that
collecting that much data allows you to
do for those of you who love data in the
audience this slide is for you you get
to see in great detail what the family's
life might look like if you wanted to
say for example how routine is family
life well in this visualization that I
put together time runs across the x-axis
and so you see all of the data collected
from spring through the summer into the
fall each row represents a different
activity and the activities are labeled
to the left that four people in this
family so they're grouped by individuals
and if an activity occurred on so each
column is a day if an activity occurred
on that day it's going to get a bubble
and the bubble will be gray if it
happened in a routine fashion blue if it
happened in a non routine fashion and
light blue and dark blue say whether or
not it was a non routine fashion but
something that you could see coming so
you get this beautiful yeah go ahead so
we defined just to for everybody who
wasn't in in this room the question is
how do you define what routine is so
with every family we sat down and
defined what a canonical routine would
be at each point in time and so every
week this was what something that got
refreshed and so as their routines
changed the definitions chains and so we
were comparing what they said was
routine with what actually happened
routine is a hard concept to define so
it's not an absolute but we're defining
it based on what they
leave their routines were and families
will definitely have an opinion about
things they usually do and it won't be
too far off from them based on our
estimations now I think you'll see in
this picture that were able to see that
for example something like school for
the Sun maybe I'll pick this up and move
over here something like school for the
Sun is a lot more routine but then
towards summer time you see lots of
non-routine events whereas the daughter
right school is pretty regular and then
finals times things start to become less
so there's just a lot less happening in
the summer time for the Sun dad his work
is a lot more regular than mom in this
particular family where mom is a nurse
so you can see every time you see some
gray and her life becomes normal her
scheduled shifts and then again it's
blue for a while until it becomes
routine as she defined it and then the
scheduled shifts again so depending on
the family the activity the time of year
I think they all suggest different
abilities for us to be modeled now what
how about at the much more detailed
level what happens that we can support
or that I think creates opportunities
for support so here is a shorthand that
I've been using to describe different
events and this is in that same family a
particular day so rows represent places
at time again is the x-axis and each
person's passage through time is
represented by a colored line so the dad
is green and the Sun is blue so when the
line is horizontal the person is at a
location so dad is at work from the
beginning of this graph until four when
a line is diagonal a person is traveling
between locations so that goes from work
to home
between four and four-thirty so the sun
is at school and then that fatter bar
represents track practice so very
specific events so this is how dad sees
what the routine is or what he believes
the family's plan is on a given day so
his son is going to be at school until
go to track practice and then come home
he's at the orthodontist appointment and
he I'm sorry he's asked to schedule an
orthodontist appointment and he thinks
my son's gonna be home at five-thirty I
can take him all right I'll schedule to
check out for six o'clock but it turns
out that what the Sun is really planning
on doing and what his routine is is not
what dad thought it was so the son has
his paper out and his paper out is
something that he does on Wednesdays the
day that this plan was was made and what
you see here his dad just didn't have it
in his active memory so it's not that
dad doesn't know his son had has a paper
route it's just that at the time he made
the plans it wasn't something that he
remembered it's as though your sense of
the routines of other family members are
this shared space but we don't always
see into it perfectly so what happened
well basically the Sun came home from
track practice and you know it was time
for his checkup and he said wait a
minute who's going to cover the paper
route so if this is the kind of thing
where it's there's a plan that is
scheduled to create a conflict I believe
this is something that we can detect in
advance especially under given that we
can build models of where people usually
go or who might usually pick them up
from another location another example on
Fridays
again the son goes to every day the sun
goes to track and then goes home at
five-thirty on Fridays dad usually goes
home from work and arrives home at two
so when there's a half day at school the
son thinks I could just go home and dad
will be there and he'll drive me to
track practice but it turns out that
what the Sun didn't realize is dad's a
member of the town baseball league and
he had to start helping prepare the
fields and so for a couple weeks now he
had been going instead of home from work
to baseball and so dad's actually not
going to be home and the sun goes home
thinking that he has a ride to track but
his dad's not going to be there so again
this is a very simple miscommunication
really or non communication because I
think there are many assumptions about
what other people what you believe other
family members are usually doing and
then especially on a particular day plan
to do so I think given our ability to
model regular behaviors and if people
could express plans we might be able to
create new kinds of systems so let me
turn the subject to what kinds of models
I think we can build so basically what
I'm proposing is that if you have these
situations like I described where
information breaks down right so people
think one thing but it's not actually
the plan and there are no resources that
exist to help them figure this out so
there wouldn't have been any way for the
Sun to figure out that his dad wasn't
going to be home because
dad never communicated that so I'm
proposing is that we can actually
synthesize these resources by
computationally modeling how people
usually move so um there are three
things that I'm going to show that
really underlie the modeling that will
then become the basis of the
applications that I'll show I've
developed so the first is just the
ability to sense that a ride has
happened so if you're going to be making
predictions about when rides occur it's
important just to be able to detect that
a ride has happened at all so in order
to do this I created just a really
simple temporal heuristic so if you
imagine and again just using GPS that if
the parent and child are traveling
together at one time together at a
second time stamp and then the parent
leaves the child stays up the place if
we sense those three events in
succession that's a drop off if a child
is at a location and the parent is on
their way there and then at time two
they are together for a brief time and
then they leave together then we're
going to call that a pickup so it's
really a very simple temporal model and
if you just pick that as your heuristic
and then evaluate using the ground truth
that we collected in the nightly
interviews you see that we're able to do
a precision value across all families
for pickups and drop-offs of around
ninety percent and your recall value is
ninety-five percent so you're you're
getting almost all of the actual pickups
and you're still doing a really good job
of predicting correctly the pickups that
you detect so given this a set of
ability this ability to detect pickups
and drop-offs you collect a historical
distribution
so this fancy equation really just says
let's always sum over the number of
times one parent drives as opposed to
all of the pickups that have happened so
it's the sum of the times the driver is
parent one at location n if the ride is
a pickup or dropoff on a particular day
of week over the sum of all rides at a
particular location so really just
creating a distribution and then have
this distribution which is it listed at
the bottom as a feature of a model that
again which just contains observables so
if we're just looking at where the
pickup is what is this a pickup or
drop-off what's the day of the week
what's roughly of the time of the day
and just use these features and then
build a model in an online format so we
can vary the amount of training data we
have which you see at the bottom and
always test on the week after the number
of weeks that we've collected so if
we're using two weeks of training data
will collect weeks one and two tests on
three collects weeks two and three tests
on four so as a sliding window equally
weighted so you can see that was just
one week of training data you can get
seventy percent accuracy of just
predicting who the driver is going to be
so in a family where parents are
contributing nothing if this is running
in the background and a week you're able
to get this kind of accuracy here we're
looking at this is the ability to
predict pickups and drop-offs and so any
events that where the children are
picked up or dropped off it can happen
many times in a day can happen once or
not at all I mean it just depends on the
family of the day the season the
activities number of children but this
is across all families of course it's
the model an outcome looks different per
family per activity and
after but nonetheless if you look at
four weeks you're getting again almost
ninety percent accuracy with predicting
which parent is driving and one thing
that I found very interesting that I'll
share is in shrinking this graph that's
kind of the x axis has become confused
but what I'm showing here is small
multiples of the number of training the
number of weeks of training data the big
number represents the overall area under
the curve and what the x-axis is weeks
one through twenty-four so what was the
test week so no matter how much training
data you use you can see that on almost
every one of these graphs there is a
drop that weeks 12 and week 18 so and
really what makes for training weeks the
highest number is that it's insensitive
to the first drop so what's happening
here that no matter how much data we
have for all families that at weeks 12
and 15 you're basically doing worse than
chance by trying to predict any guesses
about what happens at those times yeah
seasonal boundaries so we're going from
school into summer and then I'm week 12
and then week 18 that kids are coming
back from camp and parents have to take
kids to the doctor and get them ready
for school and go school shopping so on
those weeks we do really bad and so what
in trying to predict which parent drives
this is also inadvertently I think an
accurate seasonal boundary detector or
routine change detector so when not just
a single model but all the other models
become an accurate at the same time
that's what costed the performance go
down so one of the ways you'd increase
the performance overall is in sensing
that those events have happened that
your accuracy is really low and throwing
out the model
at week a week 12 starting it again so
how about lateness prediction this is
going back to the sad lonely little
child that I showed at the beginning so
given the information about how families
coordinate is it possible to create a
system that's actually able to predict
if a parent is going to arrive on time
well first of all what is on time mean
so we create a distribution of the
pickup times at each location and then
I'm going to we really need to pick an
arbitrary number and so here I'm picking
10 minutes if the parent is more than 10
minutes late we'll call this a late
arrival and this shows the distribution
in the data set that I have of late
arrivals of five families and six months
so they're 83 incidents now again this
is definitely arbitrary because for some
parents 10 minutes late is on time and
for other parents a minute late is late
so I'm the model can certainly vary but
given these parameters it I modeled this
using a graphical model basically a
Bayesian network the prediction class
for each parent remembering a pickup
I'll show an orange and then there's the
observables right basically the location
of the child where the parent is who's
traveling and then a few of the learned
models right the driver distribution
that we learned before destination which
basically is a predictive model that can
be done in a variety of ways and learned
lateness which again is a distribution
that we've collected based on our
observations of late pickups in the past
if you arrive late often you're more
likely to arrive late again so and then
put this together in this
fancy graphical model and it basically
represents well first of all it's
symmetrical because it repre- and at the
crossover nodes you have the
dependencies so for example their
location of the child the destination of
both parents depends on the location of
the child whether the parents are where
the parents are going D depends on R if
the parent remembers so the graphical
model is nice because it gets to show
the dependencies between parents in the
pickup process and it get that allows us
to model a hidden variable like whether
or not a parent has remembered this
pickup so how does this perform well
evaluating the performance of this model
at any given point in time it produces a
confidence that each parent is going to
be late or not and so what we can do is
show an ROC curve and will starting at
30 minutes before any pickup what we can
do is look at the outputs of the of the
model and then compare two positives to
false positives for people not familiar
with this model basically the number of
right guesses are shown on the y-axis
the number of wrong guesses on the left
on the the x-axis the chance is the
diagonal and so you basically want a
curve that is as close to the top left
corner as possible filling up as much
area and so here you see at 30 minutes
before a late pickup the model that I
described is not doing that much better
than chance and I think I can explain
this because most trips that most
parents took around that between the
hours of three and five were actually
less than half an hour so parents aren't
even traveling yet so it's hard to
assess whether or not they'll be late or
not but when you look at ten minutes
before the pickup time now your
trade-off becomes a lot more
positive so the overall area under the
curve is a point 801 so for every eight
guesses right you're now making two
guesses wrong and it gets better though
really not that much better and really
what we've defined as the ideal eight in
this time we're at about point eight to
now even though this is the definition
of when a parent should be late we don't
have a perfect model because the sensors
don't have accuracy are not one hundred
percent accurate all the time and we've
trained the model with data that
included the errors in the previous
models using a an online training format
for each one of the models so then just
lastly what can we do with this data and
these are the fancy visualizations that
I showed earlier so given that this is
the information that we have and are
trying to predict so where people are
what activities are happening and by
these I mean the and written activities
for kids soccer band piano and which
parent is making a pickup and dropoff
you can build a system that visualizes
what the families plan is moving forward
and so this is the current state of the
prototype for that system and so if
you're looking for example here and it
uses the same language in the that I
demonstrated before it's just a little
bit fancier colors and there's also
special symbols so you can see in this
particular visualization it's three
thirty in the afternoon and we know that
the yellow person and green or at work
the Sun is at school and the chubby
daughter is at school as well rock band
is an activity that the system is
predicting is there and yellow is the
pickup so the yellow parent is usually
making the pickup for this activity
similarly what the plan is is also
predicting is that the daughter and the
father green will go home and at
four-thirty the father will take the
daughter to karate but after karate the
predictions are less clear and so the
system just won't make predictions that
it doesn't have a confidence in so I
think this kind of system really can
work in a mixed initiative fashion so in
other words it'll make predictions and
based on everything that I'm learning
through the experiments many of them are
accurate but if not all of them will be
and so if the system shows incorrect
information a person can then simply
correct the system and allow them to
helping the system learn better and
correcting issues that were not
communicated before I think another
thing that this does is it helps just
clarify responsibilities that weren't
articulated and so when for example the
Sun the Sun went home thinking his dad
would be be there to pick him up the
model would correctly predict that Dad
actually wouldn't be there and show this
information to his son so I think it
creates a communication piece and a
shared space through which the family
can coordinate and the pieces of their
planning information that they don't
express it will help them to express by
having learned previous habits so you
can see it for predictions become a
little bit more confident it now says
dad's really going to pick the son up
from rock band leave from work at 5 45
it makes the predictions that after work
they'll go home and then once the pickup
has been made at karate and at
six-fifteen the system will predict that
everybody I'll go home and get dropped
off at home so with this visualization
I'm currently evaluating families do
data and presenting it to them and
asking them to navigate coordination
problems that we've set up in these
experience prototype scenarios that i
was showing that's going to remain
future work for now unless you guys are
interested in talking about it because
i'm happy to show you the results
because they're enormously positive but
what I think we can start to do is
extend this work to add other data
streams so I only looked at location all
of that modeling was based around where
people are but we also collected the
timestamps of telephone calls text
messages emails and so if you look for
example at the network of one particular
family where you can see you know really
in this family the mom and dad do all
the talking and then they communicate
the plans to the kids who are in the
middle versus this family where you can
see that actually one month one parent
does almost all the communication to all
of the children and that the dad here is
a much more smaller influence so you can
build networks based on the historical
call data and I think if we align the
network structure with for example what
we understand what we expect about
planning information or location
information it might give the added
ability to make new kinds of predictions
so hey this is the kind of set of call
patterns that look like something's
going on and they might have the system
become more aware or change the weights
of alerting preferences in cost-benefit
model here's another family for example
and so this research was really
sponsored originally through a grant
from google and then continued to the
NSF so
I thank you very much it definitely
helped pay for my education and really
appreciate it so and and the by the way
this is what I did with the money hey
and if anybody wants to talk anymore i'd
be happy to speak at some time and
thanks to robin and bill for the
invitations and i hope to hear more from
everybody thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
