and my dear job is being the head of the
school of personal growth in Google
University and one of the things one of
the main things we do is to take
advantage of the knowledge we gain from
the cutting edge of brain sciences and
use that knowledge to invent curriculum
to help Google's upgrade and transform
themselves yes that's what we do and we
hope that one day when we've when we
figure out how to make this look for
Googlers we can share this knowledge
with the rest of the world so that
everybody can benefit from personal
growth in the workplace and towards this
we are very delighted today to have a
man who deeply shares our goals and
aspirations dr. Daniel Siegel and it's
just like us except a lot smarter than
me then is a clinical professor at the
UCLA School of Medicine is a co-director
of the UCLA mindfulness awareness
Research Center and a co-investigator at
the UCLA Center for culture bred and
development he is also the director of
the mindsight Institute and the author
of the book mind sight the new science
of personal transformation in addition
to all that he is also the author of the
book the mindful brain or ender put the
other book the developing mind and
parenting from the inside out and ladies
and gentlemen let's welcome dr. Daniel
Siegel
Thank You mang I really appreciate the
introduction and being invited to come
speak with you today about what the mind
is and how we can create a healthy mind
it's really a fascinating idea to think
about what we know just intuitively but
yet we may not be able to define so
easily
what is our human mind so you may be
surprised to find in fact that fields
that study the mind like let's say the
field of mental health or even a field
like education where you help people
develop the mind the individuals in
those fields the educators in those
fields actually often don't have a
definition of the mind and as a
psychiatrist and trained as a researcher
in developmental psychology and working
the field of attachment looking at how
kids Minds develop what really struck me
as amazing in my own fields the gayatri
was that I was never given even one
lecture that defined what the mind is
also in the field of mental health we
had an orientation that lasted a long
long time which was that health is the
absence of symptoms and so you didn't
really have a working definition of the
mind and you didn't have a definition of
what a healthy mind would be it just
meant you didn't meet criteria for a
disorder so you must be healthy now this
is kind of strange so when I started
lecturing after the first book I wrote
called the developing mind came out
which tried to make a definition of the
mind that I'll share with you in a
moment what really struck me is amazing
and actually now I've had the
opportunity to ask in person over 80,000
mental health practitioners all around
the planet from every discipline of
mental health you can imagine psychiatry
psychology Social Work
occupational therapy psychiatric nursing
every field the numbers are about the
same and how many people in the field of
mental health do you think had even one
lecture defining what the mind is turns
out to be about two to five percent so
95 percent of individuals in the field
of mental health have never been given a
definition of the mind now when I
started working in the interdisciplinary
world of bringing different Sciences
together years ago the beginning of the
decade of the brain beginning of the
1990s
I brought about 40 scientists together
and they also didn't have a working
definition of the mind and yet our task
was to say what's the connection between
the mind and the brain which is what
we're going to talk about today and so I
offered them this definition and all of
them agreed on this definition which is
an amazing thing if you know how
academics works you usually don't find
convergence of an opinion but here
people agree with it and here's what the
definition I offered them was and I'll
give you an expanded one in just a
moment the simplest definition of the
mind that these scientists agreed upon
goes like this that the mind is a
process that regulates the flow of
energy and information now the human
mind happens in a couple of ways it
happens in a body of course it happens
it's embodied it happens through our
extended nervous system that's
distributed throughout the whole body
and I'm going to use the word brain just
to refer to that because extended
nervous system distributed throughout
the whole body is hard to keep on
repeating but when I say the word brain
that's what I mean but what's happening
now between me and you what's what goes
on right now or let's say in Google when
you allow people to have a transfer of
energy and information among them among
each other that's what you can call
sharing energy information so many ways
the mind is not just embodied it's also
relational okay so we can say then the
mind can be the
it's a working definition as an embodied
and relational process that regulates
the flow of energy information now you
may say well that sounds really natural
you may not agree you may agree but it's
actually a working definition and what's
really striking is when you sit down
with scientists who study the mind let's
say like psychologists or brain
scientists are interested in the mind
even philosophers who study the mind
which is what I've had the opportunity
to do here's the striking thing almost
none of them will define the mind and
they'll say things like the mind is
undefinable or the human mind shouldn't
be defined or will be limited if we
define it because we don't know
everything about it so what I say in
response to that is I totally get those
concerns but if we don't define a word
how can we actually use the word with
each other why would we have a word and
some people say well it's just a
placeholder for something we really
don't understand and that's okay and
then you're still in the dark you're
still doing what we've done in mental
health for all these years when you
define the mind as a process that
regulates the flow of energy information
it changes what you can do for defining
a healthy mind it also changes in a very
practical way the approach you can take
to strengthen the mind let me give you
an example if you buy into it just for
now the notion that the mind is a
regulatory process what does it take to
regulate if you say just on the simplest
level I want to take a person coming to
me as a friend or coming to me
professionally if you're a therapist and
I want to strengthen their mind at a
minimum what do you need to do what does
it take to regulate something anyone
here in engineering ok you need to
measure it you need to have some way to
measure or monitor the thing that you're
regulating and we're saying the thing is
energy and information flow so at a very
minimum you need to have a way to
monitor and measure maybe not
quantitatively but to assess
to monitor to observe that which you're
going to influence which is the second
thing in regulation if you're driving a
car and you're watching if someone has
tied your hands behind your back and
tied your feet together
you can't influence the thing that
you're trying to regulate so monitoring
and modifying are the two essential
components of regulation so once we
define the mind especially in this way
you get a new insight into how to
actually create a stronger mind you'd be
amazed but a lot of people live their
lives just having thoughts and feelings
beliefs and attitudes having hopes and
dreams and memories and perceptions all
the stuff that we can use to describe
the mind
those aren't definitions their
descriptions of mental activity but they
haven't developed the capacity to
actually observe those mental activities
as the flow of energy and information as
the mind itself so that process of being
able to see mental activity with more
clarity and then modify it with more
efficacy is something that you can name
with the word mind sight this ability to
actually see your mind not just have one
now it may sound kind of almost
simplistic but when you look at
different areas of research what you
find is that when mind sight is present
various ways of understanding mental
health are also present there's
something about being able to see and
influence your internal world that
creates more health I'll give you an
example let's say someone had a huge
feeling of anger going on inside of them
and they had no way of monitoring that
would the anger go away no they'd still
have anger right the anger would still
be changing their physiology but they
wouldn't have the capacity to have
what's called discernment to take a step
away from mental activity and notice I
have an
the anger would sweep them up and if
you're an eight-year-old on the
playground of a school and someone takes
your ball you may slug that kid right so
we've done studies at UCLA using using
mindfulness techniques one way of
teaching a way to monitor and modify
internal states and even in preschool
kids using certain very basic
mindfulness techniques we've been able
to show that you can decrease bullying
you can increase empathy you can
increase the capacity for kids to pause
before they act we've even done a pilot
study UCLA where if you teach
mindfulness techniques which I'll tell
you about in a moment you actually can
take people with attention deficit
problems where they can't regulate
energy information flow and you can
actually as adults and older teenagers
you can change the way their executive
functions of their brain function just
by teaching them mental training so what
I'd like to do is dive deeply with you
into this notion of once we have a
definition of the mind can we define a
healthy mind and then look at a way of
thinking about this and think well how
does this work in our personal lives how
does this work in a life where you're
involved in energy information transfer
around the globe how does it work in the
interface between a human being and a
computer these are all relevant areas
where understanding how you see the mind
and defining the mind may be of benefit
so the first thing we'll say is that in
common neuroscience there's a statement
that you may have read about which is
the mind is just the activity of the
brain how many of you have heard that
yep okay so if you read if you read any
of the really well-regarded
neuroscientist writers who either write
their research papers or write for the
general public this is basically what
said and I'm going to suggest you that
that view is only part of the story that
instead we can think of a triangle where
there are three points on this triangle
one point is the brain
the extended nervous system destroy
distributed throughout the whole body
which can be thought of as a mechanism
by which energy and information flow
then there's the point of relationships
which is where there's a sharing of
energy and information flow and then
there's the point of the mind which is
the process that regulates this flow and
these three points on the triangle have
arrows going in all directions so unlike
what you might read if you read common
neuroscience books where the arrow is
one direction these arrows in all
directions and it's not even as simple
as just there's the mind of the brain
you can't understand human experience
I'll have you consider without thinking
about relationships certainly my own
background as an attachment researcher
and a psychiatrist we see this all the
time that relationships shape the firing
in the brain and when neurons fire they
actually change their synaptic
connections with each other and so the
way we learn the way we grow the way we
develop is by experiences in addition to
genes shaping the synaptic connections
in the nervous system we know that
relationships shape those connections so
be way too simplistic to say as some
scientists do that genes explain all of
how someone develops I mean I don't know
why those scientists said because it's
actually proven not to be true Eric
Kandel won a Nobel Prize in 2000 so in
fact that the way experience works is it
changes the synaptic connections in the
brain by harnessing the power of genes
for sure but by experience directly so
what we have here then is the notion of
these arrows are going in all directions
now relationships can involve all sorts
of sharing of energy information you may
have had relationships with your
teachers in school which just talked
about ideas and concepts and facts and
externally based things or you may have
had relationships which are more
involving which you feel really
understood by
teacher oh you really feel your internal
world is seen by them and those two
kinds of relationships on a broad
spectrum are profoundly different and
they activate different parts of the
nervous system which we talk about now
so let's dive deeply into the brain
extended nervous system so you can get a
feeling for where we're at now in terms
of neuroscience informing us about the
mind and what a healthy mind might be
and I'll start this by first giving you
an overview of brain anatomy and then
we're going to look at a particular
clinical case to understand how the mind
is influenced by the structure of the
brain so mang has been really nice
enough to hand out a model of the brain
that's underneath each of your seats so
if you reach down below your seat and
pull your hand out you pull your hand
out it's attached to your wrist that's
manga range that too if you take your
hand out and put your finger in the
middle this is a very handy model of the
brain you don't have to ever remember to
bring it to work so if you put your
thumb in the middle and then curl your
fingers over the top this individuals
face would be in front of the
fingernails the metaphoric brain we have
here the top of it would be the top of
the fingers that's where the top of the
skull will be the back of your hand
would be where the back of your skull is
over here so taking the brain apart
piece-by-piece if you raise your fingers
up lift your thumb up let's start the
anatomy lesson here the spinal cord
brings in data from all over the body
and first enters the skull part of the
skull based brain in an area called the
brainstem and this is an area that helps
regulate your basic physiology like
heart rate and respiration but it also
has the nuclei the collection of the
basic cell of the nervous system the
neuron that are responsible for the
fight flight freeze response okay and
that area of the brainstem works closely
with the next area that this is called
the triune model or three-part model put
your thumb over your net two thumbs to
be ideal but most of us
that one this thumb represents the part
that evolved we became mammals hundreds
of millions of years ago it's called the
limbic area it's involved in five
processes and it works closely with the
brainstem
those five processes include appraising
the significance of events that happen
so if you're on a computer program for
example and you feel not really
compelled your limbic area is probably
not saying that's important pay
attention so appraisal is number one
number two is motivational States it
works very closely with the brain stem
in motivating motivating us to do
certain things to behave in certain ways
okay
number three is it distinguishes between
different kinds of memory systems number
four is it also works closely with the
brain stem and the body to generate what
are called emotions or affective states
or sometimes called valence states of
mind emotions and the fifth thing that
the limbic area does that people often
don't realize but if you raise rats or
mice or if you raise amphibians and like
frogs are important newts or you raise
lizards you know when we develop the
limbic areas mammals we also develop
another really important function and
that's the function called attachment
relationships so the limbic area is
important for us having relationships
with other people that are that are not
only close and meaningful but when we're
in a state of distress we go to that
attachment figure to help soothe us so
here you see from 200 million years ago
we as mammals have needed each other to
survive we've needed each other to help
regulate our energy and information flow
we are as a class of animal mammals
extremely social okay so that's the
limbic area the fifth function of limbic
area now since these are all below the
cortex they're called subcortical when
we also developed our mammalian
ancestors long ago developed the cortex
the neomammalian cortex the newer part
of the brain
the outer bark of the brain it's
actually really thin it's only six
layers thick and it has lots of folds
these convolutions that make it look
thicker on a on a scan and it has two
huge areas easy to remember back in
front the back has several lobes like
the occipital lobe parietal lobe we
don't need to worry about that but the
the back in general is for processing
the external world when you see me
moving my hands around like this right
we know it's the back of your brain
that's been activated when you hear the
sound of my voice coming from outside of
you we know it's the side of your brain
the temporal area even when you feel
with your fingers like this you're
activating still a back part of the
brain because you're exploring the outer
world okay so that's the posterior part
of the brain once you get from your
second-to-last knuckles forward to the
fingernails
that's the frontal area of the brain
which grew when we became primates and
this area has an urgent information flow
in it that in the first part is about
your motor action what you're going to
do with your body and response to your
experiences and the next strip just
before that is called the pre motor
strip it's where you plan your actions
where you image what you're going to do
as you keep on moving forward in the
brain which is called anteriorly as you
keep on going forward I don't know if
there's a computer analog to this but in
the brain there the way it works is the
more forward you move the more complex
the representations representation is a
cluster of neural net firing patterns
that stand for something obviously other
than the neuron that firing pattern so
in the back of the brain you might have
a representation let's say of my hand
here and moving here and moving here so
you're representing the visual image of
my hand but in the front of the brain
you can have a representation of
something like freedom or justice or
mental health or awakening the back of
the brain doesn't know what to do with
those kinds of things you know they're
really far from
solid stuff but the more forward you
move the more abstract the
representation gets once you get to the
prefrontal area you are so forward and
you're now becoming part of the brain
that is uniquely human we have a
prefrontal cortex that is so big our ape
cousins probably think we are really
ugly because our foreheads have pushed
out because of the prefrontal region and
we don't look like our ape relatives but
it's this prefrontal cortex that you
could call the cortex Humanitas it is
capable of doing an amazing set that is
processing energy information in a way
that creates representations of
information that as far as we could tell
most other animals can't do
for example telling stories sitting
together and having a meeting like this
obviously inventing stuff where you can
project things all over the planet you
know and look at little dots flying up
see where the globe is and you know
where Google is you know being used by
people in different languages I mean you
know I as far as we know you know rats
don't do that and even apes don't do
that other animals are great
but we do some pretty wild things you
know and we believe that's because our
prefrontal cortex is so distant from the
physical world because it's interior in
the cortex it can make new combinations
that we call creativity that are the
thrust of this capacity but the
prefrontal cortex while that's creative
in this way it also anchors us in some
very interesting ways in relationships
and let me give you an example the first
thing to say is like any part of the
brain there are many parts so here we're
talking about the prefrontal area which
is your represented from your last
knuckles to your fingernails the side
part the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
just the side area is very important for
when you put something in the front of
your mind so if you have a computer
program for example and you want someone
to remember something that you changed
screens and they're going onto something
else you want to know how is this what's
called the chalkboard of the mind
holding on to that piece of data and it
used to be said that we can hold on to
seven plus or minus two items people
actually don't believe that anymore not
because we're changing but because it's
a reinterpretation of the research that
in in daily life it's probably more like
three two or three items so just in
terms of what you present on a screen
before the screen moves just something
to think about what this dorsal lateral
is really able to hold in the chalkboard
of the mind but for our purposes we're
going to look now at the middle
prefrontal area and for those of you who
like them no names I'll tell you what
I'm including in the middle prefrontal
cortex so if you look up the research
you'll know what the anatomical names
are this includes an area called the
anterior cingulate the orbital frontal
the dorsal and medial aspects of the
medial prefrontal I'm sorry the dorsal
and ventral aspects of the medial
prefrontal and the ventral lateral
prefrontal cortex which includes an area
called the insula now everyone's going
oh no too much Greek so don't worry
about all that that's why I made up this
term called middle right so we have the
side we have the middle is very easy to
remember for your dorsal lateral to
remember that so the middle prefrontal
cortex is unbelievably important and if
you're thinking about mental health as I
hope you'll see in a moment the list I'm
about to give you is an unbelievable
list that helps describe not define but
I think describe what you may consider
to be a mentally healthy life so let's
look at this list here's the clinical
case I told you I would tell you about
obviously the details are changed to
protect confidentiality but this is the
essence of the case a child stopped
talking at school I'm a child
psychiatrist so she's brought to me for
treatment she refuses to talk in school
and one day as we're playing games and
stuff in silence she finds a video
recorders before
Didi's existed a video recorder and she
is very excited so she brings in a video
the next session and on the video is
this beautiful depiction that her father
was taking over it was her father's
birthday of her mother and herself
playing together and dancing around and
really hugging each other and look at
each other in the eye it's something
that's called attuned communication
where two people two individuals become
a week absolutely exquisite
but what I came to realize when she then
said that's the way my mother used to be
for the first time she spoke in the
office was that something had happened
this mom and when the mom came in and I
had heard the story I didn't understand
the impact of it the mom had had a car
accident a year earlier and
unfortunately she was not wearing a seat
belt and she there were no airbags was
an old car and the steering wheel hit
her in the forehead right in the area
where this middle prefrontal area is and
she had severe damage was in a coma for
a while
at brain surgery at plastic surgery she
actually looked pretty good but she
behaved totally differently than the
woman in the video who was tuned attuned
who was present who seemed it would be
flexible now this mom had severe
problems in the way she could relate to
her children there this girl had other
siblings as well she seemed like a
different human being the husband said
so I took the brain scans from the
neurosurgeon with me under my arm and I
went to the medical school library and I
looked up everything I could find in the
basic research on what these areas of
the prefrontal cortex did and as I was
gathering all that data I had a session
with the mom and the dad alone without
the kids there and I asked the mom what
was life like since
the accident and she says
matter-of-factly well I guess if I had
to put a word to it I I guess I would
say I've lost my soul and this was
exactly what the kids were having such a
hard time articulating there was
something in the essence whatever you
believe about the word soul you just
think of that the idea of the essence of
our personality of who we are this core
place of ourselves there was something
about this essence that was gone and yet
she could walk she could talk she could
write and she could think so when I
brought back the information from the
scans which I'm going to describe to you
now and explained it to the family we
could start to make sense of why things
have changed so much
here are nine functions that now we know
from research are based on that is they
need a healthy middle prefrontal area to
function well and you just think about
your own life what role these nine
functions play in yourself in your
relationships with others in people you
know and here are the nine functions the
first is this area of the brain actually
sits on top of the brainstem as you can
see from where it is and it helps
regulate it so regulating the body the
heart the lungs is actually what this
part contributes to body regulation
number two is you know when you look at
another person in the face and you feel
like you're connected to them and you go
tune to them that attuned communication
depends on this middle prefrontal area
and when it's damaged people don't do
that and you can try it right now if you
want to look at each other and see what
it's like when you just look at someone
you feel connected versus when one of
the one of you looks away give it a try
just see what that's like look at your
neighbor
try looking and then just look even even
just look away and see see the
difference in the feeling each of you
try on the left side do the looking away
first and then on this side now try
switching it over
how did it feel differently when someone
was actually looked like they felt like
they were too near to versus not did you
know as a difference yeah we runs
nodding their head there's a huge
difference and the prefrontal region can
create it and knows the difference
number three is to be able to balance
your emotions to let these internal
valence States we call emotions rise
enough so life has meaning but not rise
to much so life becomes chaotic and not
be too depleted so life becomes rigid
that optimal flow which we'll talk about
in just a moment that optimal flow is
what this area helps create the fourth
function is the capacity to extinguish
fear if you've been traumatized or a
difficult thing you're frightened of it
this area actually grows what are called
gaba fibers gamma-aminobutyric acid is a
inhibitory peptide that helps dampen
down firing and the lower limbic area
the amygdala is responsible for
generating activations that are what
help us feel fear so this middle
prefrontal area helps calm that down
that's number four number five is the
ability to pause before you act what I
call response flexibility to instead of
just active respond to your impulse to
pause have a space in your mind where
you consider the various options
available to you for a kid on a
playground this is absolutely all the
difference between being adaptive and
flexible with emotional intelligence and
social intelligence or lacking those
things that ability to pause before you
act as everything and if you could just
teach kids that you'd be making a huge
difference in public schools that's
number five number six is something
called insight which scientifically
means something called Auto noetic
consciousness which is self-knowing
awareness and in the brain what we think
that does is they're representations of
the past that are connected with
representations of the present and
anticipated future so you have this
thing called mental time travel
the next one is the capacity for empathy
different from attunement empathy is the
ability to tune into someone else and to
create maps of them in your mind I
wonder what that person's feeling I
wonder what she was thinking
I wonder what memories might have come
up that made her behave that way
that's the exam example those are
examples of empathy and then number
eight if you thought that those seven
weren't enough number eight is the
capacity for morality for actually
thinking about the importance of
compassion of using your moral
imagination to think about the larger
social good and then enacting those
behaviors even when you're alone it's a
way of defining morality people would
damage this area they don't become
immoral they become immoral they just
don't consider this larger social good
now those first eight for me start
echoing in my mind as an attachment
researcher independent of brain studies
with what we had proven secure
attachment healthy relationships between
a parent a child produce those first
eight we'd proven that not knowing
anything about the brain so I was going
wow that's really amazing the ninth one
no one ever looked for this ninth factor
of the middle prefrontal areas intuition
being in touch with the wisdom of the
body the heart and the intestines have
actual neural net processes around them
which allow energy information to flow
it's kind of like little computers in
your gut and your cardiac system that
then bring the data up through this area
of the spinal cord called lamina one it
comes up like in any you know mammal
comes up to our lower areas where they
regulate the heart and intestines but
then it moves up to the area called the
posterior insula in primates and then
forward only in humans and if you're
thinking about the interface between
computers and humans this is a really
important area to think about it allows
when it goes from the posterior insula
taking lamina one data from the body
including the viscera the hollow organs
like the heart and
it takes this data moves it from the
posterior insula to the anterior insula
and what we believe happens when that
occurs only in humans is you create a
representation of your representation of
the body it's called a reason Tatian it
keeps you one step removed
it's called interoception perceiving
interior world and that function
amazingly enough has been directly
correlated not only with anterior insula
activation naturally but with the
ability to have empathy the ability to
have empathy which is at the core of
emotional and social intelligence
so we've now in these years bless you
we've now mapped out the actual
circuitry that allows you to have these
nine functions and if you look at your
hand model lift your fingers up bring
them back down what do you notice is
unique about this area of the brain well
it touches everything exactly it touches
everything this middle prefrontal area
is connected to the cortex it's deeply
connected to the limbic areas it
actually receives direct input from the
brainstem it's also through lamina one
receiving direct lamina one input from
the body's whole system the muscles that
joints the teeth so you feel sensual
touch you feel the internal state of the
body through this lamina one movement
which goes directly to the middle
prefrontal areas not the back to the
front which is just an amazing finding
and as we've pointed out you're getting
the data from other people's nervous
systems through attunement and empathy
you're actually creating maps of other
people's energy and information flow in
their nervous systems so the social the
somatic the brainstem the limbic the
cortical are all interconnected as one
what is so striking about that phenomena
is when you look deeply at the
mathematics of that what's that call by
the way when you link differentiated
parts integration
this is probably there's a few regions
that are massively integrated but this
is one of the top tier integrators in
the brain it's not that the cells in
this middle prefrontal cortex look any
differently or they're not really
different in their structure it's not
like they're super special cells that go
into special schools or something like
that it's their anatomical location that
bridges with one synapse connections
obviously the whole brain is
interconnected yeah that's true but
you're talking about speed of conduction
with myelinated fibers that are a
hundred times faster than unmyelinated
ones and with one synapse shopping you
have basically connected the whole
shabang together so it's massively
integrated and from mathematics those of
you are in mathematics what do you know
about when a system can link
differentiated components when it can
become integrated what do we know about
it this is now straight from math well
let's take a choir example just briefly
as an example if you take a choir of 10
singers right 10 singers and you have
them we have differentiation and we have
linkage let's do first where they're not
differentiated you block differentiation
you have them just sing one note all at
once ah it goes on and on and on is
there any besides the overtones but in
general there's no variation it's not
flexible it's not adaptive it's kind of
dead and flat and rigid that's one
extreme if we have what we call a river
of integration one extreme is rigidity
in this case you've blocked integration
by impairing differentiation let's say
you do the opposite let's say you take
these 10 singers have them close their
ears and have them belt out a song any
song they want as loud as they can when
you raise your hands what would you hear
cacophony you'd hear chaos and for those
who are familiar with complexity theory
you know that when a system is not
maximizing complexity it goes either to
rigidity on one end or to chaos on the
other what we're talking about
is in a
interpretation of complexity theory that
says as this choir example would be if
we had the 10 singers up here we said
sing a song very often people will sing
amazing grace I can't sing so I'm not
going to do it for you but if you had
the choir you could imagine them singing
in what how would they do it harmony
harmony is a great word for integrated
flow why you're allowing the different
singers to be differentiated in their
voice and the octaves they attain not
does the what's a col I'm not a singer
what's it call the intervals thank you
very much
they're varying their intervals but
they're linking with each other to sing
amazing grace so it's an example of an
integrated flow just to give you the few
we don't have singers up here to give
you the idea this notion then says and
here's the proposal but at a mental
health when I started reading about
complexity theory in trying to
understand why the middle prefrontal
cortex might be so exquisitely important
in creating the well-being not just of
this woman who unfortunately had been
hurt in the car accident unfortunately
so severely damaged there wasn't much
recovery possible but her family was
also hurt because the integration that
is the linkage and differentiation this
family was impaired now luckily they
could go through the grieving process
understanding the mechanisms of the
brain that wouldn't allow the mind of
this mom to continue functioning as it
did because the mind uses the brain to
create itself and if the pathways aren't
there the mind can't do it so the kids
had to learn how to grieve the loss of a
mother who was no longer there whose
body was still present so they actually
did well even though the mom couldn't
recover much they grew up well they
understood what was going on they could
even begin to try to take care of the
mom various way it's a long story but
they've done well for our purposes
understanding the power of this part of
the brain even through the pain of that
family is to look at the power of
integration so take a look at this list
in your head
or if you've written it down of nine
middle prefrontal functions and how many
of you think that that list of nine has
a number of components that feel to you
just in your intuition that this is
probably a reasonable description of
mental well-being
let me see okay well if you ask mental
health practitioners they jump all over
this list and they said my god where'd
you get this list and I tell them you
know from the clinical case I think oh
that's like a magnificent description
for us
of describing mental health so here is
the move from a description to a
definition what I'm going to propose to
you and this is in all of my different
writings that Meng talked about so it's
you can see the detailed analysis and
the references in the science this is
just kind of the take-home message in a
kind of an overview the proposal I'm
going to make to you is that a healthy
mind emerges from integrated systems
integration very clearly defined as the
linkage of differentiated parts so that
when you have a nervous system that's
integrated you get these nine functions
when you see relationships in a family
that are integrated you know where
people are honored for their differences
but link they want to how are you doing
how are you doing okay you like vanilla
ice cream you like chocolate fine but
let's go out for ice cream together you
know that's a healthy adaptive family
you get flexibility adaptability even a
sense of coherence if you look at the
mathematics of coherence it's a
beautiful book by fair guard called
coherence and thought and action which
examines the equations beneath coherence
and these integrated systems get that
where they embed the ongoing variables
that they're encountering into how they
define the in-and-out group and the
system then moves through time by
changing response to what it experiences
different from a cohesive equation which
is rigid and how its defining things and
it just doesn't change you're either in
or out odd numbers out even numbers in
whatever the system is it doesn't
so we're talking about relationships and
a brain as systems of energy information
flow that when they're integrated they
can move in this adaptive way now in my
own journey through all this stuff what
blew my mind was not only being trained
as a clinician and finding it actually
useful to name specific domains of
integration like the left hemisphere and
the right having them become
differentiated and linked like the body
and the cortex having them linked just
as two examples as all sorts of domains
of integration that can outline a whole
approach to promoting a healthy mind but
one very direct approach which has been
around for it turns out thousands of
years was taught to me only very
recently because I by accident use the
word mindfulness in a book on parenting
and I said it with my co-author very
heart soul that one of the most
important things we can do is be
intentional and awake in our parenting
we use the word English word mindfulness
it turned out as you may know that
there's 2500 years of specific mental
training to develop mindfulness traits
which I wasn't aware of but since that
time I was fortunate enough to meet
people have been spending their life in
modern times studying scientifically the
power of mental training to promote it
turns out this totally blew my mind it
turned out to promote all nine of the
middle prefrontal functions and when I
presented this to one of our nation's
leaders Jon kabat-zinn on this he was
beautifully able to say that it wasn't
just that this was the outcome of
mindfulness training to get these nine
functions it turned out it was the way
of being mindful to regulate your body
to balance your emotions be tuned in to
other people to be flexible in your
responses all these things that insight
empathy moral living even intuition 100%
of them so in a book called the mindful
brain what I wrote about was integrative
process
is that link differentiated components
those are integrated like a parents
tuning into a child promote the
activation of these integrative fibers
in the brain and promote their growth it
turned out that there were studies to
suggest the fact that when you do this
thing called mindfulness training
there's the kind that's been studied in
depth is mindfulness meditation but
there are also other trainings that we
think will do the same thing we don't
know like yoga and Tai Chi and Qi Gong
and centering prayer those are all
mindfulness practices but for now the
main the bulk of research scientific
research has been done a mindfulness
meditation but there's lots of ways of
practicing mindfulness for that research
these are the areas that get activated
and the neuroscience lesson is that
neurons which fire together wire
together so if you have a practice let's
say 10 minutes a day where you are
taking time to focus let's say on the
breath and when your mind wanders return
your attention to the breath and a
loving and kind way and then your mind
gets distracted return your attention to
have this practice where you're aware of
your awareness and you're paying
attention to your intention we believe
that those the two fundamental things in
every mindfulness practice when you do
that over and over again in that 10
minute period you're creating what's
called a mindfully aware state of my
state of mindful awareness now you may
say well is that just the same as
relaxation well the answer is no it
turns out studies have been done and
show that mindfulness training is not
the same as relaxation training you may
feel calm or you may not feel calm but
it's a form of mindful awareness which
is very different from just relaxing
that's number one you say well kay I'm
doing at 10 minutes a day well how is
that going to help me good 10 minutes
what about the rest of my day here's the
secret when you intentionally practice
firing off neurons you stimulate
neuronal activation of growth you snag
the brain stimulate neuronal activation
growth when you create those states they
will change the structure of the brain
and subsequent studies have actually
shown that that's true to make a
mindfulness trait states become trades
with practice that's the whole idea so
what I'm suggesting to you is that
here's we define a healthy mind coming
from integrative relationships and an
integrated nervous system we've
described its features and now here's
the last few minutes before we stop for
questions is how do you actually do this
well one thing is you try to promote
healthy relationships with other people
you tune into not just their thoughts
but their internal world their nonverbal
signals you combine in every way you can
a way of a tuning to people's internal
worlds and respecting their ability to
be distinct from you that's a relational
one in the brain
you can actually on your own develop and
you can call it an integrative practice
if you don't like to work mindfulness
but it's basically a way of focusing
energy and information flow in a way
that as you be aware of your awareness
pay attention to your intention and
basically build the muscle of the mind
we have every reason to believe what
you're doing in doing that is
strengthening the integrative fibers of
your brain in particular these middle
prefrontal areas that I outlined for you
now when you do that we know from
research a couple of amazing things
happen people will shift the baseline
activity of their brain to what's called
an approach state so when you do happen
in life to confront thing that's
difficult instead of withdrawing from it
you actually approach it even just after
an eight-week training when people
practice everyday their brain changes
your immune system function improves
people is a approached state shift which
is called a left shift it improves in
proportion to the amount of increased
immune cells that are going to fight off
disease blood pressure is improved all
sorts of physiologic improvements happen
there
studies show empathy increases I once
did a 40-day a week-long retreat with 48
brain scientists we weren't even
focusing on empathy or compassion or
anything like that we were just focusing
on developing this capacity to be aware
of awareness for a week and when we had
our discussion group two of them one was
married the other was engaged said my
partner tells me what happens you you
sound so connected to me and you sound
so empathic what are you doing there and
what was amazing about it was we weren't
practicing any empathy practices which
exist you know we were not trying to
generate compassion we were just focus
in the mind why would that be well if
you just think about what I said about
the anterior cingulate and the anterior
insula you can talk about the anterior
singer but it's part of the middle
prefrontal ER when these two go together
the anterior insula is activation which
is what you practice when you're aware
of your breath hour after hour day after
day you're going to strengthen what your
anterior insula is doing and all the
studies that have been done a lot of
them at UCLA with people that I work
with have shown the higher degree of
empathy a higher degree of anterior
insula activation you see someone
without much anterior insula activation
they're not in touch with their bodies
very low empathy that's just what the
research shows why would be that think
that the case we're not talking about
mirror neurons but there's a whole set
of neurons to suggest that we soak in
what we see in other people to shape our
own body's response and then the way we
perceive that body's response allows us
to know not only how we feel but how
they feel so in all these ways having an
internal education where you're giving
this self connection directly helps your
connections with others and this is
where we have the opportunity as
individuals to make the world a more
compassionate place but in a setting
where you're actually affecting energy
and information flow across the planet
for our entire species you guys are in
an unbelievable position to try to
create a more compassionate world for
all of us so thank you very much for
your kind attention and we have time for
questions thank you
please
yes
yeah no not a two-year-old but you know
for we're doing four and five-year-olds
in preschool and if you go to
oh I'm sorry repeat the question how do
we do this with little kids so the first
would be the resource if you go to inner
kids org Susan Kaiser green that is the
person we collaborate with we do the
research part at the Michael awareness
Research Center at UCLA and their their
work we are working with four and
five-year-olds and studying the outcome
and the outcome is amazing the kids are
more tuned into each other the bullying
has decreased there's this sense of more
presence and flexibility well what Susan
is a genius at doing this and she has a
book that's coming out all about this
but the the way it happens is you teach
kids to be aware of what they're doing
as they're doing it so for example they
put a plush toy on their belly the the
thing is just say rock your teddy bear
to sleep so they're constantly watching
their belly go up and down and up and
out you don't tell them you're
meditating the four-year-old never
meditate but they can do that
kids are older of course you do yoga and
things like that there and we go all the
way it's a middle school you know and
and so their creative ways of doing it
and so I would go to her website you can
click right through the other group I
work for is called the garrison
Institute and we have a 180 page a
summary of all the different programs we
could find in North America that are
teaching mindfulness to kids and there's
another program called mindful schools
org up in Oakland that have been now
doing research on their program they've
worked with 4900 elementary school kids
and the bullying has decreased the the
empathise increased and this is parallel
to what happens at a program called
castle CA SEL org is where you can find
that information with their teaching
reflective skills to build social
emotional intelligence even there you
see not only obviously improvements in
social emotional intelligence which is
fantastic even academic performance
improves it's a win-win situation we
just have to be mindful enough to do it
and you know I just spoke to 3,500 of
the nation's public school
superintendents about the concept of the
fourth are you know reading writing
arithmetic
you know why not have the fourth RB
reflection that if we can build up this
you know anterior insula strength if we
can build up reflective skills which
basically no one is doing we have an
opportunity now to shift the compassion
in our culture in a very different way
and to boot we'll probably get better
academic performance why not yes please
you made a statement one point where you
said the mind uses the brain or
something like mm-hmm I thought that was
a very peculiar way to speak that that
perhaps you had spoken loosely you know
very intentionally so the my what I said
was what I meant to say and I think I
did say the mind uses the brain to
create itself how can you speak about
the my though being in that way of
speaking the mind is something different
or separate or outside of the brain
where clearly in your definition the
brain is a key part at no brain no mind
maybe I mean you guys are affecting
minds all the time I have close friend
of mine who's dead he died last year and
you could say on some level his mind is
still affecting me because of the way
it's influencing my energy information
flow that's a huge discussion but let me
let me address the idea of peculiar way
of speaking I I do that on purpose
because we hear so much from scientists
and it's such a common way of believing
and I certainly was raised this way
medical school say the brain creates
mental activities it's a one-way arrow
let me give an example of a study that
was done to illustrate why I'm you know
weird enough or bold enough or whatever
to say the mind uses the brain to create
itself you take someone let's say and
take ten people put them in a in a house
blindfold them for a week and the brain
that makes maps of the outside world
using the back of the brain the
occipital cortex
after one week these people have had to
figure out the spatial arrangements
around them to go to the bathroom
find food to find their bed go to sleep
etc after one week when you put them in
a scanner the fingertips have taken over
the back of the brain now you could say
well sure that's the brain just doing
that but one way of understanding that
is this human being what I mean is you
put them in a scanner and you have them
touch things and now the input from the
fingers which is in a relatively small
area in the somatosensory strip
massively activates what we used to call
the visual cortex and you can read about
this in a book called
how the brain changes itself by Norman
Doidge or another book called train the
mind change the brain by Sharon Begley
or another book called the body has a
mind of its own by Sandra and Matthew
Blakely these are the summers of the
science so you know I'm not just making
it up so the idea here is that we used
to think of the brain is pretty fixed
now we're learning it's always changing
and a thought can change the brain if
you if you need to know the outside
world but your eyes are no longer
Brabant but we used to think oh well
you're really in trouble you're need to
have energy and information flow about
the outside world drives the brain to
create a map of the outside world it
your mind is using the brain to create
what it needs it needs a mental image of
of three-dimensional space that's just
one example
there's example after example after
example deutsches book of how for
example imagery you know studies of
imagery with athletes they can if you
can you know let's say you hurt your leg
and you're a basketball player if you
take two weeks and just practice
shooting hoops you're actually going to
do almost the same as someone who's been
with their legs shooting them this
capacity of the mind to get the brain to
be activated and keep those circuits
active has now been proven we didn't
know this ten years ago it's so that's
why I say you know hey the mind uses the
brain to create itself now I use this
example of this unfortunate woman who's
hurt to show of course you need the
brain circuits to let the mind ride
those circuit activations to create
itself and if you don't have those
it's so for example I would do a lot of
work with traumatized kids we know the
integrative circuits of their brain
unfortunately are damaged from high
stress hormone levels so those kids have
a lot of time developing these middle
prefrontal cortices you can't just say
hey just do it man no their circuits
don't exist so in a way the mind is is
use equal using the brain to create
itself and if the brain circuits aren't
there you're absolutely right no brain
no mind in that sense but we need to be
really flexible it's a way of sort of
challenging your own mind to say wow
okay it's a two-way arrow for two arrows
for sure why posit something else
oh it's crucial that you know as a
therapist if it was just about the brain
I was just giving pills to people it
would be a travesty because it because
in fact people can use the mind to
change the brain we now know that but
it's an important issue this larger
question I'm actually going to three
think tanks this summer to look at just
that question so it'll be you should
come because it'd be a fun dialogue yeah
because there one more oh it looks like
we're done
what's it oh one last question yes
yes
yes great question in yeah I'm sorry
thank you how are these middle
prefrontal functions affected by a
severe mental illness the first broad
thing just to say is if you look at our
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
illness what's amazing to see is every
disorder the symptoms of that disorder
are examples of rigidity chaos or both
so it's this is a very different way of
approaching mental illness by looking at
impairments to integration so in
schizophrenia you do see massive
impairments to integration in autism you
see massive impairments integration and
a bipolar disorder just to address the
ones you've brought up you see massive
impairments integration in a book I'm
writing now that I'm just finishing
called mine site every chapter is an
example of a challenging mental health
issue bipolar is the actually the first
clinical chapter is about someone's
bipolar disorder and certainly often
people need medications but what I used
was a mindfulness technique to try to
grow the middle prefrontal fibers this
work from and it turned out to work in
this one particular person's case hilary
bloomberg is a researcher at yale who's
now shown that the fibers from this
middle prefrontal area the ventral ones
ventrolateral are gaba fibers that go
down to the amygdala and she's shown now
that's the first time ever to be shown
that in people with bipolar disorder
they have much fewer inhibitory fibers
going from the middle prefrontal cortex
to the limbic area to the amygdala in
particular so it's now our first you
know empirical research to support that
in fact this capacity to integrate to
regulate that's what comes from
integration balancing and coordinating
is impaired in bipolar disorder and we
need to have creative ways that of with
mental training or medications because a
lot of these medications actually
promote neural plasticity the ability to
the brain to change your response to
experience is actually promoted by
lithium for
or you know by certain medications like
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
so it may be that that's one of the
major ways those medications are working
by letting the brain grow itself out of
its problem you know but this is a new
way of thinking about it and we're
getting support then to look into these
details so thank you very much for your
attention and I look forward to talking
with you more thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
