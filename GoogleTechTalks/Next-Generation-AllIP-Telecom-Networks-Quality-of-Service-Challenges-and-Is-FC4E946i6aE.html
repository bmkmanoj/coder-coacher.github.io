starting at University and he was a
Fulbright Scholar to the US and he told
me young man
studied computer science so I'm happy to
have him here at Google four years later
thank you
and what site we'll be talking about
today is the next generation of all IP
telecom networks and some of the
challenges and issues that come with
what is really a very exciting
development especially for us here at
Google and this talk will be based on
papers several papers
one to I Triple E letters on
communication and also his presentation
recently actually two or three days ago
in Las Vegas at the consumer electronics
conference so very excited to have him
and let's see-oh a couple more words
after he was a Fulbright Scholar in the
US he was a telecommunications design
engineer to have the right at sprint
nextel and he's currently a PhD
candidate at the Technical University
karlova Hanina of Braunschweig Germany
so thank you very much Adam actually I
have my mic here so it's it's an honor
and pleasure for me to be among here
today to present my a tutorial talk that
is based on my PhD research based on
couple papers communications I Triple E
communications magazine paper and
another recent paper that was presented
in the I Triple E CCNC conference that
just took place last week
my name is side Zaghloul again and this
work is based on the collab based on my
work with professor at Millikin and our
collaboration with dr. with simon anchor
from formerly with sprint nextel and now
with Booz Allen Hamilton to give an idea
about our location in Germany and our
group we're located here in Brown
like basically very near to Hannover
half an hour away from Hannover and
about a west of Berlin about an hour and
a half by the Train it's quite nice
there and there is a lot of history in
Braunschweig so I encourage everybody to
go there and visit the Institute of data
communications and networking actually
is basically computed composed of three
major groups the major groups that we
have are the embedded systems group the
space communications group and the
networking group the networking group
where I work at is composed of two sub
groups one that is optical control plane
once that's interested in optical
critical telecommunications research
another one that I work at is basically
concerned about 3G 4G and mobility
issues design architectures so our
today's presentation outline is actually
composed simply of the motivation the
background of this presentation a little
bit about the next generation an example
actually about next generation IP
Multimedia Subsystem services what's IMS
the big buzzword that is taking place
you know and we hear a lot about it but
you know I'm here to demystify it a
little bit and point out some issues I'm
going to use an exemplary service
actually to demystify IMS and point out
some issues and then talk about some
architectural challenges in an IMS the
architectural challenges that I'm going
to be talking about are related to call
set up delay handoff management and
quality of service profile unification a
little bit point out about each of these
challenges and then at the end of my
presentation today I'm going to make
some conclusions and point out you know
some future work and research so the
object of today's presentation is
basically as I just mentioned is to
really investigate you know the
challenges and the deployments of
next-generation systems that are totally
based
the ims platform there is really our
evolution actually from the current from
the current or the traditional sense of
telecommunication networks where you
just have your phone and just you know
make dial a number and do call
forwarding and so and have very simple
services the future is all about value
added services location-based services
having some cool applications like
actually I remember from my last my last
conference in Las Vegas last week the
Nokia's VP was there and he was
mentioning point and find applications
where he could point your handset to
some really nice site for example the
Eiffel Tower let's say in Vegas and you
want the net what you want to get some
information about that
Eiffel Tower say okay I'm there but I
want to know a little bit more about the
history of that thing so I just hit a
button in my phone and the phone will
just get me of the wiki page about the
replica Eiffel Tower in Vegas of course
this involves more than just simple
image processing maybe it needs to
involve also the some location-based
service so the system doesn't like
really miss it with the real one
basically in Paris so things like these
are basically quite like new non
traditional form of services that we're
kind of looking at and imagining for the
future our approach for this research
that I'm doing and more more or less
focused on quality of service issues
approaches mainly about because I worked
and collaborated with Sprint so we're
taking that as an example the EVDO
network from Sprint the cellular network
and basically looked at the signaling
that takes place in the network from an
end-to-end perspective so that's what
I'm going to be using so all the
references all the naming conventions
even though in large sense and large
picture will apply to many other
networks
the terminology and the jargon that I'm
going to use will be more or less taken
and adopted from the 3gpp - or the EVDO
Network the results I'm gonna show
simply basically we are going to be
identifying some some issues and
basically proposing some optimizations
for how to make
better so that's my approach today so to
make things to make things more like to
just clear about the future trends for
the telecommunication networks so the
future trends actually are based on
basically from you we can look at it
from two perspectives the first
perspective is really the network
architectural level where people are
looking at higher bandwidths basically
we want higher access rates we want
different access technologies we want to
deploy certain like IP core in the
network and we want to use that core for
let's say we want to have WiMAX Wi-Fi
cellular networks all connecting to the
same core and reusing the core over and
over we don't want to deploy a whole big
separate networks you know that are
separate from each other and we want
more or less flat or plug-and-play
architecture that will flow we'll just
plug and play to that to that core from
the service level people are talking as
I just kept mentioning IMS IMS which I'm
going to explain like shortly from the
service perspective people want to
deploy that new architecture this IP
Multimedia Subsystem
architecture and and basically this
architecture really allows third parties
to get into play it's just not designed
for like big big providers and big
telcos third party providers really mean
like companies like Google who have like
real high experience in basically making
really consumer targeted applications
nice nice things like with Google Maps
location-based services searching some
pushing some special specific
advertising to the end user that really
suits them so it opens the door really
wide open away from standardization
bodies to the users basically to to to
the third parties to basically offer
their nice value-added services so
that's basically what we mean by this
development the service level and that's
quite important and then really like
we're talking about richer multimedia
session have
video online gaming all sorts of the
applications that we all hear about in
the media so it's more about involving
third parties were having richer
sessions and having you know like in
enhancing the user and users experience
about the network so the challenge is
now that our that we're going to be
talking about actually today are simply
related to the fact that as the
telecommunication networks grow
telecommunication networks are not
really simple networks in fact they are
networks of networks actually to
illustrate that fact actually before
continuing with this slide as we can see
in the past in the old days and the 90s
and late 80s people used like cellular
networks just to make you know a radio
phone call voice and to end voice call
you know and that was basically your
base station and radio network
controller managing multiple base
stations and that's it there was no
concept of Internet connectivity over
your handset and things were simple
afterwards as the network evolved we had
this we added the IP support to
basically the right network so we added
the the packet data serving node as the
first IP gateway element supported by
the home agent and the authentication
authorization server to basically allow
us an authentication and authorizing
that session pdsn and home agent really
support your IP mobility basically if
you move between multiple PDAs and
regions as I will show in this
presentation shortly basically mobile IP
will handle your mobility so as you move
your session won't be interrupted you
know because you will not change your IP
address finally people recently like in
the last few years really added what
they wanted to focus more it's not just
simple IP connectivity it's not simple
you know
voice voice you know just voice calls we
want to focus more or less on the
service itself we want to differentiate
services and we want to have different
third parties getting to play that's why
people introduce the IMS IMS includes
multiple components I'm just going
say the acronyms now and we're going to
look at each one of them quickly the
first ones are basically the the proxy
called session control function and the
serving call session control function
these are simply proxy and basically the
proxy and sip registrar and servers
you're all probably familiar with with
sip and then we have the home sub
privacy subsystem which is basically the
data basically all the element that
manages the users profile or database
and then we have basically the
application servers where these
application servers were basically the
the third parties can get into play and
interact with the IMS with the IMS
network so through this application
server you will be interacting with
these elements to to provide services to
to the to the end customer so the IMS is
simply an enabling framework for you
guys and then you deploy your services
through you using these application
servers and the system will handle it
for you down there but the whole purpose
of this presentation why do we want to
understand more about the semantics of
of the T communication network you want
to write application you want to
understand what's happening underneath
because there are some specific things
there is this mobility basically in the
network and there are some specific
things that you want to be aware of it's
not just like a connected network but
it's more it's there are more dynamics
in the network as we will see shortly
and there is at the end there's this
policy control and charging function
which will we will focus a lot actually
on and this policy control and charging
function will basically interact with
these with v with these two networks the
radio access network and the IP network
transport network to push and authorize
for the use for the use of the services
so that's that's I guess a quite
important box here to add okay
so continue with the challenges as I
mentioned we're talking about post dial
delay
the challenges that we're looking at
post dial delay is basically the time
the time that whenever you dial your for
ourselves in your handset the time that
would take this to establish this call
that's a very important
telecommunication network parameter that
you don't want it to take too long time
for you basically to acquire the service
from the network that's even more
important for push-to-talk services you
don't want to wait for for like a minute
to reach the other parties the other
thing is basically when you're moving
inside the network as you handoff
between areas you don't want to have too
much session interruption currently it's
about 70 milliseconds with with voice
telecommunication networks and with more
with with IP networks we're talking
about second reign seconds ranges and
people are working on reducing that down
to that you know to the level that we
experienced today in current wireless
networks there are multiple design and
challenges actually in challenges in and
deploying the next generation networks
and these multiple design alternatives
that we have in terms of these policy
functions we saw on the previous slide
that we have a triple a sir
authentication authorization server
authorizing for this IP network
authorizing for this radio network and
we have this policy control and charging
function authorizing from the service
perspective so we have two policy
functions and we're trying basically to
minimize these conflicts basically baby
in the roles of these policy servers so
what is IMS all about I've kept talking
IMS IMS IMS so just to make it clear
give a clear definition of IMS IMS is
really an access agnostic framework
it doesn't really care it's designed to
be not to care about the underlying
network whether it's Wireless whether
it's cable whether it's cellular
cellular of whatever kind it shouldn't
really care much the second thing is IMS
really deviates from the common
principle that we all followed in the
past which is actually quite strange it
was quite strange to me when I learned
about it initially like long time ago
all that people really standardized even
the services themselves you'll have a
standard from from ITU the International
Telecommunication Union that tells you
how to do call forwarding to that level
they standardized each service by itself
on its own and to build the service you
have to go from basically from you have
to build the routing functionality you
have to build security you have to build
everything so it's a nightmare actually
and we don't like that so to avoid that
what we did is basically introduced IMS
to have a horizontal architecture where
you just only focus on the service
itself so that's avoiding this stovepipe
the so-called soft pipe architecture and
then you want to enter work more and
more with other with other service
platforms like service platforms there
are already call forwarding
functionalities that are already and
other functionalities in the network
like call parking call forwarding etc
and these functionalities are already
deployed we don't want to throw them
away so we need to interact with them
and that's actually achieved by through
the use of these application servers IMS
is also an open platform work mainly
based on sip and other frameworks like H
248 and diameter protocol for
authentication and it's the IMS needless
to say it will be deployed by most of
the major standards like from our major
standardization bodies like the third
generation partnership project third
generation partnership project - and
WiMAX to show a little bit about how the
current 3gpp node networks are arranged
our handset is basically connected to a
base station the base station is managed
by radio network controller the PDS and
the ready network controllers traffic is
forwarded to the packet data serving
node with two forwards your traffic and
tunnels it and the packet the pdsn
basically is your first IP node this is
the first node that really talks I P
it's like your router basically and then
through the interaction between the PDS
and
the home agent you get mobility so if
you move from one pdsn to another you
still connect to the same home agent and
then you have a mobile IP functionality
and then the triple a really
authenticate and authorizes your
connection and it returns to the to the
network to the PDS and Adar and see your
quality of service profile this quality
of service profile is completely
transparent to your you to the service
that is being used it doesn't understand
whether it's a gaming application or a
voice over IP application it only it
only knows that you have a maximum
amount of one megabits per second let's
say a maximum aggregate bandwidth you
can do this these certain profiles but
really doesn't understand what's
happening beyond that so it's almost
static so that's that's the max that we
we can do on a triple-a with some tweaks
and tricks here and there maybe you can
get a little more but it's not really
aware of the service that is running so
the quality of service that we're
talking about this quality of service
profile that is returned by the triple-a
to the PDS and is will be enforced by
the PDS and on the IP layer and by the
radio network controller and the base
stations from the RF perspective so
that's that's that's how we really
enforce quality of service so let's
remember this just to recap Triple A
provides the quality of service profile
and PDS and enforces it at the IP level
and radio network controller and base
stations enforces that at the radio
level simple so we talked a little bit
about the the three network tiers that
all the three networks the radio access
network the IP transport network that
included these elements and now we're
going to look a little bit more about
the ims elements that i've been talking
about so the ims elements that i talked
about are these called session control
functions be it proxy or serving serving
call session control function here and
the proxy function really does message
verifications like any sip proxy with
extended function
it does it verifies the message whether
it's it's correctly formatted or not it
actually generates accounting for that
service and sends it to the triple-a
collection for collecting that billing
traffic and authorizes and interacts
with the policy control and charging
function to authorize for that service
so your truck your request simply go
from this this handset if you send a sip
request your first entity that will
interact with that invitation request
will be this p-cscf and then it will Pro
if it's fine it will be proxied through
an integrating CSC F it's another layer
to separate between domains another sip
proxy and then it will be proxied to
your serving s-cscf or your sip
registrar and it will be definitely
authenticated through your home
subscriber sub system for basically
depending on your service profile if
you're requesting a service that you're
not subscribed to you'll be rejected if
you want to deploy any value-added
services now it will be deployed through
this application server here for example
say that I want to say in a parental
control application that we're going to
see in a second I want to say let's say
that I want to restrict my child from
making calls during school time but only
after school time so what will happen is
that once your invitation requests or
basically the the call establishment
request goes to the this serving goat
which you're serving server here
it will go it will be routed through
this application server to figure out
whether this is the correct time or not
if it's not the correct time it will
reject it if it is the correct time it
will just let it through so you can do
any fancy things from we can have
actually a lot more applications like
maybe this you can deploy a lot more
like location-based services if you're
in that location you can you can allow
certain things to happen if you're in
the school range you can only call your
mom and maybe your teachers if you're at
home you can call everybody
any kinds of things so after just to
recap things and to put things in a in a
bigger in a bigger picture here we see a
whole call setup scenario and this call
setup scenario that we have includes the
three tiers that we just mentioned and
the steps for making a simple call the
steps for making a simple color
basically requesting requesting the
service from the IMS framework that's
step number one
step number two is basically requesting
the radio resources from the radio
access network to allow that service to
happen then having some authorization
service authorization in the network to
other to to authorize for the use of the
of the of the of the service that is
being requested and to authorize for the
radio resources that are being claimed
from the network and then in the end
once everything matches and if you what
you're requesting is what you really
authorized for then we get basically
your media session established so these
are simple five steps that summarizes
how you establish a simple session so we
saw in summary there is interaction
between the user to the ims network
there is an interaction here the user to
the radio access network that's another
interaction and there is some gluing
between both of them through this these
three and four
basically for authorizing that that
service basically having the ims
controlling the bearers the IP and the
radio bearers this is called service
bearer control where the service is
really controlled the radio and IP
bearers the bearers means that they make
the transporting mechanism so
we saw we talked a little bit about the
triple A's being the policy servers that
basically manage the underlying networks
manage the underlying IP network and
manage the and manage the radio access
network and the PC RF was the gluing
element or the policy server that allows
services to control these underlying to
two underlying networks so what does it
do it really authorizes the quality of
service the quality of service level for
your for your request from a service
perspective and signals that down to
these two networks if it needs to be
updated say you you acquired more
bandwidth for some reason the network
load reduced it updates that if you run
out of coda
it terminates your session and so on so
it has control over that bearer and it
also furthermore supplies the charging
rules are relevant to your service so
that's much more aware than just the
simple triple-a who just statically
knows this bandwidth and that's just
based on your subscription so let's see
this parental control application that
is based on our communication magazines
article in September issue so this
application is simply having a parent
her name is Sarah and Sarah wants to
restrict her child Bob from calling his
friend Johnny during school time and
only after school time Bob is allowed to
make the calls to Johnny and furthermore
she restricts the quality of service for
the video to be 32 kilo bits per second
she doesn't want to pay much for you
know 4/4 video access so she wants to
limit the options that bob has so to do
that
she configures basically the the access
rules using a web portal and these
access rules get get saved basically and
into the network basically in the in
hair h SS profile and configures these
rules that will go to the application
server as I just mentioned and few
slides ago about how this require
request will be treated so what happens
when Bob wants to make a
all when Bob wants to make a call Bob
simply sends an invitation request the
SIP invitation request is received by
Johnny
this simply triggers some also a
basically some authentication
authorization through interact through
interaction between the policy control
and charging function and the
application servers and the call
switching call session control functions
in the network so it just authorizes you
for that service and then afterwards
what happens is some authors some
similar authorization takes place on
Johnny's side we're not showing Johnny's
side afterwards what happens is that the
Bob starts requesting these resources
from the radio access network in
parallel and then the resources will the
request will be pushed from the radio
access network to the IP network once
the IP network this PDS and receives all
your authorization information from it
knows already your subscription profile
from the Triple A and once it receives
it from the policy control and charging
function here it's going to authorize
for your service and then if you're
authorized your session your media
session will be established a better
picture I have a clearer picture than
this and the next slide but this just to
show the steps that all what your reader
could need to do is basically send the
request authorize for that request
request for from the Radio Network
compare your authorization from the
service level the radio level they match
boom
session is established that's as simple
as it is but it actually it involves
many many many steps because you are
talking about signaling on three
networks so this is again a simple recap
of the previous of the previous
signaling that I showed on the picture
and this is more or less sip signaling
that we're all familiar with so this is
the invitation message that I talked
about and this basically triggers the
service information service in the
authorization information coming from
the proxy call session control function
because it's receive
your invitation requests and pushes that
service information to the the policy
control and charging function now for
this side we have two now we have two
options once I receive it I receive the
service information at the PCRF I could
simply push it to the pdsn directly to
the access gateway or it just can't hold
on it may be because what if this the
calls request doesn't complete I don't
want to reserve more resources in the
network so what happens afterwards is
that this provisional acknowledgement
that we're all familiar with will
trigger will trigger radio access
require a do bearer request or
reservation from the radio access
network we'll try to acquire the radio
resources for the session from the
network and that's through EVD or
access technology specific reservations
and EVDO there is a procedure to request
that in UMTS there is another procedure
so that's the procedure the reservation
procedure that would play place in the
in the radio network once that completes
your you're done here on Bob's side but
since for for example in Johnny's side
the the pdsn doesn't know yet about your
authorization from the service
perspective through when it receives
your EVDO better a better reservation
request when when you're claiming the
radio resources what happens is that the
pdsn will contact the PCRF and ask it
hey I am receiving a service request for
that for that quality of service is he
authorized the PCRF may have the full
information already from that step so
may not need actually to contact the pc
SCF or application services and it may
not
for some reason may need more
information depending on the requesting
PDS and maybe for your restricted in
certain regions your you have some
restrictions based on where you're
accessing that service at so it may or
may not do that once you're authorized
you confirm the service and then you
continue with the standard sip signaling
with this is called sip with
preconditions actually for through
communication networks you update and
continue with ringing
the acknowledgments there is a part here
that is that is basically once you
receive this provisional acknowledgement
here after the ringing message you there
is a trigger that comes from the proxy
call session control function down to
the to the PDS and down to the PDS and
and through the PCRF here and that
request instructs instructs the network
the IP network from this service you see
this this is the the IMS and this is
basically the service really having is
basically in charge and it's not only
the p-cscf because this is just an
illustration figure could be your
applications or your Google's
application server yes sir
how do they sure the for instance I will
receive the location of the empty
initiating a call is there any specific
protocol there it's a nice extension
list let's say the Google wants to
deploy application which will be aware
of the location of the place where the
poison
what so the question is how would how
would during this call setup procedure
how would this p-cscf or application
server know the location of the of the
handset basically to establish the
service there is there is a lot of work
actually going on today about with the
presence with the present servers and in
that region there are a lot of there are
a lot of actually there's a lot of
standardization that is taking place to
acquire the service through the presence
platform for themselves I understand
that in it I will have extra parameters
added the original invite message right
if I can listen I will not get access to
the location information of all their
cell phones true actually this was one
of actually that it is a very
interesting point actually it's it's how
to deploy IMS we had actually a IMS
workshop last last summer in Greece and
that was one of the main things actually
with these application servers even
interacting with your database as well
they are HSS or your presence
information again the solution to that
is as I'm aware of is not there in the
standardization bodies yet but it really
depends on the SLA s that you have you
may even end up having some application
server like brokering between betwee
between you and the provider during the
setup stage did I answer the question or
some broker yes some broker application
server to basically isolate you from
directly accessing user specific
information only giving you the specific
parameters that you need big players and
the pointer which are really
new features because if you are a small
startup company if you want to do
something by yourself you will never
reach the SLA on a signalization level
with any provider information news
actually this is a contrary this is a
very interesting question here but the
whole point is actually that providers
or third parties here get into the play
by just maybe owning this application
server here there was a nice startup
company from Holland that was just doing
SMS some next-generation SMS services
and they only own their application
servers there and they wanted to
interact with the providers and the
whole discussion that triggered was they
wanted some access to the home
subscriber subsystem directly and the
question that popped up or how come
you're going to just immediately access
my providers users database you could
just simply just even you know like do
you just search everything and get more
information than what you really need so
the answer to that may be through some
brokering or through the brokering so
you basically isolate them from directly
accessing the information that they
don't need to have that's a very
interesting question so again this is an
excellent question actually because it
really gets us to the issue actually of
the of even this presentation the whole
point that I'm making about the
challenge and quality of service is that
okay all of these guys are trying to get
into play and make you know and
basically deploy these services this
means that there's really you cannot
control things by standardization in
terms of the delay that will basically
how long will it take really to get this
information suppose that this service
composed of many collaborating or
federating providers small providers to
complete the service one is managing
your location another one is managing
the number of your calls and etc a
simple example that just comes into my
he covered hiccup query words yes three
ways and fits all of the issues that we
have an extension to the seat but it
doesn't really exist in the form of a
specification and yes there actually
that was at that time they had this
Tennessee Tennessee which was really
ahead of its time but unfortunately
because we were not prepared for it
it didn't really fly and ims is really
based on these principles more or less
but really taking over all the powers
from IP and from sip that is really very
successful two very successful
technologies and just pushing it so just
to show just a little bit of how
complicated it is from the radio
perspective things are basically if you
receive that's from the radio playing
perspective so how's the radio basically
how you reserve quality of service on
the from the radio level this is the
downlink or from the base station to the
radio network it will to the user so you
receive your packets here and these are
basically the filtering rules that tells
there are filtering rules there are
provisioned at the at the pdsn at that
IP Nighy node here well here's the pdsn
that PDS and that was provisioned with
these rules from the PC RF during this
call setup so these rules will instruct
the PDS and on how to separate traffic
and between who and who so will separate
traffic using simple it looks like
simple access lists actually that are
dynamically provided to the PDS and it
separates traffic and this traffic is
separated at the pdsn level and again
map to something to tunnels between the
PDS and and the radio network controller
because the radio network controller
unfortunately I only have ran here but
the regul network controller is simply
doesn't understand IP so that's why we
tunnel it into these so-called
a10 tunnels and then once this traffic
is forwarded they would go down and get
mapped again to the radio a radio link a
protocol flows basically and which goes
down to the user so it's really
complicated and this
so simplification plication of how
things go so enforcing quality of
service really means that we want to
enforce quality of service at all in all
layers in the IP network and in the
radio network this is and we signal that
on three levels at the Radio Network
level at the IP level and from the
service level okay so the challenges
that I just mentioned in the very
beginning of our talk here today is the
post dial delay challenge the handoff
delay and the quality of service profile
unification so the challenge is really
with the post dial delay the game there
is basically because we have this very
long so many we have so many messages it
takes along quite a long time to
establish the call about 10 seconds in
today's networks run today's networks
perspective the game to optimize it is
really based on two things two main two
main things the first one on how fast I
can acquire the the radio access network
and I will explain why shortly the
second thing is reducing the message
sizes that I'm exchanging with with the
with the radio network so two things how
fast I can acquire and the message sizes
we optimize these two we minimize the
call set-up time so this is once one of
the measurements and tests we've done
I've done with the Sprint Nextel with
our collaboration with Sprint Nextel and
this is mainly based on reducing the
call set-up delay through optimizing
Radio Network parameters and optimizing
sip optimization of Radio Network
parameters is really because your
handset is not on all the time it goes
dormant it releases the the radio
resources as you're not using it because
it doesn't want to keep reserving very
expensive bandwidth that's how most of
radio networks work so to do basically
when you want to initiate a call what
this means really is you want to
re-establish that traffic
channel with the radio network and then
send send your initial messages on this
on the receiving side the handset is not
there yet and it needs to check whether
it's having any message or not that's
periodically checking what's so the so
called paging channel so the whole game
is about really acquiring really
minimizing that time so there are
mechanisms from in the e video network
called enhanced control channel where
you can acquire control very quickly it
saves us about 100 milliseconds from the
current nine seconds delay and doing
some data sending data or data packets
over the signaling channels over the
control channels that are always alive
that you don't release normally so we
use these tools to send the first
invitation message so we save about 370
milliseconds on the receiving side there
are about five seconds every five
seconds max you keep checking whether
you receive the message or not whether
you received an invitation or not so it
may take you on average two and a half
seconds the average of this five to
basically to figure out whether you
receive the call or not so we minimize
we reduced that actually to this 426
millisecond cycle okay it will it will
be at the expense of the battery
lifetime but that's the best we can do
and then this basically ended up
reducing killing about three seconds out
so that's you just simply by using an
acquiring how fast we can acquire the
radio channel on the other hand we
wanted to play a little bit with SIP by
reducing the SIP content not all the STP
content is is really needed by by by the
radio network we kicked out some of it
some header information and that really
reduced up to five point four seconds
and then the real our real target was
four seconds from the itu a seven seven
one standard that's the the standard for
a national calls and that's what we were
testing for so to do that we wanted to
be a little more optimistic about the
call establishment we said okay we will
do aggressive signaling by saying we
will assume that the radio network will
always establish its call so if we make
this assumption we don't have to wait
for the radio network confirming its its
this reservation is the establishment of
the call and making and sending the ring
tone immediately to the to the sender
and to do to do the sender so that that
may end up actually having some ghost
rings basically if the other side didn't
really establish so that's the trade off
of it to look at things more of like in
a chart perspective and how things work
really the same results of the table but
per message so the invitation message is
clearly the worst one causes little
large number one and it really involves
accessing the network for the first time
and establishing the data the traffic
channels so this is really where most of
the radio optimizations really were
really beneficial to us at for this
invitation message mainly because it's
the first message we're sending and the
SIP and the size of the messages for
these little large messages because they
carry some SDP inside them we we
basically benefited from that by these
amounts or by these pink amounts over
the air interface further challenges
here I just want to be a little quick
about it this quality of service profile
we want to unify our quality of of
service we have two policy managing
servers the triple-a and the pcrf 125
both of them and we want to reduce the
amount to take a handoff how does that
happen
currently we have this triple day
managing the PDS and and the radio
network controller and we have this pcrf
talking and managing the policies from
the service perspective we want to
reduce this management overhead actually
and have only a single quality of
service profile so what we do really is
have the PCRF basically our as our
managing policy management profile kick
out that Triple A functionality and have
currently as I mentioned in the very
beginning the ims is really a service
agnostic network and using this if we
want to have some some Network specific
parameters that the Triple A used to
handle this means that we want to
introduce
this is contravention of a controversial
of course some some Network specific
parameters or profile for each network
inside this HSS so whenever you want to
authenticate from an e video network I
get this configuration specific
information from the HSS pushed it down
to the to the PC RF and this will
configure both your PDS and under your
RNC for your network setup phase so
that's what's one of the things but
again it's controversial because some
other people will tell you okay I would
like to maintain this separation as much
as possible I don't want to maintain
multiple profiles but the benefit of
that is reducing the management hassle
and conflicts so that was one of the
things that we proposed actually for
quality of service profile unification
the other challenge is really for an
established session when I've
established session if if you're
removing use or inside the network it
will take actually quite a long time as
you move between PDS and regions just to
show that in this in this diagram here
you're connected through here through
that call setup that that I just showed
and as you move from one area to another
to another the same signaling takes
place you want to authorize this PDS and
doesn't share necessarily context with
the previous one so it needs to
authorize you again to figure out with
with your pcrf to grab your service
specific quality of service profile to
figure out you know who you are and
whether you're authorized or not and
again it may do that with application
servers as well so if if you're making a
call and you're walking with it
this means service interruption this
means a voice call interruption that's
and that's really like very very
annoying much more annoying than the
post dial delay and as you move even
between operator regions here between
your home network and another roaming
operator or an alliance with the home
network
this will require having their PCRF talk
to your home PC RF here to authorize you
at your home network because it doesn't
know you're have your profile and your
their triple-a talking to your home
triple-a authorizing for you know
at its level at the triple-a 11 so that
takes quite a long time so the solution
to that was through simply what we
propose is really Prius indicating
before you really move here we predict
that you're going to be moving whether
you're if you become on the bordering
cell if you're on the border between two
networks then we trigger sending pre
authenticating you with with your home
operator so you won't have to do this
signalling when you really want to
handoff so that's the whole idea
the this is kind of different from
current attempts we were the first
actually to propose pre authentication
to IMS it's different from the current
attempts to optimize pre authentication
for for mobile IP which is taking place
today in today's Allah into the in the
IETF a lot today because we have this
variability actually going back to the
same question that we had there might be
so many providers giving you the service
and it might take a lot quite a long
time actually to you know to acquire the
service so we do this pre authentication
to save ourselves from that so what the
simple idea is basically once you
authenticate and you establish your
session right before it we send the
serve the time that is required for
authentication down to the Triple A
server and the Triple A server once your
your session starts forwards that to
your radio network controller because it
really sees and knows which cells you
are in so it it knows how if you're
handing off soon or not so once you're
really about to handoff here it the the
radio network controller will send the
hand of imminent message up to the
Triple A and from the Triple A the
Triple A will send an expected target
PDS and up to the PC RF the the the
piece RF telling it
hey the user is about to hand off to
this target PDS and pre authenticate him
there
so this pcrf immediately forwards this
information like acquires if there is
any authentication with the application
service and pushes that information to
the PDS and even before you're there
so that's simply a Prius indicating you
there and then once you really hand off
there when doing the same procedure as
we showed with the call set up you
simply don't have to do this
IMS authentication at all so we did it
right before your right before this
mobile IP signaling is taking place we
did it right before you come the idea
and the clean thing about this approach
is that it takes we only use policy
servers policy the policy framework to
bypass these triggers we didn't use we
didn't need to introduce any other
components so the policy framework is
what what really ended up forwarding
these triggers from one component to
another and that's the nobility of our
approach here another the final
challenge I wanted to talk about is if
we have multiple networks multiple
bearers in our network UMTS WiMAX EVDO
we may we're imagining the future some
situations where I want to break up my
session if I'm gonna engage in a voice
video call / a video which has quite a
narrow bandwidth compared to WiMAX right
so if I hit WiMAX I can keep my voice 3
connected to the video in order to avoid
interrupting the current session and
split the service in with with the WiMAX
so this service splitting doesn't exist
in today's in today's semantics so
that's one thing that we're working on
currently the lesson learned finally
about about the this hope from this
whole research is that it's not really
that simple actually to deploy services
quality of services really needs to be
integrated into the network and really
needs to be part of our original design
of the of the network we need to
consider things from an end-to-end
approach we don't need to just design
things haphazardly and optimizations are
necessary at each at each tier in the
network they're not necessary you cannot
do optimizations just in the run and
leave the other parts you have to have a
comprehensive picture especially as an
application developer you
you really have to expect these
interruptions you have to understand
what's what what's happening what's the
underlying things are really happening
inside the network and more
sophisticated things that will happen in
the future as I just mentioned splitting
services and these kinds of things you
really have to be aware of what's
happening there
whether you're accessing WiMAX video and
what are the semantics of the underlying
networks that are taking place thank you
very much and I appreciate very much
your time and I welcome any questions
would it be possible to use GPS to
optimize some of the handoffs between
cells if you could tell where somebody
was and how fast they were traveling
what so there yes definitely I recently
actually through the the 802 the 802 21
standard this media and dependent
handoffs people who are proposing
actually using location-based predictor
productivity through GPS the issue
actually is there are many many issues
actually with GPS today I was just
listening to a workshop in in the last
conference this consumer electronics
conference city and see in Las Vegas
people were talking about the accuracy
of your GPS fixes their cold fixes where
you're acquiring or basically acquiring
information from the network and there
are some locations that it becomes very
hard to to to to to acquire that the
exact information about where you're
exactly located it's possible but people
are still working on it the most
dominant thing today is really your
signal-to-noise ratio but definitely
there is a lot of room about it I've
seen something with people using TV
signals to locate you to do the
tranquilization so that's that's a very
cool application of it and I think that
in the future GPS will be the probably
one of the things one of the ways to go
about this predicting about accurately
predicting an imminent handover that's
that's definitely one of
things that are highly considered today
thank you yes
yeah I guess the qs4 telecom network so
important but I guess IMS IMS
particularly I guess go one step further
because it actually use you know color
this with application so I guess has
been concerned about what it is to do is
not to Natura T for example so they're
having a comment on that can you repeat
the question yeah basically the net
neutrality because potentially the
telecom the the ice providers the
wireless providers they can basically
you know control the traffic in certain
way to I don't know benefit or whatever
their business based on the content and
application as opposed to just generally
based on I'll condition of the network
and the others so this is a very
important issue if I understood the
quite the question quite well so it's
more about differentiating the services
rather than rather than thinking of
considering services as just flat a flat
IP based is that is that the part here
so definitely definitely the whole point
about IMS is basically to do this
service disfranchising so when we say
quality of service now okay what we
learn listen learn today well it's not
so it's not simply diffserv it's not
simply in serve models that we all study
about in the books and textbooks it's
much more than that sip is basically
configuring things for us and really
configuring these the parameters for for
diffserv and in certain reality inside
the IP network configuring the radio
access network somehow to to basically
establish the quality of service
requirements for your service and to end
inside the network so the game that
telecom providers are playing they're
really avoiding the mistake or what
happened with the regular internet
service providers in deploying and
really charging for the quality of
service that they give to the customers
through that signaling and giving them
better experience does that answer your
question
thank you
so I know you all are probably hungry so
