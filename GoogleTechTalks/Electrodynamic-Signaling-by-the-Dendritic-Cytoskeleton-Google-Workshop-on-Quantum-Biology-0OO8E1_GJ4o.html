izinski from the University of Alberta
he's going to talk about cytoskeletal
information processing intracellular
information processing thank you very
much for the invitation I'd like to
start by thanking the organizers for
putting this together it's a great
workshop in a great place very
inspirational for all of us I'm a
theoretical physicist who is now a
professor of experimental oncology so I
guess I've reached my level of
incompetents but i'll be talking about
something else today first of all
acknowledge the sources of funding and
in particular technology innovations
with Mike Wiener who's been faithfully
supporting my group for a number of
years but there is a lot of other
sources of funding most of it by the
ways is for a different purpose the and
collaborators non-technology
collaborators with Stuart and and vahid
lasagna and Holly Friedman and avner PL
Horatio cantarella when John Dickson
mucus Etheridge and being here I'm not
going to give any references whatsoever
just Google to Zen ski tubulin and
you'll get all the references so so I'm
not going to waste any information on
these slides okay my my day job is
actually computational drug design and
this is where the most of the funding is
coming from that's a fraction of my
group we I don't have current pictures
available we do computer design and
testing and silico searches for novel
cancer chemotherapy drugs so that's
basically what we do for a living but
because microtubules are everywhere
microtubules play a role in both young
ecology aspects as well as the
neuroscience aspect which is more of a
long-standing interest and I'm going to
try and follow the best I can the tough
acts that we heard today this morning
this afternoon
it's not easy and especially now with
five o'clock and for some of you
probably it's early morning I want to
start by saying that and integrating
some of these observations that were
made today that in my opinion the human
brain is the world's fastest most
portable supercomputer cluster and every
word has a meaning here and I think this
is quantum biology I will not say too
much about quantum to being a quantum
physicist and overstepping my competence
already but on the issue of human brain
and some of these capabilities that were
mentioned the some numbers to quote so
we have ten to the tenth neurons plus
minus some percentage roughly ten to the
fifteenth synapses so there's a hundred
thousand synapses per neuron and
synapses operated about ten impulses per
second so that's 10 to the 14th flops
sorry 10 to the 16 synapse operations
per second which compares to 10 to the
14th flops of the blue jeans so even at
the most crude the nose classical level
the brain is better than the blue jean
but I'm going to try and convince you
that actually the brain is always of
magnitude better than the lodging maybe
all computers in the world put together
a single brain and of course much more
energy efficient as well because it only
consumes 25 watts as opposed to 1.5
megawatts for the lodging so I said it's
a super computer class there and what so
what are the little computers inside the
brain so is there anything inside it so
I'm giving you a I'm also a little bit
tired so you cut me some slack please
each computer is a neuron and each each
neuron has its own processing units and
you probably guess which ones are these
but as a physicist i also want to
understand what sort of physics to apply
to different
spatial ranges or dimensions so
typically we would apply thermodynamics
to the level of an organism and at the
meso scale now we are grappling with
nanotechnology we don't really know what
it is is that quantum is a classical so
this is where cells and and subsolar
structures operated and biomolecules
with ten to the third atoms we are
stretching into the range of quantum
chemistry and eventually at the single
level single atom or or tens of atoms
front and physics it's important also to
keep in mind the energy scale in biology
these are all the important biological
distances and energy scales and also
affinity so it's all biochemistry
reactions and how fast they proceed
there are questions about time scales I
really want to draw attention to the
bottom of the scale the GDP ATP
hydrolysis and that's probably the only
time i'll mention quantum today the
energy quantum biological energy quantum
GTP is a bit smaller in energy than ATP
and i don't know what happened with the
number there it's it's between two and
ten Katie I don't know it got deleted
maybe it's below the the frame so this
is above the threshold of noise but not
really incredibly much above the
threshold of noise all the Crumpton pro
all the biological processes use either
GTP or ATP energy to to continue
therefore it's important to keep this in
mind different computers again this is
cutting things off and and that game for
the third time today i want to mention
ginter albert Bueller and you can google
cell intelligence and you'll find all
about him and what she's been doing for
the past 30 years what what actually is
albert ayler demonstrated is and this is
the premise of my hierarchical scale in
the organization of this supercomputer
cluster he demonstrated actually that a
single cell is intelligent and when you
go to his website you will see this
hundreds of pages of
illustrations and this is one of the
video I tried to show you and and it's
actually the cell is perceiving infrared
signals so it's electromagnetic
signaling of course it's also perceives
mechanical signals and and chemical
signals which everybody knows about but
the fact that electromagnetic energy is
received and analyzed by the cell by
single cell is incredibly important in
this context because the cell is already
a computer in its own right and a very
powerful one at that okay so we'll just
go with the flow so some of it was
covered sir I'll try to quickly go
through it microtubules in mitosis and
dividing cells and non-dividing cells
different roles different architectures
they definitely play a central in every
cell every eukaryotic cell has
microtubules there is no time to discuss
the variety of the building blocks which
is incredible interesting the two
billion years of evolution this
experiment on our planet in terms of
testing it's a it's a lab changing
mutating and finding out what is the
best for what different cells use
different building blocks tubulin is
expressed by 20 genes and the human and
different variants are used for
different cells cancer also makes
choices which is incidental to the stock
in nerve cells you have microtubules
packing done densely the axon and also
present dendrite so I don't know if
anything will work today no okay so i
just wanted to show this dynamic
instability there's a video that doesn't
show but microtubules are very
dynamically in unstable they grow and
shrink is a very typical polymer from
anything else in the body DNA actin
filaments intermediate filaments they
don't behave like microtubules so
there's something special about it
biologically and we'd like to know what
is special about microtubules physically
or biochemically
and that's another cartoon which I stole
from Stuart Hameroff in this particular
case so they they self assemble and
disassemble I so I want to add another
another buzzword to it evolvable
computer a recyclable computer if we can
capture this power that will be
incredible and talking microtubules
interacting with actin filaments with
ion channels this is documented in the
literature now the challenge is the
integration of these various levels in a
hierarchy and button map or top down I
don't care we'll try to to look at it
from the bottom and create models that
stretch different orders of magnitude so
that's shown here in a schematic with
with with tubulin dimer and microtubule
micra people with maps in them and in a
bundle of microtubules inside the
dendrite and probably none of this will
work either and this will not work and
this will not work so sorry about this
but
maybe everything is skipping it
so
so I nearby and talking about the the
geometry the topology and beautiful
crystal structures I have some what I'll
show you is some computer and
reconstructed in silicon understanding
of these structures built together atom
by atom and this is the incredibly
powerful today you can use computational
resources to to reconstruct biological
structures that otherwise you can't see
crystallography gives you fixed images
at some level of resolution so this is a
video from actual berkeley from even org
Alice and her group showing the
formation of microtubules from people
and dimers and the structure of dimers
in great detail the ribbons the the
Healey season and the sheets and how
they fit into this cylindrical structure
how depolarization is asymmetric it's
different from polymerization the the
Rings and actually gamma tubulin is used
to nucleate microtubules so it's a
different building block forming rings
from which alpha and beta tubulin dimers
grow into cylinders and I will stop this
movie in a second because we don't want
to fall asleep but Stewart mentioned gtp
and GTP hydrolysis so beta tubulin has
exchangeable binding site for gtp and
that is one of the possible modes of
behavior conformational change is caused
by hydrolysis of gtp that's again the
quantum of energy just about two and a
half Katie just above noise level enough
to cause these instabilities to take
place so it's a very powerful nano
machinery if you want to look at it this
way I'll stop it now and
go back to the slide show one of the
structures that was not mentioned today
and played an incredibly important role
in microtubule biology we know of and in
my opinion also in all the processes
that were mentioned today is see Thurman
I see Thurman I of tubulin are not
crystallographically resolved these are
little tails whiskers that decorate the
surface of a microtubule and they are
very dynamic they contain forty percent
of the electrostatic charge of the
protein being only a very small fraction
of the mass and they have involved in
conformational dance that is highly
dependent on the sequences so this seat
are and I have sequence variability
which is completely unique to each
species in each form of tubulin in the
human body and I think that's that's
where a lot of research will go into and
a word of caution if you use laboratory
techniques an abandoned and and
colleagues they have to be very careful
what sort of tubulin they are using
because each tubulin has different
c-termini that are absolutely crucial to
their functioning here's a
reconstruction of the microtubule in
silico that's the entire it's millions
of atoms here actually this is that went
into the computer program that created
this image and and you have see time and
I that I mentioned dynamical structures
and I have some videos to show you how
they they have different modes of
oscillation so we've talked today about
eight megahertz 1211 megahertz some of
it may have to do actually with the
dynamics of c-termini and and they are
shown here prominently in a narrative
reconstruction of the tubulin dimers so
these are the protruding in this
particular case straight app but that's
not the necessarily the confirmation
that they always adopt it was just for
the purpose of simulation
ok so again more info for the physicists
actually electrostatics plays a crucial
role here because the way the structure
is put together in this beautiful
lattice including the ring and reflects
the attraction between the negative and
positive charges as they are expressed
on the surface of tubulin that shows you
how the ring is made for example and and
this is the formation of the microtubule
from dimers also following the
principles of electrostatics this has
not been completely understood to the
greatest detail and the energy involved
in the formation but definitely the
principle is there and that's a
reconstruction with a electrostatic
surface rendition so the red is negative
charge blue is positive it has actually
a very important meaning because
microtubules have a net polarity they
are not it's not arbitrary which is the
plus and the minus end both from the
biological point of view one is more
actively growing than class than the
other minus but also they have
electrostatic polarity so there is an
electric field along the microtubule
which would explain some of the effects
that we're talking about today and also
some of the experiment that I
participated in with dr. ken taylor from
Harvard this slide also shows you the
values of these charges which may be in
view of these technical difficulties
i'll just skip what i want to spend a
few minutes on is c termini and their
dynamical states those of you who are
physicists in the audience will right
away hopefully think about spin spin up
spin down actually the seeker man I have
two stable States that we demonstrated
by molecular dynamics simulations one is
app one is down in fact it makes contact
with a positively charged patch on the
opposite dimer so beta tubulin
c-terminus
the alpha tubulin positive dimer and
vice versa this actually also causes
conformational changes work that is
currently submitted for publication so
at least four states at least four
because for the dimer up and down for
beta up and down for alpha so two times
two is four and this is another
simulation that I dare not touch that
shows you have actually dynamically
these states evolve you can start with
the down state of bent c-terminus and
run the simulation for a few nanoseconds
and then it will be you'll see it and
unbind and vice versa so so these things
oscillate there are natural oscillations
between these two states I'll give up on
all the videos by the way sir and these
are the ones that I maybe I would like
to show but maybe at the end we'll come
back to it time permitting what I'm
showing you here and we've classified
them completely it's it's it's almost
like a library of dynamical states so
I'll step away from the microphone for a
second
we have these see time united states
that may go down or app but they also
depends very strong underwear they had
what have people in the camera so it's
both I tubulin or you don't like it for
human tubulin in the in the link of
tubulin microtubules it's alpha 1 2 3 4
5 there isoforms isotypes of tubulin and
beta 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 each one has a
different mode has a characteristic
dynamical mode it's like a dancer
somebody's dancing the waltz the other
is dancing the tango somebody's ChaCha
they have their own little dances and I
think this is very much in terms of
resonance they so if you can now imagine
the microtubule decorated with these
dancers and it's made one cell is making
dancers from alpha six and the other
from beta floor they will be engaged in
different dances and therefore different
resonant frequencies I hope this message
is getting through and I'll show you
these dances I have all of them but
assembled okay
so that's under the topic of c-terminal
tail dynamics and they they are we have
estimated that they oscillate on the
frequency of jigga hurts so maybe not
eight megahertz but much faster than
that and this is not the experiment that
was performed at Harvard with Horatio
cantillo Horatio is a very skilled
biochemist biophysicist who is tomorrow
is the only person in the world maybe
outside of Tsukuba who can actually grab
microtubules micropipettes and
manipulate them he used micropipettes
which were electrodes also so he sent
electric pulses from one pipette
micropipette to the other measured the
signal and to his astonishment and mine
also this is what what they found
actually these electrical pulses were
amplified so if so the blue one is the
initial pulse at the first end and the
red is at the receptor end of the SOI
meter and receptor and the amplitude is
increased between depending on the
simulation between two and five times so
this is a big puzzle and not in addition
to all these crazy things that that
Stuart talked about in einer Brown
mention this is an accomplished
experiment in respectable journals
biophysical journal reporting an
amplification of the like electric
pulses along the microtubule surface we
have published papers also theoretical
explaining what's happening here and
they involve actual ionic so now due to
some physical concepts and explanations
ionic waves which were sent by the one
elect one of the electrode centinela
ionic cloud which senses the surface of
the microtubule the microtubule is
actually acting to attract ions because
it's negatively charged we have positive
ions sodium potassium and they
congregate around it and they feel it so
on one level a microtubule surface is a
capacitor and another water is a
resistor
I ions and water resists the flow up
because of the viscosity so we have to
these and there is also olicity that
anna Brown mentioned so it it also can
involve inductance and we created the
RLC model that sorry that is sketched
here it's electrical circuit model which
with parameter values that were
estimated from from molecular biophysics
and one complication that that is
interesting and important to observe
especially in the context of the work
from tacuba is that a microtubule is not
a solid surface it has pores nanopores
periodically located between alpha and
beta dimers so ions actually I've drawn
inside the lumen because of the
potential difference between the outside
surface which is more negative than the
inside surface which is more positive so
we've created the three-dimensional
model that includes flow along inside
and through the lumen and this is
published in this year's physical review
again google it and and we found
actually that it explains asymmetry this
is an IV characteristic asymmetry of the
of the microtubules conductive property
so Stuart mentioned this and now let me
try and summarize some numbers I started
out by saying that the brain is probably
more powerful than the most powerful
supercomputer I think we are scratching
the surface and here's a conservative
estimate in terms of if you take into
account the number of microtubules
number of neurons in the brain and the
number of states that each dimer can can
encode this is actually before we do the
phosphorylation calculation c-terminus
States at least for paradigm electron
hopping their app I didn't have the time
here to show you the elect
i also have double well states in which
they can hop so let's say four and
conformational changes this is
documented experimentally to spur
daimler so conservatively speaking you
have 32 states / diner for 1 gigabyte of
processing power per neuron with a
hundred billion neurons in the brain if
you use your brain to full capacity
Einstein said that only ten percent and
even I think he would be in this
category so let's say put these numbers
together that's ten to the twentieth
bits per brain is my estimate of the
computational capability of the average
human brain and if these transitions can
occur at nanosecond scale then you have
10 to the 28 flops actually some of you
may be very skeptical of this estimate
and will laugh at me let me just
actually don't laugh because fun lineman
in 1958 came up with the same number ten
to the twentieth subsequently we became
more and more cynical about our ability
to think and and you have the you know
the good some of the Guru's of modern
computational science estimating on the
tenth one gigabyte one gigabit per brain
with two bits per second of visual
verbal tactile musical memory and a
human lifetime of two and a half billion
seconds this is incredibly depressing
how does it compare my estimate isn't
red and you can challenge me of this 10
to the 19th if we use bites okay so
that's that's still how to present
capacity the total number of the data on
the web is ten to the fifteenth probably
drawing by one percent every minute the
library of congress 10 to three times
ten to the fifteenth so i think we are
definitely capable of incredible amounts
of information storage the question of
how do you read and write and read is of
course of absolute importance and we
with Stewart's explanation of how we see
phosphorylation sites on tubulin as
potential memory storage we're getting
closer and closer I want to say this is
not tubulin and and using proteins as
memory chips is not our original idea
this has been around and I want to give
credit to David Wishart from the
University of Alberta who has been
thinking about this for a long time and
perhaps they can be even a greater
capacity than than what I mentioned here
but what I want to before I forget and
before it's the time is over I want to
say something that may be a little bit
on the speculative side you must have
heard about near-death experiences and
people going through this life history
in their mind and everything is encoded
apart if we believe these stories then
if you if you want to store all this
information that you ever received
through sensory perception this will be
an incredible amount of information and
these numbers that lambda where and
others are talking about are
insufficient for that so you really have
to look deeper and the second
possibilities hypnosis also under
hypnosis people recall a lot of events
that normally you don't have access to
so there may be started quite quite
deeply in the brain and this just one
one one more
addition to Stewart the description of
our calmodulin kinase the original idea
for this actually came recently two
years ago through the experiment report
in science daily and I think
subsequently science of peonies I
remember the the journal were actually
commercial commercial and kinase was
inhibited in mice and and and the mice
lost the memory of training in the
previous half an hour so that's how it
kind of started the search for how
calmodulin kinase is involved in memory
and and we linked it to phosphorylation
sites of tubulin remember these pictures
so my estimate in regarding the capacity
of the human brain through microtubules
did not involve this aspect at all
that's another means of storing
information now we did something more
that Stewart didn't mention with Travis
Craddock my student asked if the
following question following after
actually advice from Stewart where drew
anesthetics really binds only only to
two receptors in synapses or is it
possibility that any possibility of me
anesthetics binding to tubulin and if so
where so this is unpublished work but
finished calculations and I'm going to
give you the sights of anesthetic
binding and tubulin that we discovered
through computational modeling and it's
very telling so I highlighted in red
some some sites for an aesthetic
bindings halothane was one of these the
volatile anesthetics that we tested they
bind in places were oncologic agents
chemotherapy agents bind taxol
vinblastine colchicine and also world
gdp binds so this is a testable
prediction that we will be confirming in
the lab in other words if this is so
anesthetics could be in here
of things like taxol another is they
bind to a lot of tryptophans and
interestingly Syrians and three onions
in c-terminal regions this is exactly
will calmodulin kinase binds these
pictures that that Stewart and I just a
second ago showed the protocol at the
poodle right Nenana poodle the Nano
poodle binds exactly where anesthetics
bind in one of the sites so it makes
sense that you lose memory because you
the nanner puddin doesn't work and
finally also binding the positive
patches with c-terminal binds I told you
that sick time and I bend over and bind
to the respective partners positive
patches on the beta or alpha tubulin
route they also bind there so there is a
lot of interesting information against
the process we have the skeleton of a
model and just to to add to the
complexity you can have in addition to
these rather fast changes and
information storage capabilities you may
also have in the brain long-term effects
of learning and sometimes pathological
developments Stuart mentioned
Alzheimer's disease and decoupling of
tau maps for map tiles from microtubules
you can also have strengthening these
connections through through enforcement
through reinforcement through learning
and repetition so this again a video
clip that I dare not touch shows you how
these map interconnections dynamically
change architecture so that's another
level of and I guess I'm done allow me
just to show one of these dances it
dances maybe with after the ice go
through the conclusions the human brain
in my opinion has an amazing
computational potential I call a
supercomputer cluster
the neuron is a single computational
unit SL like any other cell can exist on
on their own and performs complex
computational processes at the level of
quantum of biological energy I dare not
say quantum of physics but crampton of
biological energy if it's an available
its itself the neuron is an available
computer which communicates with app to
100,000 nearby computers so think about
these communicating networks inside the
brain and within each computer you have
microchips which we call microtubules as
elementary cup additional elements with
approximately 1 gigabyte of memory or
random access memory or whatever else
there may be there and this is all I
prepared for today and I apologize for
all these technical difficulties thank
you very much ok we have some time for
questions for Jack any questions ok if
there are no question so I'm talking yet
great great talk thank you very much I
wanted to thank you especially for
bringing up I'll break Bueller's work
and I wanted to highlight one other
thing that you didn't bring out and
Albert Bueller has an area he refers to
as functional anarchy of the genome I
want to comment and tie this a little
bit back into what Elizabeth talked
about earlier the first stake through
the heart of the central dogma of
biology was really when Mark Barbara
McClintock won the nobel prize for the
notion of jumping genes and in her
acceptance speech she said we will be
surprised to find out the degree to
which the genome senses its environment
and shapes itself in response to that
now if that doesn't make schrödinger's
cat start to how the idea of a sensor
and a shaper it did to me when I was
first looking at some random mutation so
I would be happy to direct anybody into
the genomic literature the second stake
through the heart of this central dogma
biology now is with the sequencing of
the genome less than two percent of the
human genome codes for any protein and
people who look at that
say how can you generate something as
complex as a human being from such a
small number of genes they what I think
they haven't come to terms with yet are
the non coding portion of the genome
forty percent of the human genome is
mobile it gets up and it moves around
and it rearranges itself and Albrecht
Bueller talks about this in the
functional anarchy of genome so we can
talk scruff like it's very common
actually and I think there is also talk
back to the cheek so there's two way
communication it's not just instruction
it's actually information flowing
backing and I hope blame like nipples or
everything but they may also play a lot
of this okay Jack you want to describe
your videos so this is one of the
c-terminal I add it's it's from beta
tubulin too I'll show you so that
basically remote these whiskers they're
not just randomly flailing around
subject to thermal wing when you
simulate this is the computer you'll see
that each one of them has a slightly
different mode of vibration or
oscillation I'm going to show I have all
all of them classified we've done
extensive simulations with my former
student Tyler Lewis Cove is now at
Rutgers this is you see quite different
and each of these modes has a different
frequency so you can communicate with
them that could be another dynamical way
of encoding that's this address you know
this is the shape that I'm showing you
is encoded by the G so so it's in the
genome by the way it so it's beta
reachable in beta to do buildings a
different gene and every organism will
have a different one so if you want to
cure cancer in mice maybe you'll need a
different frequency and that's another
one so i have many of these but just to
illustrate the point that they
completely diff
completely different motions so let's
stay a splash thank you let's thank the
speaker last time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
