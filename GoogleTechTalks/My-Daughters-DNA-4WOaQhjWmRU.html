URLs if you will because this project
was really 90% 95% of this project was
done in in my attic which is where I do
my after hours and four hours work and
it really the story in some ways of my
daughter's DNA begins with naturally my
daughter and this is a recent picture of
her and unless you're a geneticist she
looks like it we're a very cute little
girl what she is to be sure but she has
a number of things a number of clinical
findings which collected together a
constitute of syndrome and a syndrome is
as you probably all know comes from the
word to be on the same Road
or running together and the syndrome is
just a medical term to to describe a
collection of findings a constellation
if you will of stars that are generally
found together and there's some
variability sometimes but in general
these things run together so that
typically means that there's a common
cause for all the things you're seeing
and she clearly has a syndrome and at at
birth when she was born I was in the o.r
because she was born by a cesarean
because she was the third cesarean and
it was obvious to me right away that she
had something she had very very long
feet which by chance triggered in my own
mind a disease or condition known as the
Marfan syndrome well known to me because
I trained with the guy that really put
the Marfan syndrome on the map that was
dr. Victor McKusick at Hopkins who which
is where I went to medical school and
did my train my clinical training so I
saw these feet and flashed through my
mind marfan but she also had some other
things that didn't really fit into that
syndrome she had her her fingers were
contracted and she had a big port wine
stain
on her face you know what's called a
famous nevia's and those things are not
a feature of the marfan so I didn't
really know what she had and she seemed
perfectly fine or apgar's were 9 and 9
which are general measures of well-being
post postnatally so I I just got into
the swing of being a dad that day but
then right away I decided to take her to
an orthopod because it seemed to me her
primary problem was was orthopedic with
her long feet and with her contracted
fingers so that really began this whole
journey of trying to figure out what it
was and a lot of that was Shepard
shepherding her through the whole system
to find somebody who who could actually
provide me with with some guidance and I
fully expected to be honest with you
that somebody would say AHA that's it
she's got this and and that that would
be the end of it and the reason you want
a diagnosis and I think this audience
understands this you want to diagnosis
because it often dictates the natural
history that is to say what you could
expect in the future it dictates a
therapy oftentimes if there is one and
it also dictates in some cases who you
go see you know there are specialists in
these various things and so for all
those reasons you want to know what to
expect how to treat how to manage and
who's going to do that job but just you
know so that's that's where it all began
and I'm gonna as I said I'm going to
march you through that picture was taken
by a guy named Cody Pickens was a great
guy
a really gifted photographer in my view
notwithstanding the source so this is a
site that I launched really right after
the Sipho talk this summer
mainly because somebody in the audience
from The Economist picked up on this
story
and I wanted to take advantage of the
fact that there might be some readers
and the purpose of launching my
daughter's DNA dot o-r-g
was to to do a few things
one was to to find other cases like my
daughter it geneticists essentially
never believe a single case even if you
think you've really nailed the genetic
cause they just they always want to see
it either mentalizing in a family so
multiple affecteds or they want to see
multiple effect is an unrelated families
who have the same genetic problem so
they never believe a single case and
it's rare anyway so I needed to find
other people like my daughter and in the
process I realized that actually there's
no place where geneticists and even
highly motivated patients and families
share cases that puzzle them those get
really buried to be honest with you
either literally as you'll see in some
cases or figuratively in the sense they
get a working diagnosis which is
generally a grab bag of things and they
say well you have something and you just
get put into that and usually nothing
happens from that point on so I wanted
to create a forum recognizing that it
might be quixotic to think that
physicians would actually take the time
to post cases particularly puzzling
cases which might reveal their ignorance
what if somebody came along and said oh
that's such-and-such I've seen a million
cases of those and they're embarrassed
or more insidious that physicians
particularly academics kind of hoard
their patients until they figure them
out what they have and then they publish
and get all the glory so it may be
quixotic to think that people will use
it but I pitched it at a fairly high
level so that it would appeal to and not
discourage physicians and in fact I've
gotten a modest response but the quality
of the responses to my hypothesis and
other cases has been very very high
which is really encouraging and well
I'll get back to this because this is an
effort that I'm doing myself and I have
no ability to write code so if there are
people out there who are interested in
helping me do things I'd be more than
delighted and there are lots of features
that I'd love to add to this that would
help patients that would help
in fact because they're almost at the
same level physicians don't really
understand genetics and they're too busy
to learn and it's really the motivated
patients and parents that I think
elevate genetics and integrate it into
and force its integration into medical
practice I have a folder here and in
here I have a picture of my daughter's
fingers and you can get a sense of of
actually what it means to have little
crinkly fingers and the significance of
this wasn't obvious to me at first and
in fact I'm not a pediatrician I'm an
adult geneticist so I didn't really have
to deal with this too much it turns out
that the clinical description of this is
called arthrogryposis which is just
Greek for you know bent fingers and the
underlying cause is that when you're in
utero you're not extending your fingers
sufficiently and and in fact all your
muscles develop and all the the the skin
across the joints gets stretched out
from movement in utero and the first
question they asked my wife was whether
were there reduced movements in in utero
and the answer was I don't think so and
you know for four fingers it's hard to
know whether the fingers are moving but
I think this is indicative in some ways
of actually the fact that her case is
relatively mild because if you have
contractures across the large joints
it's actually worse and in fact across
the large joints she has laxity which is
a wasn't another clinical clue so I'll
give you one other picture and I'll just
walk through a little bit about I'm
sorry about what a geneticist sees when
they look at somebody's face and and
this actually gets me to another point
which is that geneticists are really the
ornithologists of Medicine in the sense
that it's an observational science at
least historically it's been and that
means that they have catalogued in great
detail all the little things that that
are
normal and abnormal like the patterns of
the fingerprints or the position of the
ears and things that all the rest of us
don't really take much notice of but
again as a collection of findings they
can be they can be unique and therefore
named as a syndrome and in this this is
a little bit you might think that that's
a fairly typical face and it is but she
has a fairly prominent what's called a
tubular nose here a tubular Ridge that
runs up here and actually where the
frontal bones meet there's a little
Ridge it's called am atopic Ridge you
can barely feel it on there and of
course nobody did for a long time what's
not apparent is that her eyes are a
little bit further apart so you now
you're getting this idea that when the
bones were coming together they didn't
quite fuse all the way she has a little
bit of what's called hypoplasia meaning
not full growth underneath the eyes here
so her eyes are a little bit more
prominent and you may be able to
appreciate that her the the sclera of
her eyes the whites of her eyes are
tinged blue eggshell blue and that again
is something that's well known
associated with a lot of different
things but well known to be associated
with general connective tissue so just
just in her face alone you're beginning
to see four or five features that begin
to define a syndrome what I don't have a
picture of not but I'll show you a
little bit later is the fact that if you
look down her throat you see that the
little thing that hangs down in there
that little piece of flesh called the
uvula is split and that turned out to be
a a key thing and of course I don't look
down her throat and I didn't know to
look down her throat and nobody looked
down and throat until she was about 18
months and and saw that in fact in her
records it says her uvula is normal
which it couldn't be
so usually normal means I didn't look at
it the
in medical fees so I'm gonna move on to
the Marfan just so that folks get up get
a sense of what what that is and in this
particular case I'm going to Wikipedia
and Marfan is is is a syndrome
associated with the specific gene a
defect in a gene called fibrillin and
there it is a syndrome and in order to
be diagnosed as having the Marfan you
have to have at least three or four
things in a long list of things to
qualify and there these criteria change
over the years as more and more patients
are seeing et cetera et cetera but one
of the things that you'll notice is that
they have a chest deformity and in this
case it's sunken in which is called
excavatum pectus excavatum but it's it
can also be a pigeon breast it just
depends on which way the bones go during
development and that's that's called
pectus carinatum and you notice the long
fingers which is very very typical of
the Marfan they also have long limbs so
they're disproportionately tall and
they're in their arm span and they're
their upper body to lower body segments
ratio is slightly altered in a in a very
stereotyped way and and very importantly
these patients have problems with their
aorta the root of the aorta dilates and
all of these features are a part of the
Marfan syndrome all attributable to
mutations in the fibril and one gene and
when I was in medical school working
with dr. McKusick
in in the 80s early 80s it was felt that
the way this mutation exerted its effect
was that it made a defective protein
that was kinked in some way and when it
was incorporated into the connective
tissue outside the cells just the the
sinews if you will because it it was
kinked the stacking if you will of the
various components was disrupted and as
a consequence
the tissue was weak and with the
constant beating of the heart that the
aortic root would dilate and eventually
these patients died if not treated they
die of rupture of that aorta generally
in their 30s or 40s and sometimes the
later sometimes a little sooner
depending on where the mutation is and
the treatment for that today is
beta-blockers which basically decreases
the pounding of the heart lowers your
blood pressure and a surgical repair of
the aorta if that's necessary so when I
when I was considering all the things
potential problems that my daughter
might have obviously the Marfan is way
up there in my on my list primarily
because of the aortic concern I needed
to know whether she had some aortic
disease she had some of the features she
had pectus carinatum she had the the
long fingers her long bones were not
long so that was a little bit mysterious
to me and it turns out she has this
bifid uvula which is not a feature of
the Marfan and in fact the it turns out
that when I was training with dr.
McKusick I I probably saw many cases of
a of another disease which is called
Lois Dietz and I'm not sure I have that
here but lowey's Deeds
turns out to be a syndrome very very
similar to the Marfan was confused for
many years with them our family patients
were all kind of lumped together and
geneticists would say oh you know that's
just the variability that we see but it
turns out it's a separate syndrome and
that syndrome has as the bifid uvula
much worse vascular disease and it turns
out they have the wide eyes so this was
my source of much of the information
this was a database originally started
by dr. McKusick called online Mendelian
inheritance in man and originally it was
just an internal database at Hopkins
that people internally using the Welch
library system could look at his entries
it was very idiosyncratic in that sense
Victor would get up in the morning read
that all
the journals and type in whatever he saw
so it's very much like the original
edition of the OED which is based on
historical principles where the first
occurrence of the word in the language
say in Chaucer or Sydney or Shakespeare
something was and you could see the
evolution of the definition of the word
and its usages this is very similar to
that unintended but it captures the
history of the description of that and
the literature that supports that and
the it turns out that there was a
discovery made actually an association
which was interesting the gene for the
Marfan syndrome is fibrillin one that's
mutations in that gene caused the
syndrome that turned out to have a high
degree of similarity to another protein
called latent EGF binding protein and
essentially what that observation did
was link a path a pathway the tgf-beta
transforming growth factor pathway which
is a hormone with the fibrillin one with
with the with the marfin and that opened
up a whole new way to think about what
was going on in the marfin and indeed
led to the description of this other
disease as well and all of this is
happening in the last four or five years
and and this was it all post-dated my
training and my following this field
very closely but as a consequence of
considering the Marfan has a as part of
the differential diagnosis in my
daughter i had to go back and read this
literature and familiarize myself with
it and it and as a consequence of that
it became the the disease that became
highest on the differential list was not
the Marfan but this new syndrome called
Louis deets which involved wide eyes the
bifid uvula and the catastrophic
vascular disease that you see in those
patients the average age of death is 27
so I didn't know too much about that two
years ago I went to Hopkins really in
search of a great
physical exam because I knew my daughter
had a bunch of things and and maybe some
other things that I hadn't seen so I
wanted to take her to go see Viktor and
some other people at Hopkins they were
gracious you know they set up a clinic
appointment we go they all come in to
the room and they see be your name is
Beatrice and they're all going like this
or all going like this you know I'm
saying what's going on here they're
looking down at the throat they call
some other people they come into the
room and they're they're all saying yeah
that's it and so it became pretty clear
that they had this conviction that she
had some diagnosis that I wasn't aware
of and they hand me a paper and say we
published this three weeks ago this is a
collection of patients that we thought
had the Marfan but it turns out they
have a mutation in a different gene or
actually two genes and it's called
loeys-dietz and then the guy who handed
me the paper was lowey's Bartlow 'yes
and he said go ahead and read this paper
and i knew nothing about it and they say
we strongly urge you to get an echo how
about today I said well an
echocardiogram of my daughter's heart
and I said well just by chance I've
already ordered one or got got one on
the schedule back at UCSF and can you
wait until Thursday and they said fine
just send us send us a copy of the echo
and I get on the plane and come back
here and I read this paper and I'll show
you this paper it's it out basically it
outlines the this this new syndrome
which whoops sorry
which essentially it the all these
patients were confused with the marfin
I'm sure when I was training I saw these
patients when we called it marfan and
just left it at that
and what you can see is that these
patients do have crumpled up fingers
they have wide eyes and they have this
bifid uvula which looks like a heart
upside-down its cleaved and some and
again we're talking about midline
development and of course what they have
is is terrible vascular disease these
these kids are born actually with
dilated aortas in some cases in this
particular paper I think one of the
children had an aortic root a Artic
replacement at age nine months so I'm
reading this paper and I'm crushed to be
honest because I'm thinking well yeah
she's got so many things that lowey's
Deeds patients have how could she not
have it they draw some blood and you
know they they say we're gonna check the
two genes and these are tgf-beta
receptor genes so it's all kind of
making sense with respect to the pathway
which gave him a clue in the first place
and she had her echo that Thursday and
that was totally normal which was great
yeah it was giant sigh of relief but I
still had to wait for the genes they
sequenced the genes and a month or two
later they said they're completely
normal and so I'm puzzled they're
puzzled we're all puzzled but the thing
that really was most affecting my
daughter was the fact that she had
muscle weakness and muscle weakness has
not even talked about in there and if
you read all the literature on the
Marfan you don't really see any
discussion of muscle weakness
so I decided really to reorient my
thinking about this this is really about
muscle and and the bifid uvula and hyper
Taylorism they must be
they're they're mild compared to some of
these patients so maybe that's just a
sideshow if you will and maybe I should
really focus on the muscle and so I from
that point on I was in terra incognita
because as i said there are no clues in
the literature about the relationship
between muscle disease Louis Dietz
Marfan and any of the other things
except I went back and looked at one
paper for a syndrome called Beals
syndrome Ron Beals orthopod Portland
described in 72 a group of families that
look like the marfin in fact again they
were confused with the Marfan and they
had long fingers long bones no vascular
disease in general and but they had puny
muscles in fact two-thirds of the
patients had a little bird leg like legs
and I saw a picture in that paper and I
said gosh you know bees legs look like
that yeah little bird legs and so I
wrote up the case you know in a proper
way and I sent it off to Ron Beale so I
didn't know but I said what do you think
have you ever seen so much muscle
weakness in any of your cases and these
other things and he said no I I don't
think it's beels
he calls it something else he's you know
some humility and you know that was it
but here's one thing that's very clear
orthopods don't look down throats you
know they don't they don't they look at
muscles and bones and things like that
but they're not looking down throats so
there's a very real possibility to me
that actually some Beals patients might
have bifid uvula
but they don't have hyper Taylorism so
again I was kind of lost I'm thinking
well okay if the Marfan is fibrillin one
tgf-beta tgf-beta receptors and this
constellation of findings and Beals is
fibrillin
to are very closely related protein and
then there's a couple of black box
but clearly they have to converge on the
same pathway in my view and maybe
there's something in between that
regulates muscle and that's kind of
where I went on this and so it was a
little bit of a wild goose chase which I
think you know is very typical to be
honest with you of of this kind of thing
but I was inclined to do it and what I
love more than anything else is
generating hypotheses so I had a friend
who was the world's expert on one
protein a little bit like this you know
I was the world's expert on amino acid
number 452 but he actually was the
world's expert on the whole thing so he
was in a different universe but he had
discovered a protein called myostatin
and myostatin is a protein that
regulates both the number and size of
muscle regulates the number of muscles
that you develop in utero and
secondarily once you're born the size of
them and the reason it caught my
attention is that it happens to be the
most closely related hormone in the
human genome to tgf-beta so I'm thinking
this is starting to make sense and the
other thing the more I read about it the
receptors which have these archaic names
that totally unrelated to my aesthetic
actually converge on the same pathway so
tgf-beta tgf-beta receptors and and they
signaled to the nucleus through a family
of proteins called SMAT 2 and CeMAT 3
turns out that myostatin signals to the
nucleus through CeMAT 2 and CeMAT 3 so
I'm thinking that's that's interesting
because maybe Beall syndrome with its
defect in fibrillin 2 is filtering
through the myostatin pathway causing
puny muscles but the reason you don't
see the vascular disease in those
patients is because these the signals
here are through a different
pathway not through smooth muscle
vascular cells but maybe just skeletal
muscle so that's how I rationalize that
and of course is really hard to find
that information there is a there is a
website put up by Novartis the Research
Institute that shows the distribution of
all the genes and how they're expressed
but the resolution was so poor that I
really couldn't get more a definitive
feel for whether there was a
differential receptor expression or
whatever between the myostatin receptor
and tgf-beta receptor so what I
basically decided to do was I asked my
friend would he sequence these receptors
I kind of went over this hypothesis with
them and he said yeah
sounds reasonable to me and if I were to
start I would start on receptor 2 B
because I'm pretty sure that that's the
business the most important receptor for
myostatin but they're there there are
others there's number one and there are
some other things other receptors that
glom on there one of which is the
tgf-beta receptor which I thought was
fascinating okay so we're getting this
convergence here and to make a very long
story short I actually had to do it
myself because nobody would do it for me
and I don't know whether that's whether
that was because everybody was polite
but said you know really felt that the
hypothesis was totally harebrained or
whether the reason some of them gave
which was well we can sequence it but we
can't give you the information because
we're not a certified lab and we
basically can't hand over clinical
information that you're gonna act on I
contacted one guy who had sequenced be
in a group of patients he I think he was
hiding in Montana or something because
that turned out to be a spurious result
but the other two genes had never been
sequenced in humans in a specific way
obviously they've been sequences in the
course of sequencing the human genome
but they'd never been the target of any
investigation never been associated by
linkage or any other method with human
disease so it's kind of on my own and
really out of frustration I just decided
you know what I've sequenced lots of
yeast genes and mouse genes and plasmids
and things like that back in the stone
Age's why not just do it myself and
that's what I you know was kind of
forced to do and I just wanted to walk
you through a little bit of what that
entails if you're interested and the it
really began with going to the ensembl
database i found out that the u.s.
database was actually too hard for me to
use but these were the names of the
genes actin receptor 1b there was two
and 2a it actually took me about a month
to figure out just the nomenclature
because these genes have so many
different names the proteins were
discovered by this endocrinologist and
he names it follicular growth factor
receptor 17 somebody else finds it in in
you know the rat and they name it
something else so so just to get it all
straight took me a while but I finally
got it straight and of course the
Europeans don't use the same
nomenclature as the US so that made it
slightly challenging but I adopted the
European method and I focus on this gene
because this turned out to be the one of
interest and here what you get at this
particular site is you get a menu of you
know all the things you'd like to know
about this gene for example the exons
which are the the portions of the gene
that remain after splicing of the
messenger occurs so it's really the
business end and it's where all the
protein coding regions are and that was
key to me because my model for this was
the lowest heed syndrome the lowest heed
syndrome had defects in tgf-beta
receptor 1 &amp;amp; 2 with essentially I
Nicolle phenotypes suggesting that it's
that just screwing up that pathway is
sufficient to cause the the disease and
all of the mutations were in one part of
those two genes it was in an enzymatic
portion called the kinase domain that
does the signaling to CeMAT to in this
mat 3 and when you can't signal
something goes amiss and so my
hypothesis was that B had a defect in
the kinase domain but in this case in
the myostatin that that turned out not
to be the case and then probably that's
a good thing and we can talk about that
but my focus was on the protein coding
regions originally and this gave me all
of the all of the sequence that allowed
me to then design a set of primers and
you're probably all familiar with what
PCR is but essentially the way this
works is that you you isolate you
isolate DNA from from wherever the
source is and you design two little
pieces of DNA that are complementary to
opposite strands and essentially what
the reaction the PCR the polymerase
chain reaction allows you to do is
amplify that is to say make numerous
copies identical copies of a of a
fragment of DNA that are contained
within the boundaries of those primers I
was a method discovered actually around
here and has totally revolutionized the
study of DNA and the what I essentially
did is go to the database get the
genomic sequence based on based on the
on what was in the database and again
there there's a lot of variation in the
database and they note these things for
example this is the genomic sequence
pulled out and they tell you wherever
they found in abnormality or or a
variant that's a much better term
actually and these variants to be honest
with you can be sequencing errors they
can be they could be something that
occurred in Tongans only and not in
anybody else in the world there's no
annotation so you don't really know but
they are noted in the database so I I
designed a set of primers that would
amplify every exon and some adjacent
regions of the three genes the AC V R 1b
there's no a for some reason a CV R 2
which doesn't have an a and then a CV R
2 B and those were the three genes and
the reason those three were we're used
as the one in the B come together two
copies of each come together and form
the receptor and you might say well what
what if you got two different kinds of
type - don't you need two types of type
one and you do and the other one the
other type 1 is the tgf-beta receptor
which had already been sequenced and
told I was told it was normal so I had
three others left and that's exactly
what I did essentially to make a long
story short I used the lab at Stanford
before I went over to Richmond and
bought a bunch of used equipment which
is cheap actually everybody's doesn't
want the ten-year-old PCR machine and I
extracted the DNA this is Andy fires lab
and he was very very kind to let me
spend the afternoon in their noodling
through extracting my DNA and my
daughter's DNA and then I ordered the
primers from a company actually I used
two different sources but you know
essentially pulled the
pulled the sequence out of ensemble and
I put it into this particular I went to
this website and they have a place where
you can design paula goes primer quest
that was me and here I would put in you
know a CV r1b exon2 and then I would
let's actually pull the sequence out if
we can of I'm just I think I'll go back
here let's see yeah yeah ensemble
release I'm gonna pull up just show you
how it actually did this I'm gonna pull
up the genomic sequence and cut and
paste it so this is what it looks like
in the genome that's the first exon the
pink I'm just gonna pull that in and go
to IDT if I'm up here somewhere right
here paste that in and gonna see if they
should be able to give me some primers
here and invalid entry I'm not sure why
I say final force following messages
let's go back here and I'm gonna trim oh
I see I've got some crap in there okay
that should be okay
so the annotations come with you and it
said for this particular piece of DNA
couldn't find any primers that met my
criteria so then I I could have
pre-wired this but this is what you do
you count a noodle through this and you
say okay well oh so no here and here
here gives me a set of primers here and
this set of primers is going to amplify
the region from about 325 to maybe five
twenty-five that's the best set of
primers that could find I will go back
and ask this to find a set of primers
that are a little bit more at the ends
of each of those so that I get a bigger
piece of DNA so when I sequence with
those two primers I cover all of the
exon in both directions it's a belt and
suspenders
approach because sometimes you'd get a
run of G's on the top strand and the
polymerase can't get through and so it's
staggered and gives you a bad read and
it's really about quality control and I
don't want to have to sequence these
more than once so I actually did
everything in duplicate and sequence
both strands and I actually didn't do
the physical sequencing I went and
priced out a DNA sequencer an old slab
gel system that I used to use and they
were like a thousand bucks and I'm
thinking oh gee and somebody told me
wait for three dollars and fifty cents
they'll you know you can just send this
off in the reaction will done it'll send
you a file back the next day and I think
that sounds like what I'm gonna do so so
that's what this is what you get when
you do that you get this the next day
and this is a just this is actually a
sequence off of that particular gene and
what you see is you see a lot of garbage
on the ends
it's sequences you know stuff but you
see there's some good sequence in there
and good sequences to find is you have
you have single Peaks here you know and
this is cccc nice clean Peaks and you
got software that will actually read it
and every once in a while you get an end
there because the shoulders of the peaks
overlap and it's ends that I'm looking
for because my hypothesis is that my
daughter has a single nucleotide change
on one strand that would give rise to
one defective receptor that could
account for the dominant likely dominant
features that she has meaning it's
noticeable dominant that's my hypothesis
yeah
no just sir yes sir but when you PCR you
you typically don't PCR a single single
chromosome you're always doing two
chromosomes so what you see is the
reason you get an N on a heterozygote is
because you got two strands too but
generally they're the same and this is
this is very typical you know of what
you see and so so the the process is
about making set of primers seeing if
they work seeing how good they work how
clean your sequences and and looking in
my case looking for ends now I'll jump
to the actual sequence that was of
interest to me and that is so here's
here's my file I did everything in Word
because I actually didn't want to buy
the software that allowed you to zoom
through and I just what I did is I
essentially just said find this that
looked like that and very very crude but
it still worked just fine
and essentially this is this is the this
is as you can see this is the
identification number for the sequence
that came out of the ambled database
this is the translated version meaning
the the codons that are coding for the
specific amino acids this is the amino
acid code here for these particular
codons I'm looking you know my
hypothesis that I'm looking for missense
mutations or possibly termination
meaning that the the signal to and
manufacturing the protein so that it's
truncated I'm looking for those in the
kinase domain and I'm looking for a
heterozygote so that's I need to be able
to read this sequence very cleanly and
it turns out the kinase domain is in the
last half of the gene the exons these
are fortunately these were small small
genes and in the case of fibrillin it
has 68 or 69 exons it is a nightmare to
sequence these had 10 or 11 depending on
which database you believe so I'm just
paging through here the the genomic
sequence you can see I've just cut and
pasted it in here and I use this as my
reference and I annotated it as I got my
sequence back and I basically sequence
did by each exon and the the red here
was the beginning of the sequence and
the long red here were the primers that
I actually developed and you can see it
the primer here is a good deal upstream
if you will 5 prime of the actual coding
region for the exon in this particular
case and here's the end of the reading
so my sequence would begin here on this
C and end on that T but usually the
first 20 30 40 are not so good in terms
of reading so I need to give some
breathers and you can see the greens
here are the reported variants that are
in the database and to my surprise you
know each little file that came back I
looked at it at night and it's a weird
it's a weird feeling
going through this knowing that it's
your daughter's DNA and she said it's
almost as though she's patiently sitting
there while you're sifting through to
try to find things and it each each file
that came back to me after sequencing
was was you know it was like you're at
camp and you can't wait to get this
letter from your from your girlfriend
but that to the nth power and what I did
is I annotated it wherever I saw a
variant I had to call B meaning call the
sequence and in many cases she had one
or the other variant and sometimes she
was homozygous for a variant or her
heterozygote as the case may be but in
in one case out of mmm almost 20,000
base pairs of reading she had a variant
that was not reported and this was
this was not where I had expected to see
it and let me see if I can pull that up
for you be as a heterozygote disposition
okay so this was it this a was the a out
of all these nucleotides I mean and it's
remarkable to me actually how how many
sequence variants were already in the
database but this one was the only one
that wasn't in there and this this was
my best candidate for being the cause of
her syndrome and you can see that it's
it's in the downstream region of the
gene this is not exonic or coding
anymore this is uh this is what we call
the three prime untranslated region and
that necessitated really a different way
of thinking about the problem because if
it's not in the coding region I'm not
affecting the kinase domain I'm probably
affecting the regulation of the gene
itself most likely the amount of protein
meaning if this particular site was a
site that's recognized by part of the
cellular apparatus that degrades the
RNAs maybe if it's not recognized the
level would go up and that would throw
things out of kilter the most likely
candidate for regulation would be a
series of micro RNAs actually which Andy
fire discovered that regulate mRNA and I
went to pull down the MIT software and
some other software that's used to
analyze that and this did not come up as
a site recognized by the canonical mi
RNAs but we're in an early we're in the
early stages of really understanding the
full panoply of those regulatory RNAs
but really the next step was to sequence
myself and my wife to see
we had an a in that position and I
haven't done that yet so I will do that
and of course if we are a in that
position yes yes but one of us if either
of us have it have that a but we don't
have the syndrome so this has to be I
mean my working hypothesis has always
been that the mutation came from me but
in my germ cell and the reason is is I'm
unaffected I don't I don't have any of
her clinical findings neither does my
wife and dad's particularly dads are 45
and over they throw off a lot of bum
seed and there is well documented
evidence that things like the marfin etc
cetera all the dads are older and so I
just assumed that I was the source of
this but if I have the mutation if I
have that variant then that's probably
not to cause it for problem yeah so so I
have to rule that out
that
well I've looked at every every snip
that was in the database and this that
one particular what I'm calling a
variant for lack of a better term that
particular a is the only one that's not
in any of the data to snip databases now
in fact most of them have no associated
phenotype but but as I said this
particular one wasn't even in the
database this wasn't even in there but
the vast majority of snips vast majority
you probably have a million snips
they're not associated with anything I
mean to do unless you have a mutation
that's already well-known it's not
really a snip but we can talk about that
because this is the opposite kind of
study where you're looking at sequencing
somebody and and capturing tons and tons
of variations where they have no
significance this is very focused and so
I took this result to a bunch of friends
you know I checked to see well is this
region of this gene well conserved its
primates have the identical sequence
it's it's it's a it's it's highly
conserved so it's probably doing
something and most of the people I
talked to said you know what's the
probability of you predicting that
there's going to be a variant in this
particular gene in this particular
pathway with this particular phenotype
it's probably it but you the only way to
prove it assuming that I don't have it
in my wife isn't is to find other
Beatrice's which is why I launched the
site and sent out the word to people who
see patients with myopathy who might
have bifid uvula z' who might have long
and spidery fingers etc etc to see if
and in fact I went to go visit children
Hospital in Boston they had 850 cases of
myopathy 76 of them had no diagnosis and
I went through all 76 of those cases and
I found six that overlap with the
clinical description of my daughter so I
think those patients are out there I
think the you know my kind of revised
pathophysiology is if she had had a
mutation in the kinase domain she
probably would have had the vascular
disease that that's my guess and so it's
a blessing in some ways that I didn't
find it in there because I think it
would have been worse and to find it in
a portion that regulates it and just
maybe throws the whole system slightly
out of kilter in some ways is is more
fitting with the temperamental nature of
this this particular protein myostatin
and tgf-beta the same way there are at
least nine levels of regulation of this
protein starting with how much of the
protein is made how quickly the RNA is
degraded the sequestration of the
protein itself all those things that
hold it so that it can't touch its
receptor things that negative really
regulate the receptor it's a whole haut
so the body is really trying hard to
contain the activity of this pathway and
just by changing the proportion of the
receptors having a little bit more could
disrupt it in fact there was a paper in
nature about maybe eight weeks ago that
no that was there's another paper
another paper about three or four issues
before that one showing that when you
disrupt the three prime untranslated
region of the ACV are to be gene that it
totally disrupts the development of the
african clawed toad the Xenopus laevis
system so that was exciting to me
because here's an example of a
regulatory portion of a gene in this
pathway
that has a profound developmental effect
on this particular species that that
little regulatory region is a little bit
more upstream from this one but it's
conserved from man all the way down to
lower vertebrates
we should be other parents that have
kids and the doctors don't know how much
try to get that involved in identifying
yeah I have there probably or seven or
eight cases that are posted on there now
a couple of them were from friends who
had children who have problems diagnosed
I mean undiagnosed one of them is a
friend of mine at Harvard
David Clapham whose nine-year-old son
died in his lap from a unknown
neurodegenerative disease and I
convinced him to put the case up which
was I think painful for him to be honest
with you but he thought it was
worthwhile and I think it it's it's a
lot of work to write up a case and to
put all the all the clinical stuff there
and to know what you should include for
example the Beatrice has had an elevated
platelet count you know it's been
variable and I haven't put that in there
but I've always thought that that might
be a clue because if the platelet count
is elevated is that the jak-stat pathway
that's interacting with whatever you
know so you know it's hard to know what
to do but almost all the cases that have
been put up there have been put up there
by scientists and physicians who have
children they're affected with no
diagnosis so it hasn't been for the most
part the highly motivated parent who
doesn't have a technical background but
there have been no cases so far it's
only been up there for a couple months
but there have been no cases from
physicians say it's Stanford or Hopkins
or wherever who have just decided to
post a case to see what kind of response
and that would be nice that would be
nice but as I said physicians are busy
there's a proprietary nature of patients
there is it's just not the way they
think so I think it's more gonna come
from parents who are working at a very
high level either because they're
scientists or because they've decided to
master
oh they do it they do and what's what's
really amazing to me and I think you
could say that I'm a little bit unique
in the fact that I'm you know I know
about biochemistry and I can I know
something about medicine and etc and
that's true it's a little bit of an odd
convergence of conditions here you know
to have a daughter that doesn't have a
diagnosis but everything is out there
really now I have to admit that the
really hard part of this was coming up
with the hypothesis that was the hard
part but I think there are ways I mean
for example and see if I can pull this
up for it quickly there are ways to
facilitate that and I have this chart
for example that was made by a friend of
mine that takes Oh mem the database that
we looked at previously and and just
does a network analysis of it and the
the point is this that let me see if I
can make this
make it bigger so you can really
appreciate this so here you've got
diseases by color or presentation like
deafness is not a disease but it's a
presentation Marfan is a diagnosis but a
presentation and you've got the edges
where the spokes here as genes and what
this does graphically is show you that
fibrillin one is the cause of the marfin
it also causes isolated ectopia lentes
which is dislocation of the eye and a
feature of the Marfan but if I were a
physician and this were live in other
words I had links here I could actually
say I've got a patient who looks
marfanoid what's the differential
diagnosis what are the other things that
kind of look like it or or you know
might might be related to it if if I
could just make that particular graph
live it would be so much more powerful
than it is just as basically eye candy
right now very little use to most people
other than to say look how
interconnected all the genes are and
blah blah blah but that would help a lot
I think just making that making it where
I could I could these would be live
links they would go to Oh mem itself
they could go to ensembl and also the
ability to put in new connections so for
example this does not have this does not
have the five the tgf-beta tgf-beta
receptor - what it does have I mean it's
receptor one you'll see down here in the
cancer many many genes cause all
different kinds of cancer but here all
by itself is lowey's deets which is
colored pumpkin because it is a
connective tissue disorder but it was
originally that particular dean gene
tgf-beta receptor - originally died
associated with colon cancer it's gonna
be interesting to see if those patients
actually develop that which is another
reason I'm glad she didn't have a kinase
to main defect but tgf-beta receptor 1
is not on here so it needs to be
annotated needs to be updated it needs
to be live it needs to be more robust
and so that's it that answers that
question
I can't remember can't remember I don't
think it is the I'll get that for you so
where does that leave us
let me just finish this up and say that
you know at the end of the day one of
the things that I've had to do is make
it what I call very difficult decision
about actually doing something about
this and here's a terrible sorry here's
a terrible slide that shows you a
pathway whoops
it shows you a pathway for angiotensin
ii and the reason this is interesting is
because this pathway by some miracle
biochemistry talks to tgf-beta in fact
this pathway talks to mad - and CeMAT 3
the proteins that are activated by
myostatin and by tgf-beta this was first
elucidated because angiotensin 2 is
elevated in cases of hypertension and so
the angiotensin ii receptor became a
logical target for drugs that manage
hypertension turns out when you give
patients angiotensin ii receptor
antagonists
it down regulates mad - and SMED three
as a side effect quote-unquote sign okay
off you know off-target effect well if
you give mice Marfan mice angiotensin
receptor blockers that is to say these
are mice that are heterozygotes for a
mutation in mark in fibrillin one those
mice are normal
it's pretty profound and so my daughter
is on look one of these drugs and I
didn't make that decision by myself
obviously
but the vascular disease of Louis deets
and the Marfan and she could be at risk
for vascular disease is ineluctable it
marches forward the aorta gets mushy it
dilates it bursts but this drug is safe
it's been in millions of people the side
effects are basically dizziness from low
blood pressure which you can titrate the
dose and manage that and so for me just
the idea of prophylactic and and trying
to minimize the risk of vascular disease
outweighs the small risk that the drug
poses and in fact I would add that when
you look in the literature and see the
patients that have taken this drug their
skeletal muscle increases in size and of
course the investigators who did that
have no idea why that is but I think the
reason is is that it's antagonizing
tamiya stat pathway and allowing those
skeletal muscles to grow and I'm not
gonna represent here that you can build
up your body by taking this drug
although you might nor am I gonna say
that the reason my daughter can now walk
up steps is because she's been on this
for seven months
but I'm not gonna take her off it unless
she has a problem you know so that's
really why you want a diagnosis is
because it leads to a treatment and even
though this is considered to be
controversial all the patients who have
really severe Marfan and lowest eats
they're on this truck there's no
clinical evidence yet but they're on it
and there is a clinical trial that's
being conducted and furthermore there
was a paper showing that the muscular
dystrophy Mouse
totally different problems you know a
dystrophy as opposed to a myopathy
distribution or you get degradation of
the muscle ongoing degradation and
constant regeneration I'm also trying to
fix itself those mice do better on this
drug and it may be because tgf-beta is a
participant in the pathology of muscular
dystrophy or maybe that myostatin is
that's not clear could be both but my
feeling is that just fortuitously this
drug will be used in a much more
expanded way than was originally
intended and yeah it's just connecting
all those little dots you know there are
lots and lots of little dots in this
story and you know I'm not going to say
that this is a conclusive that I have
the diagnosis or that I know why this is
having a beneficial effect but I'm a
physician and my primary charge and as a
dad as well is to do what I can you know
so that's I've just done what I can so
that I think that's the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
