this book becomes the open API of the
18th century this book allows you to
look up at Jupiter turn this planet and
it's and it's orbiting moons which is
about miss Jupiter 400 million miles
away I don't remember it turns it into a
giant in the sky and it's a
brilliant clock it's better than a
better than never needs winding
never runs down you can't misplace it is
always reliable yeah and so by using
this people anywhere in the world if
they have a clear night and a telescope
can tell exactly what time it is oh yeah
I see a question of the bank right here
not the baptism and you know but I don't
play my reflection yeah it's this
there's so approval to come but this was
a huge step forward and this opened up
an amazing amount of very precise
measurement all around the world Lewis
and Clark when they headed out from st.
Louis I had a copy of this book with
them and a telescope and could figure
out the latitude and longitude of places
in the American West explorers to South
America you know explores all over the
world could figure out map to within a
few miles exactly where they were on the
earth all by using this this in the
sky so that is oh and by the way you can
still buy these today that you can still
go to your bookstore and buy maybe not
your bookstore but a bookstore and buy
an ephemeris with all these listings the
the British government still puts it out
to this day for Majesty's nautical
Almanac office you know I just I picture
like you know some guy I got a Dickens
with a big you know quill pen you know
still figuring these out the US
government makes one the Government
Printing Office sells one the folks at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory make an
amazing on line one it's if you guys
ever looking for something to hack with
go online and look for the horizons
ephemeris at JPL you they have all this
data you can do things like at what time
do I have to be standing on Neptune to
see Saturn rise thinking crazy stuff
like that and
you know it's really too it's totally a
lot of fun so anyway the clock in the
sky bet that was hack number three so
give me a second to get a drink of water
and I will talk about hack number four
okay hack number four I call I call
triangle power it takes place over this
period from 1802 to 1843 and there are
two stars of this hack so let me start
with this guy first this is William
Lamden William Lambton was born in
England in about seventeen sixty or so
so a bit before our Revolutionary War he
actually fought in the Revolutionary War
here on the wrong side he fought on the
British side he was he was an instant in
the british army came over here was in a
battle in 1781 he was captured within 30
minutes and then spent the rest of the
american revolution in a prison of war
camp in York Pennsylvania so after that
start he then was kind of sent off with
a lot of other British royalty up into
the Canadian Maritimes this guy was a
really just unbelievably brilliant
surveyor a very skilled mathematician
and an astronomer as well he spent a lot
of time in a what's now New Brunswick
Canada he did a lot of surveying there
and then in about 18 0 2 he hit this
place he hit India now at this point the
British have been in India for about a
hundred and fifty years they started out
just as trading merchants remember the
the British East India Company well what
are the odds they were in India and so
and somewhere along the way I mean look
I mean the whole story of the British
and the India is you know there's a lot
of horror and bad things in there and
I'm not going to minimize I'm not trying
to gloss over that here but I'm going to
talk about one of the great scientific
things that happened during the Connell
time in India so by 1802 this this
William Lamden guy he hits the shore in
India and
convinces the Indiana the Indian
military that it would be a great thing
to do a really and I mean really really
scientifically sound survey of the of
the Indian subcontinent now there are
been maps of India but they were mostly
you know things people sketched out or
you go down this road there you know you
know turn at the Cal and go down that
road five miles to get to the next town
things like that he wanted to get things
on a much more scientific basis by 1800
the whole science of mapping has become
extremely scientific there's a lot of
really hardcore math and measurement
that's going on but this guy is about to
take it to the whole next level he
proposes to make a huge map a huge
survey what he called the trigonometric
survey of the Indian subcontinent other
fishermen here and he's going to do the
whole thing based on triangles so
everyone here graduate junior high okay
then you'll probably remember something
you learned back in junior high about
triangles if you have a triangle and
these three points picture them as
anything picture miss three towns or
three mountains could be three coffee
cups on your desk doesn't matter if you
know the distance between two of those
points and you know the angles from
those two points to the third point up
at the top of the screen in this case
you can calculate everything else about
this triangle you can calculate the
lengths of these two sides you can
figure out exactly where that point is
up at the top he's going to use so we'll
Lambton is going to use this simple
geometric principle to map an entire
continent so what he realized was take
that one triangle and just shrink it
down and once you figure done the
calculations for that triangle you can
find another point and draw lines to
that and then you can do the
calculations to figure out where that
new point is and then you can draw some
more lines to another point and you can
keep doing that and eventually you can
kind of leapfrog your way across across
any any body you want
so this is what they eventually ended up
doing William Lambton and the people
that followed him this is a this from
the British Museum this is a map of the
great trigonometric Survey of India and
i hope i don't know if all of you
sitting in the back can see but these
are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of little triangles every
one of these triangles is an actual
place in india where they set up a
survey point and then and then measure
the angles to adjoining points there's a
year today this is blow up with just the
center kind of the center strip right
down the spine of india this falls by
the way on the about the 78th degree of
longitude and one of the things that
William Lambton was very interested in
was the fact something had been known
for about a hundred years that the earth
isn't actually round it's not a sphere
it's not a perfect sphere the earth is
actually fatter in the middle than it is
at the polls and I think Newton
predicted this would be the case and it
makes sense if you think about the earth
is spinning around so centrifugal force
kind of stretches the earth now now this
didn't matter to Columbus or Mercator
anyone that but now we're getting to the
point where precision surveying
precision is so getting so fine grained
that that actually makes a difference
and one of the and the the change in in
shape of the earth with one of the great
unsolved questions of its day this is I
mean if this is as I said this is like
80 no to this question in 1802 is like
string theory questions today this was
like the total a cutting edge of physics
what is the actual shape of the earth is
it we you know a degree at different
latitudes isn't always the same distance
because the earth is as I said kind of
stretched out and flattened at the poles
but how much and how does it change
that's one of the things that Lambton
wanted to wanted to figure out now we
didn't the great thing was he didn't
really tell that to the generals that
said go out and do this survey he was
like oh no no were you know we'll do
this for the Empire you'll be able to
have you know wage better war throughout
India if you have better maps Mike
secretly
he was you know he was also really into
just the pure science of the thing I
mean I got the impression given the guys
great military career in the revolution
I don't think he was you know healthy he
was very much of a fighter you know but
he was a totally totally obsessed
scientist okay so how do you do this so
remember that that diagram the triangle
I showed you the first thing you have to
do is know the distance between two
points so he starts right here in was
called back then modrus on the coast and
he lays out a distance and and I don't
mean like he takes out like a tape
measure and stretches it across a room
he spends two months laying out an exact
distance about seven miles or so he used
he used this thing called of surveyors
chain and it's kind of a misnomer
because it's not it's not a flexible
change it's a series of metal bars that
each have a precise length that he would
stretch out to make a hundred foot
length but he wouldn't let it just
stretch out because it might sag and
then he it's hard to measure that he
built a table that he moved along and
picture this in India and 1800 you know
long it's like dusty road he would lay
out this perfectly straight 100 foot
long table lay this these metal chains
along it stretch him out don't pull them
too much because in the distance is
going to be tiny tiny bit longer and
measure exactly to the end point take
the whole thing apart move the table
down took two months to walk about seven
miles down this road and he was also
ended like he realized wait a minute
it's hot in the summer or hot during the
middle of the day so it's going to
expand I mean the guy he went insane so
he had thermometers he would adjust it
for every degree he realized well the
things going to expand about 71
hundredths of an inch that's too much
and then he realized that he went wait a
minute maybe my thermometers aren't
right so he built thermometers to check
against the other thermometers I mean he
was just you know he was like going
going around like a dog chasing his tail
trying to get the precision of this
first baseline correct because
everything else was going to hinge on
that so as I said in in 1802 he 1804
actually he makes that first baseline
and now it's time to actually start
measuring angles and walking out across
Indian first is going to go this way
things went to go down here he's gonna
finish this and then he's going to start
heading north
now to measure the angles now there he
is again oh by the way you notice have
1i smaller than the other that's because
when he was in Newfoundland he observed
the total eclipse of the Sun through a
telescope but he forgot to put the
smoked lens over his a telescope and he
didn't want to stop in the middle of the
clips to put it on so he kind of fried
his left eye so I mean you get a lot of
scientists like that so anyway so he's
got his baseline now it's time to
measure angles he uses this thing called
a theodolite you've probably seen these
surveyors use them Lewis and Clark had
one very much like this so did uh so did
George Washington you know this is fine
for like laying out your plantation or
figuring out where you should build City
Hall but this is not good enough for a
William Lambton he gets the mother of
all the auto lights this thing has a
disc that's 48 inches across and carved
on it are not just degrees but minutes
of degrees and not just minutes of
degrees but if you look down between the
minutes of degrees there are seconds of
degrees etched on this brat circle there
this thing is hard to tell in this
picture that's actually a microscope
that you use just to look down and read
the disk this thing this thing when it
was in its packing case Wade half a ton
at the time this was the most advanced
scientific instrument in the world it
took two years to get it from England
over there got captured by the French by
the way and the French but the French
realized what it wasn't actually gave it
back to back to the British so so he
sets you know imagine setting this thing
up yeah oh okay you know to just to get
like another measurement at another
point so off he goes with this device
starting to measure these triangles
across India but it's really a pain in
the ass and let me just run down quickly
I'll run through some of the problems
with it well first all there's dust in
the air so you want to try to see as far
ahead as you we can you don't want to do
like 100-yard triangles when you can do
10 mile triangles or 20 or 30 mile
triangles but you know many parts of
India are very dusty and very hazy and
there are things like trees in the way
you know it was like damn I can't see I
can't see that hill over there the free
you know these trees are we prefer got
trees or whole jungles in India
and there are swamps to sew and when
you're things like juggles and swamps
things happen like your poisonous snakes
many people on these expeditions were
killed by poisonous snakes some were
eaten by Tigers a few errs champer
trampled by rogue elephants too so then
there's also like all sorts of disease
here's typhoid and there's malaria and
they're just yours dysentery when
Lampton got all three of these and and
there's also huge extremes in
temperature which you know throw off
your measurements but also or just you
know misery to get through I mean you
know if you were to get in the car in
northern Canada and drive all the way to
the south end of Tierra del Fuego you
know all the way down North America all
the way through Central America all the
way down south america you there in that
strip that's still not as many different
clients climates as you go through going
through India it's just a complete you
know crazily varied place so there's
also to expose your problems and then if
that stuff doesn't kill you the doctors
will because he was a you know he was
subjected to all sorts of horrible you
know treatments who bled and the leeches
on them and you know horrible enemas and
stuff you don't want to hear about so
and he also had all sorts of problems
with with a villages are in the way when
they're filled with villagers and a lot
of villagers are like you're not coming
in my village for this weird apparatus
many people thought that you know and I
get him he's moving through places that
you know you know basically you know the
you know the European has never been to
yet in India and you know they're seeing
this weird apparatus many people have
never seen a telescope before they look
through this thing and this telescope by
the way like most astronomical
telescopes flips things upside down so
that kind of freaks you out and here's
this strange got this strange white skin
guy he's got this device that flips
everything upside down and brings things
really close and he wants to put it up
on the mountain above my village and
look down in my village what you know
obviously he's there just to look at my
women I'm not gonna let him do that so
he had all sorts of trouble with that
and they're all sorts of just physical
problems to light refracts in the
atmosphere it doesn't affect you so much
looking east and west or left and right
but it does up and down and he was also
measuring the height of things that was
a problem parallax was a problem if you
know
if you had two poles sticking straight
up there are parallel for right next to
each other but you move them 50 miles
apart and suddenly they're not both
pointing the same direction anymore you
have to take all that into account in
the math one of the things they
discovered was the gravity lies to you
to say I've and all this stuff is based
on getting that Fiat alike that huge
instrument level perfectly level if you
think about what level means is
perfectly aligned at a very precise
relationship to the pull of gravity say
this bottle is being pulled by gravity
and grand I've got every single hole
lined everything icing level but say
there's a mountain range right here
suddenly gravity is pulling it this way
just a little bit and I mean not this
much you'll never see it we're talking
not not a degree not a minute of degree
we're talking a few seconds of degree
but it was enough to throw off all these
very precise calculations so we're
Lamden actually did the best first
measurements of this and this is a
process that's still going on the USGS
and other organizations around the world
are still measuring variations in
gravity pull around the world this
project went on for 40 years and at a
certain point you know the folks in
Calcutta in London are like dude this is
just really costing us a lot of money so
he always had problems with that which
you know funding meant he had had fewer
staff people really demoralizing people
quit a lot of people eaten by Tigers all
sorts of other issues you know and when
you finally get the data you have to do
the calculations so look at this look at
this figure out the angles in this thing
someone a history of science scholar
figured out that to do the calculations
for the starting point up to where
things finished its 9280 different
variables of angles and distance it was
at that time the most complex
mathematical calculation ever attempted
by mankind so so William lambdin he does
this for about 20 years but he's getting
up there in 60s or so in 1823 he dies
and his lieutenant takes
over we got the second-in-command guy
this guy guy named George Eve rest now
these two could not be more different
lambton very sweet guy arrest huge fiery
temper temper I'm sorry hitting the
wrong button now lambdin kind of liked
the people of India got a lot of them
married a mixed cast woman and then
raised three strapping kids that he also
talked to be surveyors and and
mathematicians and geographers Everest
hated the Indians you know called the
mestizos and a lot worse did not get
along well at all had that whole kind of
British animal white man so therefore
I'm better than any of you in this
entire continent type attitude going
landed very kind to to his staff new
workers Eve rest to the very first
expedition he goes out to he he flogs
three of them just you know not a nice
guy kind of ackerman a whole really but
but a great great great mathematician
and surveyor and he continues this
project a virus dies when they're about
here or I'm sorry lambdin dodging their
about here Eve arrest continues and gets
all the way up to the homologous where
the project the project hits the
homologous and around 1843 or so in 1841
a verse is also older and infirmed and
he retires but there's still a few years
of data crunching it goes on after he
leaves Indian goes back to England and
in the course of that data crunching
they noticed they they they took a lot
of triangular and measurements of the
Himalayan mountains and it had six
different measurements who's got the
laser pointer hit that dark peac all the
way at the top right there they had six
different bearings of that peak that
they called peak 15 they did the math on
it and came up with a figure of 29,000
feet exactly they realized no one would
believe that it was exactly that so they
added two feet it's the only instance in
this entire port of your survey where
they deliberately fudged the data they
said that peak is 29,000 two feet it's
called peak 15 they couldn't find any
local name for it so the guy that took
over after arrest named it for him and
we've kind of changed the pronunciation
of the name
so that's how that is now called Mount
Everest it's named after George Everest
okay that's who I'm running out of time
so I'm gonna I'm gonna zip through a few
more here you guys still with me okay
okay okay we're now we're jumping
forward like another 120 years or so and
we're going to talk about mr. Beck's
Matt happens in 1933 and the star is
this guy not a male model this is Harry
Beck okay now Harry Beck worked for the
London Underground and in 1933 he drew
this the London Underground map this is
the only map of the whole 20th century
that I know of it's transcended
cartography and become just like a
pinnacle of graphic design as well and I
want to talk about what what made this
map so great so before Harry Beck's map
that's what the London Underground map
looked like it's you know it's
geographically accurate but you know
when is a very twisty place and so the
roads are there the lines are staying
around not that easy to read Harry
Beck's great revolutionary idea Atia us
to do a simplification now here we BEC
worked as a graphic designer as I said
at the London aground and the main thing
he drew were electrical circuit diagrams
which meant he spent all day taking
things like this and making it look like
this he takes very complicated real
world things and and and boils them down
to straight line very simplified
schematics take a look at this drawing
this is one of his first sketches for
the London Underground that I mean could
that look any more like a circuit
diagram I mean you can even see like the
solder points on there so he took the
London Underground map and and
simplified it beyond belief when the
London Underground map came out in 1933
it was an amazing huge hit the the
underground would give out maps at the
various stations and they do a printing
every six months or so these maps were
gone in a week people just found them so
clear so easy to use so concise and they
also looked really cool they kind of
look like the future you know 1933
there's a lot of you know future stuff
kind of coming out of streamlining was
happening
and I think I think what cars look like
in the 30s I went from being boxes too
much more swept back this kind of looked
like the future in a way now Harry back
did not rest on his laurels they have
done he did dozens and dozens of
different variations here they are
trying different shapes different angles
this is one not many 45 degrees this is
some of his sketches just playing with
figuring out how to show the
intersection mutations but London
Underground map has been in beta for
over 70 years now so here's what it
looks like right now and a couple of the
things to really notice about this map
is one you don't really know your it's
not the way that says it's London other
than the River Thames here there's not a
single landmark it's not a single Road
it's as if when you're in the
underground you know you're not in
London you're in this other universe and
you know if you've written the lender
ground the underground late at night
well that's not too far from the truth
the other revolutionary thing that he
did had to do with scale now those of us
who make maps are very concerned with
scale and showing scale like you guys
the Google Maps guys you added the scale
on to your map to show that size changes
because it's a Mercator projection
there's no scale anywhere on here and
the scale is is just one lie after
another I for instance the distance
between these two stations might be like
200 yards or so the distance between
those two stations might be five miles
scale is completely changing all
throughout the map and he doesn't care
and the ideas you don't care either what
this does is it does the one thing that
needs to do it tells you where what
lines to take to what stops to get to
where you want to go this has been
adopted now by hundreds well over a
hundred different transit systems
throughout the country here so where's
Philadelphia there's Sydney or Barcelona
there Sydney there's Washington DC
here's right where we are here in San
Jose so so Harry Beck is hack number his
map is hack number five okay two more
quick hacks and then the hour will be up
hack six I call adding features to the
featureless and what I mean this is what
if you want to map something that is if
you think about all mapping is based on
the fact that one part of what you're
thing is different than another part
well there's a stream there there's a
mountain here there's a there's a subway
stop there's something that
distinguishes different places well not
always true what if you're mapping
something completely amorphous what if
you're mapping the sky as people wanted
to do back in the back in the 1940s how
can we put a map in the sky what they
came up with was this really clever
system called vor which stands for very
high frequency omnidirectional radio
ranging and this is a great example of
how advances in mapping are based on
advances in technology we needed the
kind of sophisticated electronics that
came out came out of World War two to be
able to pull this off let me show you
how the system works critical if you
ever look at an aviation chart and
they're really beautiful things just as
works of art I recommend it you'll see
circles like this you know how this
looks kind of like a compass rose with
different bearings with a thing right in
the center and a bunch of stuff that
tells you what frequency to tune your
radio to every one of these circles on
an aviation that corresponds to
something that looks like this it's a
transmission station on the ground
there's one of these rape right near a
nice time to go pal a San Jose Airport
there's one at the north end of the
runway you'll see it looks just like
that what each of these devices do and
as I said there are hundreds of them
scattered all across the country they
each of these things sends out a signal
actually it doesn't send out one signal
it sends out 360 signals one for every
degree of the compass and each one of
these signals are electronically tagged
so it says I'm coming from you know this
station you know station number 218 and
I'm coming on an angle of 90 degrees so
you throw that thing up and you can now
pick that up the electronics in your
aircraft can pick that up but the really
great thing happens when you start
putting up more than one because they
start crossing they start intersecting
so all of these vor transmitters are
sending out these signals in effect what
they've done is they've painted a huge
highway system up in the sky a huge
system of inter crossing streets of
highways of kind of like interstates up
in the sky so when you fly from place to
place and your say you know you're going
from here to the east coast and
somewhere over nebraska for no reason
that you know
can tell the plane suddenly just kind of
turns a little bit and keeps going
probably what's happened is you just
changed highways in the sky so okay
that's that's hack number six the vor
system here's the seventh and final hack
I call this one the master navigators
this started at at least 3,000 years ago
or five thousand years ago and it's
still going on to this very day and when
am I talking out about to finish up it's
some of the techniques used in
Polynesian navigation when I say
polynesia basically we're kind of
loosely talking about this triangle it's
Hawaii up at the top that's New Zealand
down at the lower left and that's Easter
Island over over here on on the right
it's just to give you a sense of how
vast an area we're talking about that's
how big an area is that that triangle is
you know on land basically it's the size
of North America it's a huge bit of land
logging off land it's a huge bit of
water for every acre of land in this
triangle there are 500 acres of water
you know how in the world can you get
around in there reliably safely well
upon the Polynesian people like
indigenous people all over the world how
do you have a huge storehouse of
knowledge of their environment and I
just took a few of the things that I'm
not going to talk about they they could
read and then Ken I can't stress this
enough there are still people out there
in Hawaii in you know fiji all
throughout the the polynesian area that
still no these these these techniques
and are working to keep them alive but
i'm not gonna talk about how you can
recurrence or waves or read clouds and
other types of weather i'm not going to
talk about how you can tell what island
is nearby based on what birds have flown
over your ship things like that i'm
going to talk about some of the methods
that Polynesians used having to do with
the heavens here's a picture of the
night sky this is about what it would be
like in dusk right here in San Jose ah
about 15 minutes from now it's going to
look it's going to look like this you
and I think you're seeing these stars
are setting below the
rising now you'll notice you know these
stars are getting close like that one's
actually touching the horizon remember
the horizon is something you have in
abundance when you're out in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean you know its nice
flat view all the way around these stars
a given star will call this one Fred you
know this star will set at the same
position everywhere on Earth it now it
may not set at the same time a day but
it will always this star is always going
to go below the horizon just a bit south
of West so if you can memorize the
setting and rising positions of stars
you in effect have a compass with you
all the time the Polynesians did not
have the compass by the way there's no
basically no iron in in in the
Polynesian area to have discovered the
compass with but doesn't matter they got
the stars and the start you know it's
just like using Jupiter as a as a clock
you know you can't lose the stars
they're always what they're always
reliable so Polynesian navigators
memorized the rising and setting
positions of hundreds of naked eye stars
this is a just one chart that I got from
this really cool place called the Bishop
Museum in Honolulu where they have a lot
of exhibits on this stuff ok so you
memorize different stars and you have to
memorize a lot because they don't
difference are set and rise at different
times and a different you know
throughout the year so just using that
you've got a compass wherever you are in
that huge Polynesian expand but what if
you want to figure out how far north and
south you are well we already know that
you can do things like look at look at
the North Star Polaris except most of
Polynesia is in the southern hemisphere
they've never even seen polaris but the
but the same principle applies the
Southern Cross rising in the south and
and so on but to get a more precise
measurement of latitude Polynesian
navigators could use pairs of stars like
for instance notice these two stars here
they're about to set in the western
horizon and there are approximately the
same level let's now go 50 miles north
and look at those same two stars and you
can see they've shifted let's go to
another 50 miles north and they're
canted even more and now you could it
looks like these two or
much level so a change of a hundred
miles you've changed the relationship
among these stars let's go even a bit
further and now this star kind of lines
up halfway between these two so that is
an extremely reliable way to figure out
how far north and south you are so what
would this mean in practical
applications let's say you were sailing
to Hawaii you've left I know being of
you've left New Zealand and you're
heading to Hawaii you know Hawaii is
somewhere to the west of you but you
don't know where I'm gonna use these
same star charts and show you where you
would be heading to Hawaii that first
that first relationship between the
those stars that I pointed out it means
you're on this line you're somewhere
south of Hawaii the next 150 miles north
you're exactly aiming if you if you turn
just turn west you're going to hit right
in the middle of the Big Island of
Hawaii go another 50 miles north and
you're going to pass to the north of the
Big Island go another 50 miles north and
you're like dead center to hit la Kiki
beach in Oahu where the surfing even
then was great and go another 50 miles
north and you're going to pass to the
north side of the entire Hawaiian island
chain so by memorizing these stars these
relationships they had the tools to
accurately figure out what the way they
were going and what latitude there at
throughout this huge vast expanse of
ocean and the thing that really just
blows me away about this is if you think
about what is mapping if mapping is the
act of taking the physical world and
turning it into this two-dimensional
representation then this act of taking
the physical world of a huge part of the
earth the whole Pacific Ocean basically
and projecting that physical reality up
into this arbitrary arrangement of dots
in the sky that is constantly shifting
with time with location and with the
season taking making that leap of
intellect I think it's one of the great
intellectual achievements in all of
humanity and that's my seventh and final
hack so thank you very much I I just
want say I blog about this stuff my
websites virtual world com if you want
to read more about this stuff I put up a
kind of a quick and dirty page called /
geo hacks where you can
pick up some are you can you can get
pointers some books about this type of
thing and I welcome your emails and
questions I welcome your questions right
now and I really thank you for taking
that an hour to listen to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
