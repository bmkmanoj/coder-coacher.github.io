mining at Google today I'm going to get
through the first part of chapter two in
textbook the first thing I'll mention to
you is that there is a homework that I
gave the students they're taking it for
credits and if some of you are
interested in doing that homework what I
can do is I can email the solutions to
you I actually have the solutions ready
it's linked from the web page I'll go
online and show you where that link is
right now and like I said if you want to
go through and do some of those
exercises it's meant to cover chapters 1
&amp;amp; 2 so you can go ahead and do those let
me take a peek at the web page and I can
show you what's up there it's one
problem from the textbook and then four
problems that I wrote down it shouldn't
be sort of you know pushing the limits
of anything too much but should give you
some review of things that we're
covering in a lecture so let me navigate
there right now and just quickly show
you that okay so you want me to talk in
the mic okay so if you look here on the
web page we have homework right there
chapters 1 1 2 homework is due Tuesday
that's a week from Tuesday if you look
at the homework assignments the first
thing is just to read chapters 1 &amp;amp; 2 now
chapter 2 you don't really want to read
section 2.4 that's measures of how you
measure distances between attributes
there's a lot of material there we'll
get to it when we talk about clustering
so just the first three sections of
chapter 2 and then all of chapter 1 1 &amp;amp;
2 that we talked about last time I just
mentioned to think of some different
examples then textbook problem number 2
from chapter 2 on page 89 then the last
two questions I give you some some sort
of toy datasets and ask you to do some
exercises with those to get you familiar
with using Microsoft Excel and R so you
can take a look at those and if I forget
to remind me to send around the
solutions for those so if you want to
practice doing some problems okay so
that's the homework assignment we're
going to get into chapter 2 today the
title of chapter 2 is generically called
data so the first question is you know
what is data well we're usually going to
try and force data into looking
something like this matrix that you see
up here and we give different names to
the rows and columns and we we associate
different things so generally the you
know I'm going to so if you can't hear
me let me know I'm going to talk as loud
as I can while still writing on the
whiteboard and hopefully you can hear me
okay so the think of the data is being a
matrix like this so the rows okay
the rows we call the rows some people
call them objects okay
some people call them that might be
because this mic isn't on so okay so the
rows are going to be called objects what
else do we call the rows so they call
them objects up here that's what your
text books like to use I like to call
them observations okay and that's
probably more common in stats
observations other names that are giving
to them record point case sample entity
instance and then observation so in this
in this toy datas that they have up here
the rows are probably people right and
you see then the person either got a
refund on their taxes or they didn't
they're a single married divorced they
have their taxable income listed there
and then whether or not they cheat it
now each one of the columns okay so the
columns your book tends to call those
the attributes I tend to call them
variables other people will call them
fields characteristics features
sometimes people will call them
predictors but generally designate one
of them as being the response in general
those are the columns and then a
collection of attributes describes an
object so I think I've covered
everything on this slide now this is
just a toy data set and you can think
about how might you use such a data set
again you might use this to sort of use
these as example data and then try and
generalize a rule to predict how likely
someone is to cheat on their taxes so
when they say you know these are the
things that raise a red flag for the IRS
that
that they have some sort of a predictive
model so that they think based on your
attributes you're likely to cheat on
your taxes and so they're going to try
and audit you so this is sort of a toy
example that you can think about what
the real data would look like I want to
sort of move away from the toy example
and show you a real data set so the
first real data set we're going to look
at is right here on the web stats 202
comm slash stats 202 log text and this
data set is basically the web logs from
the stats - OH - dot-com domain and a
couple other domains that I have
registered and it's from one day in
particular and I think it happens to be
the day where I made some announcement
about the class so there's a lot of data
there so it's from actually June 19th
and you see the earliest date here is
like 31 minutes after midnight and then
it goes all the way to the end of the
day three minutes before midnight okay
so a full day's worth of web logs and
I'm just simply going to you know save
this somewhere on my machine and I'll
talk about how we can open it using our
and you can using Excel assuming you're
using a Windows environment I think
someone sent around the email the other
day about how to do this on the Linux
environment so there I have the file
sitting there on my desktop what do I
say to do now so I say right-click on it
and say open with and then say Microsoft
Excel so I'm going to go ahead and do
that of course you could open the Excel
application first and then try and open
it from there but let me just
right-click and say open with Microsoft
Excel now when you do that those of you
who are familiar with Excel will realize
something has gone terribly wrong what
happened here is is all the data is in
the first column right so the first
column has all this data the second
column has no doubt even though it looks
like the data is going all the way
across that little app acts you see up
there at the top of the screen that is
actually what's showing you what's in
the first first column first row so the
first column first row has all this if I
mouse over to the second column first
row you see that there's nothing right
this is just all carryover from the
first column so what I really want to do
is make sure I get these things in the
right columns right I want to have each
attribute being its own column so just
to sort of get caught up with the slides
here I said right-click welcome with
choose program then choose Excel and I
say oops everything is in the first
column so what is the solution here well
the solution is you know we need to get
the column separated in the right way so
the solution is click on the first
column and then there's this thing
called data and text to columns that's
going to do the trick for us so how do I
do that I go here click on the first
column which is where everything is I go
to data and I say text to columns ok
first thing it's going to ask me is it
delimited or is it fixed with now I
think those are self-explanatory and it
sort of tells you what they are right
here this turns out I can treat it as
delimited and then I'm going to click
Next
hmm and it's not tab delimited it's
actually I can use this one as space
delimited okay and then this text
qualifier we'll talk about in a little
bit but you see once I do space
delimited it sort of draws these
previews and at least the first few rows
look like it separated them correctly
into columns and you can scroll down and
look at some more examples but assuming
the file is made consistently it should
be ok so I click Next then I get to sort
of change mess the types of these
they're all defaulting to general and
I'll talk about types two types of
attributes in Excel later but I'll just
leave them all as general and I'll say
finish and now you see the data looks
nice right the first column looks like
it's some sort of IP address these
columns seem to be missing most of the
time this is the date this is a little
extension there and then you have some
other information these two are numeric
this is the the URL so these people are
going to my home page these people are
going to stats 202 comm then it looks
like this might be I think the referrer
and then this probably a lot of you know
more about this and this is what type of
browser they're using ok so I have data
from the weblog and I've wrote it into
Excel and I think that catches us up
here let's see I so click on the first
column say data text to columns
I choose delimited and I tell it that
the space is the thing separating the
column so this is a space delimited file
basically wherever I see a space I know
to split the column on that now one
question that comes up when you do this
is sort of you know why did this work
right because what's curious is that
some of the columns that I've created
themselves have spaces in them right
like if I mouse over to right here the
browser type clearly there's the space
between
well between Windows and NT right
there's a space there between Windows
and NT so why did it not split that one
as a column now I think many of you know
the answer to it the answer is that it
is right right there are quotes around
it so you don't see right you don't see
any quotes here in the file right
there's no quotes there however if you
actually go back and you look at the
actual file itself you can see of course
that whoever makes these web logs it's
hard enough
oops you oh I have it open already right
that's what it's complaining about okay
let's look at it here you look in the
file itself and you see right these
quotes around a lot of these attributes
so in particular this one I'm talking
about the browser Mozilla 4.0 space
right there's quotes around that so it
knows that whenever you see a space if
it's within quotes not to break the
column there okay and so that's the
answer to my question why this work it's
escaped using quotes right so whatever
you see quotes if there's a space in
between the quotes you don't break the
column there now of course that raises
the question what if you want to have
quotes in one of your columns so then
what do you do you escape the scape
cracker right so this sort of you know
can get a little bit tricky and you know
sometimes you wind up having four or
five quotes just to do certain things
but many of you are familiar with this
if you worked with data especially here
where we work with a lot of them you
know types of URLs and things or not
URLs but other things they can have
spaces in them if you read the the wiki
article on de limiters you can you can
learn a little bit more about this but
I'm embarrassed to admit how late in
life I learned this but you know a lot
of you have already worked with real
data so you're probably used to doing
that and as we opened it with Excel you
saw that it did say that the the quotes
had a special function and that's
exactly what and that's a very common
convention to have some sort of
character like a space or a comma or a
tab that separates the columns but to
escape it using quotes that's a very
common behavior so that's sort of how we
read data into Excel any questions about
anything I went over with that okay so
that may be familiar mm-hmm familiar to
many of you so we have our data set in
Excel next thing how do we read the same
data into our M excuse me well we've
already downloaded it so I don't need to
do that
the first thing I usually like to do is
do this set W D command that saves me
from having to specify the full path
every time and literally what that means
is I'm setting my working directory so
let me um first open our excuse me
hopefully many of you saw the thread
that went around about the all our
installation on your machines so I've
opened R here on my Windows machine and
I'm simply going to set my working
directory to be my desktop which is
where I save that file and so I do that
now anything that I save anything that I
load I don't need to specify the full
path is just going to assume that's here
in this directory and you can specify
any directory you want there the only
thing that makes it tricky is if you
move things around later you might have
to change that command if you have it
hard-coded into your script okay so that
sets it there then let me um let me
close this version of it so it doesn't
complain to me again okay so now I'm
going to read it in now the command I'm
going to use to read it in is the read
dot CSV command and I'll say a little
bit about the syntax maybe I'll just say
this okay so what did I do I said I said
read CSV that's the command to read it
in a CSV file then I quoted the name of
the file which was status to to log text
the next argument was the separator by
default CSV defaults to comma separators
so I told it that the separator should
be a space header equals false meaning
that the first row of the data set does
not give me column names right sometimes
the first rotor data set just gives you
names of the columns this time it
doesn't i say head or equal false
because i think the default is true if
you want to know more about any one of
these commands like set WD or read CSV
and R it has very good help the Windows
version if you type question mark and
something like read CSV which is the
command you just used it'll give you
sort of well read table read dot CSV
these are all similar things and it
tells you about the different arguments
and you can see here that in fact read
CSV does default header to true and so
if I hadn't changed that to false as I
did what would have happened it would
have basically not given me the first
row would have used the first row as the
header columns which wouldn't make much
sense and you see of course the
separator defaults to comma so it's a
good thing I changed
to quote so the help is very useful for
these commands but you sort of have to
know what the command you want is first
because sometimes it's hard to know so
read dot CSV reads the data in for me
now let me tell you one other thing I
did up here right yeah
oh let's see yeah so what you would type
would be yeah sorry what you would type
would be exactly what I have on the
slide and so between the comma and the
separator you're right that plus is just
a continuation that it was pulled on to
the next line okay was that that's what
you're asking about okay okay yeah so
this is literally what I type now the
other thing I want to say about what I
typed here and I'm sorry this also this
is the prompt sign so I'm not typing
that I do type though the data with the
less than and the - and what does that
mean that's an assignment in our right
so had I just typed read CSV it would
have just output to the screen right it
would have just showed me everything in
the file all at once
if I just typed read CSV without that
assignment it just spits it all out at
me so when I do that it's basically
assigning the object called data and I
didn't have to initialize it or anything
I just call it data you could call us
whatever you want and I assign this data
set to the object called data okay so
now our has in its memory an object
called data that is assigned this data
set okay so that's generally how we read
the data into our I mean there's other
variations of this you know if you don't
want to use up the memory or if you want
to specify the path directly and not
have to have two copies of it floating
around you can do that but that's
generally what we'll do to read the data
and any other questions on that okay so
now let me go to the next slide I say
let's look at the first five rows of
this data okay so our is not a
spreadsheet application like Excel but
we can view the data and here I typed
notice I type data 1 colon 5 comma okay
let me explain what that means and what
it does so basically if I want to see
the first 5 rows I would say something
like data 1 colon 5 comma with this
argument like
okay basically it thinks of the data as
like a matrix right so you're telling it
which rows you want and which columns
you want so if I want the first five
rows I say the rows are one through five
if I want all the columns I just leave
that argument blank right okay so those
are the rows and those are the columns
and in are something like 1 colon 5 is
just just means literally 1 through 5
right so I'm telling it rows 1 through 5
columns everything ok so if I do that I
want to see data 1 colon 5 the first
five rows and all the columns that's
exactly what I get okay and you have to
scroll here a little bit to see that you
know now notice it's given the column
names it's given these it's it's made up
these attribute names right the first
attribute is V 1 V 2 V 3 then V 4 and
then I see the row number is 1 through 5
right there
and so it looks like it's done a good
job of reading it in and I can look at
the first five columns and make sure
that those are sorry the first five rows
and make sure all the columns look like
they're reading in the right thing ok so
that takes care of what I have on this
slide then the next slide I say suppose
I want to look at the first column well
for that one you can imagine you would
just type data and give me all the rows
so I leave that blank but give me just
the first column right so that's going
to give me the first column okay now the
first column looks like some sort of an
IP address right so we can confirm that
if I say data oops
data comma one just the first column it
spits out all these IP addresses at me
and notice it's giving me still the row
numbers so 19:21 so then the last one
must be 1922 which confirms that there's
nineteen hundred and twenty two rows in
the data set now it also says something
different which is going to come up a
little bit later
it says seventy-three levels and it kind
of lists them it lists this one this one
this one dot dot dot and then the last
one okay well I say the last one okay so
these are seventy-three unique values of
the IP address in the first column now
it's sort of interesting that it's doing
that because it knows that this variable
is not something that's numeric that it
has distinct categories and we'll talk
about that a second question
one everything is one index dinar okay
the only thing though you can still get
yourself a little bit confused in both R
and Excel because if you especially in
Excel if you have a header row then
everything kind of becomes too indexed
right because your first row is always
your header sometimes so you have to be
a little bit careful with that but in
general R is always one indexed and so
is Excel but be careful with the header
row okay so we have the first column
there in R and I think yeah that's all I
wanted to say about about reading the
data and we'll play more with this data
set a little bit later on and we can see
what's going on in the stats 202 comm
web blogs but that should give you sort
of pretty much the information you need
to sort of read a data set into Excel or
eated acid into R now of course there's
data sets a more complicated structure
that we're not talking about but
assuming you can sort of force the data
into looking like this matrix with the
different rows and the different columns
then this will do the trick for you and
obviously that's kind of what are in
Excel are hoping for especially Excel
being a spreadsheet application is sort
of hoping that it can look like a nice
matrix okay any questions about a
reading data into R or Excel yeah
No yes pacify a difficulty yes and
exactly so the header equal false versus
the herd equal true suppose your data
set the first row had column names then
you would say header equal true or use
the default and whatever it sees in the
first row it's going to use for the
column names now of course there has to
be as many entries there as it has to be
in the other rows but it will use that
as the column names and by default you
would get a bad behavior if you if you
let header B be true and the first row
is really an object then that object
becomes the column names which is not
what you want okay other question say
ohm 1 3 right so he wants to see just
columns 1 &amp;amp; 3 so in our there's this and
I'll talk about this later there's sort
of this C thing which sort of creates a
vector right so C 1 comma 3 is the
vector 1 comma 3 so if I said data and I
wanted all the rows but I wanted columns
1 &amp;amp; 3 that would be the syntax that we
give it to me ok so here let me just do
the first 5 rows but columns 1 &amp;amp; 3 there
you go you got V 1 and V 3 out okay so
again you just index into it like that
but yeah you have to combine the 1 and 3
with this little C operator and I'll
talk more about that C operator next
time any other questions about reading
data into our in excel okay so the next
thing I want to talk about if we're
going to be working with this real data
we have to know what kind of data we're
getting and it's very interesting that
the textbook doesn't talk about this
right and I think this is sort of you
know one of the criticisms about data
mining is that the I don't want to say
ignore this issue but it sort of becomes
a non-issue so what am I talking about
there's this big distinction between
experimental data and observational data
and you notice that I say up here
I say most all data used in data mining
is observational data so be careful
right so observational data is data they
can often get you in trouble okay and so
what's the difference between these well
I put sort of some definitions up here
but I think most of you should sort of
get this just from thinking about you
know the difference between collecting
data and experiment versus the
between collecting data observational
right so experimental data basically you
exercise careful control right
so think about experiments that you do
here you say well I'm going to randomize
whether or not this person is in the
control or the treatment I'm going to be
very careful about any anything and just
be very careful right you have very
careful control over the data whereas
observational data you really don't know
too much about the data observational
data you really don't know too much
about the data and you really don't know
what's causing someone to be in one
group or the other so there's basically
no or we could say little control over
the attributes okay now why is this
important well I'll make it obvious
through some examples but the whole
point is that the data is going to look
the same either way right regardless of
how the data is collected it could look
the same to you but whether or not it
came from an experimental setting or an
observational setting will influence
sort of what conclusions you can draw
from it in particular you have to be
very careful what conclusions you draw
from observational data however in data
mining it just has this observational
feel to it if you think about the types
of data we were talking about last time
it was just sort of data that happened
to be sitting around anyway and so we
were going to look at it and see what
kind of information we got from it it
wasn't data that we said I'm going to do
an experiment to collect this data it
was data that happened to be sitting in
a database and I was going to see if I
can find any information in it so how
can this get you in trouble well I have
a couple examples up here just to
mention how it can get you in trouble
and then I think it would be pretty
clear right so the first one is the diet
coke versus the weight right so what's
going on in this data well in this data
my observations
okay our people right so I have people
you know person 1 person 2 person three
person four right these are my objects
these are my observations these are
people right and then I'm going to have
two attributes or two columns or two
variables right the first one might be
like how much Diet Coke they drink let's
express it as like a ratio or a fraction
of all coke consumption right so this
person like you know when he drinks coke
ninety percent of time its diet right
and this person when he drinks coke you
know only five percent of the time
diet okay so let's do it like that and
so let's assume all these people are
people that least drink some coke right
and so you know this guy is the guy who
seeks it out and this guy he only drinks
it you know when when they're out of the
regular coke he hates the taste but if
he's thirsty he'll drink it okay and
then we record their weight right okay
so this person you know he's he's kind
of a big guy he weighs 200 pounds and
this guy you know he's pretty skinny he
only weighs like 145 right and and so on
and you get lots of observations like
this okay so now my point is that you
can collect this data in a lot of
different ways but it will still look
like this okay so what are the two
different ways you could collect it well
one is observational II right you just
go out and you get people and you say
hey how much time do you drink diet coke
versus regular coke hey how much do you
weigh you just collect the data
okay that's observational data another
way you could collect it would be the
following okay you get a whole bunch of
people and then you randomly tell them
look you are going to drink 90% diet
coke you're going to drink 5% you assign
them right in fact you could just split
it up and say you know 10% of the people
are going to drink 10% diet coke 10%
people going to be 20% diet coke
Thomerson getting 30% diet coke etc you
control it right that would be the
experimental setting okay
so the same type of data can be
collected in two different ways now why
does this matter well let's think about
what you might look at with this data
right you have two variables so we might
plot them against each other right so on
the bottom we put here diet coke
consumption and on the top or on the
y-axis here we put their weight okay now
let me ask you the following question
okay so if I were collect if I were to
collect the data observational II right
simply asking people how much Diet Coke
do you normally drink and how much do
you weigh do you expect one or two to
you expect the more Diet Coke they drink
the less they weigh okay or or the
reverse or the reverse so so so right
right so it could go either way right
and so you expect maybe you would see
this someone so maybe can sees but
there's also an argument for the other
way let's talk about the argument for
the other way right
I see this one okay now suppose I see
this one first of all let's talk about
what would be the wrong conclusion from
this data the wrong conclusion right is
to say that like Diet Coke is making you
fat right they're putting some
ingredient in there that just makes you
fat and just makes you you know I have
to buy more diet coke right okay somehow
this is a bad thing to drink you should
lose weight by drinking regular coke
right because as you drink more regular
coke you break it okay so that's of
course the wrong conclusion but how can
this happen well look if I'm a skinny
guy what why am I wasting my time
drinking diet coke right I'll just drink
regular coke I don't care if I gain
weight I might actually look you know
better if I gain weight but but if I'm
if I'm trying to lose weight so you get
the point right so the point is if this
is observational data this is quite
possible but the problem is then you
can't infer any causation right from the
observational data you cannot infer the
causation you don't know that drinking
more Diet Coke causes people to weigh
more and in fact in this example it
doesn't so the observational data would
look just like the experimental data
except I can't and for any causation
from it because I didn't really do the
experiment okay so you have to be very
careful the data is going to look the
same but how is it collected as
important the data doesn't tell you how
it's collected the data is just sitting
there in a database you have to know how
it's collected and you have to be very
careful with this distinction and they
don't really address it all in the book
let me give you the one other example
which is sort of timely and I think it's
sort of cute so this is yeah quick
comment
it's a way to you grow right right so
the thing is you may be able to measure
other things that will be more
insightful so I'm not saying you can't
conclude anything I mean that though you
would wind up with a statement where you
would say increased coke consumption is
associated with higher weight right
associated with as opposed to causation
and that could be quite useful to you
right if you have a game where you're
trying to predict how much someone
weighs and all you get to know is how
much coke they drink it could be quite
useful to you right you know if that's
it's a really a prediction problem when
you're just trying to predict their
weight and you just get to find out you
know how much coke they drink right it
could be quite useful but you just have
to be very careful about the causation
so okay and then you like you say you
could measure other things which might
clue you in to the causation but with
just the two attributes it's a very
murky picture okay so this one the
carbon dioxide and the Earth's
atmosphere
sorry carbon dioxide in the Earth's
atmosphere versus temperature so so this
is the picture right you say like look
every year I'm going to plot how do I do
this one I'm going to plot how much co2
is in the atmosphere and I'm going to
plot the temperature okay and what do I
see well in 1920 we had you know low co2
and low temperature 1940 it was a little
bit higher etc you know now we're in the
year 2000 we have a lot of co2 and the
earth has really started to warm up
right so you see this picture right it's
going up okay so you know some people
will say this is proof right you guys
are causing global warming with your
cars and your SUVs and your computer
usage you guys are all causing global
warming right because don't you see that
the higher the co2 is the higher you
have caused the earth temperature to be
okay now some people will use the exact
same data and say the follower what's
really going on is the earth's
temperature has been increasing
it increases sometimes decreases
sometimes we used to have an ice age
Greenland was called Greenland because
it used to be green and then you know it
got cold and froze and all these things
they'll talk about temperature just
changes and lately it's been going up
and if you know anything about gases
when this gas when these gases that make
up the Earth's temperature are hotter
they can hold more co2 so they
we'll make that argument they will say
of course these things are associated
because increased temperature causes
more co2 to be absorbed in the
atmosphere now who's right who's wrong
the point is the data doesn't tell you
that it's not experimental data right
you haven't you know you haven't
artificially changed the Earth's
temperature to see if it would go up
you haven't artificially increased the
co2 to see would go up now there's other
data that could answer that right
if you see one lagging the other there's
other data but the point is just looking
at the two attributes observational II
is not proof enough you know you still
you haven't replaced the scientist with
your data right you still either need to
do the experiment when you need to have
some understanding of which variables
are really causing the variables the
data alone does not tell you the whole
story okay so these are my two examples
to sort of warn you about the difference
between experimental observational data
and to just know that when you get data
and data mining it's most often
observational so you have to be very
careful about the conclusions you draw
especially especially with regard to
causation okay any questions on that
question so a relation is no causation
exactly that's why that's it
that's a basic bottom line is there it
this seems to be vaguely related to
possible sounding biases not the two
examples you gave of the journal said I
stop people and ask questions and half
of them just walk away thinking of
bothered right away and up something
those were interested in off link what
I'm asked exactly exactly now so the
more carefully you do sampling the more
it can look like an experiment and the
line can be a little bit blurry so I can
get really good observational data that
is almost good enough as experiment so
that's the point right and then your
first point about correlation is not
causation you're right that's the stats
101 and I'm just sort of telling you the
story it's curious though that they left
it out of the book because I think a
book on data mining anyone you know has
to say be careful about that because if
nothing data mining is looking at
observational data okay any other
comments questions on that okay so the
next thing to talk about with attributes
is whether it's qualitative versus
quantitative this you've probably heard
this before it's the distinction between
categorical and numerical which other
words I prefer the textbook uses
qualitative and quantitative so this is
sort of you know not that deep and you
probably understand it
from saying what the words are right
categorical what your book calls
qualitative right or categorical
basically these are categories not
numbers okay let me just call this
categories so you would not add or
subtract these things right if I say
like this is my home phone and this is
my office phone okay
they're both numbers and you say oh
there's a 50% chance he's at home
there's a 50% chance he's in his office
let me average the two and call that
number right there's no point right
those numbers have no meaning right so
an example here would be phone number
even though it looks like a number it's
not really a number right something else
would be you know zip code right I don't
usually say oh the difference between
these two zip codes is something so you
know what does that mean to me means
nothing the numbers are pretty
meaningless right I color a letter grade
those are obvious they don't even look
like numbers but something like IP
address or zip code or phone number
those look sort of like numbers and you
might be tempted now you say well that
sounds really stupid right no one's
going to average two phone numbers but
you have to be careful right the
software you're using is going to be a
black box algorithm and it's going to
see a number and it might start treating
it as such right if you give it a zip
code or you give it a phone number
without the dash in it or you give it an
IP address without the little decimals
in it it might treat it as numeric and
that's the wrong thing to do so as data
becomes electronic you know even
something like eye color right you have
eye color and you code it you know Brown
is one blue is two you know green is
three your software might assume that's
actually a number and it's not so you
have to be careful about that
distinction and then of course the other
one which is what your book calls
quantitative that's simply you know
numeric right so these are things that
are numbers and can be treated as such
your weight failures per hour number of
TV is the temperature okay these things
can be you know you can subtract these
numbers you can add these numbers their
numbers and should be treated as such
but you have to be careful about that
distinction in the textbook talks about
on page 26 any questions on that
distinction question
to the company where that the male like
a million things and when they imported
data this is a code filled got treated
as a number so the entire East Coast
whose zip code is prefixed with a zero
zero is drawl
okay so something like fifteen percent
of all the mail bounced get back okay so
so yeah if anyone didn't hear that so
the story is someone treated as a zip
code as a number and so they dropped the
trailing or the the preceding zero and
and yeah that's it's a problem and Excel
will do that to you I've had ID numbers
in Excel where it wants to chop off the
first few zeros and I have to tell it
look this isn't a number don't treat it
as a number okay and you can imagine
doing like a regression model right the
zip code shouldn't be in the regression
model as a continuous predictor right
you're not trying to extrapolate between
two zip codes right so you have to be
careful okay any other comments on
qualitative versus quantitative okay
again this is sort of stats 101 stuff as
you say but as you're using software you
have to be careful about this your book
also splits up the qualitative or the
categorical into nominal versus ordinal
and the quantitative into interval which
is ratio now this distinction becomes a
little murkier okay in fact this is
somewhat controversial but you know
we'll talk about sort of the textbook
formulation of it and talk about why the
differences are important so let me just
say the qualitative qualitative splits
into nominal versus ordinal ordinal
right okay so what's going on here so
nominal there's no order and ordinal
there is order so let me call it a
meaningful order right because you can
impose sort of some arbitrary orders so
let's call this a meaningful order okay
so the question is like is order is or
not let me I have examples on the next
slide so let me just mention a couple of
them so nominal things with no order ID
numbers right if there's no information
in the order of them then it's nominal
right if the fact that someone's ID
number is bigger than your ID number
means nothing to you
then it becomes nominal right I color
you know blue brown green you could
order them in the order of the color
spectrum but that probably doesn't mean
anything
zip code you know it doesn't mean
anything so you said the lower
lower numbers are on the East Coast well
if it means something to you okay maybe
it's ordinal but in most cases something
like zip code the order of the number
would have have no meaning to you does
it basically you could do sort of a
permutation okay an isomorphism where
you permute all the numbers and you
haven't lost any information if that's
true it's nominal okay things like
ordinal would be like okay your height
tall medium short right medium is closer
to short than tallest okay great ABCD F
right a is closer to be than a tha's
right taste of potato chips on a scale
from one to ten if you ask people to
rate webpages on some scale for instance
so that could be that could be ordinal
data right so basically they're
categories but they have order okay so I
think that distinction is pretty clear
now you say there's some things in the
middle right maybe I am using the number
of the zip code to tell me whether
they're east coast or west coast in that
case that one might leak down here but
most of the time you're using zip code
if someone changed all the numbers on
you you really wouldn't care because all
you're really using is them to
differentiate distinct areas of the
country okay so any question on the
distinction between ordinal and nominal
okay now most software packages don't
really you know handling ordinal is a
little bit tricky there's really nothing
well we'll talk about it later on but
it's not a hard distinction in software
packages the other distinction here for
quantitative attributes we split them
into interval and ratio now this one is
probably even trickier and a little bit
more murky but let me talk about it so
if something is a quantitative or
numeric quantitative or numeric it can
be either what we call interval or it
can be ratio okay so what's going on
interval they say there's no what they
say true zero right there might be a
zero but there's no true zero versus
ratio there is a true zero there is a
true zero and you can division you can
do division division make sense
whereas on the other side you cannot do
division no division doesn't make sense
okay this is sort of if someone says you
know there's a 10% increase in
temperature okay does that really make
sense okay so let me give you some
examples here um
so things that are interval right so
most things are raesha
most of the time division makes sense
but there's a few sort of special cases
that we should consider is interval one
thing would be temperature okay let me
give you this argument right suppose
that it's 80 degrees this afternoon and
last night it was 40 degrees okay and
I'm sort of impressed by that so I call
home and I tell my parents do you know
in California it's twice as hot in the
afternoon as it is during the night it
doesn't really make sense right because
what if my parents live in Canada then
they'll look up that then they'll say
you know no it wasn't right because
they're measuring in Celsius I'm
measuring in Fahrenheit and those two
scales have different zero points so
then you say okay well where should the
real zero point be well probably not in
either place right it probably should be
absolute zero but no one measures you
know an absolute zero right so so in
those cases there's no real true zero so
temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit
are called interval you can take
differences you can do a subtraction
addition but you can't really do ratios
you can't really divide calendar dates
right you know should I start at 1970
should I start according to you know my
religion something like that you don't
really agree where you start so
differences makes sense but ratios
really don't GRE score right if I have a
600 on my GRU knee over 300 doesn't mean
I'm twice as good as you because where
does the GRE start at like 200 or
something 250 I don't remember what it
is but it doesn't start at zero so
there's no true zero so the point is
division doesn't make sense ratios don't
make sense you shouldn't say there was a
10% increase in temperature if you're
measuring on Celsius or Fahrenheit okay
most things though something like the
Kelvin scale that starts at Absolute
Zero is okay something is twice as long
that makes sense something took twice as
long that makes sense I have twice as
many of something that makes sense okay
so most the time division is okay but
there's a few cases where you shouldn't
divide and those are called interval
okay
any questions about that if I'm able to
pursue
hmm then I can't read anything yes is
very is very tricky right I mean they
question about even like calendar dates
right you could say like well it's twice
as long after 1970 as you know so if the
the question with that one really is
like how how does the zero really make
sense is it really important and if you
are referencing with regard to that zero
then it's okay right so if you're saying
this date is twice as long after 1970 as
this date then the ratio makes sense but
if 1970 has nothing to do with anything
then you have to be careful because
someone else could say I'm gonna fix my
zero at nineteen fifty and you're you're
you know 20% increases now my 5% agree
with the temperature right
you know the Canadian is going to argue
with the guy from the US and say no the
temperature swing was only ten percent
not thirty percent right so you it has
to be like a zero that everyone can
agree on right something like length
right my foot is twice as long as you we
agree where zero zero is sort of like
where you know you have no foot right
and then it starts gets longer than that
right like like I took twice as long as
you right you can actually see the
number two right you would have to do it
I'd have to you'd have to do it two
times two equal one of my time right we
agree on zero there's no question things
like this is murkier we don't agree on
zero and again the line isn't that that
hard and fast but you have to be careful
you know when someone says you know this
metric increased ten percent do we
really is the zero really meaningful if
we can agree that it is it is but if not
someone could fudge the data and just
move the zero and say oh I made it
increased 50 percent because they
redefine their zero okay but it's like
sort of a murky distinction any
questions on on this one more welcome
you'll take a ratio variable and make a
difference of it mm-hm
but it depends on whether you're talking
about the ratio value as it or the
reciprocal of it the difference can mean
right right go in different ways is
there any kind of after picking the
right reciprocal versus not reciprocal
yeah I mean there's a lot there's
discussion about sort of different
transformations of these things in which
things are illegal in which things
aren't legal and you can lead yourself
into some contradictions so I think I'm
just going to leave it at this maybe
next time I'll point you at sort of the
paper which was from psychology where
they
we started talking about these different
types of measurements and I think there
are some internal contradictions it's
not without controversy and so I don't
think I want to go down these roads but
there's it's yeah it becomes sort of
tricky and how should you transform
something and what is the most
meaningful scale on which you should I
be logging something and how does that
change things etc should I take it
reciprocal how does that change things
is it still meaningful right okay other
questions on this okay so let me um go
on here to just mention that there are
sort of basic arithmetic operations
associated with each of these in
particular something that's nominal
you're only looking at distinctness
right so it's either equal or not equal
where as a categorical variable that's
ordinal you know we're inferring the
order so less than greater than or equal
or not equal something that's interval
you can do the addition and the
subtraction you just can't do the
division so you have addition
subtraction you're greater than less
than you've equal equality or not equal
and then finally the ratio you can
basically do all four things right
there's nothing stopping you from doing
any of these things the the distinction
here I would mention a little bit though
I just wanted to say this when I was
talking about this yesterday someone
mentioned a real you know how murky some
of this is sorry where's my examples
they said why is it that the taste of
potato chips which you scale that one to
ten was ordinal where the GRE score was
interval they said it seems to me like
the differences here mean as much as the
differences here and that's a little bit
questionable but the problem with the
potato chip scale right is something
like if you rate these as bad to good
and you just say you know like one to
two ten the question is the difference
between nine and ten the same as the
difference between eight and nine and
arguably it's not right for the potato
chips because it might depend on how
they label the scale where arguably with
the GRE a ten point increase on the GRE
is supposed to mean the same thing
whether you went from 300 to 310 or 600
or 610 but you can debate that and that
determines whether or not it's in one of
these whether or not the subtraction is
meaningful if the subtraction is not
meaningful then it has to become ordinal
but if you believe the subtraction is
meaning
well then you can call it interval and
again it's a quite a murky distinction
okay
all right okay any questions on that all
right then the next thing to talk about
which is should be pretty clear to you
is the difference between discrete and
continuous and you've heard this before
right so discrete I like to say that
there's some sort of gaps between the
numbers there's like either finite or
countably infinite number of possible
values whereas continuous are things
like real numbers right there
uncountable
okay and so data can either be discrete
or continuous okay continuous okay so
discrete again there's some sort of like
gaps naturally occurring gaps between
the numbers where it's continuous
there's no gaps okay so that's sort of
my short two word informal definition
what does it say up here okay so again
discrete finite or countably infinite
set of values so zip codes right there's
just separate categories right you can
have a you know nine four five five zero
or nine four five five one but you can't
have nine four or five five five zero
point two right there's nothing in
between those two right you can't
measure zip code more accurately right
it's just some level of granularity
things that you count right how many how
many siblings you have to know exactly
how many siblings do you have now that's
it right you can't have like
three-quarters of a sister or something
right instead of words is not a document
sum so you have like you can have a half
a sister but you cannot so say me you
can a half a sister but you cannot at
some point you lose the granularity
right I cannot have 5/6 of a sister
right okay and it's countable right you
can you can give me fractions but you
can't give me floating point so okay
often represented as integer variables
right especially if it you know you can
usually map these things into integers
binary attributes are a special case of
discrete right binary is a special case
with just two values okay binary you
know it's just two values that's a
special case of discrete and the one of
the homework problems I asked you is a
discrete continuous or binary right okay
then continuous these are things that
are real
you can compute as accurately as the
instruments allow so you can compute as
accurately as accurately I'll probably
spell that wrong accurately as your
instrument allows right so you have some
sort of measurement instrument and you
can you're just limited by that exactly
as instrument allows so for example
right temperature 76 degrees today well
it's really 76.4 well it's really
seventy six point four - you know height
I'm five foot eleven I'm really five
foot eleven point three something like
that now it's interesting right you can
say no two people are the same height
because if you really believe it's
continuous there's always some miniscule
difference okay so if you're a sort of
do probability right what's the
probability you know if I draw two
numbers uniformly between zero and one
what's the probability they're equal
zero right this continuous okay wait no
two people are the same way now
practically you can you know represent
these as floating-point you know and you
can practically use a finite number of
digits but again you know you really
want to have as many decimals as you can
if it's really continuous where if it's
discrete at some point there's no more
information right there's just gaps
between it okay so I think that's what I
wanted to say about the difference
between discrete and continuous and of
course you know that's going to depend
on how you treat things in the software
a little bit but for the most part it
doesn't make too big of a difference
okay I think that's all I wanted to say
there oh the one interesting example is
money I think right is money discrete or
continuous so I claim if it's money out
of my wallet it's discrete right but in
general if it's money you could argue
it's continuous right so how is money
out of my wallet discrete well I can
have you know the textbook cost eighty
dollars and fifty five cents or eight
dollars and 56 cents but I can't pay
half a penny right you can't you can
break the penny in half but it's not
worth half a sentence no there's no
there's nothing in between
whereas continuous you know if you
compute interest rate you can compute it
as accurately as you want right if you
say the interest rate is going to be 5
and one-third you can carry as many
decimals as you want but money in your
wallet would be discrete so that would
be a good example that's sort of right
on the boundary to
pending on it should say money in your
wallet can only be computed to the
nearest sense where it's discrete can be
computed or whether money in the bank
can be computed as too many decimals as
you want okay then I will I will mention
here that qualitative categorical
attributes are always discreet all right
that should be obvious right if
something is in distinct categories its
discreet the thing that gets tricky is
that things that are quantitative can go
either way and the example I gave you in
the examples I gave you so far things
that were quantitative they can go
either way so I think you remember that
distinction and say that if something is
qualitative that immediately implies
that it's going to be discrete you know
or binary which is a special case
whereas if it's quantitative
quantitative that will imply that it's
continuous ah that will imply that it's
either/or so it could be discrete or
continuous or continuous okay the next
thing I have up here is to go through
some of these examples actually this is
one of the instructions on here are the
same as one of the homework problems but
this is exactly where I stopped on
Thursday when I did this so I'm going to
stop here a couple announcements oh
let's see
let me know if I forget anything so the
videos oh the videos are up online
they're also so they're on the Tech
Talks but if you're trying to watch them
at home or something
they're also up on Google video right so
let's see Google video see if this works
they showed it to me last time I think
it was up there the why are we so slow
maybe my connection okay whoa look at
that
let's see so see that see
there it is okay so that's um that's
Tuesday right so you can watch that so
those are up online there and then also
on the tack car what is what is fine
right so right yeah right it right it
what I'm mad about is that you know I
don't get that recognition right you go
that's not any better than this class
right it's just some guys singing so um
so anyway I just tell you that the
videos are up there the other thing I
was going to say is that the books they
ordered some books I promise we give
those away today but they're not in yet
so you know next time if they're in
we'll do a sort of draw randomly I don't
know how many they have like 40 or 50 I
told you about the homework
I don't know I'm forgetting to say
anything nothing okay so I'll see you
guys on Tuesday thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
