conference 2008 my name is Lydia Ashe
I'm the chair of this year's conference
on behalf of the G Tech committee we're
excited to be hosting you in Seattle
this year all of our presenters have
spent a considerable amount of time
they're all experts in their field
they've pulled together some great
presentations over the next few days and
they're all engineers that are working
on the space of software and quality G
Tech is a conference that Google holds
each year it is unique in that there's
no fees we just want to get a lot of
people to come and talk we pay for our
speakers costs and every one of our
attendees has to apply for their slot to
be here so we know a little bit about
each of you
there's no booths there's nothing for
sale it's just a lot of people
discussing software and quality this
year we had such a huge number of
applicants that we had to move it to
this larger venue just to accommodate
some portion of who applied and so we're
just excited to have such a great group
here today so what's going on on the
outside this is a really challenging
economy and these are the business
realities that each of our companies are
having to deal with each of our
organizations has to deal with these
these are just a few of the headlines I
pulled from last week testing is an
infinite activity even in our small
applications we have a near infinite
number of code paths and an infinite
number of activities that are valid to
undertake but none of our resources are
infinite and none of them are growing so
I think the question that we're all
asking is how do you do more with less
how are you going to get creative and
solve problems in the cheapest way
possible without degrading the quality
hopefully with improving the quality
these constraints will bring focus and
the scarcity will highlight the need for
businesses to be competitive not only in
their quality but in their methods to
achieve quality companies that are able
to do this will defy the economy it
might start as waste reduction
identifying tests they're unnecessary
activities that aren't contributing to
quality will look for optimizations that
can be done how to run tests in parallel
ways to test around the clock
reducing the overall costs will buy us
that ability to try new things to get
creative with our approaches and to
develop new innovations so with all of
that Wayne on our minds why take the
time to come to a conference each one of
us is here looking for new ideas and new
ways to approach problems companies that
adopt winning strategies will get more
competitive and individuals who invent
those winning strategies will have very
successful careers each company wants to
increase their productivity and that is
certainly a focus of all of the talks
here today test automation is one way
that companies can improve quality and
reduce their costs within Google we've
got a wider variety of software than
most people realize just in the Seattle
office we have a miniature version of
Google we have nearly all of the Google
technical focus areas represented
projects for mobile online productivity
applications online gaming advertising
maps Search Indexing they've all been
worked on in that office one thing I
have learned in managing a variety of
these applications is that great
insights often come from solutions from
other places the problems of quality in
large-scale geo dataset have a lot of
insight to bring on testing a web index
you often can't predict where these
ideas are going to come from but
cross-pollination and the exchange of
ideas is critical to new insights and
that's really the theme for this year's
g'tok interesting approaches to
difficult engineering problems we wanted
to look at a broad view of what software
engineering encompasses we wanted a
conference that focuses on the technical
aspects of our roles helping everyone to
find the
engineering problems in their own
products and solve them in an
interesting way so I want to talk for a
moment about all of you a large part of
the g'tok value comes from all of our
participants we know a little bit about
you we know the value that you said you
could bring today find the value and
those around you introduce yourself talk
to other people that's a big part of
what G Tech wants to bring to help with
that we have seated each of the tables
out in the in the lunch areas with
controversial topics this is to help you
just gonn create around ideas don't just
stick with the same people you know find
a table find a topic share your
observations on it do you agree or
disagree but get to know people around
different ideas we have several hundred
people here today and it's it's really a
great turn up it's a great opportunity
to share ideas we have companies from A
to Z we have several search engines that
are represented and we have content
companies that rely on them we have
services that book flights and we have
Airlines represented we have phones and
routers networks and devices online
world's banks and universities they're
all here and the individuals in the
audience are just as diverse we have
students and professors industry
luminaries authors and developers each
person here came to actively participate
take the time to introduce yourself and
meet some of them so we've got a
schedule lined up in it's a one track
conference the idea is to keep everybody
together so you all have the same
experience and can really discuss from
different perspectives the same material
we have a Q&amp;amp;A session set up at the end
of each and we have microphones so we
can make sure we get everybody's voice
heard throughout and on tape breaks and
lunch again are a great time to meet
other people we also have a Connexions
board that's really to help people
connect with the larger audience if you
have a topic that you want to bring up
with a larger audience we're going to
kick off tomorrow
with a little bit of that just helping
people connect where they might not
necessarily bump into somebody randomly
if you have comments or feedback please
leave that on the on the connections
board for us and if you don't like the
topics on the tables that we provided
ignore them make up your own but right
on there what you did find interesting
because that's going to help us drive
content in the future let us know what
you want to talk about because we had to
move this to a larger venue we wanted to
bring a little bit of Google in here too
so we tried to drag lava lamps and
beanbag chairs in and that just wasn't
going to go so we brought in testing on
the toilet which is something that
graces our Google stalls every week and
like our offices we have a lot of
flexible spaces set up for conversations
we're inviting you please carry on your
conversations take them out to the
flexible spaces there's whiteboards set
up
delve into topics with your fellow
participants now before I introduce our
first speaker are there any questions we
should get to first great oh yes this
year actually we had a lot of feedback
from previous years that said let's do
more with how Google does testing we
want to hear more about how Google tests
and looks at these things but we didn't
want to stack up just a whole set of
presentations by Googlers so what we did
was we took the lightning talk series
and we set that up with Googlers and
that's gonna be tonight over at the
Google offices so that will be a chance
for those of you that gave us feedback
and said let's see more from Google
we're gonna do that instead so we can
keep this really focused on what people
in the industry are doing no others
great
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
