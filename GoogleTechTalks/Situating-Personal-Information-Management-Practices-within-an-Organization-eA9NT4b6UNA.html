an engineer on the search UI team it is
my honor to introduce my advisor and
associate professor from Virginia Tech
dr. manuel perez quinones today he'll be
talking about his work in personal
information management and how users
personal information management
practices can be leveraged by the
organization for knowledge management as
well so this talk is also part of the
perspective as speaker series which
attempts to empower individuals by
sharing their research and their life
stories with everyone all of us so
without much further ado dr. Perez
quinones thank you thank you and I'm not
your advisor anymore come on you
graduated we're colleagues now having
said that I have on my slides here minus
2 and gaara is my PhD student so I guess
I'm in the same boat so I want to thank
manas for inviting me and I want to
thank the the Google the Hispanic
Googler network I have a hard time
saying that it's a group of Hispanics
hear that that saw my tag might talk
announce and and wanted to co-sponsor
and one of them behind the screen here
hiding what I wanted to do was talk a
little bit about personal information
management research in general then talk
about a couple of studies two particular
studies that we've done in research and
my apologies to Manus or not having
picked his dissertation as one of the
two and then moved on to something that
we're pushing the the research into how
do we sort of take advantage of the
personal behavior and practices as a way
to capture knowledge management and that
is work that is evolving now and its
starting and it's a little bit more
speculative and open and then I want to
close because the Hispanic group asked
me to sort of give a brief life history
or something along those lines words of
wisdom of sorts all at the NL I'll say a
couple things on that this is the world
we live in today we have just huge
amount of information lots of displays
of digital information that comes to us
in many different forms and we are
clearly overloaded in one statistics
that I saw recently was that in 2005
there were 35 billion corporate emails
exchanged per day and a lot of workers
are reporting that they're just feeling
overwhelmed by just trying to manage the
information the other thing that is
happening is that we have a
proliferation of devices we have
handheld computers phones PDAs game
boxes and all of them have email all of
them have web access to all them are
connected all them access your calendar
and it's starting to get to a problem
where you in some cases you have to
wonder where did I put that stuff I
wrote a note to myself on one of my
machine someplace and I think the cloud
and some of the other things that are
happening will alleviate that but the
current situation today is that you
still have to do a lot of syncing
information these two things are things
that we try to address in personal
information management research and in
particular my research group of Virginia
Tech has been looking a lot of the
handheld devices and small device work
soap in research is about studying how
people find information keep it
organized and reuse it down the road it
is very very much targeted to the
personal aspect of that it's really much
targeted to how do I find my emails how
do I organize my emails how to organize
my files not the traditional ir type
research of how do i issue a query that
will result in the right document the
the research and the work has sort of
been organized around this framework of
finding keeping organizing and reusing
information so a lot of the studies have
been finding studies or making a keeping
decision what what are the information
that I've run across I decide to keep or
not the same thing with organization and
reusing and and the reason to study is
the previous two slides we are overwhelm
we have a lot of information demands
information demands attention which
means you get
distracted quickly from one thing in the
other that leads to a decrease in
productivity and we also want to do all
this so that we can develop next
generation of technology that it's
better suited to handle some of these
issues pim is hard to study because of
the personal part of it you cannot do
control lab studies for example if you
ask me to do a study on how I handle my
email I can put you my inbox the people
that's an email to me you don't
recognize you don't know if they're
critical you know if their urgent where
I file my emails you have no idea where
they are so whatever you do in that task
is going to be very very inefficient and
just totally irrelevant so personal
information management has to be studied
within the context of your personal
information so if I'm going to do a
study of how you do email I have to
somehow one get you to sit down and do
your email in a place where I can see to
have to sort of worried about privacy I
don't want to see emails that maybe
don't belong to public view of your
personal stuff but at the same time I
have to do that to study in the right
contact so it's very challenging it
tends to be done in this idea of Diary
studies we there are a lot of studies
that tend to just follow somebody along
ok follow somebody along for a week and
have them questions on a daily basis as
opposed to control out now we can do
some control laps on some sort of
smaller parts and I'll show you one
example where we need one of those the
other part of him that's sort of
interesting and hard to studies that
people develop strategies to manage your
information if you look at how you
handle your email it's probably very
different than the person sitting next
to you some of you might use tags on
gmail so i'll use my use folder some of
you might use smart folders on a mail
app on the mac
the every single person has a different
strategy and it's a strategy that is
very heavily dependent on the context of
your work manis and I have talked about
email organization for over the last I
don't know four years and and we both
sort of have it under control and
they're both very different and his
works well because of the type of emails
he gets I wish I could do it the way he
does it I can't and he probably changed
now we haven't talked you probably
change the way you do it now there are
as cool that's one of the things we
found is that in life's transitions
changes your strategies so the
strategies are very very very much
personal it's a combination of life
context person and the type of tool you
use and you know changing from being a
student to professional changes a lot
the types of information you manage and
again so that's another reason why you
have to study and not only in a very
personal basis but personal basis within
a particular context of that person's
life a really brief history of pimp
research a lot of the sort of
foundational studies on PIM happen in
the 90s him as as a as a phrase was
mentioned on land sale book in 88 but
really didn't start as a collection of
researchers identify themselves as PIM
researcher until 2001 or so that's when
william jones at washington started
doing some research on calling it
specifically PIM and then he led it
workshop in 2005 which led to a special
issue in CA cm and led to another
workshop led to a book and then led to
another workshop etc and so forth the
last two or three workshops actually the
last four workshops Virginia Tech has
been involved heavily either me or Rob
Capra who was another PhD of my norm
Aniston Gary
directly involved with the organization
directly involved with with the
presentations and having papers and
there's plan there's there's still plan
for a conference in 2011 so that's still
sort of in the air the last workshop was
a few months ago in Vancouver and manas
presented remotely one of his
dissertation papers so I'm going to go
over the finding keeping organizing just
to give you a flavor of the kind of
things that we research in in pin and
the finding information we study how
people search and browse for information
as a way to locate information they need
to accomplish on particular task because
p.m. is very focused on the personal
aspect of it we focus on finding for
personal use or finding in your personal
store we call the PSI personal store of
information sort of the information
you've collected you know the bookmarks
the history cash and all that it's my
personal store and you can search just
that by using tools like the ones you
get on your desktop we also find
information just by encountering it and
and these are one of those things that
are difficult in your day-to-day
browsing you might see something on the
side that you find interesting and you
follow that trail and you find some
information that is relevant but you
wearing and the way to get that
information and those tend to be more
difficult to get back to them because
you sort of stumbled onto a trail that
led to the information you weren't
explicitly looking for it we also have
this notion Jamie taevon described it of
orienteering and teleporting
orienteering is a search behavior that
you don't exactly know where you're
going with your browsing pages of making
almost local decisions on every context
you look at the page and you go it's
this choice and then on the next page
you go it's this choice that is similar
to the notion of orienteering if you're
in the woods that there is no path but
yet at every step you look around you
let's go that way let's go that way and
so forth
and it's sort of countered or juxtaposed
to the notion of teleporting which Jamie
described as jumping directly to a goal
and and our work has modified that a
little bit with the issue at the bottom
of information address ability what we
describe teleporting ass is knowing
exactly where you're going even though
you're not jumping directly there and
orienteering is you don't know where
you're going at every step you have to
make decisions as to what the next step
is and a good example teleporting that
we use is if you google something and
you tell somebody will google my name
and it's the second link that shows up
on a page so you're going to make a
decision or clicking on the second link
but you know ahead of time is the second
link before you even see what the second
link is so that is sort of a teleporting
type behavior that you know how to get
there yes there are actions it doesn't
mean you type the URL that you get
directly to the end their actions that
you go on the way there and and we tie
that to this notion of information
address ability we say that information
has an address meaning that you have a
way to specify how to get to the
information now that doesn't mean again
it's not that I know the URL you might
know the address of how to get to for
example Manas phone number by saying
google his name his webpage would come
up click there click on personal his
phone number is there that is a full
address to the information because
unequivocally gets you to the
information you want it doesn't mean
that you don't have to do some steps to
get there but it does mean that you
don't have to think about it it's almost
just sort of mechanic to get to it the
way we think of that is that sometimes
you have partial information and that's
where search engines come in a search
engine is a tool that you give it
partial information it gives you some
more information that you make decisions
and then navigate to them so we think of
partial information and searching as
going together searching tends to be use
with partial information if you had the
full information you would need a search
engine to get to the information you
want
the other thing that has been studied is
this idea of track strategies that work
over a different collection so finding a
file and finding email is different even
though you could use search for both
largely because we remember different
things there are studies that have shown
that people remember the sender and the
recipient of emails very well and that
becomes a very prominent factor for
which to use for finding things or files
a lot of times a file name is not the
most discriminant factor and a lot of
people don't remember the file name a
lot of people remember content or
remember you know it's a file that I was
working on last week I don't remember
what I named a proposal one or something
like that for email that's not the case
email you know that it's an email that
somebody sent to me so you can query on
that and then just sort of browse do you
find it so the behavior across different
collections is different which makes
this finding information sort of
interesting because particular
strategies that work on one don't work
on the other so once you have
information you have to make a decision
do I keep this information though I just
somehow accumulated in some form do I
book market do i copy do i print it to
PDF and save it on my hard drive what do
I do with the information and the
information that the decision is largely
based on is there a value of keeping
this information for future use a lot of
times the information is out there you
can just look for it again and so
there's no need to keep it a lot of time
the information is sort of temporary
like today's temperature well you don't
want to keep that because tomorrow it's
irrelevant but overall you end up with a
lot of information that you have to make
a decision that you want to keep or not
and that starts to build up William
Jones has made this nice diagram that
says that the if the information is
useful and you make a decision to keep
it you've done a successful decision if
it is useful and you don't keep it then
you have a Miss because later when you
have to use that information you have to
go finding for it again if the
information is junk
you decide to keep it you have a false
positive and it's going to affect
finding information in the future
because now it's going to be among the
things that you kept that you don't need
if the information is junk and you don't
keep that you made a correct rejection
and this is the issue here that you have
to keep in mind when you're doing this
and when you're researching it that
keeping information is not costly but it
affects the cost of refining down the
road on the other hand a lot of times
you have information that you don't know
it's useful it's what's called post
value recall it's information that at
the time you saw it who care and then
later you go you know like me going to
San Francisco coming here for a
conference well a month ago I might have
seen some review of a restaurant in San
Francisco and I wasn't thinking of San
Francisco so I didn't care now i'm in
san francisco and realize oh you know i
saw a review a good place like where did
i see that i didn't keep it now it has
value value that I didn't know at the
time I made the decision so it's
impossible to manage and keep that
information so the keeping decision is
not completely a local decision
sometimes it's a sort of future decision
that you have to guess is this going to
be useful in the future there are people
thing that you should keep everything oh
just keep the cash big enough storage is
cheap just like a search engine find it
and that could be a possibility i am and
their people and i'll get back to that
later in an another slide so it but it
is an issue for decision is an issue for
research organization is is difficult
for a couple of reasons one is actually
cognitively demanding to decide where
you file something we tend to think
we've been trained to think in
categories that tend to be exclusive so
things live in only one place when it
comes to digital information there's no
reason why that's the case furthermore
if takes more effort for you to think
okay this
belong under my professional
presentations or it belongs under my
trip to San Francisco and the answer is
probably both you don't really have to
make that decision on one of the other
file systems force you to make that
decision so the demand that the task is
a little harder and then it becomes also
an issue of how am I going to reuse this
information you need to get back to that
for example filing the slides for my
presentation I put them on their folder
called presentation under a travel
folder for san francisco and i'm
actually in san francisco for another
purpose so it's under a folder of grad
school presentation at something or
other it made sense at the time of
organizing this because of the time
factor I bet you six months down the
road i'm going to go looking for this
light and i'm going to go crazy and not
find them because I'll probably go
looking for them in a folder of
presentations given that or something
like that and that's not where it is so
it and you don't want to spend way too
much time linking all these things and
connecting them you almost want to just
dump in some place and just find it
somehow and actually there are people
like Manas that names files by keywords
he will use for searching the file names
are like this long separated by comma or
spaces and they're almost irrelevant but
there are presentation Google grad
school council conference San Francisco
and it's just a bunch of words that are
all the possible ways of how you're
going to go back to it and that might
seem weird but it seems perfect when you
think REE finding that file later the
other problem that happens is
fragmentation you end up with things in
multiple places and you look in the
other place or you in one place and it's
in the other one there are a lot of
strategies and i'll come back to those
in a second they have been identified
for files and a lot of them for email
filer versus pilar filers are people
that methodically put everything in a
folder someplace piner's are people that
just leave a bunch of icons on your
desktop is the one that the desktop
looks like it's over floated
you have spring cleaners which are
people that sort of pile for a while and
then they sit there and file everything
in one day it's like a spring cleaning
of your house there are people that do
filing their people to do tagging if the
system supports it and one of the
benefits of this structure organization
because if you think about it filing
structurally everything I said is
negative well there is a benefit to it
the benefit is to is that as you
navigate your file structure to get to a
file you're rehearsing the organization
and it becomes more in your head and
then it becomes easier to say oh that
goes didn't in tinton and and that's
stored in these steps down the road so
so there is a benefit to a structure
organization because it helps you
rehearse your own organization mechanism
so here's what i was saying they're
they're different strategies on how you
organize things there is no right
strategy there is no good strategy it
all depends on a person by person you
have the file and organize everything
you have the organized nothing and just
search for it and I I was more on the
file and organize everything until I had
this very weird experience I I was
looking for a paper and I literally
googled the title of the paper the first
hit that came back was my own server I I
basically had accumulated a bunch of
PDFs of some research paper in a folder
and my server the folder was visible
publicly the Google engine had crawled
it and here comes the link Perez dot
csvtu I'm thinking oh don't I feel like
moron I am accumulating things and
organizing it and then don't know where
it is and Google for it and finds it in
my own space and it was interesting
because it brought to me very clear to
my head that maybe I shouldn't organize
anything I mean if I can put things in a
place where a good search engine can
pick him up who cares where it is I mean
did you know that that's that was a very
extreme example that I from Virginia I
google and it came back to my server
that was sitting
next to my leg and and the funny thing
is that I had no idea it was there um so
it it sort of changed a lot of my my
information practices to realize okay so
the search engines are getting to a
point that are good enough that can sort
of help me find stuff to the point that
I don't actually have to organize
anything or at least have to organize
loosely there are different groups that
have explored this the life bits group
at microsoft believe that you should
save everything literally everything
they actually you have like video
cameras that tape your whole life and
archive 24 hours of video of your life
they actually have audio recording of
your phone conversations and like
archive them and then they the plan is
to eventually transcribe them and search
them and all that I think that's a
little bit extreme there are groups that
believe you have to have everything
structured and they are very formal in
terms of taxonomies and ontology that
seems more for a librarian than for a
normal person there are people who say
you need to do a lot of unification so
that man is on my email is connected to
men as the co-author of a paper in my
file system and we know they're both the
same person and and so forth and they're
people that just say you know just dump
them someplace who cares just search the
search and you will pick it up and we'll
find it for you the tagging in search is
sort of a loose organization because
it's losing the sense that you're just
putting some labels and dumping in a big
bucket and then just letting search find
it email organization is very it's
interestingly you know similar but
different in the sense that we have
until fairly recently we we had lots of
really bad email tools imap I think
solved a lot of the problems with email
so the most common problem you're here
with email is oh that's on my home
computer and that only happened because
you had a pop client that downloaded and
that
in axis is somewhere else so that
changed a lot of people won't practice
once you move to an imap now all your
email is everywhere now you can put
effort into finding it because you're
finding it in a place that you'll find
it later at another computer tags with
Gmail and some of the other systems and
support tax also are providing that so
one of the things that people do an
email is this idea of prioritization
archivers people mark the emails or
labeled them as I need to work on this
and then archive the rest and that stays
in your inbox or stays in some sort of
inbox I used to be a heavy filer on
email and number a number of experience
convinced me to ignore that I'm sort of
on the priority and archiver now I all
my emails archived in one folder called
archive I don't care who they are where
they come from I don't do anything to
them don't color them tag them or
anything they stay on the inbox until I
handle them once I've handled them
archive out of the way and the search
tools on the email programs are good
enough that you can just go find them
without any problem so you save a lot on
the organization add the cost of every
now and then an email being a little
hard to find so now I'm going to tell
you a couple of studies that we've done
at Virginia Tech over the last few years
the first one is a refining study done
by Rob Capra we're interested we were
interested in the the idea of refighting
the idea of finding information you've
already found in finding information
particularly on the web he got into this
project through a very sort of wacky and
innovative system he built this thing
called web context and it was a a
caching mechanism for a web browsing
experience that would then pull out
keywords out of all the web pages you've
seen and built a phone in her face for
you to query pages and pull out
addresses and phones and the idea was
the example I gave early of a restaurant
in San Francisco because he often had
the experience of I'm going to a
conference I make reservation in the
process of making reservation you find
the area for the
tell you see recommend a restaurant you
see all this information that at that
point is irrelevant six months later
when you're in that city becomes
irrelevant but when you're in that city
your computer somewhere else or you
don't have internet so what he would do
he would pull all the addresses and
phones found on web history pages and
then he build the phone in her face I
used words and you would say Chinese
restaurant San Francisco I want the
phone and the system would search for
the pages and actually would read out to
you the phone number for any Chinese
restaurants that you had browse for so
it's a very interesting study it was a
very cool system voicexml it sort of got
in the way and a lot of the things we're
trying to do but then he got interested
in refined information and this whole
idea of how do I go and find something
that I already had seen and there was
this question of is refined in different
than finding and and intuitively if you
think about it finding is very
exploratory you're looking for something
that I'm sure it's out there someplace
but I've never seen it I don't know
where it is I don't know where it would
be refined is this idea that there is
something that you already saw that
you're certain is there you may remember
the color of the page you might remember
it was in some government website you
remember some things that differences
are enough for you to sort of have a
different search behavior so we
conducted a study we had 18 different
tasks we had two sessions we invited
people ask them to search for
information we invite him back I think
two or three weeks apart and we
basically asked them to refine same or
similar information right before each
task we asked them how familiar are you
with this task and how frequently you do
this task and what we found was that
familiarity and frequency turn out to be
the most discriminant factor in whether
you can refine the information easy or
not meaning if you do the task very
frequently then you can get back to the
information faster the types of tests
that we did
were looking up a word in a dictionary
looking up a phone making a travel
arrangement meaning find a flight that
the price of the flight from Two Cities
from one city to another finding
instructions for a DVR you know go to
TiVo and download the PDF for this
particular model sports score movie
times talks for a company the home home
page for a professor at the University
the weather for a city and information
for a local restaurant like what time
does it open and things like that
interestingly enough and contrary to
what we expected search engine did not
or i'm sorry search engine use did not
come out to be a significant factor
between finding and refining people use
use the search engine the same way they
use a search engine if they had a
problem finding the information at the
beginning they had a problem finding the
information when they came back if it
was easy to find that it was easy to
find it on the second task task type had
an effect as you can imagine finding up
the definition of a word versus finding
up the weather in the city are very
different tasks and had an impact there
were a number of tasks that were very
hard to do they were two in particular
one task was find the headlines today's
headline well two weeks later we say
find two weeks ago headlined and the the
sort of interesting thing will realize
is that if you go to any news site the
default URL CNN com or abcnews.com shows
today's news well yesterday's news are
some place in there but they're not
under today's back one day they're in
some nondescript URL and often it's hard
even to find them by date it's more by
topic that you find them so it was
really hard for the person to go back to
last monday's news they didn't remember
the news it was they remember they had
seen in a monday and that became a very
very difficult task the other one that
was difficult and was sort of
interesting was we asked people
pick two sweaters you want to buy for a
friend for a gift we didn't give any
indication as to where or what type of
sweat or anything like that and on the
refine the activity we asked them to
find one of those two sweaters and what
happened was what we noticed was that a
lot of the decisions we're sort of the
orienteering type decisions like you see
two sweaters you go I like that one
better and you go on and it's a very
local decision that has no principle
behind it so when they came back they
went like I don't remember which one of
this to a pic so it became very
difficult to actually follow the same
path to the information that they had
found before I mentioned an information
of their civilities is the same topic
here we came up with this model we came
up with a model that says low frequency
and low familiarity ree finding is
really no different than finding if it's
something that yeah you saw it before
but you've seen it once you don't do it
frequently it's almost like just finding
something and the behavior and the
patterns and the search queries and all
that are very similar the moment you go
up in familiarity meaning that you
visited that site several times then you
start learning some patterns do you
start remembering middle the road point
so if it's a page for a professor at
Georgia Tech and you've gone there
multiple times maybe you remove the URL
of the department and you start there as
opposed to start at the Georgia Tech
page and then the department and then
the professor once you cross over in
frequency familiarity and frequency
means shortcuts people that that do a
task a lot of times we'll remember
shortcuts by either bookmarking it or by
either just type in the URL so a lot of
people found whether they went straight
to the weather side they knew which one
it was they check whether all the time
so they went straight to the weather
and just enter the zip code or in the
name of the city so familiarity and
frequency sort of it's what you're down
the domain of of learned shortcuts or
actually accumulated bookmarks or you
know buttons on your browser then there
is this strange inherently difficult
test it's our task that that you do with
high frequency but no matter what
they're really hard going to yesterday's
news is really tough and it's not so
much anything in the task or the user I
think is more on the web design it's
just they're just some tests are hard to
do that doesn't matter how many times
you do them it's just going to be down
in that other category and and that
category i think is very small there are
just very sort of odd things in there oh
one thing that we found that that i
think it's worth pointing out our study
had just two sessions you come in and
then you come back a few weeks later we
found that they went from quadrant one
to two after just one session so the the
familiarity just having found something
once it's enough to influence your
access pattern and make it easier to
find you do less exploratory you know
they're this this starts spoke model if
you find one place and you go to all the
research links and then you find another
place we found that just having done it
once was enough for them to remember two
weeks later on how to get to the
information the next study I wanted to
mention is calendar use and this is a
study that was initially done by an
undergraduate student and then Maness
and I picked it up we had been sort of
gathering dust on my office for a while
and we sort of read sort of cleaned it
up did a little bit more data analysis
and there are a couple of things that
are interesting and we're still trying
to get this published what we wanted to
do was try to find out how people search
or how people use calendars given that
today's environment has changed so much
from
the time when calendar management had
been studied kanima calendar management
was studied in the and the 90s by
several people and and this was the days
when you had big workstations in your
office and you didn't take him home and
you didn't access them from home either
so using a calendar men running a
program on your son workstation or
something like that since we've had
personal computers PDAs now phones now
web applications so we wanted to sort of
see how things have changed and this was
done or university 98 survey
participants most of them faculty or
more than half faculty and then with the
16 in-depth interviews with them here's
some interesting findings we found a lot
of proxies for calendars we found a lot
of people that print the calendar found
a lot of people that wrote down notes
for the calendar and took it with them
we even found users that did that in
spite of having a palm this was a few
years back in spite of having a palm
device or some kind of handheld device
we also found that calendars continue to
be printed that no matter what all the
technology gives you that people have
certain comfort on the paper calendar
even if it is a printout of the computer
calendar and to this day my supervisor
at the graduate school actually brings
her calendar every morning you know in a
color printer it looks nice all the
color and everything but still printed
every morning it doesn't go back to the
computer to see what my nine o clock is
the paper sort of is the one the more
current the we found that a lot of
people keep family and work calendar
separate and particularly family
calendar tends to be a wall calendar
posted up in the kitchen or something
like that it was amazing how many people
pointed it out it wasn't just one or two
the paper calendar continued to be of
use for things that actually technology
is not helping and I'll go to that in a
few seconds paper trail it's one of them
annotations is another one and this
notion of opportunistic rehearsal is
another one opportunistic rehearsal is
when you look ahead in your calendar and
the more you look ahead the more you
remember what you have tomorrow at two
o'clock and a lot of the online
calendars don't have a good way for you
to look ahead sort of casually without
wanting to and actually google calendar
has one interesting feature that is the
next four days no matter where you are
in the week they show you the next four
days that's a perfect example of good
opportunity opportunistic rehearsal that
a lot of candler show you they or week
well on the week calendar if i'm on
saturday i can't see next week and if i
go to next week i can see today it's
sort of this artificial boundary of
where the week ends when reality today's
today and I want to know what's
happening tomorrow and I don't care if
it's next week it's tomorrow so this
opportunity rehearsal is one part that a
lot of calendars don't really take
advantage and make it difficult so
people prefer to print it by hand the
other one is it's one that I actually I
do this a lot is people use the
calendars and memory aid for reporting
purposes you go back when you have to do
your annual report you go back and say
where did I go this year what did I do
this year what conferences that I attend
so you use it as a record of things
you've done and as a memory of who did I
meet with and and when did i meet with
such and such person and things of that
sort and again that's another issue that
then I'm not sure our online calendars
do anything in particular to help other
than the fact that it's still there
there's no sort of global way of
browsing old history which clearly is
different than you know the day to day
or month to month browsing of the
upcoming events we collected candler
samples and I want to show a couple of
examples here that are sort of
interesting the one in the top left this
person had an activity and printed the
calendar and then proceeded to put a
post-it on top of it to capture to write
in this case I think was a potluck
dinner and and the person wrote
what she was bringing to the potluck
dinner so these are the type of things
that that paper calendar support that
online calendars make it really
difficult to do it's the idea of adding
some sort of generic notes not that are
hitting inside someplace but just
something in top the middle one is
similar is that was October thirty-first
and person wrote you know a pumpkin to
remind herself that she had to take the
kids to go trick-or-treating the one at
the bottom is interesting this was a
grad student who parked at nine in a
place that he couldn't Park during the
day so he put an alarm to move the car
at eight o clock so it wouldn't get
towed so he was so confident that he was
going to be in the lab at eight in the
morning from an overnight working on a
project that he just had a recurring
alarm for every day move car at
ten-thirty and again it's sort of a
weird odd use of a calendar you think of
calendar for meetings maybe reminders
this is sort of a very strange of the
mainstream so what implications that we
come up with that for design paper trail
we had people that wanted to know when
they deleted an event okay and there are
two cases for that one is I look at my
calendar for monday i see i have
something at ten okay monday morning i
go there and it's not there now i gotta
wonder what happened and my my
administrative assistant has access to
my calendar so she could have deleted it
but the question is did she do betta did
she move it somewhere else did i look at
the wrong week am i looking at the wrong
week paper calendars if you erase that
you will see the mark of the erasure and
it gives you a confidence that yeah that
was a race is not there more but it was
there and that is something that gets
lost on the digital is this evidence of
use and wear and tear that that
disappears a similar to that is this
idea of tentative events
dueling very often you're told well
separate tuesday at two wednesday at
three and thursday at eight for a
meeting we wanted those three let me
coordinate with everybody well you might
mark all three but then you delete two
of them or you delete only want to
forget to delete the other and then you
show up at the meeting the wrong date
and realize oh I forgot to delete that
that was a temporary one and what you
have is you have multiple appointments
that is almost like an exclusive or you
really want only one of these and and at
some point you want to confirm this is
the one and the other one should
disappear and when you go electronic
that option is not there but it's a
common practice that is unsupported and
needless to say intelligent alarms how
many of you have calendars that go off
on your phone your laptop your desktop
at home all at the same time they're all
beeping and going crazy I've stopped
using alarms because of that because
they all beep and actually they all be
but about the same offset from each
others like a minute off so my ipod will
go off first then my cell phone goes off
that my laptop so I've just stopped
having alarms go off which then you lose
the alarm you lose the feature of the
alarm going off and alarming you because
you get annoying half the time because
it's going around so moving to sort of
more of the future work that we're doing
so knowledge management and organization
is this idea that there is knowledge in
the organization that is sort of not
directly embedded in the mission
statement or in the financial report so
it's it's in the people that work in the
organization and they a lot of
organizations struggle to try to capture
this knowledge you want to have that
information so that if one employee goes
the next one that comes in can pick it
up sort of quickly from where they were
what we're looking at is we're looking
at this idea that knowledge management
can be a byproduct of pim practices
knowledge management can be in inner
organization can be a sort of side
effect of how you do your email how you
either you're filing how you do
things and we're trying to find ways
that that can lead to social
collaboration to identifying experts in
the organization by just looking at
traffic or where the questions go and to
help shape the awareness of audiences a
lot of research on communicating on
listserv says that people don't
participate because I don't know it's
receiving the email so I'm afraid to say
something that might offend somebody and
and and that's part of this issue of
organizational management so the big
research question is how do my personal
practices benefit others in the
organization and notice that I'm sort of
trying to stay away from the big social
part I'm trying to focus on the
organization because there is a lot of
things in common between you and the
person that sits next to you whereas
there isn't that much in common between
you and your best friend because your
best friend might work in completely
other industry and the types of emails
or documents they manage it's just
completely different so when finding
information is no different than
personal information finding but in the
organization you have these other
situations where people find information
for you you get emails from people
saying you know I found this and I
thought of you here Pullman they push it
onto your face or they they ask you
questions are things you've found that
now they want you know at the meeting
you mentioned this last year's report
where is it that so now you don't only
have to find it but you have to find it
and make it available to others so so I
think we thought we have more ways of
finding information in our organization
because now part of it is sort of this
collaborative information finding we
also have different ways of organizing
information and this is where the
personal starts moving to the
centralized at the Graduate School of
Virginia Tech we have a central file
share and I just absolutely hate it I
don't use it because it's the union of
everybody's file systems so where my
things reside is like buried someplace
and multiple areas and things that
I sort so there's a folder for public
presentations and then there's different
people inside and then inside and it's
sort of strange to me is very unnatural
to to use that and still keep it in sync
with my file system they don't match
structure wise because I'm in CS I can
refuse to use it and explain technically
why I don't like it the rest of the
people have don't have that luxury you
have to put it over there it's not there
you have to put over there and it
becomes really weird becomes very it's
strange it's almost like it it's a
problem looking for a solution it's also
strictly hierarchical you have to make
that decision okay I have a form this is
an admissions form it's also a form it's
also this it's also the other we have
versions problems okay this is an update
though I didn't put a number etc etc so
it gets gets very frustrating and it has
a very high cognitive demand very
quickly the other part that we're
looking at is how to leverage this
social graph of people imagine all the
people you're connected to and within
the organization I don't want to again
I'm trying to stay away from the
facebooks of the world implicitly you
can use a social graph within the
organization to improve your payment
practices for example email providers
use aggregate view of email traffic
across users as a way to identify spam
if a particular email has a few keywords
and it went to everybody on site you
have a very high certainty that it spam
and then you can provide spam filter to
individual users that are heavily
influenced by the collective users so we
can think of the same thing in terms of
organizing your email in terms of
organizing your files where do you file
that attachment that I send you might be
relevant to where I want to file it
explicitly on the other hand if we could
capture the strategies we can build a
community of sorts we could say this is
how personal X hand
or email and you could sort of it's
almost like a skin that you would apply
to your email program that would create
some smart folders create a set of tags
and you create some instructions as when
you get this email do this and put it
over here and then you can share those
practices through the organization you
can do it automatically because the tool
does that automatically like spam does
or you can do it manually by allowing
sort of a community of practice to build
some of the strategies and accumulating
someplace you download them applying to
your email now on this idea of your
social graph imagine if we could capture
the friends of a friend network from
work from your neighborhood from your
facebook site from you know your high
school friends your personal social life
and all that and you unify around people
and then apply something like the
PageRank algorithm but a friend rank so
that people that are higher important
show up higher on that graph then you
can use that as a way to capture whose
email is more important than others if
we could do this and save it and
manipulate it then you can temporarily
update it for example this week emails
from Manas to me are of high priority
because he was going to pick me up this
morning I didn't want to miss that email
in the middle of twenty other emails
last week I was working on a proposal
with three professors emails for those
three should go above the top of the
queue they're the most important one so
if you can manipulate the importance of
people that can influence your PIN
practice when you're working implicitly
you can use it to rank emails and so
forth so the idea the research question
is can we capture and share these
strategies for use on email and and
that's sort of something we're working
on I'll give you one quick example that
we are looking at sort of applying email
tags across the email client so if i
send somebody an email and I
taggat the software on the other end
says the sender had this tag would you
like to use it on the email to turns out
that the most appropriate person to
tagging email is the sender the receiver
has to read the email before to decide
what tax to use now you can send the
tags along without revealing anything
private or the other person you can
anonymize them tag one tech to tax 3 in
and you can also then share them back
and forth and you can have this notion
of sending emails and then sending backs
as suggestions of how to organize it and
when you put together the collaborators
across you get a richer set of tags that
if you sort of do unification much like
citeulike or delicious does and say you
know people that like that bookmark also
like this other one without
understanding what they is just because
there is a common link between them then
you can have people at tag this file
with this tag also our email also tag
this email with the same tag so you can
do this collaborative tagging and
organization and leverage the heavy
organizer in the group to help in
information organization to the nun
heavy organizer in the group we're
currently building this we have a a
design or architecture design to
actually work with gmail on that and
we're hopefully over the next few months
we're going to take a crack at it and
see how it goes my sort of conclusions I
have another slide at the end but I want
to touch quickly information overload is
here that is killing us we we sort of
need to find a way to do things I think
Bill Gates has been quoted as saying
that he's become a librarian and he
hates it so he wants people to solve
this problem he doesn't want to spend so
much problem organizing his information
he wants to the work I think we're way
beyond the point of we spend more time
organizing than we need to pim is sort
of studying exactly that problem how to
organize information on how to make
useful we're pushing it now to see
organizations can benefit from that
go and are gonna help people organize
information help people identify expert
and provide some added value to
employees because this talk was
co-sponsored with the Hispanic Googlers
network they asked me to say something
brief about my life history so I'm going
to give two seconds of this I think some
of you might find that interesting there
are many career path my high school
yearbook says I was going to be a lawyer
and I actually went to college to study
law why because my father was a lawyer
and my mom was a university professor I
was really good at math in high school
and as a mathematician your choices are
limited as to what career you get at
least that's what I was told and I sure
as hell did not want to become a
university professor that's not a boring
so math wasn't a choice my mom was a
professor I knew that was sort of solo
it is and sure enough I ended up being a
university professor mostly by
completely pure chance I ran out of the
math courses in business I was being
about a minor in business took all my
math courses run out of them really
quick my English wasn't that good so I
wanted more math courses those are
numbers I understand those without
knowing English and the my advice is
that you want to take the sports from
programming things it sure does they
have a lot of English now it's mostly
formula ah needless to say that was it
halfway through the semester I went back
to visit can I do a major on that said
sure you can it's called computer
science really oh cool let's do that and
I switched to a minor in business and a
major in CS and then from there on you
know one thing led to the other I ended
up getting a PhD and I'm boring
university professor now so there are
many careers path that you follow that
our non-traditional non-standard none of
them are better than the other sometimes
we as as minorities we sort of feel bad
because everybody went to Stanford and
have PhDs from MIT it's like no the
other one that I find a lot of people
have a hard time with this is that
everything is relative I get asked this
question to you speak a foreign language
as a yeah English
and people sort of have a hard time
going no no I mean a foreign language
that yeah English I did not grow up
speaking English the English is a
foreign language to me in English is a
second language to be and as no no but I
mean you know other that English said
Spanish is not a foreign language to me
it's to you but not to me and people
have a hard time understanding that my
wife was was asked have you ever lived
abroad and she says I do now well I mean
abroad means you're leaving away from
your family you're living in another
country we grew up in Puerto Rico this
is abroad for us so it's all relative
people have a hard time with that here
in the United States I think all of you
understand that and technology we have a
lot of people from international areas
find mentors that don't care why they
have to give you advice a lot of times
we get advice from the wrong people and
this one I'm not going to get into it
we're going to have a session in the
afternoon I 132 talk about diversity
that's what I do at the grad school it's
at this room if anybody's interested in
coming and talking will be ending formal
discussion we can talk about that so
I'll stop there and take questions okay
no questions okay so we're done thank
