want to thank Craig for setting us up
and also Carina um and I think so i'm
going to talk about a wide range of
different intersections between sort of
psychology brain imaging and computation
let me start out with with some sort of
context give you sir there's an age-old
problem which many of you have heard of
having to do with sort of our
disassociation between what the sort of
physical aspect of the day you know this
three or four pounds of guellen-- ahead
and insert of our thoughts and feelings
and emotion so and this goes like at
least thousand years Aristotle da
Vinci's a cart for certain talk about
this problem and the question is exactly
how do you explain the relationship
between these little tiny details
neurons and synapses are and these sort
of larger integrative structures we
think of as systemic behavior I have a
phrase for this and over the years I've
written in a couple different places I
call the neurocognitive gap it's very
simple to explain cells fire you order
lunch and the gap between you serve well
some of your laughing sorry you're going
what is it but the kappa think about it
a few cells firing your temple oh and
all of a sudden you're ordering lunch
now this this should be something that's
like I'll just care about and want to
try to explain in some sort of
systematic what that should be really in
my view the goal of trying to deal with
anatomical and functional nature of the
brain now there's some hope because if
you take this particular subject in fact
much of his behavior could be explained
by anything at me if you look closely
enough and for poor Homer here there
might be other problems of system level
brain measures sort of start
only within to the last ten years maybe
last 15 and it began focusing on various
kinds of imaging methods you might be
familiar with the G you might be
familiar with cut someone might have had
a PET scan and certainly most people
have had some kind of MRI scan well the
1990s a new method was invented called
functional MRI which actually allowed
you to sort of look at different parts
of the brain to see where you might be
ordering lunch or thinking about what
you're going to have lunch and a new
field emerged which tried the pleasure
of being involved in a wood called
cognitive neuroscience and it was meant
to be a blending of cognition which most
neuroscientists really don't care much
about because they're measuring single
cells and neuroscience so to think to
make Congress psychologists who don't
like to think much about brains start
thinking about that kind of paradox in
terms of the mind-body problem as it
stands in the 21st century so here we
have the promise to look inside the
brain and see in real time or at least
certain real-time cognitive and
perceptual processes and so hopefully
this would provide some kind of
constraints for our theories and it
would provide some connective tissue
back to our understanding of the brain
as well so let's talk a little bit about
the brain the brain is bigger okay the
brain is huge in terms of the unit of
analysis that matters so the particular
way you index it is probably all know
matters a lot and we have something like
billions of billions of neurons and but
in terms of functional regions we have
things that may consist of hundreds of
thousands to tens of millions of neurons
the weird part is the average seller has
about a thousand connections so this is
sparse if you think about it so even
though there's a huge number of synapses
relative to this space the connectivity
apparently is very selective for some
reason right so this is this is this is
a sort of a hint about what's going on
this is a slide I stole from Terry
sadowsky some years ago and in this
slide he was stressed the idea that
there's sort of different ways to
approach the brain there are ways to
sort of slice and dice and figure out
what level of analysis is the most
appropriate level to study for our
imagers and also my background actually
comes from back in the 80s being
involved in a lot of the neural network
kind of research connection all of this
stuff that was happening in their own
information processing nibs and a lot of
the workshops there are you know sort of
reflect these different levels of
analysis and how they integrate with
computation what is interesting to me
about neural imaging or what began to be
interesting to me again back in the 90s
was that it it sort of fell in between
maps and network so that's the very
famous van essen map above for visual
cortex and extra-strength cortex and it
shows that there's a lot of connectivity
but again it's relatively sparse but
there's as much feed four of us feedback
so this is some dynamical system of
general interest which we don't
understand and then there's other sort
of smaller circuits that become
important to characterize as well and
neuroimaging is a nice place now what
you're giving up is you're giving up on
neurons but I got you know I got to say
that to my neuroscientific friends or
neuroscience friends that if you really
want to study you know 50 million
neurons or a hundred million neurons and
try to put a bottom I'm sorry together
this is going to be very tricky to
actually sort of define the dynamics
underlying that yeah this kind of a
probably cellphone question I don't know
anything but so I guess we talk about
these different levels of these
different chunks of the brain that have
that we we sort of talked about as
having functions and so on I presume
some of these sort of anatomically you
can look at and say yes this is a
a real component I presume there's also
other bits that we kind of project some
you know that we don't know for sure
it's like an actual organizational part
of the brain but it's Walker convenience
or is that not true oh well I actually
i'll go through some of that in a minute
when i start talking about the
neuroimaging results which are more sort
of system level measures so what most
neuroscientists do is they measure once
all the time or sometimes 20 and
sometimes neuroscience measure hundred
cells and they get very excited and the
problem is if you look at the covariance
structure that that's actually pretty
tiny when you're talking about hundreds
of millions of naira so although we know
that there are sort of sensory parts of
the brain organized for vision and old
faction dishes and so on the rest of the
cortical structure is not well
understood and the way in which it maps
itself out is even more poorly
understand you'll see that as I go on in
this talk there is actually there is a
lot of real irony it's not just for sex
is that where there's a lot of hierarchy
there's a lot of modularity but there's
also a lot of distributed computation so
the brain has been opportunistic about
the way it constructed the underlying
you know engineering principles if there
are any to to make it or work and that's
that what makes it very difficult to
reverse engineer I think too so I'm
going to talk about sort of two kinds of
images one having to do with anatomy so
that's the Homer on your left and then
the functional MRI which sort of
characterize something about these
functional States which however does
have Benny but the point is is you'd
like to connect up anatomical structure
with functional structure this is the
three-test machine at Newark uh which is
jointly run by our group and group of
radiology TMJ what you do is basically
you put someone prone down in one of
these machines you have a magnet that's
spinning very high speed around their
head it's relatively noisy you have to
sort of control computers one basically
to
play stimulate in a mirror system that
then projects into the visual system of
the subject and then you have a control
system to collect the data and there's
probably somewhere between hundreds of
megabytes do have a gig per volume per
trial so if you collect 30 or 40 trials
or even 100 trials from that subject you
might also have 20 or 30 subjects so the
data collection problem and sort of the
storage and manipulation is all a
nightmare and this is something we
actually to get used to over many years
now fMRI depends on sort of three lucky
aspects it really is a lucky thing and
said Jo magawa who was at Bell Labs who
first noticed this in rats so it
basically opened the top of the rat's
head they were measuring various things
and they'd see this kind of bluish and
very bright reddish response depending
on sort of the atmosphere they were
feeding to the round at that time where
there was oxygen based or carbon dioxide
first off were mostly made up of water
so there's a lot of hydrogen protons
around in our body that can basically be
aligned in the magnetic field so
magnetic susceptibility and tissue ties
back to these hydrogen protons changes
in neural activity produced changes in
local blood flow and oxygen consumption
so when you think about lunch something
happens locally in temporal lobe and
then all of a sudden a bunch of blood
flow comes into that region to basically
do something metabolic to repair and
support the neuron functioning now local
blood cell also disrupts local tissue
magnetic susceptibility so when you're
thinking about lunch this actually
changes something about the local field
and so that allows for localization in
what is relatively a homogeneous field
and so we can pulse and cause some kind
of spin change in the protons and when
they relax at
rates we can localize where was we
thought the task events were occurring
now this is called blood oxygenation
level dependency or bold so that's often
when people call the bold signal and it
is with fMRI we have neural activity
blood oxygenation then goes up and this
in fact is the basis of that from our
signal now this is the actual official
picture of what's happening in terms of
the biophysics the reality is we have no
idea how this happens so from neural
activity to into sort of the various
kinds of ATP cycles and all the
biochemistry there are models of this
there are theories about it but we
actually were the science that we're
doing is sort of based on this slippery
business that neural activity has
something to do with blood phone now let
us about the me very much because I'm
not a neuroscientist and this as a
psychologist it's just another kind of
systematic measure I can use to
understand behavior what comes out the
output we call it to t star weighted
image intensity and this is essentially
the fMRI signal basically being measured
by the magnet and being pulled back out
and we then can analyze it and localize
it more specifically so the hemodynamic
response is the first sort of problem in
this story because we're talking about
blood flow so it's relatively slow now
there's ways of dealing with this I'll
talk about later on in ways you might
want to fuse some fast signal like EG
with fMRI but in general we've got
essentially something that lasts over 18
seconds the task information of the peak
is somewhere around 68 seconds maybe
four seconds so the largest point where
we might like to sort of a phase shift
this back to the task stimulus so if the
stimulus occurs here we might like to
push this back here so that we actually
have most of the signals sitting right
on the stimulus onset and so that's a
lot what people do know we found out my
failure we didn't have to do
that but that's that was the
state-of-the-art back at that time
period here's standard sort of
experimental methods one is the classic
block design where we have some kind of
stimulus event in a set of trials in a
block and then we have a rest period
these can be is again as long buffered
as long as about ten seconds apart
because we basically want the decay to
decay decay back down to zero and then
we hit the subject with another stimulus
and up it goes and so on so forth so if
we have a kernel function that him and I
response that looks like this this
Bionic thing then in fact if we involve
that with the design we basically gets
up like this and we actually see this
kind of patterning in the bold during
the task we can also do an event-related
where in fact we jitter the stimulus a
little bit or the particular trial and
this produces a complex waveform what as
long as we know where the actual
stimulation work we can go back and use
various statistical models to pull that
out so we do that like this we have an
Ephraim I time series up here in the
left hand corner now one of the things
that people do while they're laying down
for more than 15 minutes in a magnet is
they wiggle so you have to do some kind
of motion correction we do some kind of
spatial normalization to a reference as
the standard reference is the telerik
and turn no reference based on some work
done in the 1870s in Paris on a small
French man's brain but it's digitized
and it's very accessible there's other
anatomical references are available but
this is still one of the better ones so
we actually do you know some kind of
warping to get it into this outlet space
so that we can then reference specific
points in the brain back in the telerik
turn of reference we do some smoothing
to clean things up because there's a lot
of noise we fit it with a general linear
model which then produce some parameter
estimates you can see here's a block
designer some data and concerta see it
goes up and down
and the blue curve is our best estimate
from the GLM so it's not terrible and
then we can project this back into a map
we have a statistical parametric map and
that produces that weekend the color
code based on the underlying statistics
we calculated the T values or faa's and
we get some pretty pictures so that's if
you looked at any journals or science or
nature you'd fun essentially pictures
like this and this is how they make them
so in a classic design here's glass
brain and here's finger tapping so a
finger tapping test I'd be laying the
magnet I'd be doing this flopping my
fingers deviously for a while and then
I'd stop and I do it again and I'd stop
and so on you done four or five blocks
you start getting things in terms of
central sulcus and the motor strip which
represents where you expect to see
things if you're tapping your fingers
together and you can see there's the
block design in terms of the contrast
you're basically then contrasting this
signal condition against the background
rest condition because the bolt signal
in this is actually not more than three
or four to five percent okay so it's
extremely hard to see in all this noise
and there's an enormous amount of noise
that you actually have to filter out and
people localized function before this
the video of that comes right basically
in risky operations that were mainly
been at McGill back in the 40s and 50s
where you would look at epilepsy you
have some you'd have some motivation for
opening the skull up and then poking
around okay the other thing our animal
models in terms of the macaque monkey
which is the most common subject we
again you can do single-cell recording
you can put visual stimuli up and see
you know that part of the brain seems to
do this or have the monkey do this with
its arm and you can sort of measure and
see cells fire in various parts of the
motor system and all
so next Australian so you can make
connections between visual system motor
system attentional systems which is in
parietal areas prefrontal systems so
when you're cooking Chinese food or thai
food or whatever your dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex is going to be
involved because it's got a sequence
things when you're writing it for
computer program if I put you an MRI i
will seed or Selassie middle frontal
gyrus going bang bang bang bang bang
because there's just enormous amount of
sort of sequencing structure that's
going on there as well as spatial
imagery and other kinds of things so we
know a lot about that from you know
hundreds or perhaps thousands of
experiments that were done especially
with monkeys and then also in humans but
typically in operations it wasn't until
the 90s or going to actually look at
this stuff now I going to tell you it
really annoyed a lot of the
neuroscientist because people would do
this and they say oh you know I put
stuff in the visual field and say you
know the visual cortex got active and
you're a scientist said yeah so what
like big deal we already knew the visual
cortex so so at that point there had to
be some more information coming out of
this because you know one of these
machines cost for a million dollars you
you're doing horrible things well not
really in terms of FM rice out but in
pet it's horrible you've gotta inject
people of contrast agents so that
there's there's got to be something
other than what we're getting out in
terms of monkeys and it turns out there
there is and I'll show you some of that
and so this is sort of the traditional
state of the art at this point and i'm
going to move then into some newer
methods especially methods using machine
learning and neural networks and so on
oh and some sort of graphical
connectivity theory that's applied to
brain areas as people are doing sort of
online tasks any questions so far so
this should they should allow you to
basically go off and run in our MZ
expand really i'm sure yes is there any
ways to the no in fact in this case fMRI
has been tested even up near five or 60
with humans and you see no problems you
and typically you do 9 Tesla experiments
with rodents and so on and there
can we promised the magnet if you don't
set the parameters I right it can seize
and basically blow up and this is not
good if you have metal chairs in the
room with you and you turn the magnet on
this whole row will move really bad
right run out the other side so many
times subjects these days we'll have
metals and their ears and everywhere and
so basically after you know to
demagnetize them and in order to get
them into the magnet and then there's
artifacts it can occur as well if you're
not careful which is which is which is
more important in terms of the science
at least yeah not good so we're talking
about in fact let me go through that
I've got I've got some slides on that so
here's MRI and here's fMRI so in terms
of fMRI nice segue we have a three
millimeter resolution but it can
actually be better and get it down to
one millimeter and these are voxels so
three dimensional zor image elements MRI
actually can get down to a half
millimeter and so this is showing sort
of you know if you have a brain tumor
and you went to the doctor they would
basically give your number I and look at
it and try to see what was where it
might be in what they can do about it
the fuzzy picture the fMRI in fact we
collect over time let's say in trial
bites of two seconds for like five
minutes or up to an hour and we get one
of these images but for the whole brain
so basically we're taking your whole
brain firing it through dropping it on
the disk and saving it every two seconds
bang bang bang bang bang and so you get
a lot of data this way now here's a
slice terminology this is a sagittal
slice and that we're cutting essentially
down the sagittal side of the head and
we're going to take something like ten
slices and these will produce slices
from the top of the head down to the
bottom
and it basically then gives you all of
the sort of voxel information and the
grey and white and cerebral spinal fluid
information that's in the image an N
tine slice will then be cut into voxels
which in this case is 64 x 64 we often
it probably goes up 225 28 for the
anatomical for most of the bold data
it's 64 x 64 a kind of experiment here
we have the stimulation control so in
terms of what I was talking about in
terms of the GLM what you're what you
get here is that some stimulation and
see there's not a whole lot of
difference when you look at it visually
but when you subtract it all of a sudden
you start picking up stuff in v1 and pre
cuneus maybe and you can see across
individuals there is some similarity but
there's also differences and averaging
can always be useful in the situation
although there's a lot of worry today
that we're missing some of the
individual difference information here
and we have to be a little more careful
about what kind of generalizations you
draw from this the kinds of activation
statistic studies here you would have
say condition 1 which could consist of
maybe 30 or so stimulations condition to
again then we might create a region of
interest specific point that we want to
look for activation in and then we plot
that we see the I wrote I'm cursin the
red condition is a little higher than in
the great condition and then you can you
know sort of throw away all the most
various cremation and put it into a bar
graph and then plotting it back in the
brain we essentially see ya there's
activation here and it seems to be
modulated by these two conditions in
that specific way so that's kind of a
classic study to look at the different
kinds of modulation effects in your
experiment okay so let me switch over
and talk a little bit about
newer stuff but that gives you I think
the fundamentals for if you went to a
science art you'd actually read it you
could probably make sense of in terms of
what sex it doesn't you might not like
it in terms of what exactly their
concluding because there has been a kind
of a focus on sort of one area one
function sort of finding the face area
finding the morality area etc and that's
probably just false i'm going to show
you in fact one of the things
controversies i'm on one side of happens
to be you know whether or not there is a
face area and i basically say there
isn't and then there's a Nancy kanwisher
and other people who say in fact there's
absolutely a face here so let's talk
about that and you probably all think
you do out of a semi makes sense faces
have this kind of sociobiological
relevant you look at them there should
be something in the brain that gets
active the question is is there a
specific area and is it you know sort of
act like a simple module sort of on and
off based on senior face so here's some
stimuli that get used in these kinds of
experiments we have faces and houses and
scissors and serve various natural
objects and categories and what we might
do is then in this kind of block design
is give the subject some faces in the
block measure their activity give them
rest time and give them some scissors
and so on and so forth and these would
be in different orientations different
sizes different kinds and so and so
forth and we counter balances and
randomize it so the subject doesn't
actually know what's coming up now when
you do this in the past there's about
thousand studies by now showing in fact
if you take this is the back of the
brain and so we're kind of looking up
underneath it and we've got the two
hemispheres and they're taking one of
the hemispheres and I've turned it up
like this on its side so that's that
point where it's an underneath there
more medial towards the the middle of
the brain is the parahippocampal place
areas is called but out towards the side
of the head sort of
back through here it's called the
fusiform face area or the FFA and this
area is supposed to respond almost
exclusively the faces and nothing else
now it does respond to headless bodies
it responds upside down heads but in
general if you look at chairs and houses
and coffee cups and so on it responds
about three times less in most task then
it does two upright places in some sort
of angle and so that FFA area is very
controversial but can assure has made a
strong case that there is such a place
now in 2001 there was some work done by
Jim hacks be looked at this in a
slightly more complicated way you want
to understand if they're sort of
patterns of activity that might
characterize this as opposed to specific
local modular area so he had a what's
called an N back test it's just a
category vigilance test so you get a
stream of stimulii and you basically
have to say is the one that I'm looking
at now the same as the one I looked at
two steps before or three or whatever
now if you do this again on a block
design you get this kind of result now
this is at the bottom of the brain so
this is a slices right about here right
in your middle of your ears coming
straight back and it's showing in even
runs and odd runs in the block that if
you show a face that top picture there
it essentially if you look at the
patterns can you see in fact the
patterns in the even runs in terms of
the averaging this is like a one nearest
neighbor classifier if you will the way
you did it you would you basically have
the very similar patterns but across
faces the houses in fact the patterns
there's more of the yellow on the right
hand side less of the blue and so on and
so forth same thing with chairs and
choose so it seemed to be sort of
positive correlations across even
oddments for the same stimulus but
either no correlation were small
negative correlations across these
stimulating
and if you looked at a bar graph you'd
see in fact that the stimulus associated
with even and odd rent was in fact the
best predictor of that particular
condition and even when you removed he
removed the maximally responsive voxels
not just the ones that Nancy kanwisher
would say we're like in the middle of a
fusiform area which is a particular area
in the fusiform gyrus which runs around
the back of the head he removes those
and still the orange was still response
so whatever's going on there was
relatively distributed and led people to
start questioning the idea whether or
not we could actually understand these
brain functions in the sort of
one-to-one anatomical functional amount
we did some work with some simple neural
networks where we took something like
1500 voxels and some number of hidden
units did some conjugate gradient and
sort of fit this thing did n minus 1
bootstrap sampling on it so that sort of
introduced new technology where people
were doing these sort of simple linear
models and they really weren't doing
cross validation that you really had no
idea what in fact they had when you do
this you actually get a fairly good
prediction scheme so this is about
something like eighty-two percent over
the whole set bottle and scissors are
curved the worst case but if you look
back at the original headaches beast in
you they were sort of little tiny
scissors and the bottles are all kind of
fuzzy so it's not surprising that in
fact you didn't get sort of the kind of
visual response that you expected the
in-sample classification was one hundred
percent correct of course now what we
can do is actually query the classifier
and basically do a perturbation test and
ask which particular vox's which
particular features in the input layer
were contribute to different classes so
what we would do is just run noise back
through the network and whenever we saw
a particular error that was above some
threshold we plot it if it wasn't above
that treasure we threw the box away so
what this gave us was a sensitivity map
in the classifier space that
then tell us well is there a specific
category mapping for face how Scissors
shoot that's distinct across IT well
it's about eighty-five percent overlap
so in fact this suggested it was more of
a calm Natori coat sort of like playing
a piano chord ok and then modulating
that and you can face her say say say
say say say sort house on sales or
scissors so that the category sort of
information was coded in some unknown
feature away but still coated as some
features this is the apology of nothing
of the sea you'll recognize faces paid
to be frozen agnosia right then right I
mean that that doesn't matter that would
seem yeah there's all kinds of problems
with those kinds of studies and actually
it's a review of them the show that some
prosopagnosia juicy faces some dough
it's kind of but if you look that the
key thing here is if you look a 19 you
look at the lesion space leasing space
covers most of those dots in other words
you know the kind of problem that you
would have if you weren't a
developmental prose effect music but you
had some kind of damage in temporal lobe
that actually that those lesions are
opportunistic they're all over the
temporal lobe so that doesn't really
prove that there's some specific
location and these people have other
kinds of deficits to really if you start
looking more carefully it's not just
faith no no actually I was on the very
early NIH TMS options panel and the
transcranial magnetic stimulation
basically is essentially a method where
you stand a magnetic pulse end of the
brain and you sort of D synchronized
neurons in some sense the idea is your
deactivating but in fact the reality is
you're saying a cone on sort of magnetic
stimulation it's all over the rain if
you look at these people when they if
you've ever seen such that basically
just bang here's her which led me to ask
the question at the end of this what
would you research be any different if
you just took a baseball bat to hit them
on the head in the same place and I
didn't get a good answer from that so
TMS is not really going to work here
there's people like cause them and
others who claim a desk but it's sort of
dying this work also louise pessoa has
done some SVM support vector machine
work with this and here's a really cute
example we're at 60 milliseconds to
showing blank in a fixation fixation and
the 60 mill assess your full face and
then a neutral face and all and then
this is alternating with neutral neutral
and for your face and they're coming
randomly well it turns out if you take a
classifier you can actually look at the
fMRI activity alone over a number of
regions of interest in the more you have
the better you do and you get a very
sharp hit curb having dinner with the
probably reporting fear but the
interesting thing about this is you can
predict before they say or push the
button that they thought the fear face
just from looking at the temple oh so
you can actually see the part of the
brain that's coating for this before
they respond so you can just read that
out is it and this is 60 milliseconds so
given what I said earlier you should go
light whether it's something wrong here
because you said it was like six seconds
right and in fact the temporal
resolution of fri is a little tricky we
don't actually understand what the
temporal resolution is either and let's
cause the number of us to try to do a
task to combine various kinds of fast
measures like EG with that from right
which i'll talk about next so am i still
good okay so a Rainier activity we're
going to look at interacting bright
sides and you arguably if you think of
any cognitive function if you're
multiplying two numbers together if
you're writing a C++ program whatever it
is there's a bunch of areas of the brain
that are interacting and what we'd like
to understand is that network is that
sort of circus structure not just one
particular area of the brain with some
function in fact it might be that these
areas of the brain circuitry used in
different kinds of functions where
you're doing different things this is
one of the early pieces
actually it was done in 2004 so this is
a very recent stuff and this is in
science it was by yuri husan and Rafi
malik at the Weizmann Institute there is
a postdoc at NYU right now and what you
do is here they gave the two subjects
the movie to watch so this was the good
the bad the ugly and they watched it for
30 minutes and then they simply recorded
all of the fmri while they were watching
this movie together and then took the
time series from each voxel so roughly
in grey matter in a flattened cortical
map we have some of their 20,000 foxes
here taking 20,000 time series and point
by point correlating between the two
subjects while they're watching the same
film what do you get well something that
was really shocking in the beginning but
now you think about is not to showering
now what this is by the way this is what
we call the football brain so you've
taken the brain and you've kind of
inflated it in certain parts and then
you cut down central sulcus and a couple
other places you flatten so the back of
the head and visual cortex is right back
here temporal cortex which are showing a
minute ago was up here prefrontal the
front of the heads up here well what you
found is this a high correlation in
visual areas and in areas that seem to
have to do with motion detection the STS
object recognition in terms of faces and
hands and other objects that were very
active and then there was all this dead
man's land all this stuff that didn't
seem to be correlated with anything it
seems to have some kind of intermediate
processing starts going on here so this
is really an anatomical statement that
visual areas are highly connected either
correlated and they connect out to
various prefrontal areas and various
parietal areas and so there is some kind
of circuit here that even across two
subjects you can sort of see it emerged
in the anatomical underlying structure
so we want to take advantage of this and
so we're going to where we start to look
at movies as well here we have in fact
what we call sort of event comprehension
studies and here we in this case we take
a scripted video that we can
struct let me show you an example one
and in this case what you'll see is
someone sitting in a restaurant and
they're reading the paper and it looks
like they're basically doing the same
thing at sublight we asked people to
press a button when they think there's a
vent change that's basically that's all
we add to this and when the waitress
appears she puts the paper away people
think this is an event change and you
can think of this in terms of a parsing
of the video in two different video
elements at change points that people
think are relevant to Conan or
comprehending that video structure now
we have a number of these so i'm going
to show you at all but i'll show you
something here's a typical cases of one
of my graduate students putting together
a chair that was delivered in a package
a postdoc that was who made coffee every
day and we filmed in making coffee but
these were fixed sequence so Donovan is
a dozen you know we would know
authorizing okay pick up the coffee pot
one second then we would title this and
this would give us sort of an exact
sense of where in fact subject we're
breaking this information up and you get
sort of reliable kinds of results
another kind of example is we call the
house sequence in here you basically
have a circle that begins randomly
moving to this space that's all it's
doing but it basically people look at
this and people hate to look at things
and not have stories about them so they
make up stars it well the ball is
looking for something yeah now if you
put a triangle in there and have the
triangle move around with the ball luma
they'll say all the balls chasing the
triangle you know they did some sexual
harassment think something they'll make
up something specifically about this
story here and then we have an oddball
task where we simply have a bar that
jitters up and down and at some point it
will jitter about three
standard deviations beyond what is
normally chittering so there's a small
standard deviation Algeria and the pvn
they subjects simply to push the button
at that jitter point unbeknownst to them
we've arranged these jitter points to be
at the same point they were pressing the
button in another video sequence so we
control for the button pressing we
control for the perceptual bottom-up
kind of analysis that they're doing what
you find is something quite remarkable
when people do this it basically we call
these temporal response densities
they're essentially probability
distributions over time showing so for a
particular tape this is the study tape
where a student comes in opens a book
and studies for a while you see this at
point o 1 probability in this
distribution centers are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
and these are essentially 20 or 25
subjects that are pressing the button
and we simply accumulate that frequency
at the particular time second to
indicate where in fact that point was
you can go back and show subject disease
out of say twenty films they've seen and
if they see that particular index point
of a particular change point that's the
most memorable or memory caring part of
the sequence same thing in the house
tape there's a bit more maybe 10 or 12
of these now what we found though which
is sort of annoying is there's people
who parse things very fast and people
who parsing is very slow and this can
cause loss is caused a lot of trouble if
you marry and then you take a road trip
together and you sort of missed the
corner and so the fact is is that the
difference in this differential parsing
will in fact produce different memory
encoding to of what you remember about
that particular sequence so when you
look at that in terms of the data you
see in fact there's a huge rate
difference from people who are pushing
the button at a very slow rate thick
okay they're paying they're paying for a
ticket at a movie theater he takes out
his wallet picks up the ticket leave
someone else's he moves his hand towards
his wallet ebooks is what
well out of his pocket he listened opens
up as well he moves some money on soon
and then we put the way he picks like
the diggity Lexus the decay busted again
so they did the bit that they're picking
out all this detail that seeks people
appear so they'll have something like
somewhere between 40 to 80 events in
these sequences instead of say four or
five now here's the interesting thing if
you take the two videos or any set of
videos and you simply take that person's
parsing rate and you plot it against
their parsing rate on the other video
it's about point 86 curl it what happens
is we all have these natural parsing
rights and we maintain them in order to
sort of construct whatever memory
sequence is sort of most compatible with
the information we've already collected
this is expectation driven okay as
opposed to say that oddball task okay so
let's talk about how we can model this
in terms of rain activity we essentially
have a lot of cognition that trots
itself out a perception memory sequence
grammar and so on but we're going to be
interested in some kind of interactive
distributed Processing's time dynamic
structure we know that have some kind of
neural network Circuit in this case what
we're going to try to do is we're going
to connect together EG and fMRI for
real-time measure EG measures you may
not know are not spatially very good or
spatially ill-posed so you don't get a
unique solution when you try to find a
location but they're extremely fast or
like millisecond level so you can see
events at each millisecond FM liza order
of seconds as i said but you get down a
millimeter even though this may be a
million neurons it's still relatively
small so what we did is we during that
restaurant task we measured EG and fMRI
together and this in fact is a sequence
of fri and EG activities you don't
really have to see the details here but
what's happening is that where
coordination between frontal and visual
cortical activity and in the EEG we see
a huge sort of negative deflection over
the whole brain as the event change
occurred so we begin to think about this
once we looked at a couple hundreds of
these sequences that we could possibly
fuse these teeth to together and use a
result information to create some kind
of dynamic model so that's what we did
this is a fusion model that my graduate
student yard how chenko basically came
up we're doing we're doing forward
modeling of EEG and the fMRI the simple
story here is that tent EEG doesn't have
much spatial information we actually
construct a spatial filter for it since
fMRI doesn't have much temporal
information we use the human dynamic
response for a temporal information and
then we couple the equations together
and then generate a cost function and
solve this using a gradient method and
we regularize it we're basically
reconstructing the signals we wrote a
book chapter on this actually reviewed
all these fusion medicines that can give
you that later if you're interested in
the details here's what it looks like
when you fuse the material together so
now we're looking at two seconds before
the event change you'll see the event
change right there so now unlike the
fMRI niji this is actually spatially
accurate information within a millimeter
occurring over milliseconds and so this
actually gives you a chance to model
something about the underlying time
series in a way to create some kind of
dynamical graph you could think of
Bayesian networks or whatever your
favorite structural equation model a and
so on what we do is this
these get a little dense I apologize but
uh what we're going to do then however
you localize this activity we're
generating brain activity at different
points we pull out the time series
information we do filtering and
reconstruction so now every roi
basically has a time series associated
with it we construct a covariance
measure of all of the time series down
here and then we actually calculate all
the possible graphs there are 3 raised
to the n times n minus 1 over 2 of them
so it gets very large for five nodes or
60,000 graphs for seven it goes up to
Milla 14 million or something so this
right is very fast we then score these
graphs and we keep the top 1% in a
goodness-of-fit measure like a Kiki and
then we construct a graph and so for the
film's I was just showing we did that
for all the graphs and here's what they
look like here's the oddball task which
actually has a cingulate which is known
for sort of novelty detection sdg or sts
which is a motion detection IPL inferior
parietal lobule which is associated with
spatial imagery and spatial functioning
and medial frontal gyrus which is an
executive control function when you look
at this with the ambiguous story where
you have the little ball moving around
in the room and so on again you still
get cingulate you said you get a little
bit more we're now getting medial
frontal gyrus or Broca's area which is
also noted for sequential kinds of
analysis and finally in the familiar
story we get all of the same areas but
you can see there's a rewording of their
underlying structure so I don't have
time to go into all the detail but if
you look here cingulate as you go to the
familiar story disappears why because
cingulate is actually used for novelty
detection so if you really don't know
what's going on cingulate is basically
going to drive a lot of aha oh what's it
what's that oh I gotta follow that track
those and so on but you'll notice that
it disappears down here in the familiar
story and sequence response selection
begins to appear to be ambiguous door
move in their story again very important
for source structurally understanding
the story elements of putting them
together in a comprehensible form so in
summary what I've been trying to tell
you today is a sort of about how brain
imaging is involving and that really
these hypotheses should be more about
these underlying networks and not
specific regions of interest or areas
there's we think like a software reason
reusability concept in that these areas
STS or medial frontal gyrus or so on are
basically being recruited for that task
at that time and as a new test comes up
they don't disappear they simply sort of
automatically rewire and produce some
other function that's opportunistic for
that particular task the subject is
doing and in effect we think the
dynamics of cognition can be found the
dynamics of the brain the mind is the
brain like Descartes so let me just
mention some of the people or involved
in this and some of our project JB
Pauline is actually at the orsay lab in
France we're doing a direct perlmutter
who's a machine learning that guy who
did some of the first independent
components analysis that the Hamilton
the Institute of Dublin Kathryn Hansen
who did a lot of the event perception
where the face perception work with Jim
hack see we have a paper coming out
neural comp in a month that basically
shows using support vector methods and
recursive feature eliminations I've
there you know really is at the face
area and we also have a large Autism
Center we're actually looking at using
these various methods to actually
understand something about special
populations where in fact you have
various kinds of attentional deficits
but it more complicated sort of wiring
issues in terms of autism schizophrenia
for example and that's it thanks for
your attention and
happy to take any more questions or or
thought so thanks yeah look I find these
would submit it's too simple Brian's to
primate or relation crustaceans the
problem well one of the interesting
things there that strikes one when we're
thinking about these brain circuits it's
the same thing at people were thinking
about 10 years ago when we were finding
areas of the brain was that you could do
some kind of sort of genetic mapping to
brain function and this is important
especially in terms of disease kinds of
analysis and sort of connecting
particular part of the genetic code back
up to what it is it's actually under the
root of what is autism one thing or is
it a hundred things and so what sort of
genetic connections are knockout mice
and brain imaging kind of activity are
used in these context but my interests
are mainly ins our cognitive function
and although mice are smart they don't
have a lot of cognitive function and the
kinds of measurements one can make there
are still relatively limited in terms of
the kind of task class conditioning
another service simple associated
learning tasks and so I and say you know
maybe very early on but we're scaling up
to human kinds of phenomena and the
thing is is the areas of the brain that
I'm showing you their very familiar they
come out almost on any kind of task it's
almost like some kind of infrastructure
that's sitting there and they organized
in various ways in different ways when
the subject is doing working memory task
or problem solving tasks or learning a
language etc but they're the same areas
and so we know that we've got some kind
of constituent structure you know some
functions that we can actually put
together in some way
might make some larger sense so that
there I think there is a large amount of
progress here and I where it should
start first bearing fruit is in a lot of
the disease kinds of context which are
sort of the most devastating things that
were you know we're just very curious
sure for for genetics or brain well
there's there's older work that has to
do with what was called split brain
studies where in fact you've had some
sort of epileptic seizure kinds of cut
and one of the things about the
epileptic seizure is that it works off
some sympathetic dynamics so some
activity starts over here there's some
bilateral activity and then they begin
to produce some saturation and WaPo
everything tears well what they found is
it could take the brain is lateralized
symmetrically so you can basically take
at the corpus callosum and you can cut a
small fibers channel and this doesn't
sound like some of your fortitude
general but if you do do it it actually
stops epileptic seizures and because the
the seizure structure can be somewhat
random in its geometry it's very hard to
do this without so it but it does get
lateralized and that's the part that
produces like ninety-five percent of
seeders so for someone who wants a cure
that was something they did back in the
70s and still do it produces some funny
kinds of perceptual phenomena in the
subject and they often get a sense that
their left side of their body is doing
things they have no control over like
taking their time off and putting it on
the table or something
put it back on it takes a better things
like it so there's these kind of very
weird sort of functional separations but
most kinds of seizure stuff is the
dynamics of those is it's very very
tricky and not under control you could
do some kind of the transcranial brain
stimulation in this case could probably
help but mainly because it would produce
a kind of a disruption of the basic
activities but you know did the
synchronization would be wiped out
implants is another way of doing that's
another way of sort of creating some
kind of disruption but again if that
would be less effective because you'd
actually have to predict where these
implants would be I should use constant
monitoring it's also very busy yeah you
don't want to really have some sort of
electrical stimulation that
automatically takes off whatever it
feels like it might actually cause
seizures yeah yes that's it and I I
think they're irritating work right now
grass and this is why I bring up a lot
of this no I'd write a workshop meeting
so little workshop determine peers or so
where I try to bring together various
kinds of machine learning you're great
where this connectivity because there's
a lot of fun knows if you can just take
like fun take just lots of my scripts
other way do nothing else
the correlation this is just gold really
which you know I just I probably talked
about five percent there's a growth
industry here five years some of us will
get played on you but a lot of it
especially a trends of it is it's going
to be very important in 400 people start
talking ranter certain that aired it
should buy you a particle whole parietal
circuitry neo has to do with attention
switch that will be that's often where
science change yeah Nick like the
present Robin a model-driven drum unit
for the risk of calling the same
entrapment people do when they fight
boxing pero diagrams proposed the
sparsity that doesn't actually exist
like you're absolutely right and and I
cactuses those are the first word the
morning Chris didn't insert dynamical
system that actually model this alert
over time we got a project part we go
ahead of business under looking very
amazing memories one of the issues is
how you sort of control the acid product
or so every year you're exactly right
this stuff our peers in fact we're
seeing so many compensable uses and
celebrate you have a muddle it lyrics
what happens if you have a whole bunch
of areas in the comments so there has to
be some principle signature to this
oddly and you better get the Essex
County extremely for you
but that's okay it's still it's still
early and you're still a lot of good
people on there that yeah but you're our
models are really just snapshots and we
want to think of these little data
structures that you know sort of show to
me okay this is a data structure and
this property that woman and what did
you get in your study and so this allows
us to I think share the information at a
more relevant level of Investigation but
it is a worry I assume that the computer
scientists can deal with the computation
so how long would you estimate a little
tight your size an accurate map model of
a brine well the good news the good news
is the brain imaging data is being
accumulated online and will in fact be
available to you know almost anyone the
public domain especially people who have
computational savvy if you look at human
brain mapping as a conference which
structure really started out as more
mythological biophysicists and
mathematicians and computer center and
then expanded out to cog neuro science
now sort of overrun with a lot of people
who are admittedly doing silly things
you know let's look at people gambling
and so you know it so so essentially you
can use almost any person ison and
you'll get back nonsense me I which
decided to do a study to try to cover
this I call of the peanut butter and
jelly steady but we did part of this
where you took picture live under
sandwiches then you took pictures of
peanut butter and jelly signs but
different ways like Norman Rockwell fun
black and white images it and then you
get the two contrast conditions to
subtract them clearly you're going to
get the gel year and in fact I know
where that is it's in temporal moment
but this is absurd that mean in fact
there's something about the level of
references is wrong and you need to get
that clear it's some constituent level
like in terms of these brain areas and
the way they were organized to solve
certain fundamental task the fundamental
task we chose even work had to do a sort
of these natural image sequence parsing
because this is what we do everyday it's
it's sort of it's sort of more
ecologically valid as some sort of more
natural context or did that answer about
the ticket kinda y on the foreseeable
future it's just it may be it may be in
200 years time maybe not well I you know
yes progress is slower but the these
devices have actually only been
effectively used probably in the past
eight years and so I mean relatively
speaking we have we do we do have a
little more leash on the whole system
but I I do think the methods are you
know can give use of remarkable data
about certain kinds of processes that
you couldn't imagine
