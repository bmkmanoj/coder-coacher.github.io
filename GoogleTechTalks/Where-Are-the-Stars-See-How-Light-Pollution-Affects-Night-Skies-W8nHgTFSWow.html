start with a small story about how I got
into astronomy and a subscriber fee back
when I was in school in tenth grade
there's this chapter about the universe
and in physics
it went into the details of the Big Bang
Theory the Milky Way galaxy
the size of the universe finance stars
and nebulae and galaxies so I was really
really excited about that the class was
really looking forward to it but the
school that I went to they thought it
wasn't important it was really
theoretical it wasn't important for a
salon and asked us to sell plot in an
overly disappointed in one of the
classes I asked a question that if we
had inside the Milky Way galaxy how do
we really know its its shape they told
us it was so it was so spherical sorry
huh
yeah how do we yeah listening how do we
really know is the no it's vital yeah
that's the were looking for how do we
know it really know its shape so I was
actually - that I was disturbing the
class and and it wasn't important when
asked me to stop asking questions it was
really delicious appointed then in 2009
I was watching this this documentary on
National Geographic Channel about the
relative spice and spirits things in the
in the in the universe and it was really
fascinating to see how fast and how big
various things are we're in the gain was
relative to to do what we see in our
daily daily life stuff I was I was in
fact detected after watching that video
because I I really wish I'd gotten into
astronomy much earlier in my life ah I I
wish that I had somehow had a career in
and astronomy somehow even studied our
goes we went to school to study
astrophysics
then in 2011 I had to move to California
then two of my friends and I went up to
Yosemite National Park and when he
stepped outside the cabin we were
staying at an entire village
we saw skies of starza and I we couldn't
be couldn't believe what we were seeing
because under the point in our lives
which never seen so many stars in life
it was so packed the sky was so packed
with stars it was really really hard to
believe or words we couldn't comprehend
what it was in early symbols we're
looking at it almost felt unreal then I
got back home I started looking into
learning about what's like pollution and
how it affects the night skies and then
then I read that Mount Shasta is
actually one of the best places in all
of California to even see the Milky Way
so my friend had a had an entry-level
DSLR that we decided to take up to take
up to Mount Shasta and try and take a
picture of the Milky Way our salsa and
the first time you you see the you see
the sky so stars or the milk you for
yourself it's such a such an amazing
Phyllis it's very hard to put that into
words very hard you gotta you gotta see
this for yourself
and the moments when we thought this is
mostly in our DSLR screen I felt a
connection like I cannot really explain
how I felt I felt I felt the connection
on to the point I'd seen so many so many
pictures of the Milky Way on the
internet but but I couldn't connect but
that I I didn't know it was real because
I didn't I couldn't feel feel the juice
which was it but when the moment that I
the race took the saw the photo for
myself I had taken it so I knew that it
was it was real so that's how I got into
astronomy and astrophysics II and I've
been taking photos of the night skies
for the last two years and last year I
made a last year I made a short film on
like pollution and some Googlers wanted
to learn more about it so here are
giving attack so thanks thanks for
attending I want to share some of my
some of my most favorite uh
photos that I've taken over the last two
years this was in Yosemite National Park
up in the Tioga Pass Road in in Yosemite
this was in Mount Shasta still apply one
of my favorite images this was in fact
my first shot are still the night sky
mmm monsters too
for my most favorite places for the for
the night skies this was in Eureka dunes
in and then Death Valley and this is in
a very remote corner in Death Valley the
impact the darkest of all places and in
all California this was in non-europeans
- my wife and I had camped there a such
a such an ethereal experience because of
the be we had we hadn't seen any other
human for near 50 miles
he was only people there it almost felt
like camping our different different
planet it was such an amazing amazing
experience so why should we really get
why should we care about astronomy we
should be care about care about the
night skies the tonight case the mind is
the population is universe the givers
gives us identity it makes us feel a
connection it gives us a perspective for
me the thought of the sheer size of the
universe our or the possibility of life
forms elsewhere in this universe er
keeps me keeps me grounded
teach me keeps me humble one of my
favorite things to do is to is to look
at Europa one of our Jupiter's four
moons not sorry one of the food one of
Jupiter's moons through my telescope and
and wonder about there's a possibility
of life-forms so the kind of life on
stage would hover beneath the thick
layer of ice when I was when I was
younger my room with my mother told me a
story about an Indian King Randor and
then one of his ministers called up
brandy ball upwards the King placed a
very long stick and promised the price
to to anyone that made the stick smaller
which was actually touching it so then
everyone paid the seemingly impossible
that the big officer the Bhatia Minister
placed an even longer stick next to it
and made the long stick look small
the universe gives us this perspective
it and without this perspective I think
these days were becoming more more
centered more more than a statistic
especially in this industry in this day
and age the astronomy astronomy arouses
this
sense of sense of art if you imagine
looking at the sky so started it makes
you feel so tiny it makes it feel deep
it's a humble this this this all least
leaves the feeling of all these to a
sense of small self it makes you more
kind makes it carrying next it makes you
humble makes you makes it feel generous
imagine keeps growing a passionate about
passionate about astronomy looking at
images from from the Hubble or the on
the internet dismantle thought are also
same same feeling of filling up our
think of all the great mindset of gazed
about the night skies astronomy has
inspired countless people in our history
from artist to voice to duty to musician
to scientist stuff I think he's lost the
potential of thousands of great minds
they Quentin based literally robbing
kids of finding the passion passion for
for ishani a Charlie makes you ask
questions it makes you learn science I'm
a good example myself I wasn't really
interested in fine sun's light for my
passion for astronomy it made me ask
question cycle why is the sky turn
orange or during dawn and making me
learn more about licenses why are most
celestial objects or spherical making a
lot more about them more about physics
and force astronomy is a humbling and
character-building experience like Carl
Sagan La Coste can put seta it reminds
us of who we are and I think we thought
without this perspective it only
increases the difference between us as
humans but most people lack this
connection most people have never seen a
sky full of for the full of stars so
this was the first photos that my friend
mine took when we would have been up in
our Mount Shasta when I showed this to
my dad the first question I had was how
could there be so many stars and every
time I show them a photo of my sky and
this is the question he asks how could
there be so many so many so many stars
so most people most people don't know
the peacefully start exist and worse yet
some don't even believe that these funny
babies funny stars exist is a famous
story about people calling
during the do during the los angeles
microsoft angeles the earthquake up
there was a code and people were seeing
the Milky Way galaxy for the first time
in their life and they call my nan run
about strange clouds hovering and there
ended in the sky this is common
misconception that that you need fancy a
trip and some sort of fancy equipment
are secured to even look at the skies to
even to look at the sky full of full of
stars and I show this to my mom the
first time she asked if I if I had taken
this photo to my telescope look the
problem is which is we lacked this
connection we've never seen so many
stars in our life and and then we cannot
we cannot we cannot comprehend where it
is so it the people people cannot relate
which people cannot believe that this is
a this is a true mainly in some children
and factions will never see the milky or
20 they are sky full of stars in it and
they're Liza even even Googlers when I
when I show my photos to to Google as to
the first question they have it's real
can you really see these phony
additional charge you'd be surprised
I want to tell you a small story about
the time when my wife and I made it up
to actually done made it to Eureka dunes
in Death Valley my voice Priya she
accompanies me on almost all my shoot
thank you but she's really interested in
astronomy Jesus does it for me when we
an event it was when to Eureka dunes
that we had been travelling straight for
for nine hours straight
when we made it to the furnace creek it
was hot it was carting hot it was 125
120 was 50 degree Celsius sizing around
120 Fahrenheit whose car Ching scorching
heat then we had to travel another two
and a half hours through backcountry
dirt roads to get to the campground once
we got to the trap card it was still hot
it was at around 3,000 feet elevations
wasn't that hard but was still around
hundred hundred five and when we gotta I
was so so bindis at that and blew all
fans from the dunes are blue all over it
was very hard to say
and I was feeling really guilty for
making my wife go to this it was such an
unpleasant uh unfitted experience of her
her he went to sleep before nightfall
don't really know he blame her but she
woke up in the middle of the night to
use the restroom and when she when she
got back she stood that she stood that
for a few minutes for the first time
until this point the best I could do was
make her stand outside for a few seconds
look up at the night sky lit up I really
tried but there that night she stood
there so the kid used to give you some
perspective it's it's the level one like
policing it doesn't get darker than that
she stood there looking at the night sky
for four minutes I was amazed I i won I
wonder the McNary taking there and it
was it was true so dark it was so bright
from the Starlight was so bright that
picture for your own shadows it's
extremely hard to believe that but if
you if you ever make it up to a level
one light pollution you will see for
yourself now she wants to go back to
your cadence she wants to do to have the
experience again a level one light
pollution area now 80 tinkles think of
the differences should make in the lives
of children that could find this passion
in astronomy it would make much much
better world over the over the years it
is it is fiercer quite siren me that did
not care enough about astronomy are the
view of the stars are so I made this
video loss and light up to express this
feeling and somehow encourage people to
people to pursue Shani
so I want to play this video now I think
most of you have seen all this in the
video but I want to get this video right
on the screen actually makes it appear
much brighter than what it is
one thing that I realized after making
this making this so first of all yeah
the Chaplin was a huge success he was
seen all over the world it occurred
publish of the National Jarvik it made
the news in more than 40 different
countries definitely did not expect this
kind of kind of response but one thing
that I realized after making this short
film was that people were able to later
to the difference between the levels but
not able to relate to the to the milky
way at all because most people have
never seen in the milky way is the other
problem is that the camera sees way more
colors then then our eyes do and center
of the Milky Way's is extremely colorful
so some photographers actually take it a
few levels up and and and make their
photos look more appealing the problem
is that it makes it more art than then
reality it only distances people further
away from from reality and it doesn't
really help help the cost of getting
people to perceive it be is connect to
astronomy through through through
photography I'll show you a few examples
to to tell you what we mean double
just like visa this is miss Whitten that
doesn't look like the sir
or like this whereas the Milky Way is is
part of it it's a very nice photo but it
definitely helped help people be being
able to connect uh to the to the night
skies and I'm guilty of this mistake a
mistake myself ah this was my second
second photo photo of the night sky I
should be screen makes it look even
worse the second photo of the night
because I took in Bank and in the it
definitely does not represent definite
does not represent that took true colors
of the night spirits it looks pink it
but but it got it got exact mousse
appeal of it it got it got the most
comments from Googlers which it's got in
fact you're going to print it up in one
of the wall things Google sunny girls
building so I regard it got published on
CNN for one up there like police not
because it feels terrible I feel
terrible for having having a done the
serve for myself looking back I had no
idea
looking back the problem is that a lot
of put on of this don't know the real
color can we do it then yes I did yeah
so much but understand never seen
anything we don't know the true colors
of the colors of the night sky so at
that point point I decided so at that
point I decided that that I'm only going
to take photos of the night sky a few
months ago I decided I'm only going to
take photos of the night sky to to get
people involved in astronomy never take
a photo of the night sky to to make it
look good to make it make it look
appealing in fact in fact a lot of
photographers today so the center of the
Milky Way is only open during the summer
month so a lot of photographers only
only take photos of the day so obsessed
with the Milky Way that they take only
photos of the night sky in the summer
this project they forget the the winter
night skies the Orion constellation is
the king look the winter night skies of
the RNA it is a great theater it's a
great thing to do to to help explain
light pollution when I was living in Los
Angeles so then I took my friends up to
to Death Valley there this is Joshua
Tree I usually ask them to take a look
at the Orion constellation
visible in the most like beautiful
cities like la take a look at our
encapsulation when they're in LA and
then and then look at the look at our
incarceration when they get to when to
get to the dark side there are so many
stars around around RN and in the dark
side that it's even hard too hard to
draw their draw the constellation so so
I thought I thought maybe I should make
another short film to show it's similar
to the previous one but show the Orion
constellation instead of the Milky a for
two reasons I was hoping for two reasons
one people will be able to relate to the
to the Rin Bharata and the Milky Way
because most people have see me or at
least people have looked up the sky has
obtained the rain but not the milky way
the other thing is the the difference
between what the camera sees and what
Ric is not so big for the array n
comparative to the center of the Milky
Way so I actually went ahead and I made
another sharp tone I I only finished
making it last week
so so far my only my wife and I have
seen this so I haven't uploaded on the
internet I start up for the people that
make up make out the text here I help
America
thank you
so if you've noticed I've dedicated both
my videos to my wife I wouldn't be able
to do here almost any of these services
are supported motivations of Thank You
Freya I'm gonna go into a little bit
about the making of movie also easily do
hold more planning than than anything
else I I planned planned so much I spend
more time planning than anything or such
I planned so much that I know back to
parts picard on the day of the shoot
back to park the car I've got to put the
tripod what frame I need I'm more
planning than anything else in fact it's
been it's been enough question that when
I came over here I looked google
satellite you to see which which part me
and sister shall I take to get to get to
get to shortest you do to the to this
room is it the one of the important
things in tanning is finding locations
to shoot and the first thing about that
is to find the light pollution at any
given location
I used to decide call darkside wander
calm to do it gives the light looks like
pollution for any given location they
use satellite images to do to estimate
the light pollution for any given
location if you look at the East Coast
this is a form is really really bad and
the viscose not so bad but it's it's
it's getting worse in part when I when I
went to Mount Shasta this year compared
to my previous just two years ago is
this only gun was early all the gun was
and in Europe the problem is really bad
in part this video the first video lost
invited it got most because the most
attention in Europe so use this site to
to come up with the locations then I use
some Google Maps Google Street view
images on Google Maps or Google Images
to to to extend the
of finding a digital frame on that you
need I usually look for something
interesting to put in the put in the
program and by the way there is the
foreground in the video it definitely
does not look that fright it
it's the screen that is making it
ridiculously right and we most people
actually think that a lot of people
think that you need a fancy equipment to
do shoot the night skies not really
actually if you plan really well if you
practice how the patience and definitely
the passion it's not so much about the
gear but having said that you still meet
decent enough gear - if you want to make
up if you want to make really sharp
crisp photos I have canon 60
I think nothing too fancy nothing too
expensive Afghan and sixty and a pair of
rocking on analysis and in terms of
shoot I usually look at the pace before
during the day to do - to see if there
any surprises
then I once I set up the time-lapse in
the night I in fact plan so much that
that I spend the time with my wife in
the car and we usually watch the movie
so it's not it's not painful at all so
if you if you plan it really well it's
not a difficulty in terms of
post-processing I used I use Adobe
Lightroom for this for the images and
and Adobe Premiere Pro for putting on
the images together to make the video
now on to light pollution itself what is
this light pollution really light
pollution is is any artificial light
that goes where it's not supposed to go
as a simple accident and I want to make
one thing very clear that when I say
light pollution
it doesn't mean turn off all your life
so it doesn't mean mean it doesn't mean
switch all your lights up it only means
any light that goes where it's not
intended to any light that that goes for
gays now we know this light pollution
affects my skies voice this is a slight
pollution bag the International dark-sky
Association is a nonprofit organization
that helps fight light pollution and
educate people and policymakers on the
effects of light pollution and help them
by trade pollution up they estimate that
the thirty thirty five percent of light
is actually wasted
and unshielded of improper lighting
light that goes away that's equivalent
to about three emissions from three
million passenger cars and account to
about three billion dollars three
billion dollars are wasted every eight
year light pollution also affects a
human sir yeah in less than 100 years
ppb we drastically alter our nighttime
and gromit we've lit it up so much
lighting it up so much that affecting
our biological clocks are disrupting our
our sleep patterns are in fact some
studies have shown that exposure to
light at night and shiftwork meaning my
cipta increases the risk of cancer
diabetes hormonal imbalance among other
other diseases exposure to light is nice
also suppresses the natural formation of
this hormone called melatonin which is
responsible for regulating as our
sleep/wake cycles so looking at your
laptop or your computer or your phone at
night for for long time before you take
this not definitely it's not definitely
helps you sleep my single ship e would
all be no that means like pollution also
affects affects plants and animals so
it's not as just as humans that are
affected by light pollution for
thousands of years all life's on earth
have been used in rely upon the
day/night rhythm it's in fact encoded in
the DNA of all plants and animals so we
light a beat we disrupted that that fits
the cycle part by by lightening up our
night time constant species has impacted
a lot by affect a lot by location is our
the fetus the sea turtles come ashore to
the betta to to lay eggs and the
hatchlings me into a dark dark skies you
to orient themselves towards the pee and
they often get confused by the lights
behind the beach and end up on the road
and getting killed or they they get so
disoriented that they don't reach the
sea until dawn and get eaten by
predators it's so many so many coastal
down so fast like in ordinances to help
favor
the cicadas but they not often strictly
enforced one of the species that
affected by light pollution or by
pollution a lot are the my trading birds
the migrating birds use moonlight and
Starlight to navigate a migrate and even
hunt but but they get they get attracted
to the bright city lights and they bind
off millions millions of birds are
killed each year killed each year by by
colliding into providing little
extremely bright up building so if you
see a bird dead on the streets is or the
parasympathetic most likely because of a
bright building so when I even leave
easily begin to learn the effects of
light pollution like creation at it it's
only the it's only the beginning when I
when I move to move to the US from India
where I went to school this town called
Gainesville Florida it really surprised
me that that most most sharks had their
lights on light at night it puts in the
case of backed by a common in India my
friends told me that it was either for
advertisement or for security purposes
for me a very well lit shop did not I
couldn't really associate a very well
atop due to being safe in fact the
burglars and thieves could actually see
everything inside the inside the inside
the shop and for me it more spins made
more sense to invest in in motion
sensors and then security with motion
signals in security for safety rather
than having this false sense of a sense
of safety by having the lights on all
light up
in fact how we have to actually turn off
lights and confidential so these lights
are supposed to go off on their own but
they don't they don't so minutes uh I on
any given day when I walk from my desk
to the micro kitchen or anywhere in the
office I don't off between eye contact I
turn off between three to five lights
three to five lights it it's not about
saving money for Google it's not about
it's not about it's about it's not
caring for it why do we compose like bad
pointed out here we a compost are it's
about caring for the for the for the
planet it
so even in your apartment or home if you
if life is learning use if you're not
using it turn it up just turn allow this
the problem is you don't make this
connection light equal to electricity
equal to burning fossil fuels
you don't make this connection 67% of
the country's electricity comes from
burning fossil fuel so next time you see
a light that's not in use please PLEASE
set it up and I feel like contains you
feel like a crazy person going into
conference rooms turning lights off but
if more people start doing it then I
won't I want it ready so please the
International dark-sky Association uses
recommends using tinted life so she
didn't light make sure that the light is
actually pointed downwards and not does
not go up where a useless it only helps
create like pollution and I'd look if
you look at the images of the bottom the
one on the right is shielded in one on
the left is unshielded are shielded
lights to stop any words compared to
untreated lights in fact unshielded
lights create a lot of black especially
on streets on roads really bright
untreated lights create a lot of blood
it's the problem is actually goes for
mix it imparts direction much worse for
eight eight eight drivers so yeah so you
select only when it's needed
that's that's a very important important
point here and people often think that
the bright light is bright as the paper
it's not really better lighting it's a
paper in fact in the significance images
it's so bright on accessible unshielded
of bright white light the hardly even
see the person are standing there I
spoke to similar things National Hockey
Association not recently they add this
they gave a talk to to to roofless cops
so they had a small home like syrup on
one corner of the room and there was a
light on all the time and there was
someone acting as if they were stealing
something no one knows no one loaded so
it was so bright that no notice suddenly
they turn off the light and for when
they turn up the light they notice so
the point is these people they are
- the change - the difference but people
don't really react to is something
really bright toward they get used to it
they I don't really blame her concerns
about concerns about people installing
very bright lights and there are in
their home banner and a crime happens in
the in the in the neighborhood
I don't really really blame them they
feel insecure by lighting up their their
space but yeah I think it's a sense of
false false security because if you if
you think about lighting up our space
all night it's above we can really see
what's what's going on it actually helps
as well run and we often don't think
about the dark shadows that a bright
light creates so so investing in motion
sensors actually make much better sense
in terms of safety then then then having
a light on online if you think about
what we'll start to include to a burglar
a light the terms are certainly or
something that's on all my people get
used to these stuff used to give to a
light being on all them and and it's
it's definitely must paper to have most
motion sensors and then having a light
on all light and if you are thinking
about lighting up any any space your
backyard or anything else a few lights
cue evenly two lights few small lights
lighting of a space evenly it's much
better than having one or two very
bright light that's this gas station on
on near my apartment up they have this
ridiculously bright light and it's
almost blinding this is a very good
example of the sister recessed lighting
the lighting that goes up and holes up
in the goes into holes up in the ceiling
it it concentrates light downward I'm
not trying to say that I'm not trying to
say that the an unlit or a very very
very low let gas-station feel safe I'm
not a support when it feels unsafe so
the point is we are we're not trying to
say this don't offer life in the gas
station you're just saying that use
device inner inner lighting choices are
use you start with dark sky friendly
lighting make sure that these also help
it's not it's not it's not just about
like policing also help sister
reduce glass how many times can be
driven by really bright buildings and
then and then it is it it distracts you
so to use only bending need the amount
really and light upon the space that's
it that's really really needed so the
what is International dark-sky
Association recommend in terms of our in
terms of different types of lights their
advantages and disadvantages
sodium is mostly with lamps these are
the orange and the yellow huge street
lights that you that you see they are
more energy efficient compared to the
incandescent the tungsten filament bulbs
but they are not so much compared to the
LED lights to the image a narrow band
with the low color temperature they want
but low color temperature like the
disadvantages of these lights are that
they have toxic elements in them so they
need to be properly disposed of and it
takes a lot of time for them to warm up
so if you turn them on they don't they
don't turn on instantly the mercury
vapour lamps they're actually being
being phased out are LEDs on the other
hand or energy-efficient they have a
much longer life they can be turned on
instantly and they can be programmed to
to be dim vector specific terms is a
really nice feature because you can you
can turn them off or even dim them
during non-peak are so why are LEDs thin
pad or you really is abandoned LEDs
often tend to be much brighter much
brighter and led have a lot of blue
light in their in their spectrum do
lights appear the brightest or to rise
and go lighter brightens the night sky
more than any any other color and blue
light has a much much father reach much
father Java creature than any other
color so the brightness plus plus the
rate makes makes a light pollution land
sky glow even even lower son and since
our ice is very sensitive to blue lights
it creates a lot of that so unshielded
the high-temperature LED lights until
they're on roads definitely definitely
not but it's a philosopher and its
really problematic especially for our
aged aged people and do like this
associated with us be alert it's
associated with our cognitive abilities
so yeah so TV phone or your laptop all
emit a lot of blue lights looking at
them for long hours before you sleep
definitely definitely no it's not not
recommended definitely not in fact I ate
recently if it's very hard to not use
your phone or your laptop dispersity
finalist in fact is recently installed
this app that controls the color
temperature on your phone it's been
really really good on my really good on
my eye so it's definitely recommended
LEDs are actually the beam in Boone
applies pollution on any of this is
proper LEDs are using proper color
temperature LEDs are used so that one
may be sure they can be turned on and
off itself sometimes they can be dimmed
during non-peak ours so the
International dark-sky Association
recommends using LED lights that are
2200 Kelvin or below so like LED lights
have this color temperature range so
anything below 2000 that Kelvin or 3000
Kelvin is what they what they recommend
now P we know that we know that like
position of external search it affects
wildlife the public cells humans this is
there are ways to fight it but are
people really responding a do we do we
see any new bikini hope so is there any
hope I spoke to the technical director
at at the International Hockey
Association and up I was really glad to
hear a lot of fear a lot of fear a
success stories Tucson Tucson in Arizona
the recently switch to 2007 expressing
LED lights and when they measured the
luminosity compared to the for the
brightness compared to the first was
only 40% there's only 40 percent of what
it was before and people no one no one
noticed the difference it was only 40
percent of what was the Ferno would
notice the difference and they in fact
reduce it by another 10 percent after 11
p.m.
again no no one notice the difference
Phoenix Phoenix did this did this
experiment where they add both 4000
Kelvin lights and the 2010/11 lights in
one one area and people actually like
reflected preferred the 2007 cousin
Edmund I saw this the eye temperature
led by Jensen greater than 4000 5000
Kelvin is really harsh really harsh
analyzed people actually hated these uh
these these harsh blue lights the
Phoenix is actually changing ninety
thousand lights ninety-three recently
voted to change all of about 90,000
lights in Phoenix to 2500 given are LEDs
Montreal's and all of all of Georgia the
state of Georgia you think in order to
to to switch to to the Selective in
knowledge to the only about a small town
and Canada I forget the name uh this so
the small town in Canada at in one of
the streets we switched to to a much
lower what is the sodium vapour lamps to
see people notice the difference no one
notice the difference it was I almost
have to after the brightness after
luminosity no notice the difference
because our eyes usually get adjusted
adapted to to this reduction in
luminosity so many cities so many
municipalities having made the mistake
of installing 4000 and 5000 Kelvin light
is ridiculously bright LEDs having made
the mistake people hated these lights
people hated this icon and hearing the
success stories from other up other
towns and cities
teaspoons of all these are now actually
sitting back to so many months parties
are now switching parts of 2010 at the
Kelvin life so it makes me really
hopeful it it it it makes me really
really optimistic to maybe maybe maybe
we'll see you'll start seeing changes in
our own inner inner inner life answer is
hoping what can we what can we do what
can we really do ourselves so we can
make a start a liquid the lighting in
our in our apartments in our teeth they
are dark sky friendly home depot has
this section on there on the other side
for dark sky friendly lighting
excuse me so we can you can you can
check out our Home Depot and then if you
if you're really interested you can you
can you can check it for the lights in
your in your in it in your streets or
neighbor streets or shielded or it's
tape creating a lot of flat and if
you're really interested you can even go
up to the City Council that's a push I
know but we really interested up you can
go up to the city councilman bite upper
lighting arguments the International
dark-sky Association will definitely
help us are very very friendly people up
there talk to people raise raise
awareness raise awareness on the on the
issue but but but don't leave any it
will be the part is being really kind to
people then you have any talk about
light pollution the first reaction that
you get when you say light pollution or
you want to turn my lights off you want
to really turn my lights up no I'm not
asking you you're crazy
alright so the problem that is what it's
what we perceive as bad versus versus
reality so we make sure to make sure to
be soft and try to make sense into them
I wanna I want to start start talking
with the schools or trying to trying to
get I I spoke to someone and someone
recently shot from the East Coast
they eat uh starts at the bar scores and
uh I gave my video at least been doing
talks on astronomy and legislator he
says it's really helping out kids so the
thing we think that I should find talk
to kids at school so if you any of you
are interested in doing that yourselves
please please reach out to me the more
of the super editors or if you have any
contact at schools or boys girls girls
were focused on necropsy saw Felicia
that would make I would I would I would
love to have them I want to end this
video with something that is inspired me
something that has inspired me over the
over the years I don't know how many of
you would have already English but why
is the one now was to space book that
was sent to send to study the outer
solar system so when it finished it's
the primary mission it was asked to turn
back and take one last photo of Eartha
American a strong
Costigan gave this famous famous speech
about the deal you got so I'm gonna save
it for you all right thank you I have
this room till 3:30 so if you have any
additional comments or any questions uh
please stop this way it will become by
your color especially later and just
because it is plain it it's it's me it's
the three I post process the image
sometimes when you have any Oh take a
take a photo the the white balance and
the white pants is what controls is the
color of various pixels in the in the
Indian major and there is it for success
properly sometimes it comes out comes
out really bad I didn't spend the time
to to make the cut the white balance it
didn't look back to my eyes so I went
put it but if you if you make it really
right when you take the photos is the
what is so yes this is the white balance
not not suppose you on this surface the
Lausanne house was bigger because I
begin to express and I find me here
launched the online business for Asia
which runs and hello is the
hydrogenation column and what is the
response especially there is actually
sky discrete colourful go on bye-bye you
make everything your colorful clothes
full of like not really
yeah so they especially these days
people are very skeptical and cynical on
the on the internet so it is definitely
does not help for sure it gets more
attention for sure at gate 4 edition but
it's silly word for terror here here
going for in fact the I tried mimicking
really may be the turning point is we
clearly more finally see behind
sometimes it puts that kind of the top
away in rest of them I could provoke the
one going and looking up my movies are
doing auto gates 3 both here because
already box is exactly true that's
definitely true but if you take a photo
of the Milky Way through with your with
your DSLR it's it's all there's already
a huge difference between what we see
and what the camera sees and then it I
think that Foy itself if for the ones
that are really interested in a in these
type of photos I think that by itself is
enough going be overboard
it is what I feel it is not even
necessary what my solution are mine is a
way we're really kind of commented
around where for so 15.15 point
definitely Pigeon Point down port
anywhere on the coast and Rico skatepark
is definitely a very good place
you mention power plan yeah weeks weeks
I planned so much that I tried to take
out take out any any guesswork in fact I
usually panic and I don't really like if
there's something that surprises me so
when I when I go before I go to a break
I know the the how many seconds it would
take me to come from a car to where I
can put my tripod and I usually make
sure that there aren't most registered
on any animal photographs so it make
sure it's not a it's not a popular space
if it's a popular place then there's
other people with this car headlights or
or their own life because if you take
their so coming from India I don't feel
unsafe anywhere here as especially
especially here maybe two o'clock in the
night in the Tenderloin in San Francisco
but in national parks come on who's
going to make out the trek all the way
to the National Park appeal so I usually
don't feel unsafe at all the cops are
sometimes at all they will stop by check
on what you're doing but if you at least
in California and even now Arizona you
Newt actually if you tell them that
you're taking photos of the night sky
they're usually friendly I was in
Treasure Island in San Francisco just
last week I didn't know that I was
supposed to park there a cop stopped by
and I told him I'm taking photos of the
Bay Bridge
tonight's questions are on the Bay
Bridge he said I'll give you 15 minutes
sister can you give me some articulatory
said yeah I'll give you 30 okay okay
yeah yeah lead and I'll leave in 30 so
it if you're not a crazy person is I
think inclusive fine I don't feel unsafe
in any especially in national parks
on that note I love parts of big person
that they have my sign they market both
passive Star Trek deep you can call
ahead or they get permission so these
patients who have a little closer after
the after art they don't actually let
you and if you go to a day they tow your
car so I avoid these places this is one
one exception is Montebello open space
preserve in in very very close to here
about 30 minutes from here they have a
after night astronomy permit but I
reached out to this time actually reach
out to San Antonio which is the cult
Rancho San Antonio County Park it's a
sorry we don't all have anyone after up
soccer they have a good enough reason is
because of this age because of Monta
lines so I usually avoid registered
skater I use I usually use a Google
Street view I think I would have used to
Google strictly more than anyone else
use Google strictly a lot to find to
look at party signs so pigeon point said
no parking after 7:00 p.m. so I call
them I call them I spoke to the guy at
the the the guy that manages the light
oh so I spoke them I said I want to take
a photo so night skies and doing a
document electing on like pollution can
I park up the currently and we said no
one's going to notice no one thing I'm
going to go this stones gonna be done
after dark so so I try to try to collect
as much information as possible when I
went to actually ask this National Park
in a muta
it was a very very popular destination I
really regretted the rejected going
there's so many so many photographers so
when I'm doing a time lapse for two
hours that the other light
can you create again I get a full moon
on the site hmm everything that we see
asteroid depots in Palo Alto yeah yeah
actually seven it's the other way other
way down
yeah seven it's definitely not as bright
as it is in San Francisco but Palo Alto
yeah even still see things for the city
- still she thinks it's actually funny
because the initial stages is the light
pollution that you keep that's making it
bright for you to see but in the latter
stages from the later stages so it's the
Starlight that make it the more visible
so it actually is very high very high
drop stop shops and stuff going up again
yeah yeah I kind of perfect oh forgot to
mention that I make sure the moon's not
up and it's nice not cloud or rainy
alright thank you thank you for uh thank
you for coming thank you okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
