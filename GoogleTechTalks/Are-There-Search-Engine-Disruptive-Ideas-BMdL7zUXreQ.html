we're very pleased to have Randy goble
with this team Randy there was a lot of
stories I can tell about Randy but i
won't i will just say that he's well
probably everyone already knows a based
on his work he's worked in a number of
different areas there's a lot of work
done on visualization of web graphs for
example is pretty interesting old logic
around the knowledge representation just
a whole plethora of things that he
worked on over the years with the chair
of the computer science department
university of alberta currently is
serving as chair of I Corps and was very
pleased to have him here he's been here
several times and today's going to tell
us about search engine whose relative
ideas if there are any and with that all
ready to go thanks baron he said I've
done a lot of things mostly that's
people criticize me for being get
scattered and unfocused which I will
continue today and so the reason that
I'm giving this we got to the yellow
projector he's the right one in this
room shakes a lot it oh we've tried the
yellow and it's also shaking I think
there's another talk in there I tried to
reserve right so you want to try I have
the yellow is usually better in this
room but I think it will be the same
we're trying okay then earlier so as the
disruption is continuing visuals
disruption so the little logo up here
says that the Alberta is the Texas of
Canada actually in the Canadians I think
of Texas as the Alberta of the United
States except we have more oil and so in
in my jurisdiction we spend a lot of
money on research so I'm in a group now
that that gets a lot of money to do a
whole spectrum of research and machine
learning my background is as a formalist
a good old-fashioned a guy doing
knowledge representation and when I
think hard about what happens with
search engines I've tried to think hard
about what the disruptive forces are and
what some of the approaches to dealing
with them are and you'll see what I
think those are in it and it's this is a
good place to get so motivation and
conclusions come first because of the
room gets too full and it's too jittery
and you can see the conclusion go away
and get out before you can wait for the
video tape version 2 2 to get to get the
to get the details but but I'm not
largely focus on two things one is going
to be knowledge representation but in
context with communities and culture
somebody who I was telling about this
talk said you can't be a computer
scientist with a social conscience but
in fact I may be I will reveal myself to
be that let's see yeah good point i took
this diagram from a friend's paper a
recent paper done for telecom
laboratories and in Germany and the and
I it's a it's a little busy but the
reason I like it is that we can think of
where we are in the development of the
large broad community of digital
information and what I liked about this
is that the European project sometimes
in the newspapers referred to as euro
google has split now in to to to to sort
of philosophies one is the French and
one is the German you know what my
sermon is earning this thing you might
know what my preferences are but on the
German version and they're interested in
what Wolfgang and andreas dengle have
taught of called web 3.0 the real
motivation i have is really only two
things and and i have to tell you that
that it's it might be thought of as
democratization of information but
you'll see the google mantra a little
later on so i'm interested in what it
means to move in this direction and this
is just an example and a diagram that
helps motivate the idea for moving in
that direction you can see we're not
moving in a very steady pace it's a
little jittery but you'll see so here's
the conclusion so you'll see these later
on i just want to briefly go over them
because what I'm going to claim is is
that I gave it I gave a similar tuck
this at Google Beijing in October I said
I told those people that they had the
opportunity to rescue google from from a
metadata monoculture and you'll see what
i mean by that is i keep talking
then I do want to talk about the
technical architectural impediments and
about these notions of digital
communities in tracking how they
contribute to meaning when you search to
retrieve information because of course I
think most of the people here are really
smart and they know that when you search
you're not just searching you're
actually augmenting content with
semantics I'll show you some examples
but we'll get bet by again get past that
again to make this clear and you know or
to try to make it clear is this is that
is you can think of Google or any other
search engine is more than a search
engine providing semantics on top of
content and so this is a sort of
facetiously thinking you can think about
web 3.0 whatever that is it's very hard
to define but largely in the technical
community of people worried about
information retrieval and indexing it's
adding something that allows you to
better interpret the content that you're
trying to retrieve I have to tell you
that I'm using somebody else's words in
doing that because I'm an old-fashioned
AI guy semantics has a very clear
meaning when you talk to a logician
about what it means to imbue con content
or semantic content to syntax but with
that said that's the point right is is
the point is what can you learn about
moving in this direction and adding
whatever it takes you think of it as
metadata to start off with because
that's a good as good analogy and
everything as anything to provide better
semantic support for the poor user out
there trying to get access you know do
what I mean is an old acronym from very
old days that most of you wouldn't
remember is you weren't born then but
the the Lisp front end that was called
whims that do what I mean when I'm
programming that's another way to think
about this so I had to take out the
perfunctory analysis of what I think of
as may be the most brittle kind of way
of adding semantics but you'll recognize
this thing from tim berners-lee nuh
another version of it from from the guys
at the german center for AI research so
who believes that you can actually
engineer semantics in this very very
static brittle way that is building the
layers and getting to the
these three things here are the domain
of the old-fashioned representation guy
I don't know anybody that believes this
in principle but as a practice of
organizing metadata on top of what you
do maybe there's an analogy that that
allows this but I'm not sure I believe
this and I'll tell you a few reasons why
one reason is to think about this is
that it's the good old fashioned
knowledge representation so called go
fair good ol fashioned a I saw a long
time distinguished between table lookup
in search and and in the case where your
domain is small enough to build table
lookup so these if then Andrew if then
else will so in a game situation that
says if this is the situation then do
this you can just look it up and
indexing and retrieval works fine and
you're not changing the semantics of
anything when you do table lookup and
you if you watch the newspapers and you
watch the editorials that people write
about how Google impacts the world will
be more from a year perhaps than me when
you read these to say that there's a
certain kind of distortion that comes
when you do a whole lot of processing to
be able to make choices and decisions
about what information to retrieve based
on this very simple interface which
skews you in this direction to think
about what is the knowledge that I use
when I make decisions about what move to
make next at least in this very simple
inference environment and so I want you
to keep that in mind because every time
you add a layer or you add something of
some algorithmic discipline between the
user and the content they're looking for
your biasing the meaning of the things
that you retrieve and so if you believe
that or even if you understand it but
don't believe it you'll understand all
the rest of the things i'm going to give
you this is a cleaned up version of it
so in watching the dialogues I just
talked to Peter Norvig watching the
dialogues between Tim berners-lee and
Peter Norvig it's very clear that one of
the problems with the semantic layer
cake is that these two issues are an
issue at every level at every level that
you provide the opportunity of some kind
of expression of metadata you provide
the opportunity
to not get it correct but the
opportunity to have it intentionally
wrong the province of the discipline
that I've worked in for many years
knowledge representation deals with
these layers and I'm afraid that they're
not nearly as tidy as they look there in
that diagram so there's a lot to do
there and I'll give you just a few
examples to show you how what can be
disruptive there but this you can take
take home as a message is that these two
issues are issues at every level every
time I write down an annotation in any
metadata form right I can lie you may
not know but the first computer system
that ever was brought to a halt and
crashed using the world wide web was a
graduate student in engineering at the
University of Victoria in Canada who
said wouldn't it be neat to see what
happens to the university's computer
systems and the web server if I put
every word in the english dictionary
that has anything to do remotely with
sex on a web page and find out what the
search engines do right it brought the
university to a halt but that was 1995
so it was in the early days so I'm going
to tell you a little bit about what's
disruptive you can now go away if you
think that these are disruptive I was
going to stroke this one out apparently
that I can't keep up with Google
purchases so not not not surprising but
I'll say a little bit about some of
these and you'll see that there's two
kinds of challenges here one is
credibility of information I'll give you
an example from this company called
freeload press and the last couple of
slides I'll show you will be about
sensor networks and world dashboards and
what they do is they show you the
incredible complexity of the problem of
building a view of the world and and see
what that works like looks like but
these these are sort of cultural you'll
see some of this i would put in a plug
for another canadian the the word
cyberspace was first published in print
by a science-fiction author named
william gibson should read this latest
book of visits it's near fiction and
it's really about the remix culture it's
a very interesting novel the same kind
of Gibson writing that's like a
rollercoaster you have fun along the way
the roller coaster stops you go and you
say what was that all about but it's an
interesting book because it talks
about a potential impact of some secret
person re mixing a whole bunch of things
in the internet world and producing
something that advertisers are
desperately wanting to get a handle on
because it's creating such attention in
the whole world so you might look at
that book so now I'm ready to start the
talk right i want to remind you about
what your mantra is and if you can if
it's changed canadians coming into this
country always worried about weapons of
mass destruction so I thought that you
remember the search for weapons of mass
destruction in your pages before
organized is a very loaded word and
that's part of what this notion of
disruption is I want to point out to you
is is that I worked on a project many
years ago and Japan was called the real
world computing project may ran has
trained me to think about this century
as being that the century of data and
machine learning and I think he's right
but the conception in Japan and this in
this magnificent 10-year project was the
democratization of information along
these scales and if you talk about
computing evolution and function
extension fifth-generation computing
project led to this one which was
flexible information processing it was
about how to ask for information so if
you like the semantics of access to
information was in the process not in
the secret indexing in the data to give
you an example some of the things come
out of coming out of these projects was
were things like visual querying how to
separate the background from the
foreground focus on modeling the white
in the room so I could find the people
instead of focusing on what an image of
a person was so is a bunch of intriguing
and interesting ideas but the motivation
was the democratization of information
based on process not unday de if you
like so that so this idea is at least
related now those of you who are old
enough to remember you can see that that
when this thing came out 1966 almost
killed natural language research
in many places Canada used to lead
natural language research in the world
because of the bilingual nature of the
country and expenditures and in research
in the early 60s it kind of died out
because of the kind of Canadian
conservatism but but this project report
talked about the semantic bury this is
the time when natural language guys were
trying to do natural language processing
by dictionary lookup and I and what I'm
telling you is is that I think that
there are all kinds of semantic barriers
as soon as you think ontology and the
semantic layer cake is buying you a
solution it's like my head the world by
the tail and then it started wagging me
phenomenon so we're going we go through
these cycles a lot so this is another
one here's one that's more recent so
this was a the newspaper on Sunday
talking about I book and and the anxiety
that some people have in the world in
this case I think it's clear it was a
librarian who talks about whether or not
the creation of indices to books that
Google might produce for access online
would actually help scholars understand
our ordinary people who are just
interested in books so it's the same
kind of thing is is that there's all
this anxiety about the technologies and
tools being used to provide access to
information but they themselves become
brittle and fall apart if you're looking
for a punchline the only one that I'll
say is that the only antidote to this
really is machine learning applied to
large volumes of data as at least you
have control of your bias if you like
right so now I want to I want to go
through two phases of things to two sets
of examples that have to do with
knowledge representation but actually
turn out to be about culture and
community and then some other things
that talk about technically slicing up
the environment in which we work which
is really about the internet and IP
architecture and related things so here
here are the ideas of the first one is
is that is that to delve very briefly
into a highly technical world of
knowledge representation and you'll see
with this little funny diagram means you
can think of this as a robot observing
snapshots of the world accumulating
information and the old idea is that you
have
eight of the world is a consistent
database maybe it's some first order
theory doesn't matter much what it is
except that it's a formal representation
from which you can draw inferences you
might add something to it and adding
something to it you have several
alternatives to take on the world so if
I tell you it's raining outside right
now you might think I'm wacky but maybe
there was a cloud that went by then if I
tell you in a little while later it's
not raining any longer no then you begin
to wonder whether I'm a weatherman or in
academic so on so you accumulate
information that goes inside the robot
but if you think about this the
decisions you make might give you a null
set of alternatives and one way is to
think about collapsing these two one
alternative so if I tell you it's
raining you don't believe me you store
in your mind as this guy's wacky don't
pay attention him it's not raining even
if i left the roof of my car down here's
an example that that there is no known
solution for in this thing that's really
simple so take P and Q to be rich and
famous if if you store the fact that
somebody's rich and famous and you're
told they're not rich and famous right
so everybody knows enough boolean logic
to know well the alternatives then to
collapse my database be conservative
about what I throw away is to say well
if this person is not rich and famous
maybe they're only famous or maybe the
only rich but I know I can't have both
of them now have a decision pick one of
these and if I pick one of them and I'm
subsequently told they're not famous if
I pick this path I get empty and if they
pick that this path they're still rich
the point is is that is that as we
accumulate information have to be very
careful about preserving alternatives in
the face of incomplete information why
is that important here well there by the
way there in technical solutions in a
literature about this even as early as
this thing another another PhD student
with me studying nonmonotonic reasoning
said oh it's really easy what you can do
is you can use these PI order logics
talk about Oh scope and say that no
matter what you know
what is implied by what you know depends
on context so you can look at this paper
it's a highly technical paper nobody in
their right mind would sit down and read
it from for bedtime reading unless you
wanted to put yourself asleep by the
first four sentences but it is a
technical solution and when you think
about what this means in higher order
logic it comes down to culture context
and trust and that's what I'm going to
show you oh by the way Google does pay
attention to time sometimes but only in
this way this is an issue of time of
temporal indexing and representing
ambiguity and another way to think of
ambiguity is that it arises in lots of
different ways so there's many of you
will be familiar with this guy but what
you won't know is is that he copied a
lot of ideas from this guy is a young
dutch mathematician who has aged 18
started drawing as many impossible
diagrams as he could this is one of them
right so here is a representation of
something that captures ambiguity
directly and we're actually going to
have to understand that if we're going
to provide semantics for the world so
that's an example of these things so let
me keep going here's another one so now
what I'm doing is I'm just giving you
examples of places that of things that
must be captured and are captured and
what they do is they distort our view of
the world that says I can issue a query
term and get the right answer and if I
just work hard enough I'm going to get
the right answer and I can refine it and
I can hone it and I can use the best
statistical methods and machine learning
but if you don't admit that the world is
ambiguous and you represent ambiguous
things you're kind of doomed to get it
wrong in some way so here's another one
artist's conception right we have all of
these things in the world many of them
you can watch these guys go so this is
for maybe I'm trying to tell you how how
these carbon monoxide molecules move in
a circuit I don't have to believe you
with that but here that's the artist
conception here's the real thing this is
from scanning tunneling microscope that
shows benzene moving and in the
visualization work that we do we we try
to pick vocabularies visual vocabularies
that emphasize the properties that the
physicist is looking for not the person
reading scientific america
and the bias is different it's the same
underlying principle but different
vocabularies for expressing different
things another aspect of representation
so here's another another one that you
can try so here's looking for the word
wunderbar and one of my favorite german
words and so this one is searching only
in Deutschland and you can see what
happens here what we get here is
searching for a wunderbaar in the
American context calm first thing you
get is an advertisement for beer taps
right that tells you something a little
bit about culture you can't it can't
ignore the fact that what you retrieve
and what you type in and what it means
is culturally dependent we all know that
I use different search engines depending
on what I'm looking for in the world for
example and here's another one that you
might recognize so there's a bar in this
area of Tokyo called gotanda i don't
think i actually may be one of the few
bars in tokyo that i haven't been at now
how are we going to solve this problem
well when i was here in august
louisvuitton gave this great talk and i
couldn't help but recall what he said if
I said and and some people are playing
ESP for 60 to 70 hours a week well I
don't know who this people would be but
here's my reaction is somebody if you
use the data that that's that those
people playing 60 to 70 hours a week are
using is they are defining the semantics
of the images that I use your image
search engine to retrieve I don't like
that very much i like to have more
control over how meaning arises and to
give you an example most of you know
about ESPN true right anybody not know
about this game about the collaborative
labeling so it's a way of getting
somebody to work for free so ESP is
again you go online you retrieve images
from the web anything that you can
distinguish is an image to people play
unknown to each other and they try to
collaborate to label the image without
using the taboo word so you can't write
chart and pie and in you win there's a
notion of competition you win because
the more quickly you collaborate to get
the same words you know it's a clever
really clever idea and it can apply in
lots of area
and this isn't the first person to do it
but this one captured the attention of
many people including Google but now
here let me do this I did this in in
Google Beijing so I want you to play the
game with me here's the character i'm
going to present you with you tell me
what it means right now as I look around
in the spectrum of this room I see one
guy who I know very well right who is is
a great scholar who comes from the
People's Republic of China speaks
Chinese pretty well belt one hell of a
Chinese parser so he's going to have an
advantage over many of us about playing
ESP game when the game is labeling
Chinese characters and I'm going to be
pretty abysmal at it unless i have at
mydisposal some kind of dictionary that
i can read so how many people would even
venture to guess what that character
means this by the way is currently the
most complex character in the online
Chinese dictionary that's accessible in
this way anybody want to guess who has
some notion being able to parse the sub
symbols internet it's a diagram of
Internet connectivity of visualization
so that I had this game from our machine
learning group publishes a poker program
and I had it as a prize and in the
beijing office I said whoever gets the
closest to this gets this and two guys
got pretty close so tell us that's what
you think it means not the advantage of
having moving out train ya think
yeah so so I'll tell you in a second now
though one of the things that that I'm
doing now that I just got a google grand
forest is to work with some students on
analyzing Chinese compounds building
compound dictionaries for compounds that
aren't compositional so that you need to
search through a set of resources to be
able to confirm them but this one is not
a Chinese compound so anybody here is
Japanese so this doesn't occur directly
in a Chinese dictionary it's a little
journey still but anybody who can read
chinese has an idea about what this
means right right who knows what this
one means right okay now let me tell you
what the first one means well so that's
the that's the Cantonese no sorry this
Mandarin pronunciation of something that
I got from the people in beijing this is
what this means poor enunciation due to
snuffle this is not going to change your
life if you don't get this right but
it's an illustration that shows you the
context of playing the labeling game
without sufficiently paying attention to
the cultural contexts I you know I would
I would rather have somebody Chinese
play these games for me you can do that
by the way right maybe okay here's
another one this one is really
interesting cultural context of language
so i got this one for my friend not
kushina last two weeks ago in hyderabad
room I don't know if you went to his dog
that time the invited talk but here's
something that's really interesting
here's what I want you to think about so
the first sentence in calabar has no
country novel begs the issue the
following issue is i want you to you
don't necessarily have to close your
eyes but think about what you see as an
image in your mind when you think about
this translation which has been vetted
as a accurate translation of Colorado's
first sentence in this novel the train
came out of the long tunnel into the
snow country so everybody have an image
of the train coming out of the long
tunnel into the snow country right watch
this so this Japanese scholar studying
how people think about this
it has proposed the hypothesis by
interviewing people and talking about it
this what this is what the Japanese
think about and this is what us well I'm
personally a grey fed Prairie white boy
but this is what he claims we tend to
think about another stark distinction
and how one thinks about these things
culturally now the claim is is that the
semantics of what we retrieve that's my
hypothesis has to do with all of this
context put on top of the content that
we have can we figure out how to use
that and exploit it and distinguish it
as a question so let's keep going now
it's Peter asked me when we came in and
said what's the answer i said trusted
digital communities so here's the answer
and i'll give you some ideas about how
to identify these just from what I've
learned in in in thinking about them and
talking to people so if there is such a
thing as a trusted digital community if
you could delimit one it would tell you
something about the meaning of the
information that it has a perspective on
you already see this you know Google's
famous for translations between English
and Arabic and there are there has to be
in a belief that what you're what you
read and translate from an Arabic
newspaper might have a slightly
different opinion about a perspective on
something than in the English newspaper
for example so how are you going to
measure what's happening in those
communities how you and identify them I
want to give you one idea that I get
from people who teach language its
so-called authentic material say a
little bit about that and then just say
that identifying communities drawing
inferences from them and tracking their
evolution is interesting there are some
extremely precise concrete examples I'll
give you some of those but here's
something about the language learning
community is if you talk to somebody who
teaches people how to teach language the
most successful teachers of a second
language deliver graduated contexts to
students and say in the simplest context
here is authentic material in that
context that allows you to move forward
and for example developing the
tabular e so you have levels of learning
and this notion of authentic material is
important so in my backpack I have a
newspaper that comes from Hyderabad why
is that important because the way
language is used there is different than
the way you use language in the Palo
Alto daily right trust me it's just
different so when people are learning
language in jurisdictions having
authentic material helps define the
community they're trying to become a
member of now can you think of a digital
community where there is a precise event
or object that defines that community
I'll show you some but but just start
thinking about that there's not just
authentic material but authentic
processes and authentic events and I'll
show you examples of one how can you
track them what does it need to do that
this comes from a woman I know who
speaks nine languages and it's busy
always trying to build these models of
how to track people through language
learning and that's where I got the idea
of authentic material these are just a
couple more places you can leave you can
look at this talk and get this I
guarantee you that the version you'll
get online will be less jittery than the
one that you see here so here's one
here's what I would say as an authentic
community it's really hard to figure out
how and I buy a book on Amazon confirm
my purchase charge my credit card how
that's not an authentic event it's a
confirmed event in a community that I'm
willing to allow the use of to make
recommendations I don't actually don't
have much control over that it was there
but it's a notion of an authentic
community it's definable you can track
it you can draw inferences from the
community that creates it and you can
identify whether you're part of the
community or not so that's a really
really simple one the more interesting
ones of course much less easy to
identify can you derive measures of
stability in Wikipedia that will tell
you something about when you're
approaching even in the most abstract
sense of machine learning in the limit
when the data is stabilizing enough so
you should at least believe it arises
from a community which has vetted it by
more than one person right so you
watch it would be interesting to track
wiki page changes Wikipedia page changes
and and look at people carrying on a
debate about the the truth of this thing
the last one I also claimed as a
phenomena of a digital community so you
may not maybe some of you don't remember
this but opentext was a Canadian
corporation the University of Waterloo
or I was that built search engines and
search documents when it is revealed
then back in the late 90s that they were
actually gerrymandering the retrieval by
because of people paying them for four
rankings right they lost credibility I
don't think that they exist anymore as
an open open search engine kind of thing
they lost too much would that happen
with Google today I'm not sure it's hard
to tell it's just a different kind of
community so this is an example of a
trusted community that's what happens
when I confirm authentic events they're
real they can't be spoof right if
they're spoofed somebody's using my
credit card and I do what I can as
quickly as I can about the identity
theft so it's just a really simple
example to try to get you to think about
that evolution here's another one so I
got this from google I'm disappointed
that when it searched for a material and
artificial intelligence didn't get the
text but that compete with the Peter
Norvig for but you know that's something
maybe I can pay somebody there right now
money so when I searched for this I get
this so i get lectures assignments and
references but but how is it that i get
these and no and not others it's it's
it's the mystery of how the thing was
created underneath and i'm sure there's
some coherence to it but it's another
example of a community over which i have
little control that exists that's
defined somehow that you can think about
its value i wanted to put this one in
here because google has become a verb in
some sense here's another one that a
small company and trying to help get
some traction is doing called freeload
press so their business model is this is
they they go to authors who are
producing books maybe second editions of
books and say we're going to pay you
whatever you thought you would get from
your original publisher but we're going
to take your book and we're going to
give
away for free online because it hits a
mass-market at lots of us colleges and
then they insert advertising into it the
students get the books for free they can
even print them for the cost of printing
and you might think the first reaction
for most people is oh my god insidious
advertising in between lemma 1 and lemma
2 it's not quite that way but but but
the idea is that there's another
opportunity to build a community and
it's very interesting one so here's an
example in this particular algebra book
which I'm thinking about about the
algebra of eigenvectors these days I
have to read more of so anyway this is
the chapter starting with linear
equations and this is the advertising
than the next page that gets stuck in
there's a book so it's there's an
attempt to stick in the advertising
recover the cost for the author and give
away the textbook for free but it's also
introducing a certain kind of bias and
building a certain kind of community as
far as I know Google hasn't bought this
company yet but you know I haven't read
the newspapers for almost a half an hour
now ideas about how to deal with these
communities are kind of interesting
because here's one that I constructed
because there are two two sliders that
I've heard people talk about which bias
retrieval of the metadata in a community
right so here's here's here's the fabric
Randy's fabricated slider you can tell
which interface it uses and so one comes
from yahoo mindset that you've probably
seen another one comes and was spoken of
it at microsoft research seminar which
is local global microsoft didn't like it
very much when i pointed out that that
it was in years since google produced
desktop search for mr. gates software
and they still haven't quite got there
yet so i haven't been invited back to
Microsoft since by the way but there's
there's a slider so you can imagine a
whole notion of like graphic equalizers
on dimensions in these communities that
I take control of as a user and bias the
use of the metadata that's put in there
if I told you that I knew how to do it
I'd be lying i actually don't think
anybody
how to do it but the idea is to be able
to first acknowledge that there are
those communities use the strongest of
them where you can actually have this
kind of for example access but one that
we're working on that we that we haven't
said much to is I've just I just pulled
out this thing it's kind of hard to see
but you can imagine imagine we're doing
some work on incremental search that is
use any old API of any old search engine
company retrieve far too much and then
use local information and local data
about the structure of knowledge you're
looking for so you don't have a slider
but you have a hierarchical organization
of data one of the guys that's working
with me a guy named Christopher English
debtor comes from a group in eunuch and
what what some of the things that
they've done is built some really
interesting custom local knowledge about
for example hotels in Germany how many
of you have used a search engine to try
to find a phone number for a hotel right
yeah how do you penetrate all of those
resellers right it's really a difficult
job so you can think about this in that
case it's a practical application doing
sort of genre classification of
information using it locally and moving
through it as a hierarchy or something
else not just a slider all of these rely
on what i would call some sort of
identified trusted communities so that's
the only thing member i start out with
knowledge representation and got to
those sliders that's sort of the really
fast tour through that kind of thing now
let me say a little bit about about
things that are a little more technical
in the sense that as a search engine
company no no search engine company I
know has a lot of control over changes
in the broad architecture of the
internet and it's changing and you find
subsets of it you can't have access to
private nets you have the whole spectrum
of how things change and that just
provides another semantic challenge how
do you how are you able to build the
metadata and instrument access to those
things where they add value and provide
access to information so here's just a
few things to talk about before I go on
with this this is this is just from
Reese
talk from a cysteine II at this meeting
about the future intranet these are his
identification of things that can change
how you can index and retrieve things
they're pretty technical right they
don't rely on any abstract ephemeral
notion of trusted digital community
where you have to pick what it means to
be trusted you have to pick what it
means to be an authentic event you have
to pick what it means to delimit the
community but they're just structures in
the network that might provide
interesting challenges to doing this so
let's look at this is just a picture
i've used here before a previous talk if
you know what the jurisdiction you're
working in is you can get this so this
is just something that I've used before
to say if you have a jurisdiction server
and you control the jurisdiction you're
working in so if I'm a company and I by
one of the Google service to organize my
data inside I have this sort of cart
blush to organize all of the data in
there and I can do a lot of really
interesting things and not just not just
the user data and the queries and the
content and the metadata a whole
spectrum of things and we've done some
things like this trying to do navigation
compression that is looking at web
blocks parsing them seeing what
improvements you get this is some things
that we've done and then visualize them
because we're working on Big Data spaces
you can do this when you have control
over the space if you don't have control
over the space you can do much less and
in fact not having control over a space
that changes can be disruptive to you
building metadata that's trying to
understand it so there are lots of
places that data can arise you're
starting to see for example telephones
in Europe which may soon be available
North America's kind of backwards
compared to Asia and Europe in that way
is it by telephone that maybe Apple's
iPhones will do this when they come out
by telephone that uses both 802 11 and
CDMA and GSM and it swaps around and
moves around it creates at least three
subnets of exchanging data that are
really hard to track some companies
actually can't charge you properly for
those things there's a story about the
u.s. GTE Fonuts it took them six months
of free calls before they actually got
the charging right
you can't get the charging I believe in
you can't track the data right either so
here are some examples that that you're
probably familiar with that changed the
shape of the data that you can look at
if you like they use the tools that
already exist to provide a different
perspective on the data so i told you
about this vertical search engine with
the german hotel information and its
claim that these are like that so here's
one that everybody scenes one of the
first ones that you might remember and
so as being a little facetious so this
plots all of the filtered crimes in
Chicago so this is looking for crimes
that happened in a church synagogue or
place of worship that were associated
with criminal transmission of HIV in all
districts from November second 252
december four 2006 between one midnight
to another right as you can imagine
there's not a lot of activity on this
graph right here's another one
convenience store burglary on the other
hand is much different right now that's
pretty highly cultural right what that
means and what you expect when you see
that and what I told you about it I
biased as broadly as I could to say oh
yeah this audience would understand that
that might not make sense in some other
jurisdiction or context yet another
example where you have to worry about
semantics now the last example I want to
give you comes from connecting humans
and machines to sensor networks so one
of the reasons that were interested in
this in our machine learning group is
that if you deploy a million carbon
nanotubes generating carbon fluxes and
you want to sample the health of a
forest you have to be able to have a
model of data economy so use you for
example a reinforcement learning model
that says which pieces of data are most
important at what time / sometimes
spectrum to give you the right sample
but that's just another information
processing ties right it's another
indexing search task because how many
people have looked at pete's pond in
botswana nobody's looked at pete's pond
pete's pond is a good so pete's pond is
uh it's
quite good cameras and sound on a
watering hole in Botswana and Africa you
can use it at night because the sound is
so good that it sort of lulls you to
sleep if you're halfway around the world
in a different time zone but how do you
interpret that right there's a lot of
data there that can be biased so there's
a guy down the road at Stanford you
probably know Leon be honest who says
that what we need is an architecture and
the same we've got a semantic layer cake
we're waiting for the semantic layer
cake for sensor networks that's going to
drive a bias in a way that you retrieve
information because you should be able
to say in some kind of query language
show me the last four wild goats that
came and took a drink at this pete's
pond in Botswana but you need a coherent
architecture to do that that's one
proposal for it here's another one how
do you provide coherent access this is
from flux net which is both cross North
America and Europe but this is what you
get in and you can see that there's a
Microsoft influence in how this chart is
done but here's the data that gets
retrieved and you're going to introduce
bias every time you try to build
metadata on this to understand it the
last one that I want to use is when I'm
proud of because the there's a project
called Neptune which is just another
data source just another big complex
data source that you should be able to
query and think about what how you query
and what happens in between the data
source and so this one Neptune is for
instrumenting the west coast of North
America putting in all of these sensors
and building something whose artist's
conception is like underwater labs this
is one of the rare cases where Canadian
funding is ahead of the American funding
so it's Canadian you know we feel we
feel like we're so small we have to
point out these things but there's there
is the most complex data source that I
know and the question is how are you
going to identify communities and
metadata that allow you to query this
because it's public information you you
want uniform access to this within a
fabric of a digital community know which
one you're looking at so that's the last
one now this is just the same slide as
before I guess if I was paying attention
I would have taken this
you'd have seen progress during my talk
but it's not that dynamic so here's what
I think of as the sort of some of the
challenges for Google the last one is is
one that it turns out that you're
powerful enough and rich enough to start
buying things if they seem disruptive
that's as good a way as dealing with
disruption as as anything one of the
most dangerous things in that semantic
layer cake is fraud and as I've said
before if there's a punchline is it
creating metadata with machine learning
is probably the only antidote to to sort
of moderating the the naive construction
of the semantic layer cake I'm willing
to answer questions about all the rest
of us and don't know if there's anything
else here's the summary that you saw
earlier so the summary really includes
these two pieces one is the connection
with community and culture to knowledge
representation which is not a solved
problem there are lots and lots of
things yet to be dealt with the other
one is keeping track of shifts in how
these communities form as the
architecture of the internet changes and
so two solutions watch it one is to
identify authentic events use machine
learning to understand where the
boundaries of communities are when
somebody issues a query say which
community are interested in the answer
from or here are two solutions this is
what this community thinks this is what
this community thinks for example so I
think that's about it
think about the ESP game the the one for
the collaborative labeling is if I I
suspect and of course I have no way of
doing it you could imagine of
identifying where the communities are
that are playing that game reside and
then start to think about partitioning
them somehow but if you don't it's kind
of like a monoculture labeling those
images so if I'm if I'm sitting there
using image search that has been
constructed by a monoculture I'm going
to get really frustrated because what I
think of when I search for a particular
word I'm not going to get back the
results I expect so that's it's the
effect of a monoculture but finding
those monocultures is not easy but you
have the data to at least start to do
that so if you look at the when when
moran shows the new visitors the
visualization of the languages and the
query activity on the globe that you
come in right you even have that data to
help identify things and then start to
look for differences between those
communities so distinguished and
culturally so it's so it's not it's not
complicated it's not a complicated
concept but it can be an insidious one
right I don't like watching CNN and when
I'm in Canada i turn on our CNN CBC
right it's sort of like cultural
diversity if nothing else right to be
diplomatic about there so that's what i
mean by sort of the monoculture problem
i told the guys in beijing that they
were they were a significant part with
that example of making google a
worldwide company not a mountain view
company for example yep in some sense
part of the storytelling this kind of a
long story yep for example medical data
Amelia list of these nervous
transformations because nobody dies of
apoplexy anymore right nobody dies of
dyspepsia that those were legitimate
causes of death out of years ago and
we've got those datasets going all the
way back and so the question really
becomes as we continue this forward that
subject is changes in semantics you know
interpretation drift and all my stuff
yeah mechanisms for dealing with that
other than soda social networks
local cultures of interpretation it's a
really good question because one of the
ideas that I sort of rebel against is
the is that we're working on an ontology
and we haven't quite got it right yet
and and what I'd say never get it right
now and my argument is you don't get it
right but but but what you've said is
that you must track those changes right
so you must learn to build tools that
say here's how the meaning of these
things have shifted over time find fine
milestones of shiftin for example we
talked about apoplexy and dyspepsia well
these are not serious diseases anymore
here are milestones that say we
understand them it changed the culture
of how we refer to them and integrate
them into medical practice for example
so I think that that's important we
can't we can't do that with the massive
volume of data we have without hat
without using some kind of simple at
least simple machine learning to do
classification and look for distinctions
between histories of data that's why I
put up the little thing with google
trends said you know that there is the
start of something there that talks
about temporal indexing but its temporal
indexing over vocabulary change for
example I think that's really important
to watch for miles don't changes sort of
the easy case in sometimes I mean the
harder cases you know there are still
countries in the world where people do
not die of AIDS yep because that's not
allowed in this country right yeah we
could work on rotated yeah yeah so
that's a more difficult probably seen
that transition in South Africa from the
it doesn't exist and 20 maybe it does
exist yeah absolutely I think you're
right those are really challenging
problems and the reason that I tried to
make them as simple as i did is i'm
trying to connect them to my technical
background in representation saying what
can i do and to provide tools that will
allow me to start tackling some of these
really tough problems i want to look at
at broad temporal databases and isolate
change in them that's based on those
kinds of things for example and i think
we can't do that we're kind of lost at
building up that semantic layer cake
that's the hypothesis anyway
from when you're talking about the sin
being situated or controllers both the
day that you have that you're gonna
potentially we're sorry yes as well as
what you're trying to yes part of it is
it seems like the user can also be
depending on the culture ID so one level
we're in the United States oral language
wise that's one thing but that make you
go into the cultural differences between
someone and say their upbringing yes
very giving them different regions of
the United States yes I guess the how do
you yeah are you again how you have
their different layers for this and has
a lot of truth to be able to separate
out these right so so something that I
said nothing about but that but that
user modeling is at least a start to is
is you model you're asking a question
about the user themself come from an
immersive some immersion in some culture
that you can find distinctions in right
so you have to model both sides I think
you're right you have to model both
sides that's tough because we tend to
mean this is one of the claims i have
about the user modeling communities they
tend to overfit and overfitting means
overfitting to an individual right it's
much better to fit two classes and do
that but you need need to find the data
boundaries and decide what data you can
gather from so you and i you sitting
there might generate queries that we
could eventually distinguish our
cultural backgrounds for but i don't
know how to I don't know how to solve
the practical security ethical
impediments to do that but i think
that's right you do that when you click
the yes button on any of these websites
that you enroll to that creates an
authentic event that puts you in a
digital community right you can't you
have to behave this way in this
community you have to accept all of
these terms that flash by and say that
but you also do that in educational
context right so if you do interactive
computer intelligent computer aided
instruction is maybe what it's called
this day you explicitly subscribe to
modeling each individual user and you
look for misfits between how they
understand
modernized content that so what if it
wasn't homogenized content and the
problems harder but I think it's part of
the structure that you need to address
your issue I just it's really hard right
but you can start we have all of these
tools that we can start with if we only
think that it's important to distinguish
those cultural communities slide early
on many shows you know the growth of
this manic left towards 23-point oh I
see a man that end up hope the existing
relationship between Google and the in
for a search engine end user and then
the semantics and Memphis I approaching
wall yeah I know time so like I said
when you want to sublet my see this
diagram yep about semantics support yep
and then I go to the examples you're
talking about example seem to be in the
form of I need information is relevant
to me as an individual to me as a member
of the community to enable the
communities to global information but as
far as as the semantic support and and
web through 10 are concerned that the
problems that hearing and talk about
don't seem that they seem to be much
more concrete I'm not I'm not I don't
have a connection between the problems
that you're talking about my their
semantic support and why web 3.0 is what
that even means in a sense in terms of
we just want our applications to be more
related to individuals and the cultures
and have individuals and cultures
contribute to them why is why semantic
support okay why is that a semantic
problem as far as the architecture why
is that not just personalizing our our
online services ok so I'm a and there's
a lot of senses in which I haven't been
clear about that connection so let me
try to redress that in the following way
is that I don't believe this is easy to
fine so this is just kind of a
caricature of other people saying that
oh well web 3.0 is coming it's can solve
all your problems with web 2.0 not
knowing that either one of those could
be distinguished in any meaningful way
but the notion of semantic support for
me isn't in understanding the individual
it's in giving the individual access to
and by identifying separate communities
to say I'm searching for something and I
have a query language what is the answer
to this query from the perspective of
this trusted digital community so if you
like it's saying that that whenever I
create an abstraction of data that is
metadata there are different ways of
doing it be careful to distinguish them
so that me as a user can say what does
the Palestinian community think about
this issue so so when mayor and I are
talking about the the individual and the
connection to things that was that was
going all the way to fitting to an
individual user what their view of this
data was I actually don't think that's
very useful in this context what I think
is useful is identifying communities
which have distinct perspectives on
things so the vocabulary that they use
is different maybe slightly different if
it's in another language maybe the
translation comes out differently in one
query than it does when I type it in the
native language and that that gets
different kinds of retrieval so it's
having access as a user over here too
not to say so it was somebody that it
left there said that was talking about
multiple communities that you can't ever
get it right there is no way to simply
improve the engineering of an ontology
in the semantic layer cake that improves
search quality because there is
ambiguity in the content and so what you
want is a different perspective so I
want I want some kind of way of
classifying those communities and saying
I'm asking a question just give me all
the answers I am really interested in
finding out what this kind of community
thinks about this so let me give you let
me
Kate an example I want to know what
people think about this consumer product
I would like be like to be able to
direct that question filtered from an
ebay perspective of articles so no sold
only in the United States as I suspect
that perspective would be different for
the same kinds of articles sold
elsewhere in the world for example so
two different communities issue the same
query and look and compare the results
so it's not modeling me it's giving me
access to a different perspective on
substrate of data something sense to
reformulate what you're saying yeah it's
in the existing model it's a
responsibility of a search engine to
internationalize to define communities
to set up the black boxes to which you
can go into and you're saying you would
like to make possible for users to
contribute to the creation of
communities that the near term you're
learning for machine learning yeah I'd
saying well I'm a I'm a French speaker
in in California I'm looking for
products site related to this and
whereas now you can't do that because it
requires someone in Google that I've
come up with that distinction and in
fact i think that there's even a sense
in which i think that that you're
looking at a grander problem i would
just be happy to be able to find simple
ways of classifying well delimited
community so i can at least see them
emerge when I make this query so that's
why i remember i had the sliders but the
sliders might be digital right they
might be they might be really simple so
the local global search thing that
microsoft says or we want to find things
in the whole wide world or just on your
desktop or the buy-sell the by research
thing of mindset yahoo there's no reason
for a slider because you have no idea
what it means halfway in between anyway
right but you want to buy us at somehow
and what i'm saying is is I would like
to be able to look at the best results
of the simplest machine learning tools
doing classification on the largest
volume of data to draw boundaries
between those communities that at least
I can faithfully interpret so it's even
it's even simpler than what you said
your goal is grander
it's more important but I think that we
have the tools to start building those
things and finding them but that's why
from this language instruction thing
this notion of authentic material really
grabbed me it grabbed me in the sense if
I know if I can confirm what an
authentic event is in the same way that
I can avoid spoofing of IP addresses and
people gathering my data all that other
kind of stuff that's highly technical
from the communications literature then
I have an attribute that will help me
learn that community if you like so I
think that we have all of those pieces
there what I don't want to do is use a
search engine that denies its existence
and thinks that if just by working
harder in the background and building
better inference and better blackbox
structuring of the data that it's going
to get better so the notion of generic
search quality right for me doesn't it
becomes less appealing as the world gets
more complicated so yeah your your
description of it is what I think in its
but its grandeur so you're have a
tougher time achieving it thanks for
your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
