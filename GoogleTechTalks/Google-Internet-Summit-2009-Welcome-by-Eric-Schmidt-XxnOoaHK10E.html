Schmidt the CEO of Google for taking
time out of an extremely busy schedule
to offer a few thoughts and to welcome
you here to to our campus Eric hardly
needs an introduction but I can tell you
that he has in a remarkable history of
involvement in technology and its use he
was the CTO and sun microsystems for
some years became the CEO of Novell
where I'm sure he engaged in an
incredible battle between the internet
world and the ipx world it was that
split the company in many respects and
then had the good fortune or good sense
or both to come to Google to to lead
this company for the last eight or nine
years he has been a spokesperson for the
value of technology and its impact on
our society on our economy in our
ability to utilize information if
there's any person who personalizes
personifies our motto which you heard
earlier today which is organizing the
world's information and making it
universally accessible and useful it's
eric who somehow manages to keep that
fixed in his mind while he's trying to
manage this burgeoning enterprise that
started with two people ten years ago
and now number is over 20,000 as you
probably are deeply aware eric is also
involved heavily in advising not only
the US government but other governments
as they struggle to absorb the impact of
technological change so Eric I'm not
going to take up any more of your
airtime let me thank you profusely for
joining us this afternoon and turn the
microphone over to you thank you
after a picture of vented me Ottawa
that's right the when I was a young
executive it's uh I was asked who did I
most admire in the entire world and that
person has been surf and if you think
I'm making that up son was foolish
enough to actually make a huge poster
with my picture stating this with his
image which they gave us as a memento so
vent in my mind represents the very best
of humanity kind of selfless dedication
to a clause that I think all of us have
worked hard to be able to do for such a
long time there are other people in the
room who I feel are perhaps not as
well-known would have had the same
principle Advent has articulated so well
over his over his long life and it's
clear to me that the Internet is unique
because of the people who founded and
ran it and largely established the set
of principles that I want to talk about
for a few minutes so first my goal here
is to welcome you guys to to Google I
think most of you have been here before
and they Google employees you know where
you are but they're from our perspective
it's obvious that the Internet is
essentially everything to us when I
think about my career and the things
that I've been able to do they've all
fundamentally started from the concept
of DARPA the concept of tcp/ip are the
kinds of things that you could do with
openness in my early career with UNIX
and unix-like and so forth and so on and
subsequent activities and what I'd like
about it is it's all the same theme it's
the same of openness of growth and of
sort of creating new things and if you
think about what we care about right now
at Google the first and most important
thing and I don't mean this to sound
defensive as we care that it stays this
way and I want to come back to some of
the threats to this let's start with
some of the opportunities it's clear
that the that the Moore's Law revolution
will continue in a particular as applied
to fiber optics and routers and so forth
is not slowing down it may slow down in
10 to 15 years but we've got a fair
amount ahead of us some people in the
room or involved in some of the amazing
things going on at the hardware and
routing level which we think absolutely
makes sense this is the ISO stack and
all those kinds of things all those
things and there's a long time ago still
work it's nice to see the things that
you learn in graduate school you still
don't need to learn something new is
still the same principles work and it's
nice to see it actually get to where it
can be we have in front of us huge
networks of CPUs disk drives complex
routers simple switches and so forth
that combined into a new model which we
generally call cloud computing you all
understand what this is but think of it
as web computing applied to the historic
model sorry that I like to talk about is
in the 1980s Gartner group invented
three-tier computing when you have a
marketing consultancy inventing a
computer architecture you know you have
a problem and the reason they did that
is that nobody could get anything to
work because the network's weren't open
the standards weren't set and so forth
and it took us a very long time to get
to the point where the modern and open
principles of the internet that we also
celebrate are now capable of use in
applications platforms integration and
so forth and so on so when I when I sat
down and I look at it and I go back in
my own history and see the narrative I
see this constant progression of growth
at each and every level
the things that we need to take
advantage of now are the enormous
platform that has been created so let's
define the platform let's start with a
billion plus people God knows how many
computer is you all a familiar you saw
some of the numbers this morning and
every one of those is an opportunity for
better accuracy that our service better
application what's interesting to me is
that we're at another if you will
tipping or influence point because the
internet is no longer something which
was sort of our toy space if interesting
fun people got would public on it and so
forth and so on it's now become
essential and it's sufficiently
essential that it's now threatening the
very fabric of certain industries and
the most obvious example has to do with
traditional telephony and traditional
radio and frequency management the
distinction between radio and television
is obviously artificial if you think
about it in the context of fiber optics
and tcp/ip right why is this all not one
set of information expressed in
different ways it's obvious if you think
about it that way and yet we have 50
years of regulatory business structure
and so forth around that the whole
principle of openness and the whole
notion of no constraints think about the
internet the internet is really about no
scarcity well almost all businesses
certainly in the media industries are
based on scarcity they have windows and
restrictions and rules and so forth and
so on and yet consumers those pesky
obnoxious consumers actually just want
what they want when they want and this
is causing a huge identity crisis for
people who basically ran their
businesses without their end user as
their principal at Google is by no means
perfect here but our basic objective is
to start from the premise of what is
vestiges of the consumer and I can tell
you that in my experience talking to
consumers is they want everything they
want it now they want it right and they
want a perfect okay seems pretty
straightforward so what do we just
deliver on that
actually actually with actually with
they want us to pay you at this point
but but you see my point it's a very
very different model so go through the
industries that have been affected by
this and you begin to understand the
game that we're now playing is no longer
just entertaining it's really very very
serious businesses that are built around
scarcity are going to fight openness and
their do it in many many different ways
businesses that depend on scarcity in
particular licensing feel particularly
like the free notion that that has ended
up being so popular on the internet and
we face many many threats but I suspect
the biggest threats have to do with
trying to close off the openness and the
end-to-end principles that have built
internet still strongly and so well the
ones I'm worried about have to do with
governments because they're the cut you
know it's a shock I used to do this
thing when I that son I have a surprise
for you what there's a criminal on the
internet and I'd go and they go like how
do you know said because there's
criminals not on the internet okay and
if I knew who they were I'd have them
arrested okay unfortunate i don't know
who they are because they haven't
committed a crime yet right and this
seems obvious today but it was a new
concept ten years ago so if you build
something which touches all of society
you have to deal with that fact and so
the fact of the matter is that because
of one reason or another people are
using these things as excuses to try to
put in very very significant changes
into the way we might operate in the
future and that's something that we need
to think about the best solution would
be to come up with a technological
solution which would do quote the right
thing but remain the openness retain the
openness the worst thing is to
essentially have as a result large
islands of closed information which will
be a significant step back
so from a Google perspective what we
care about is we care about scalability
you care about access and we care about
transparency my assertion to you is that
if you can build networks that are
roughly open transparent and scalable
we're rough and again they're always
going to be edge conditions but they're
basically where the next set of
innovators can build the next category
of applications you can talk about that
later this afternoon but as long as
that's true we're going to be just fine
because ultimately I'm an optimist about
the way people behave in society I'm one
of these people who believes that the
the overall human condition is a
positive one that people really do want
the world to be a better place and that
the remarkable achievement that all of
you helped build vinton course but many
others but that will continue that
there's no particular reason for us to
think other than very we are very
optimistic that we can overcome the
challenges whether it's a politician who
doesn't understand something because we
can talk to them or a government that's
not elected that behaves badly and we
have a set of those at any given time
but we can overcome these with both
talking fighting and their technology so
then that was sort of my my opening
comments thank you did you did you want
to take you in big dick I'm your you're
my host so whatever you want this is a
golden opportunity folks as I saw you
didn't say the S word yeah security suck
yeah so what's your the content of
sending bought by oracle is still
something that i'm working through in my
own mind no such as this prick SS in
security so what what would be your
answer to how given the other three
parameters you would like to see that a
pro
what are the other three parameters the
ones I is innovation the other so I
still believe public key cryptosystems
are the right answer I believe this 20
years ago and they still are not in
widespread use it except for certain
kind of key key uses I don't understand
why we have been so slow at using the
technology that is existed for so long
you don't like the again pgp you name it
and we've accepted in society that we
have routine locks on houses which can
be broken by sophisticated locksmith but
they provide enough thing I do not
understand why attitudinally we haven't
addressed that coherently in tcp/ip and
in the systems above it it seems obvious
to me that the kind of simple
straightforward encryption chips or
circuits could be reasonable ubiquitous
that would provide enough security
against normal interlopers I'm not
talking about the sophisticated attacks
I think my guess is the problem is we
have the brilliant security people who
basically try to solve the problem
definitively and then we have the other
people who don't understand what they're
talking about and that the mid the
middle of that which is a routine and
common easygoing security that worked
against teenagers who weren't too smart
right that that would be a huge
improvement again I'm not talking about
very sophisticated attacks by very
sophisticated us which I think will
require different my face and whip Erick
might try to answer the question of
course I think it's more a capital
development problem than anything else
if you feel the key management
infrastructure you have a lot of up
costs and a lot of downstream rewards
and if you look at the way the central
facility at NSA works it's capitalized
entirely differently that's what one key
aspect of it but the other is our
problem is much harder because diversity
of authority is the bane of security DoD
is very large the fact it so
realized makes make security much easier
for them even though they think it's
more difficult because the demand very
nice time and I'm also one of these
people who believes that security is
achieved by having multiple stages so
again my position on security is
relatively simple layers of systems are
probably good enough for most things
yeah so Craig partridge hi okay um so I
had a completely different question
which is you know Google is now running
some of the world's largest compute farm
I was always to the largest maybe the
lightest but I was just you know like
being your usual quite self right um one
of the things that seems to be going on
if you track close the industrial
literature and some of the research
literature so those are becoming their
own network ecosystems yes that they are
running their own specialized network
protocols that they are and one of the
interesting things as they seem to be
rediscovering certain errors that we
made 15 years ago and the question is
how do you see that evolution for
grassing in some sense that's sort of
the set of private internets that are
sort of hidden away yet this their huge
part of the economic driver this is why
my job is so easy we're redoing
everything we did 10 or 15 years ago
just at a different scale but you have
all the same problems latency
reliability and so forth it's just you
know three or reserve attitude faster
and in our case to some degree cloud
computing is a return to mainframe
computing you have all the issues of
management revocation who may you know
how do you deal with user is how do you
do with building all those kinds of
things I think from our perspective we
benefit from the fact the pc industry
has standardized on very fast ethernet
chips basically and so you think of our
architecture as pcs with ethernet chips
with very very fast protocol drivers so
we will for example use the fact that
tcp/ip has windows in it and things like
that in clever ways architectural way i
don't think you should generalize from
google's experience to everybody else
because our data needs are so large we
ultimately find ourselves building
specialized solutions but that doesn't
follow that everyone else
to the same thing literally the amounts
of data that we move around are so much
larger than everybody else's well well
yes but this is rumored running around I
know if it's true enough that that half
of Cisco's high-end routers are now
being sold into data centers which are
large quantum anning large coin is a day
they may not be a Google size but
interesting I should look at that as an
ecosystem use trying to say that's a
pretty big financial and intellectual
ecosystem potentially but Cisco is very
good at routers right right so they're
probably figuring out all that all the
sudden the subtle issues the only
fundamental difference within a data
center is that you have better control
over over the speed of light because you
understand your physical locality you
have all the other issues but I've
argued for a long time that you know
that basically computation speed is
ultimately constrained by speed of light
we had this funny story where we're
building a data center and we're having
this debate as to whether it had to be
one story two stories or three stories
based on the speed of light to the
central oh and I thought God this is
where we have gotten and by the way the
answer turns out to be that the topology
that was being used this highly
proprietary was suitable for a one-story
design thank you you mentioned you
brought up cloud computing which is rich
really a good point tickling in context
rebuilding things that we may not have
done right 10 15 years ago there was a
big debate at a at RSA a couple weeks
ago about cloud computing and and the
fact that security is not being built
into it as we're starting to do the
architecture for security excuse me for
cloud computing can you comment on where
your perspective is on that is it indeed
a priority to say we're going to build
build the pki into cloud computing we're
going to do all the other things we need
to be doing on top the gate I don't know
enough of the answer to give you a
precise technical answer cloud computing
as we express it of course everyone
because it's now a buzzword and
marketing everyone is now define it in
their own terms we define it as
essentially html5 web web browser
applications with a back-end server that
uses TCP IP is in an RPC
in the obvious way so the answer to your
question depends on where you think
security should lie do you think it
should be at the application layer or do
you think it should be a Sam middleware
layer below that the applications can
use I think it's too early to really
know it's very strategic for us that
people build think of them as Ajax
applications Ajax plus plus with all of
the extensions and so for there being
prevented represented because that
displaces the traditional PC dedicated
client architecture it's much more
flexible in all the ways that you know
the data is in the right places and so
forth so I don't know how I don't know
how security will play out I'm not aware
within Google of a lot of activity at
the applications level in security
because the the kinds of questions
you're asked are still relatively early
so maybe we should fix that people know
that's that's the ffs laughs right thank
you very much Steve Buerger yeah you're
heavily involved besides of Google with
representing Silicon Valley to
Washington and providing advice can you
say something about the dynamics of that
where what's been active and and where
the access is what the dialogue looks
like well a couple of things first I I
think people here the room know that I
was a significant supporter of President
Obama as a candidate I should disclose
that right up front because I felt that
this was a candidate for president who
actually understood technology and
believed in science which to me was
revolutionary and right so that's like a
big deal so far President Obama has done
all of the things that a person who's
not a scientist but who believes in
science would have done within his first
week he very quickly and carefully
reversed anti-science policies that
exist in the previous administration in
the stimulus package there was an
increase in in science funding and
technology funding that was extremely
significant so for example NSF budget
was doubled the NIH buzzes were doubled
as well and these are going to to high
quality organizations then from my
perspective
hit and I think the government has been
dealing with the banks and all the other
issues everybody knows and so the
Science and Technology agenda has
largely been a secondary thing and I
think they'll get back to that if you
look at the president's advisors on
science they're all top-notch on a
critical John Holdren or that vet sort
of whole team so there's hope that that
the institution of government will now
have a set of places where they can
actually get some accurate accurate and
technol technically correct advice
before they make whatever political
decisions are going to meg so I think
it's a in that sense it's a new dawn
it's not obvious that it follows that
all the policy prescriptions are the
same is what you or I we want in other
words the fact that there's accuracy
does not necessarily mean that they'll
choose to do the right things so for
example with banking the obvious
solution in banking is transparency
because all the computers knew what the
risk profiles were but somehow the
government hasn't figured out a way to
suck all that information out of the
banks and publish the the nature of
risks so they have these manual
processes and so forth around banking
tests I think one of things that we
could do as a group is going back to
this transparency thing is to tell the
government that why don't you make what
you're doing more transparent so for
example why don't you make all your
hearings webcast it's trivial why don't
you have all the Opera what did you have
all the groups within the government
have their equivalent of YouTube
channels and Facebook pages and that
kind of stuff I think that's coming but
it's not natural to the government in
many ways it's worth saying to me that
about any government independent of
politically these governments are not
typically in favor of transparency
because it causes the bureaucracy the
opportunity to be embarrassed and so it
takes it takes an act of the president
and active Senate or Congress to force
that and we need to give them the
examples so televised all the
information publish all the data make it
available and I think we'll get a better
we'll get a better functioning
government will also be able to have a
better sense of checks and balances by
citizens who care a lot about things
so with that I think that really does
have hope so thank you so thank you very
much again Eric one thing I wanted to
emphasize is a comment that was made to
me in 1994 by George Soros he was
addressing a meeting of the internet
society it was an inet meeting in 1994
in Prague and sorrow said remember he
came from a communist dominated country
he lived in a place where freedom didn't
exist and he made the observation about
the internet that just because it's been
free up until now and open does not mean
it will stay that way and I thought it
very important to remind you of that
because I think he's right and that's a
lead-in into the next session which is
all about security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
