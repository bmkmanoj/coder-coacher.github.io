recently joined Google Android as native
Chinese I was very fascinated by Tom's
work Chinese ethnic group classification
it's actually interesting from a
computer science point of view today
that how would you classify people into
who have been living you know that of
length four thousand thousand years how
do you divide them into different ethnic
groups what features would you use is
the language in speech speak is the
proximity in geography or is it the
clothes they wear or how they marry what
features do you use to classify them
with different categories and finally
the most formal study of this that how
officially was nineteen fifties with
pretty important political political
ramifications in terms of representation
even though most of the first things you
see families China was talking but still
was important for all groups groups to
be represented and he traced and
analyzed how that project went and it
was fascinating but today he's going to
talk about another topic that he's just
expanding which actually is interesting
to me because as a research scientist
have devoted a big portion of my career
and study how to enter information into
computers and Tom study shows that much
of this work we do today on mobile
phones on touchscreens actually twice
for Channel five for Chinese engineers
and inventors have done in the past many
decades so I'm very pleased to be able
to invite him today so please welcome
thank you very much can you all hear me
okay excellent so it's a great pleasure
to be here and an honor and I want to
thank Schumann joy for inviting me to
speak with you today the the talk of the
paper has changed many many times many
iterations so we're gonna keep the main
title of a Chinese typewriter in Silicon
Valley but the subtitle has changed a
little bit from the abstract to how
Chinese typists invented predictive text
during the height of Mao ISM to give you
a little bit of context the broader set
of questions that I'm working on right
now in a in a book I guess tentatively
titled the Chinese typewriter a global
history is a broader story of 19th and
20th century China which pretty closely
connected to the history of European
euro American imperialism is is the
question of how to render compatible how
to render the Chinese language
compatible with a set of information
technologies such as the Telegraph the
typewriter and and later forms which
almost in their DNA
have been so closely connected to
alphabets or more generally speaking two
languages with a very limited set of
modules be they alphabets or syllabaries
and so there was during the 19th century
and 20th century and even today this
very fundamental question that I posed
up here is Chinese script not the
language as a whole but is script the
Chinese script Chinese characters are
they compatible with modernity or must
they be jettisoned so that China can
modernize and this was a major question
in the 19th and 20th centuries with many
people saying no we have to get rid of
characters use English even Esperanto in
order to modernize and and many even
more who saw who used the imagery of the
Chinese typewriter in particular as kind
of proof of this I say proof and
italicized that with my voice so as to
say that the proof came and these sorts
of concocted imagined ideas of what a
Chinese typewriter must theoretically
look like that would be a
an immense machine with thousands of
keys upon which it takes even five
people to type and so forth and so you
see some of the earliest and most
derogatory and racist perceptions of
this from the turn of the century that
top one is from an article in 1900 all
the way through the kind of dregs of
b-movie culture with the Tom Selleck
movie the Chinese typewriter into the
famous dance coined by MC Hammer and you
can't touch this known as the Chinese
typewriter that dance was called because
it was meant to mimic what a typist must
look like as they move across a massive
keyboard into the Simpsons and so forth
so that is to say that within this story
of the question can is Chinese are
Chinese characters compatible with
modernity the Chinese typewriter in
particular became a kind of icon for
those who said no it's not and it's a
surprisingly durable I con and what I'm
here to talk about today is that
parallel to this story there is a a far
richer more significant and interesting
story of those who did not give up on
this idea that Chinese characters could
be compatible or rendered compatible
with technologies designed without
Chinese in mind and I'm charting in my
own work the kind of larger history
about this involving Chinese telegraphy
type writing Braille and indexing
systems and so forth but I'm going to
talk with you about today if I had to
kind of make this relevant for for a an
audience that is obviously very
interested in in deep history but it's
also setting out to build things and
make things is that when I see the
Chinese typewriter I don't see this I
see a machine whose history is an
incredible repository of design
inspiration and some of the most
eccentric and brilliant innovation most
of which never saw the light of day
never materialized into forms but some
of the most brilliant and and and
penetrating analysis and innovation of
human machine interaction of input of
data structuring and
and many other dimensions and so in
particular what I want to talk about
today is a kind of episode that takes
place in the 1950s in China and this is
going to be the sort of context and I
will be explaining this in a bit this is
a few snapshots of different Chinese
typewriters in the 20th century
the episode comes from November of 1956
in the pages of the most the most widely
circulated Chinese newspaper the
people's daily which featured an article
in in that fall one of the fall issues
of a typist in the city of Lou young in
China that had performed this
unparalleled feat and was reported to
have using a Chinese typewriter whose
operation I'll explain in a second using
a Chinese typewriter had typed at speeds
verging on 80 characters per minute
now I invite you not to immediately
compare that to QWERTY input or things
like that because there I'm gonna try to
explain that they're largely irrelevant
comparisons but the important comparison
is how fast had a typewriter a Chinese
typewriter been at that point roughly
speaking if you look at a lot of the
archival documents teaching manuals and
so forth in the 20s 30s 40s 50s and on
the average typing speed at this moment
was about 20 to 30 characters per minute
so this thing this this event this
person in doing this if it was real
represented a three three-fold increase
in speed of input if you can think of it
that way without any substantial changes
to the kind of mechanism of the machine
this was not a new typewriter this was
some sort of change that had taken place
to the existing machine now to give you
a sense of how the machine works how
these various models appear work you'll
notice that there are there's a tray bed
if you see right here in the clearest
model here there's a tray bed on the
1960s double pigeon model of 35
characters by 70 characters these are
free-floating metal slugs if you were to
pick up this tray and turn it over they
would all fall out there is a tray
select a selector that can operate along
an XY axis
and actually can XY and then the tray
bed itself which can move left and right
along one axis and so you kind of move
both bring the selector in positions
push down on the lever and the the
something pokes up the slug from the
bottom it is grabbed inked it strikes
the surface of the platen and then it's
returned in the same location that's the
basic functioning of these machines now
then so if you can imagine this is about
this is two thousand four hundred fifty
characters so the most important
dimension of this is taxonomy is the
organization and disposition of these
characters now the way that in the 1920s
and 30s and 40s characters on the on the
on the machine had been organized will
be very familiar to any anyone in the
room who reads or speaks Chinese but for
those of you who don't excuse me it was
the system known as the radical stroke
system and basically this system which
dates back to the Ming Dynasty
popularized in the Ching dynasty that is
into roughly around the 16th to 17th to
18th centuries we're talking about is a
system by which the tens of thousands of
characters in the Chinese language are
subdivided into a set of 214 classes or
categories based on the primary
component out of which the character is
built so for example one category of
these 214 is the person radical category
the shape here and here are some
examples of characters that fit within
it that are built out of it another
radical class is the water radical class
here these three strokes and you can see
two characters that would fit into that
and then within each class the
characters are organized according to
the number of strokes it takes to
produce them so the character Toth
meaning he would come before the
character duel because it it takes more
strokes of the pen or the brush to write
the character and so this is the way
that dictionaries have been organized
and the way the typewriter had been
organized what the article in 1956
suggested was that this typist in the
city of Long had departed had kind of
taken a radical departure if you will
from this system and reorganized the
tray bed according to a natural language
arrangement and so if
we give if we take a sample a very small
sample of the twenty five hundred or so
characters those of you who don't read
Chinese follow with me now the yellow
the highlighted yellow characters the
character Tong and the important thing
about this is that unlike the previous
organization which in which that
character would have been put next to
characters it has nothing to do with in
this reorganization of the tray bed in
1950s all of the adjacent or many of the
adjacent characters in the Moores
neighborhood the eight cells around it
where the disposition of those was such
that they could be combined with the
character Tong in order to produce a
real word most words in Chinese are
actually made of two characters not one
and so for example this carrot the
yellow character and it can be combined
with what's below it tongfu meaning at
the same time to the right tongue see in
the same period and then inverted lee
with the character above it gong home
meaning shared and then if you can do
this with each of the characters on this
every character is both a center and a
periphery can being combined or combined
a bowl with everything around it and you
know we have to when we look at an
article like this from the people's
daily which we have to be very careful
we have to be very careful as historians
not to believe what we read and and kind
of follow up there had been many stories
of model workers and then in the in the
height of mao ISM model model laborers
who out produce their quota model
farmers who out produce their grain
quota and here we have a model typist
who had out produced they're typing
quota their character quota so we have
to be very careful here but
interestingly is having spent quite a
long time checking up on this we see
that this actually happened and was I'm
going to suggest here one of the
earliest implementations of a system of
kind of techno linguistic system that we
now think of as predictive text or
natural language arrangement or however
we want to we want to describe it so
more broadly I think before I get into
the nitty-gritty of this I think it's
pretty self-evident but let me spell it
out that
if this is true then what this alerts us
to is the need to look very much more
seriously at techno linguistic
innovation in three contexts where we
don't often go looking for it
China the Chinese language and in in
this case mechanical pre-computer
pre-computer system at the very least
predictive text is not associated with
Chinese language not associated with
innovations in China and is certainly
very rarely or ever associated with
things in the pre pre computer
Information Age so if we if we we have
to begin by asking the question this
will be relevant here in a second the
the primary innovation that I'm talking
about here is obviously not a not the
design of a new machine but a new
interface this is a new interface
between a Chinese typist and the machine
and so we have to ask the question was
there a context for this typist in law
yung to kind of pick up and move around
the modules on this interface was this a
total radical a totally radical act very
unprecedented act or was there a context
for this and there was a context for
this and the simple the simple framework
for this is that unlike the story of the
typewriter and specifically the semiotic
interface of a typewriter in every other
part of the world be it let's let's
refer to languages more particularly be
it English French Italian Russian Hebrew
Thai Cambodian Arabic and so forth in
the story of which the semiotic
interface of each of these typewriters
at some point stabilized into QWERTY as
their tea and squirts and so forth that
the story of the the machine interface
of the Chinese typewriter never
stabilized was never meant to stabilize
and was understood as as something that
would constantly need to be adjusted or
changed by the operator through a
constant process of optimization why is
that the reason for this is comes in the
fact that
the basic put this up here that the
basic structure of the Chinese
typewriter was based on the system
called common usage so there are many
more than two thousand four hundred five
hundred two thousand four hundred fifty
characters in Chinese there are tens of
thousands the idea of the common usage
Chinese typewriter and that's what we're
talking about is to select the most
frequently used characters and to put
them on the tray bed and then the rest
of them would either be in a box about
five thousand characters of less
commonly used characters and then
anything else beyond that would have to
be written by hand
okay now the sort of the issue for us
here is that no matter how perfectly you
chose this these two thousand four
hundred fifty characters no one set
would be perfect for every given context
in a police office versus a bank the
common usage character would be
different from one to the other and so
therefore a typist in a police office
police office would have to take an
uncommon character and put it on the
tray bed and the same thing for a typist
in a bank or a government office and so
forth the other there's a diachronic or
a temporal part of this optimization
story which is that for a moment to
moment common usage characters fell out
of existence uncommon characters became
common and some some prime examples of
that pertain to the administrative
geography of China so for example in the
in the teens and early 20s there was a
province known as some sorry as a Julie
Julie province so but so the characters
Jun and Lee both appear on the machine
in the teens after roughly nine the mid
20s the province of Julie was abolished
as an administrative region and was
divided into a set of new provinces now
what happens to the tray bed the
character G is very very common in many
many many other Chinese words and so it
was kept the character Lee is very
uncommon on its own and so it was
jettisoned the same thing happened with
the province known as funky n which no
longer exists and after this transition
you can compare the tray beds and see
that the character TN which means sky
very very common is kept
and the character which means Fung which
means to present something to a superior
was a very very uncommon character in
and so it was jettisoned so this is all
to say that there was a kind of built in
already a built-in kind of churning
optimization process in which these
operators in 1956 would have been
operating it's very interesting that so
actually let me let me let me tell you a
little bit more about the structure of
the tray bed here here are three
different tray beds from three different
periods just to get this impression in
your mind the red region are the most
commonly used characters all of these
are commonly used but these are the most
common use characters and then the dark
blue or the kind of purplish regions are
the secondarily common usage and I'll
talk about the kind of light blue in a
second so there was even a structuring
of frequency within the tray bed that
will become relevant in just a moment
now what's interesting about this is
it's not just the optimization of the
machine was not simply at the level of
the tray bed and the disposition of
characters on it it was also a question
of how a Chinese typist would would
undergo training and how they train
their body and to put this in a
comparative context again because it's
it's it's helps illustrate the point in
in Roman alphabet or Cyrillic or Hebrew
or Arabic or so forth typing the ideal
state of being when you are typing is
known as blind typing if you are sitting
there staring at the keyboard you better
go and practice a bit more you know your
the idea is that you can look at the
manuscript or the text and then have a
kind of non visual relationship with the
interface and just go this this this way
of interacting with the machine makes a
lot of sense in alphabetic and syllabic
languages and makes no sense and was
never endorsed in the case of chinese
typewriting for the chinese typist and i
put up some various typing manuals from
different points in twentieth-century
chinese history actually emphasized the
need for the typist to refine to ever
greater and greater ability their vision
and their memory and their peripheral
vision and I'll give one example the
idea one of one of the most
and parts of being a good typist was to
always be anticipating both cognitively
and somatically the next character the
next character the next character so if
you were to go to one character that is
all the way over to the right of a tray
bed I know that my laser point doesn't
work very well let's say you need a
character over here and then you know
you're looking at the manuscript you see
the next character and you realize that
it's over here you need to start kind of
orienting your body in such a way
getting ready to move it back in that
direction you know and if you don't do
that you'll still be able to type but
you'll type very slowly so that is to
say that even in the training of the
Chinese typist because of the the sort
of almost built-in affordances and
limitations constraints and abilities of
the machine that we see an analog to
this in the in the way that a typist
would train in in China as opposed to
many other techno linguistic context one
other very quick example that I like
very much pertains to the what those of
you who've read any dairy Dawa know as
materiality of signifiers and in a more
concrete sense means that the the typist
would have to adjust the strength the
force that they use to press down on the
typing lever depending upon the number
of strokes in the character because the
number of strokes in the character
translated directly into the weight of
the character and so what some
characters are one stroke like the
character II meaning one is just one
horizontal stroke and then there's
another one for Dragon long which has
many more than 20 strokes if you use the
dragon strength force on the character
one you could puncture the paper and
therefore have to start all start all
over again and so this idea of kind of
optimization anticipation operated on
many many levels okay but this is this
is a kind of necessary but insufficient
set of conditions to get us to this more
radical change the semiotic change this
this change of interface that takes
place I'm arguing in the 1950s and so
how
do we get to a place where in 1956
someone actually sits down and removes
all of the characters from the tray bed
and then rebuild some sort of natural
language arrangement of all of the
characters how do we get to the place
where someone would feel mandated or
authorized or inspired to do that the
the question of this is really connected
to the politics of the 1950s the
politics of the 1950s and in particular
a politics that was within twentieth
century China unique to the Maoist
period which was a centrally endorsed
proletarianization of knowledge that is
kind of user-led innovation in a sense
we're in in a vast number of different
expert domains including seismology
paleontology medicine the state the
central state in Beijing and the
Communist Party was advocating mass
participation of non elite kind of
participants in these otherwise expert
systems and was also advocating the
really the overturning of knowledge
systems and the kind of if you want to
say if you want to put it in a kind of a
prose format to take much more seriously
Falk knowledge to take much more
seriously the knowledge that everyday
people have and so there does seem to be
a strong correlation between this this
advocacy that's take that and mandate an
authorization that's being issued from
the party state and the type of
experimentation we see in the 1950s so
it's very very difficult to locate the
origins of moments like this and in many
cases finding an exact point is not all
that important but if we had to if we
had to choose the the first moment in
which we see a natural language
arrangement of Chinese characters in an
information technology environment it
takes place not in typewriting but in
typesetting in the city of Kai Fung
with the work of this
a typesetter named Jiang seeing and John
seeing worked as a typesetter both in
the pre communist era in the 1940s and
then into the early into the Maoist
period in the 50s and he posted very
respectable typesetting speeds
throughout most of his career and his
his character rack the rack where all
the characters were displayed for his
use were also organized largely
according to the radical stroke system
the same one that we saw before around
nineteen fifty one fifty two inspired by
this new mandate for the
proletarianization of knowledge mass
participation and so forth he began to
reorganize these characters to maximize
the adjacency of of those characters
that go together some of the kind of
prime examples for this come from the
name of the press he worked at the Xin
washa so he said well I'm constantly
setting scene washer so why should I
reach around this is character rec why
not just put them next to each other
another example is a gumming revolution
I'm constantly saying coming in are
constantly setting this type so might as
well put them together and then my
favorite is Mady American imperialist
this was the time this was the time of
the korean war in the first really
nationwide campaign of the Maoist period
which was aid Korea resist America Aid
Korea as an in connection with the
Korean War so this phrase made II was
said over and over and over again now
what's interesting is it's very hard to
say was jump teeing inspired by this by
this central new mandate of the
Communist Party or were many people
doing this and and we just don't know
about it's very hard to say the one
thing that we do know is that the the
party state was not only advocating or
promoting this type of
proletarianization of knowledge but
whenever it happened in a locale or a
region they were publicizing it and
popularizing it so john seeing was
actually became something of a little
media star for a few years he was he was
featured in the people's daily there was
a book published
his method he was sent on a paid tour of
China to various printing houses to tell
people about his method the the central
broadcasting company filmed him doing
his job and he was eventually admitted
into the party and so he kind of was his
method was celebrated
it's very quickly after that celebration
of his method that we start to see the
same application of natural language
arrangements of the of the of keep of
characters on the Chinese typewriter and
this brings us back to the 1950s and the
story that began began the talk so this
brings us back to again the same the
same example now what's interesting
about this is that there are if on a 42
key keyboard there are 42 times 41 times
40 so forth possible arrangements on a
on a key on a tray bed with 2,450 there
are two thousand four hundred fifty
times so forth and so on there is
effectively infinite number of
arrangements possible arrangements of
these characters and so what we see is
that in after this after the predictive
turn in the 1950s we see multiple people
applying this to their own tray beds
centering around certain basic basically
shared principles and yet each of them
completely individualized and completely
idiosyncratic there are no two
predictive tray beds that are that are
alike and let me give you just a few
examples of this there's two tray beds
that I'd like to talk about one is a
Chinese typewriter used at the the Paris
the the unesco office in paris
another one is used in the United
Nations Office in Geneva these are two
separate Chinese type typewriters and
typists working in very different
contexts and I and I'll walk you through
this as well on the left one here and
this is 1930s is to give a comparison
against the pre predicted turn tray bed
in the middle here in the UNESCO machine
we see this character in yellow Mao this
is the this is the surname of mouth
and if we look to the below it we two
characters below it arts the dome so
that he could type or she could type
mounted on mounted on mounted on quickly
and easily emanating off to the right of
it are is the character are the
characters chewinsky juicy malluci which
is chairman mal
and so it's kind of the Mau is again
constellated in such a way that it can
be kind of concatenated with a bunch of
different characters that this type is
needed in the right example in the
Geneva machine we see the exact same
idea but but in essence constellated
differently we see the again the
character Mao in yellow and now Mauser
dome doesn't go it doesn't go up down as
in this example but off to the left and
Mao juicy Chairman Mao doesn't go off to
the right but goes down so in essence we
see these these typists converging
around certain principles but each one
very idiosyncratically organized to make
this a bit clearer for those you know
for those who don't read Chinese we have
the example of punctuation predictive
text was even applied to punctuation and
then actually end numerals but anyway in
the 1930s the question mark exclamation
mark period comma were put where they
kind of rationally belong to all
together in one place and after the 50s
a set of typist began to say well that
doesn't make much sense
we know that question marks always come
after a question particle because that's
how you express that's how that's one of
the ways you express the interrogative
in Chinese is by the addition of
particles we know that the part that the
character is ma ba and not those are in
red there are always followed by the
question marks so let's constellated
around the question mark on the machine
we see in the United Nations machine by
comparison the exact same idea but again
a different configuration of these other
particles now why are they differently
configured and this is the really
fascinating thing that I'm sort of
working with various kind of data
visualization specialists and others to
try to think about it could be all sorts
of things left handedness
right-handedness the sort of mnemonic
devices that one per
and prefers to remember the location or
another all sorts of factors could go
into why the this idiosyncrasy prevails
but they're really but but kind of
anchoring any of this idiosyncratic
personalization are again these kind of
coherent strategies that we often see
from one example to the other this is a
basic heat map which is basically
visualizes the is a calculation of
adjacency it's it's the the bright red
or the dark red patches are those that
in which the character can be combined
with maybe seven six seven or eight of
the characters in the surrounding area
the kind of the white the very very very
very light what red the white can be
combined with one and and then the black
here indicates that the character cannot
be combined with any of the characters
in the Moores neighborhood to form a
real Chinese word this is a heat map of
a tray bed from the Republican period
1911 to 1949 before the type of
innovation I'm talking about so you can
see that there is some almost accidental
situations in which a character is
flanked by other characters that it can
be combined with and then there's one
part here that I'm happy to talk about
why there's a why there is a collection
there the important thing is that once
we go to nineteen after 1949 this is
what the tray bed looks like it it heats
up it lights up because the basic
principle again is the maximization of
adjacency of related characters so to
put them side-by-side we can kind of get
a sense of what all of these incremental
innovations in the interface of the
machine translated into and this is how
we explain an acceleration of the speed
of typing that could be that high as
indicated in the people's daily not just
this leap it's not just this leap that
that is so interesting it's also again
the variety between different interfaces
these are both the UNESCO and the UN
machine both of them predictively
natural language arrangements and how
differently each of them behave
they have clusters in different places
they the kind of architecture of the
arrangement is very very different
and again in in terms of interpreting
why that's a very challenging active
operative working backwards from the
arrangement by the nineteen late 1980s
and into the 1990s we begin to see
chinese typewriting companies and
chinese typewriting instruction manuals
the appendix of which used to carry
grids like tables that showed you where
all of the characters on the tray bed
are you know it's a very important thing
for a manual to teach you by the 1980s
and 1990s we begin to see tables like
this that are empty because they're
basically saying to the user you decide
you decide where to put the characters
now there are some suggestions these
characters here well it's hard to point
to it the characters along the side are
saying you should probably you could
probably put characters about communism
here you could probably put characters
about higher education here about war
here about science here about and there
but they're just suggestions ultimately
it is left to the typist to decide where
all of these arrangements are taking
place so in essence what this what this
speaks to me is that machine are the
manufacturers of these machines were in
effect catching up with something that
was a user-led innovation so to close I
just want to ask a few sort of a sort of
set of open questions the first set of
questions is kind of what about the
computer you'll you'll notice that
Electrical automation computing word
processing is noticeably absent from
this talk it's entirely about a
mechanical type writing environment and
if you go into the the discussions of
various innovations in by Baidu or by
Sogo or by various input methods that
use predictive or algorithmic
probabilistic determinations for input
the assumption the prevailing assumption
is that this was kind of the the the
thanks to the computer which like the
deus ex machina comes in and saves
Chinese from its
in essence and what you see you actually
when you look into the history of early
Chinese computing in the 60s and 70s is
by and large the virtualization or
digitization of principles and
applications that had been developed in
the mechanical chinese typewriting
environment that is to say that at the
chinese academy of sciences and various
others working in the late 60s and 70s
they are very aware of what's going on
in the mechanical chinese typewriting
environment and they're trying to
basically enhance or build upon that and
it's not it's not a question of this
innovation coming in exclusively from
the outside and and and changing the
game as it were so the the the larger
question I guess is that and I give this
example here and Baidu excuse me
the Baidu example all I'll input systems
not just search engines but all input
systems for Chinese are all all make use
of predictive text all of them now and
so there is this important question of
where does this come from in the history
of Chinese computing and Chinese
internet and quite obviously I'm arguing
that there is not an exclusive genealogy
that dates back into the history I'm
talking about but one that certainly
combines the history of chinese
typewriting and the history of computing
more broadly so if this is true the
question is let's start a bigger
question is how did we miss the Taiping
rebellion if there was this no Chinese
historians in the in the group so okay
there's this mass massive civil war in
China called the Taiping rebellion
anyway there there is a question of that
if this innovation is taking place in
the 20th century then how do we keep
missing it how do we why do we in large
part continue to ignore the history of
information technology in China before
maybe five ten years ago and imagine it
as being in essence more of a proof of
the anti modernity of Chinese than
anything we would ever look into to be
inspired in our own our own innovation
and what I would like to suggest is that
not
for my own purposes but also maybe even
for designers among you who are who are
who are looking for a massive repository
of experimentation and innovation which
may not have seen the light of day but
may itself provide inspiration and
blueprints for for things moving ahead
I'd like to suggest that the Chinese
typewriter as a problem historically has
operated in very similar a similar type
of inspiration as the original the
original billboard ad back in the day
that was designed to kind of challenge
and inspire the most the most innovative
eccentric kind of thinkers in the world
and the Chinese typewriter in its own
way throughout the course of the 20th
century became a magnet for not only
innovators in China but from all across
the world and same thing with Chinese
computing and now into into later
technologies and so it is actually an
immense repository of inspiration and
principles that I think we could we
could all profit from from looking more
deeply into thank you very much I'm
happy to take questions why don't we
start on the right and then go to the
middle right
right absolutely could everyone hear the
question okay so the machine was roughly
let's I'll just use my hands it's
roughly about this wide the tray bed
itself is about this wide and this deep
okay and then the machine itself kind of
made juts out from the back maybe about
this far and it comes from top to bottom
it would be about yay tall very very
heavy
so the dimensions of it are are pretty
comparable with with with with many
desktop systems we see but the the
weight of it is significantly higher but
what you're what you're talking about
here this kind of built in this built in
almost personal relationship between the
operator and the type and the machine is
absolutely true so even before what I'm
describing as the predictive kind of a
predictive turn in the in the interface
you would have to personalize your
machine not only in terms of the time
period and whether or not you work in a
bank or a law firm as I suggested but
things like maybe your coworker or your
boss has a surname whose character the
character if the person's surname is
with in and of itself very infrequent it
doesn't show up in newspapers very much
but for you it shows up every day every
page and so you would have to make sure
that your machine has that name and so
if if we imagine a scenario in which you
know someone was sick that day
and couldn't couldn't come in and
someone else had to sit down at the
machine there would be before 1949 there
would be a kind of basic roadmap the
person would know that this is organized
according to radical stroke but beyond
that basic roadmap they might not know
where to go they might not know how the
other person personalized it so it is a
very different interface just as ability
from from the get-go
then typewriting in practically any
other language that we that we that we
see and then after 1949 this becomes
even more so you would not be able to
use
really effectively a typewriter that
someone else had had rearranged
according to their own natural language
arrangements the tray bed is almost an
embodiment of their consciousness if you
think about it it's it's how I remember
where everything is how my body works
how I prefer this to be and then you
come and try to use it it's like trying
to figure out someone else's file folder
structure on their laptop it's very very
personal the gentleman in the in the
sweater and then to the gentleman with
the glasses yes I know yeah that's a
great question yes Oh for the remote
audience ok I'm sorry the question is
the question is so the talk mainly
focused on how in essence people with
their understanding of and their use of
natural Lang they're their own use of
the language reorganize the interface of
the machine is there any evidence to
suggest that the kind of reorganization
of the interface machine cycled back and
really transform language the the the
quick answer is I suspect so the longer
answer is I suspect so but it is going
to take massive corpus analysis to
really decide whether or not that that's
happening we'd have to we'd have to do
stuff that really has never been done
with the analysis of Chinese language
material high through I mean it really
depends upon Chinese OCR becoming better
because we would need to do immense
corpus analysis to see whether or not
there are changes over time the one
thing that may be counter veils against
it against the possibility so that is to
say that I suspect that it's true but
one thing that maybe suggests that it's
not is that the Chinese typewriter was
mainly a a rien scription device a
reproductive advice it was you would
start out with a manuscript or something
and you would copy it you would produce
a type a typescript version of it what
you don't see in
context of chinese typewriting as
opposed to practically every other type
writing context is the idea of the
author sitting down at a machine and
producing a manuscript like there's no
such thing as the writer Lin Yue Tong in
China sitting down in this Chinese
typewriter the way that Alan Ginsberg
might sit down and this comes back to
the common usage system that not all of
the characters are there and it is the
job of the poet and the job of the
writer in fact to delve into the
infrequent and the beautiful and so
maybe maybe not but I think that that's
one that's one area that I'm trying to
team up with with a distant reading and
corpus linguistics specialist to see if
it's possible to ask that to ask that
question about linguistic change the
gentleman in the glasses and then the
gentleman in the black letter sure the
question is you know that the
relationship between simplification
campaigns and then this this kind of
taxonomic reform of the tray but are
there any relationships because they are
happening at the same time they're
happening in the early 1950s under under
under under the enduring Maoism they
they take they take place in the 50s
there was an earlier abortive effort to
simplify characters under the Republican
regime but the the places where they
seem to be related is that the
typewriter became and the tray bed in
particular became a highly politicized
space our domain if we think about it
because for example during
simplification campaigns there were
there were notifications sent to
typewriting manufacturers saying that
you need to replace these traditional
characters with simplified characters
now which from from their perspective is
a monetary you know as a financial
burden there's a financial burden on
people at the local level to that
theoretically have to replace the
character with another one that has been
identified as the simplified version
and so people were reticent to do that
because it just just kind of cost money
and was it was it was a pain and so it
became one of the places that that the
the the communist government was very
eager along with printing presses are
very eager to to promote simplification
because these were obviously the places
that produced text so you want to go to
the if you can change the characters on
a typewriter and change a character on a
printing press
then you therefore transform every piece
of every page that gets produced
thereafter so in terms of them
interacting or relating to each other
causally I don't see that all that much
but they are connected historically yes
sir and then gentlemen right the
question if I can if I can synthesize it
let me know if I get it right as I see
it as a question is here is there a
relationship between the kind of
template ization I like that word of
language in in a in Mao in Mao's China
which relates to kind of the kind of
Newspeak phenomenon that happened in
many communist contexts and this that
because the language was in essence more
predictable that it was more amenable to
a predictive text arrangement the answer
is I mean I think yes and in the longer
paper and the longer project that's
actually an entire part of the argument
is that the the emergence of a of a of a
of a political rhetoric of unprecedented
standardization during that the Maoist
period of unprecedented kind of wrote
this was itself largely facilitated the
creation of a tray bed in which it would
be very useful to create a natural
language arrangement because you know
you're going to be saying American
imperialist American imperialist over
and over again what's fascinating about
it I think is that normally the idea of
Newspeak this kind of 1984 image of the
communist rhetoric is typically
understood as an inhibition as an
inhibiting inhibiting factor to
innovation it inhibits thought because
you can it kind of you know that's its
double-plus good kind of idea of
language and and it seems that perhaps
there is there's a lot of credence to
that argument but in this case the we
see the exact opposite that for the for
at least in this context Newspeak is
inspiring or part of a history of
radical techno linguistic innovation in
which there is a there is and there is a
kind of encouraging or inspiring
momentum for the typist to make the tray
bed as idiosyncratic and personally
optimized as possible so that they can
more and more efficiently produce texts
that are more and more rote if you see
what I mean so there's there's do you
see what I mean there's actually there's
actually a relationship between
innovation and Newspeak that we that we
rarely see in other contexts but that is
highly relevant highly relevant here I
think yes in the back and then in the
black sweatshirt
the question pertains to spoken dialect
and and if I can if I can broaden it out
because it is a really interesting
question about I mean really the
question of dialect and Chinese language
information technology as a whole is a
very very political question throughout
really the 20th century for the most
part there has been a kind of
antagonistic relationship between
Chinese information technology and
dialect in the sense that people have
been political leaders manufacturers and
others have been very resistant to the
idea of developing for example Cantonese
input or Shanghainese input or Taiwanese
input or - even before that before we
think of input and whatnot the question
of whether or not different dialects and
Chinese should be outfitted with their
own written languages and that and and
whether or not people should be able to
publish for example a book in Cantonese
where the characters are actually there
are many Cantonese characters which do
not exist in matin and Mandarin Chinese
should people be allowed to publish in
that way which is also a kind of
information technology question and the
answer has consistently been no because
if we if we pair up the massive
diversity of dialect diversity in China
with written form we will in some sense
institutionalize these cleavages and
that could actually dam in the damage
the territorial integrity of the country
that's why most regimes in in the 20th
century in China have been very very and
and other elites political elites have
been very focused on the promotion of a
single single standard and so for
example with with pinyin with Chinese
pinyin inputs that is actually a not
only an information technology tool but
a pedagogical tool that people know that
if they're going to use a computer in
China they have to use pinyin input and
pinyin input is route is connected
directly to the Chinese standard and so
the very act of learning how to use a
computer is in some way shape or form
become
oriented towards the standard and so
they've been very resistant to develop
alternate techniques for that let me
just
I jumped you I'm sorry sorry yeah so the
question and this the the basic question
is how did these re-engineers of their
machine do it how did they go about the
process of producing these natural
language arrangement tray beds
that's actually why or how I came to be
here today was I gave a talk at Stanford
which is my home institution and I was
it was within STS and STS context was
was was was attended very luckily for me
by Scott clemmer from HCI at Stanford
who then invited me to give a talk there
and I was talking with Scott and I said
I need to I need to talk to someone who
works on optimization because I need to
know how someone right now would think
about the optimization of such a hyper
complex system not because I want to
build a Chinese typewriter but because I
want to hear someone talk about the
process of optimization so that I can so
that it can excite my imagination and
excite my sort of heuristic complex so
that I can go back and and and have more
intelligent search more intelligently
for for exactly the answer that you're
talking about it is entirely a question
there's two pathways to answering the
question I don't have an answer yet
that's that's gonna be that's the kind
of reason that I actually first emailed
sorry to complete the story then Scott
said you need to talk to Schuman's I
and then he put us in contact and we had
a really wonderful conversation and then
that manifested itself and today but I
have to admit with the tools at my
disposal I'm at a loss because there I
can I can try to reverse-engineer from
the tray beds that I have and that's
where I really need to pair up with
someone who thinks about those problems
everyday and then the other thing that I
can line up is ethnographic or oral
historical interviews with typists but
even that is a very challenging thing
tell me back in 1970 how you decided to
move character 1 to space X and carry
that you know that's that's embodied
memory they that's not something that
they're going to have written down
somewhere so even that is an incredibly
challenging process but that's I think
an incredible payoff not just for me as
an historian but for designers who are
looking for inspiration and in my in my
in my opinion the gentleman oh I'm so
actually I'm sorry maybe if I can keep
the order and then and then - Schumann
yes yes right No so the question
pertains to before 1949 before the
natural language rearrangement here
even the how did the process of
optimization of tray beds in the
Republican period take place and the
process that you just described is
exactly what would have been required
there is no I've seen no tray beds where
some character is just strangely out of
place and but everything is always in
place so if you think about it the
closest analog we have is the kind of
that game with the
missing plastic with the plastic pieces
with one piece missing and you've got to
move it around you move one thing
everything must move everything must
move to fill in the to fill in the space
and so yeah so even so that that's
that's an important dimension here is
that even before the 50s there is some
there is a there are dimensions or
characteristics that are built into the
tray bed itself and into this particular
techno linguistic apparatus that
provided a context for the more radical
transformation we see in the 50s but but
every tray bed I've ever seen exhibits
no laziness in terms of some weird
character out in the middle of nowhere
so so yeah right that's that's I feel
like I feel like I owe you something
because I you give me a chance to kind
of mention one slide that Isis get which
was very important which was the fact
that see if I can find it very quickly
that even in the Republican period there
was one small part remember that
remember that member in the heat map
there was that one little bright red
part there's a cluster there was one
tiny tiny region of the tray bed roughly
two cells wide by maybe ten cells tall
so out of 2,500 roughly so a very small
region which were arranged according to
natural language arrangements and these
were Provence names so the example up
here has let's look at the character
it's young that's highlighted in yellow
which means River John can be combined
with diagonally with soo
to create the province name jang-soo it
can be combined with the character to
its left George or John which is another
province and then it can be combined
through this kind of neat kind of night
like they can chess kind of thing of hey
longs young from the bottom to the top
to the right
this was the one there there's there's
few important things about this one is
that we know both here and in and in
very esoteric discussions by some
language reformers that people were
thinking about this in the 30s they were
thinking about this they were kind of it
was in the the general swirl of
possibility as a known thing and at the
same time we also know that in the 20s
and the 30s was a time of hyper hyper
innovative hyper iconoclastic language
reform this was the time when people
were saying let's get rid of all the
characters and replace it with French
let's simplify all the characters let's
replace it with a symbolic notation
system very very crazy sort of ideas and
yet even with this context the step
towards the the kind of radical
departure towards this new arrangement
was never never tried to my knowledge
and I've seen a lot of these machines
now more than I care to admit and so
there there seems to be it seems to be
that if this is purely a question of
efficiency and optimization that we
would have seen something far earlier
because people would have known it was
as if something was keeping the dams the
water behind the dam and that it really
took the it really took the 50s and it
really took now ISM and it really took
this idea of the kind of mass
overturning of knowledge systems to lay
dynamite to that dam and just say okay
everybody do whatever you want to the
tray bed do whatever you want however
you see fit and then from that moment on
it takes place it gets in the people's
daily it's shows up in three different
places it shows up in dozens of other
places and not everyone does it but
suddenly it starts to spread out until
by again that that slide for the 1980s
shows that even typewriter manufacturers
were like okay you guys you guys are
better at this than we are you have
better ways of optimizing your machines
than we could ever come up with
so you
so the semiotic interface is yours
basically so I do think that there is I
thought about that for a long time and
ultimately I came to the conclusion that
that the last piece of the puzzle on
this is I counter-intuitively maoism
