public policy here at Google and is one
of the leaders of the work on privacy
that's done here so that's it hello
everybody i hope you had a good lunch so
there was a bit of a Miss introduction
there this is not going to be a
technical talk I actually usually give
this talk to lawyers and I thought it
would be interesting for all of you to
see how the issue with privacy is
presented to a group of lawyers I'm nice
self I'm not a lawyer I was a computer
scientist is as an academic and here at
google him on the policy team so I in an
interface between the legal team and our
engineers for the most part so with that
bit of context I'll go ahead and get
started typically when you start talking
to a group of policymakers or lawyers
about privacy the way that the
discussion gets framed is often you know
companies need to protect need to
collect all this data about their users
and they need to do this to serve ads
it's an economic imperative right if
they don't collect the data they won't
exist but collecting this data creates a
problem for their users it violates
their users privacy and I find the frame
of privacy in that context particularly
unhelpful to the discussion and so I
often like to start by talking about
what we can learn from data right and I
think everybody in this room I'm
probably preaching to the choir for the
most part that you guys are going to be
much more familiar with the examples i'm
going to talk about then then the
group's i usually talk to but there's
there's an interesting trade-off between
privacy and knowledge that is not often
acknowledged within the policy
communities and so there's a reality
that by collecting information we
actually learn a fair bit about
ourselves about the world about society
and how to make things better so being
at Google being at a search company one
of the questions we asked is what can we
learn from search data it's pretty white
box I don't know that the founders had
anything that complex in mind when they
started out I think they wanted to find
information right but today we can
actually learn a tremendous amount from
what people are actually searching
or so I don't know how many people in
the room are familiar with flu trends
quick raise of hands so I know how much
introduction I have to give perfect so
you all vaguely know how this works we
look at historical search queries we
correlate them against data from the CDC
and we have this beautiful model that
predicts flu outbreaks we we predict it
faster than the CDC something like two
weeks faster I think and it roughly the
same accuracy again I don't think the
founders really had this in mind when
they built the service and yet it's this
powerful public social good that we're
able to create similarly how variant our
chief economist took that same data this
is actually built off of google trends
which is all publicly available data
hopefully you're all using it and and he
looked at a bunch of economic indicators
in the US macroeconomic indicators and
can model out unemployment rates rate
housing indices in the same way that we
can predict flu and that also is pretty
powerful so you can only start you can
start to imagine all the things that we
could do with data obviously translation
is one of the products that we've built
that most obviously shows the benefits
of all of this data analysis you
couldn't build it if you weren't able to
collect vast amounts of data study it in
the aggregate and draw patterns out of
that data and it's a pretty amazing to
like typically when I give this talk
people aren't aware that you could go
into google chat start a chat
conversation with somebody who did not
speak your language and in real time
have that translated as if there was a
human translator there with you it's
incredibly powerful and and this is the
type of innovation that all of you are
probably working towards in your in your
full time research it's the type of
innovation that we have to explain the
policymakers the reason being that this
is the philosophy of privacy that people
have in mind right when they think about
privacy data is personal if it's
directly linkable to an individual a
question that often comes up
particularly in the European context is
does that mean that the IP address is
personal to a computer scientist that
doesn't make a lot of sense the IP
address is a machine I
a fire right but to a privacy minded
lawyer in particular or a policymaker or
someone without a technical background
the IP address can be linked back to an
individual some degree of certainty and
therefore maybe it's personal so from a
technical point of view this this can
get us into some hairy situations and
difficult debates similarly people have
a right to access and correct a personal
data in theory this sounds wonderful in
the day 8 you know the database age the
1970s this was a phenomenally easy
principle to obey it's not so clear that
that's true anymore there's a certain
degree of data collection that is just
absolutely mandatory for an Internet
service to function if you were to
assert that the IP address is personal
which which many people do that's
actually quite difficult we at Google
couldn't give everybody access to the
raw search logs because it would enable
spammers and fraudsters to take
advantage of our search engine those are
the types of trade-offs that aren't
often discussed in this debate personal
data should only be collected retained
used for a specific clearly communicated
purpose now if Google had followed this
principle strictly right by strict
interpretation in the year 2000 we would
never have built flu trends so this is
also a tough principle when you start to
think about the type of innovation that
people want to do with vast data and the
last one I think you know should only be
collected with the individuals consent
again this is a great principle when we
think about it in the abstracts but
they're going to be specific situations
where we run into trade-offs that are
that make it somewhat difficult so I
often like to ask how we fix the world
because I'm a big believer in this vast
data analysis I think that we can solve
a lot of vexing social problems by
pushing forward in that line of research
but I'm also a privacy advocate I
personally believe in privacy have
always believed in it and for the past
decade have really spent a lot of energy
focusing on it and there's these these
inherent trade-offs between the two the
two objectives
the useful information that's going to
solve the social problems of the 21st
century many people believe is going to
come from this vast data analysis and is
anybody here heard of this site
PatientsLikeMe a few people i just heard
of this yesterday as i was talking to
somebody about what should I say to this
group I can't believe I hadn't heard of
it before but but the idea is you sign
up and you put in a little bit of
information about your health profile
including some particular disease that
you have they have a selection of
diseases you can pick Parkinson's mood
disorders there's a collection of things
you can select you enter in your
treatment details side effects the types
of symptoms you're experiencing and some
basic demographics age gender how long
you've had the disease and you're
immediately connected to a group of
patients like you and so you can start
to ask questions about well what is this
medication do to you what are the side
effects that you have how do you deal
with it and there's really interesting
shift happening there right instead of
the doctor being the curator of your
personal health information instead of
having to rely on this person that you
see maybe once a year for annual
physicals you have the ability to curate
your own health information and to study
your own health with a collective
knowledge on top of that right so you're
not just studying in isolation with
generic information it's with
information about people like you and
that's tremendously powerful this is the
type of innovation that we are going to
continue to see for the next decade at
least who knows what comes after that
but at the same time all of this data is
about people in their behavior right
search is in some sense about behavior
you could argue it's about questions
that people are asking the patients like
me data is all about people and their
health situation that creates a bit of a
privacy risk but when you think about
what privacy risks actually correspond
to its certain identification if you
don't actually know that John Smith did
x y&amp;amp;z you can't violate his privacy by
asserting that he did because it's it's
have a guess right this is the entire
idea behind the u.s. jurisdictions the
core the judicial systems credible
believable you know guilt we need
certain identification to be able to do
something horrible to somebody's privacy
but on the other hand we can do most of
this vast data analysis with a certain
amount of uncertainty right so you can
have vast datasets study them in the
aggregate and through statistical
analysis learn all sorts of interesting
things so so I throw out typically a few
research questions but mostly I want to
hear questions from you all so I'll go
through these relatively quickly the
first research question how do we enable
meaningful control in a world where we
need this type of vast data analysis to
advanced society this is a this is a
tough question this is why I Alfred
laughed yes it's these are really hard
questions that we don't have answers to
and that we are looking for researchers
like you guys to solve and the ones that
I think are most interesting in this
group are in bold how do we balance
giving users control over the data
collection versus detecting and stopping
abuse so this question gets to the spam
in fraud point right we need a lot of
data that's just we just absolutely need
it to be able to operate these services
because if we don't have it people will
take advantage but how do you enable
people to meaningfully opt out if that's
the situation that you're in and still
have a usable service right the second
question how do you give users
fine-grained control over their data
without overwhelming them with options
this is a sudden this is a question that
is of increasing importance in the
social world right you can see out of
some of the criticism that Facebook gets
for their settings pages the type of
challenge that we're dealing with here
right how do you set such a vast array
of privacy preferences that apply to any
number of contexts any number of groups
of people any number of timing
situations and do it in a way that the
user actually can can interact with can
engage with
and doesn't just say man this is too
complicated I'm turning it off it's a
really hard problem as well you want to
surface the right options and but who
knows what the right ones are they vary
by person very very difficult question
the others on here are also interesting
i'm not going to talk about them too
much the second research question that i
find pretty interesting is how to enable
users to influence their self
representation online and I the word
influence is pretty important here this
question is often phrased as how do we
let people control their self
representation online and that that word
choice is very important because of a
belief in free expression right I would
argue that we don't want to let people
control their self representation but we
do want to give them the ability to
influence it six of them make sorry I'm
going to talk through a few examples
anyone heard of Stephen Fowler one
person I had not heard of Stephen Fowler
when I put the slide together and I feel
so sorry for this poor guy look at these
top three hits you go to yahoo were you
go to Bing and it's exactly the same
it's not like Google's discriminating
against this guy he was on some reality
TV show and something horrible happened
people decided he was the worst husband
in the world clearly and then the third
one is like it's horrible his wife
apologizes for having the worst husband
in the world this poor guy you meet him
and you go google him and you never want
to talk to him again and so this is this
is a tough situation one I don't
probably a 30 minute segment on TV
destroyed his reputation forever there's
an element of storytelling that goes
into this right that social storytelling
that most of us will never meet Stephen
Fowler does it really matter that his
reputation is ruined if we're never
going to meet him maybe maybe not but
for the people that he does meet it does
matter and so do you want to give
stephen fowler the ability to influence
how those folks that he meets see him
and understand him this example may be
more familiar to all of you the dog poop
girl in korea anybody bueller no really
so this is 2005
a woman in Korea got on a subway train
with her dog and the dog pooped on the
chair and she got up and left the train
without cleaning up after her dog and
everybody on the train snapped photos of
her with her cell phone this is just
when cellphones really boomed in South
Korea and they were all internet-enabled
and so they uploaded the photos up to
the Internet and within hours this woman
had been identified her reputation was
destroyed she dropped out of school she
moved out of Seoul like completely
upended her life and some of that's
cultural within the Korean culture but
you can I mean the query on this dog
poop girl she's infamous right I think
in Korea her name is pretty well
publicized although I don't speak Korean
so I don't know it's a similar question
and in the United States very few of us
are ever going to meet this woman and so
does it does it matter that this is the
perception we have of her it's a really
hard question there but within Korea her
life was completely destroyed and and
search engines and the ability to find
information and organize it didn't
really help and so what can we do to
help help fix that talk through one more
this is star wars kid I'm not seeing
recognition with this one either this
was a young teenage boy who got a
lightsaber and started doing Star Wars
like actions he recorded it somehow it
made its way onto YouTube not by his
choice and he became known as Star Wars
kid it was one of these internet memes
four or five years ago and the
interesting thing about Star Wars kid
the BBC and I you can't see the BBC
article here but the article about this
kid on the BBC identified him by name
but if you go to his Wikipedia page he's
not identified by name the community of
wikipedians decided to be kind in the
words of Jonathan Zittrain and not name
this poor child it let him go on and
live his life there's a couple
interesting things to learn from that
one is that could we enable through
social mechanisms the crowds to behave
kindly to one another how can we sort of
start to temper the mob mentality that
takes
over when you've got crowds of anonymous
users on the internet temper that and
persuade people to be kind to each other
in a reputational sense another question
here is could we do search engine option
optimization for people and what are the
trade-offs that we run into if we wanted
to do that type of that type of solution
for this if you wanted to enable SEO for
individuals it's a bunch of trade-offs
you would run into clearly facebook has
been doing some of this some interesting
questions the third and last question
I'm going to talk about is conveying
privacy preferences to other users on
the social web this is related to the
question of having an overwhelming set
of preferences shown to you on a
dashboard but it's different because
it's actually about this idea that
people can violate my privacy without me
even knowing it all right so someone can
upload a photo of you on facebook and of
course you maybe don't even know the
photos ever gotten up there and before
you know it it's an internet meme and
your Star Wars kid I'm going to show a
video actually to talk about this one I
think no not supporting the organization
at all I just think the video is great
read it read it read it read it
hey I think you dropped this
put that video into digital terms it's
actually really interesting so in that
video if you think about what just
happened right this girl recorded some
information about herself it was
collected on a piece of paper was
transferred right a third party came in
and took that information and
transferred it over to yet another third
party without her permission and that
final third party got the information
and could have done whatever he wanted
with it but he looked at this girl on
the other side of the room and she is
conveying all sorts of discomfort right
her facial expression turns downward her
cheeks get red she starts to cower in
the corner it's very clear that she's
uncomfortable with what's happening and
so this final third party the young boy
is able to understand just intuitively
that this is not what this girl wants to
happen she doesn't want him to have that
information she doesn't want him to
publicize it and so he chooses not to
and part of part of what I think this is
really important about this question is
that when you look at the types of
privacy violations that happen on the
social web that are reported in the
media today there are these types of
violations right so-and-so uploaded a
picture of you and got shared around and
you were tagged I don't think that the
users in those situations actually want
to harm the privacy of the of the
subjects right I don't think most most
of us are not out to take each other's
privacy away and to embarrass each other
for the most part as a general statement
but the web has not really enabled us to
convey these types of social preferences
to each other so personally when people
tag me and photos on Facebook I have to
go untag myself and then email them and
say you know what I really don't really
appreciate that please don't do in the
future and then the result is they feel
terrible about themselves right they
feel very guilty they're like oh god I'm
so sorry I didn't know I just I really
didn't mean to offend you and then of
course they forget and they do it again
and then it's it's even worse right and
so are there things that Facebook as the
system designer could do to smooth that
social interaction a little bit for me
and for the other person so
my privacy would be protected but but in
a way that was functionable in the
social world that's all I have for you
all thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
