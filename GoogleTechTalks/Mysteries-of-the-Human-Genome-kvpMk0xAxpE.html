Gilbert Iran oh and I come to you now
from UC Santa Cruz I i'll be talking
about the human genome lab itself on
that so i'll tell you all kinds of
things that we find very exciting new
discoveries about the human genome etc
that's what the subject of the talk will
be about and I some post looking Santa
Cruz now as you can see that's about
ending and I'm going to be switching
over in a couple months to start working
as an assistant professor at Stanford
John between the violin computer science
there and I already looked up close I
already have the march of somebody who's
serving two masters so hopefully that
will go into it anyway and I did my
undergrad PhD in Israel if you want any
about the accent so I'm born raised in
Israel I just tell you about all kinds
of fascinating things about the human
genome you're welcome to stop an arm of
the format allows too much of that but
I'll take questions either way and then
towards the end and the topic is you
know these things that we find the human
genome to conservation living four
thousand really all kinds of new things
that will start on the same origin so
without further ado so this you know the
21st century is pretty much hyped as the
century of biology in terms of the
sciences and I'll give you a glimpse of
how we really feel about it people who
work in genomics and just how the flood
of data is really changing rewriting
some basic laws of molecular biology so
from our perspective which is definitely
a fun time to be in and they're all
coming into a crowd that's predominantly
computer science people i assume i can
easily put this slide up and say you
know this hour and we think so one of
the things that in my background is
religion in computer science as you've
seen i'm actually going to see on a
department of biology now and you'll see
why because of the things that i do but
we can actually take this biological
data and modely and actually cast it
into terms which are mostly amenable to
computational tools okay and we'll go
through these things string circuits
I'm see et cetera and there's all kinds
of very exciting biology getting hidden
out there so I'll story is going to
start with with PNA the molecule of life
and in a second will be very much
simplified so if you know some biology
you know I apologize upfront i will be
smoothing things very very close game
and i'll tell you exactly the amount of
biology we need to kind of follow
through this lecture okay simplification
number one so DNA okay DNA is a linear
molecule that is found in every living
cell and that DNA molecule actually
carries the instruction of how to make a
living organism and that's what you pass
on to your children and they pass on to
their children etc etc etc Cooper study
and for the purpose of all talk we can
cast DNA as a long string over a short
alphabet so the alphabet is only a size
of full hill and the strings valley
between a thousand and you know hundreds
of billions of letters and what's
important for the purpose of all talk
and we'll start unwrapping this Apple in
a while is that this long string of DNA
is actually made of two components in
principle potions or sub things that are
actually never led to the lifetime of
the cell colloquially these are known as
junk DNA will go back and revisit all
these terms along the lecture so these
regions are actually never use and
they're there and you'll see what
happens to them and they get copied from
generation to dinner and then there are
regions but i'll actually use okay so
you can think of it as a remark and the
actual code if you want to over simplify
them okay so that that's the important
distinction for us and they actually
tell us how when where etc to make all
kinds of operations to actually have a
living so in each cell which is the
basic you know functional unit of life
we're going to talk about there is what
is called a genome and the genome
effectively is a single copy of all X
DNA in the example I have here
DNA is actually made up of two strings
so you have two strings and the combined
they're called the genome and every cell
has a single copy of the genome we on
what you want to make two cells from one
cell you actually copy the DNA and you
get two cells each one has a single copy
of the gene okay and at the level of
simplification that we're going to work
with a human being is 10 to the 14th
says it start from a single cell and it
undergoes all these repeated
replications over and over that's the
point I want to stress it even over the
lifetime of a single individual that one
string is actually replicated a huge
amount of time okay and you know for
this purpose it was actually easier to
talk about an egg in a chicken chicken
and egg so you start out with a single
cell and when you get to the 10-14 then
we have a human being and every one of
these has a single copy of exactly the
same thing okay then of course you have
sexual reproduction I won't have time
and it's not critical for our discussion
to discuss the wonders of sexual
reproduction but effectively you have
one copy from here one copy from there
and for some process that we aren't
going to touch up on the is at the end
of the day a single copy in the one sale
that actually makes up the next chicken
down the line okay so the amount of
replication of that linear molecule
order a full letter alphabet is
tremendous within the lifetime single
individual and definitely as you start
going down the generation will be
cruising down hundreds of millions of
years so you can imagine how many of
these applications are actually out
there and you know you can make you can
take something of a of an ID perspective
on life all you can actually look at it
as a processing time during which
species diverged away from each other
and if you can look at the DNA molecule
in each one of these species you can
learn out fascinating things about what
makes us all the same and what makes us
different and how our genome has evolved
over time and shaped us as we are and
that's really what we're going to talk
about in the general title of this field
is called comparative genomics you
compare across species but we need this
whole comparative paradigm now sweeping
across biology in many many ways so
that's what we're getting to let me show
you the power of comparative genomic
through again fully simplification that
we've just started so imagine you have
the single copy of the DNA molecule in
this one cell and remember it's made out
your blue jeans that have never used and
then regions that are actually used here
until to actually make yourself that
thing as we said is replicated many many
times in the lifetime of that chicken
but then it's replicating the crucial
point in order to start a new chicken
okay and the first thing as we need to
take into account e is that this
replication is inherently imperfect so
all kinds of errors happen every now and
then for one generation to the next
every application is imperfect some of
these would be small scale will talk
about louder skills or later on but
these systematically small skills tiny
insertions deletions single letters
sometimes I'll call them bases drop off
or from one they smell into three or
they just change etc etc etc now when
that happens to the junky agents the
regions that are actually never read
during the lifetime of an organism
anything goes in these regions if you
can imagine from Oh from organism to
offspring to also important they just
change at the rate at which this process
is imperfect right let us follow let us
join etc but the reasons that actually
are functional that actually code for
something that the individual leads
during its lifetime and then goes on to
use these regions actually cannot
tolerate many types of changes so maybe
that one later laws would actually be
tolerated to the next generation but
perhaps that one one because the
instruction that is now spelled out is
one that won't make this either a viable
one
sale or maybe the chicken that comes out
one produces many of swings or one
produced often at all and these changes
are swept out of the population through
the process of selection okay so
effectively this is evolution in a
single slide you have in perfect
replication of the instruction set and
then you have a force that sweeps out
things that are bad take seen things
that are good and that evolution Phillip
okay so what we are going to talk about
let me actually finish this so the
consequence that you can derive out of
this is that regions that actually code
for something change much more slowly
over time okay because these all kinds
of changes will be swept out of the
population so sequence conservation
along the generations actually implies a
function that means that there is a
sweeping force that clears out all kinds
of changes that are not tolerated to
actually make a viable organism and make
it viable offspring etcetera etcetera
that's the basic observation of
comparative genomics if you like ok so
now we switch on we had you know a
single generation here now we're going
to nonchalantly go from a single
generation into 18 million years of
independent evolution okay so roughly
around 80 million years ago there lived
a species which was the common ancestor
of let's say Apes and rodents or us and
mouse if you want to get particular and
at that time point of Li the two
lineages separated into independently
evolving lineages so over 18 million
years that have been tremendous
application of that single string
independently along this branch and
independently along that bunch ok now if
you have access to the linear molecule
the DNA here and there you can actually
compare the two so you have very long
strings and when you compare them you
find the region that is actually
conserved between human amounts you
apply the same logic we talked about in
a second ago if this is conserved across
the two organisms then that substring
must have taken all kinds of small
changes
that was swept out of the population and
they were swept out presumably because
that region is functional you have no
idea what function is it is it but
you've suddenly highlighted a substring
within this long thick long string and
it said functional now I have to figure
out what function that is ok but it is
comparative genomics in a nutshell so is
the quantitative look at the human
genome ok and that let's call that for a
second before in the pre genomic era
which is the previous century which is
not not longer than five to ten years
ago so the human genome is a DNA
molecule of the length of three billion
letters and part of the discussion was
whether we really want to see the whole
thing ok so quantitatively about one and
a half percent of that three billion
letters has a function that we
understand that was after the situation
before when i go to what this thing
actually is going to be and then we knew
that about big people say no more of it
is junk and the question was you know
why bother spending all these billions
if at least half of them are going to be
junk and I'll show you what I hope is
pretty good reason for that several
reasons for that so nonetheless the
whole discussion 12 and I won't go to
that and people actually went in a
sequence the whole human genome and the
whole month genome that was the two
first mammalian genomes the whole
sequence and once you do that you can
actually see exactly what I've shown you
in the previous slide compare the two
sequences and ask how many substrings
appeal to be under selection appear to
be functional and this is what this
graph is showing is showing you how
conserved highly conserved or low
conservation are a subset of human mouth
regions that we know to be in this junk
pile and then you compare on top of that
how can service the entire alignment
between human mouth genome so the same
sub the same string evolving
independently over 18 years and when you
subtract one from the other you see that
about five percent of our genome just by
comparing to this one other species five
percent of the genome is actually
highlighted as functional
and as we alluded to that's actually
three times as much as we knew before
getting into this endeavor as being
functional in the genome so those three
times as much functional DNA within our
genome than what we understand and that
comes up to hundreds of thousands of
some strings that we can now highlight
and we have many more species now and we
can highlight them very very clearly and
we have no clue what they do the only
reason we think the functional is
because we see them very well conserved
of course many many millions of years
question maybe I just don't understand
it by so presumably what you're doing is
you're comparing a mouse and a human are
saying you know where there are a lot of
changes and where they're very similar
but presumably there's also just the
difference between a mouse and a single
molecule but solid replicating a long
two different branches you just had a we
are you just have these two so it's
possible it's something that you think
of is junk really represents just the
difference between a mouse
so this let me put in in other words
this is only a lower bound on how much
is actually function on its genome okay
let's put it that way so there's five
percent that we now understand that by
no means is the final number exactly
because and there will be things that
are eight specific human specific and
they won't even be in those comparisons
differently okay so that's a good common
at least five percent of all genomics is
functional but we can actually see the
substring sounds we just don't we have
to figure out what they do so in 2004
you know all these revelations came
about at the end of 2002 i think around
christmas or something like that and
2004 there was the slush of papers but
i'll talk some about where we came up at
the end of the year there was a slap-up
science magazine has this breakthrough
of the year every year and in two
thousand of 2004 we came up fifth one it
up this is what we got a sailing world
so that's really well that shows are
expected all scientists going back to
the junk DNA and saying oh my god that
piece of junk is so important i better
understand what it's doing okay though
the question yep GM actually originated
back to the common ancestor and Hamish
was introduced by things like viruses
but yeah ok i am circle so it's a quick
let's actually you'll find a bit of an
answer later one and then we can take it
out again at the end okay stay tuned
second half okay sure but now i just
dodged it so i'll repeat the next one ok
cool okay but let's get back to this in
da so what do you do so now i have to
teach you a bit more biology okay so
those two properties that we're going to
talk about when we look at this long
string of DNA one is that the DNA codes
for proteins genes code for proteins and
proteins are really the world causes of
every living cell these are the
molecules that make up the sale they
make all the reaction within the self
and your DNA tells you how to build each
one of this molecule this is actually
also a linear molecule just bundled up
into a spaghetti bowl type thing okay so
there's this
how to be the protein and then just next
to that there's the region of roughly a
thousand letters we assume that tells
the cell when and where to make that
thing because obviously you also want to
exactly precisely make the right
quantity a tight I'm not just have the
ability to make it okay so here's a
picture of the human genome let me walk
you through this briefly so at UC Santa
Cruz that's actually want the two
biggest portals in the world to
annotation of the human genome it's a
publicly available website and you're
welcome to look at it that's the others
let me walk you through a snapshot a
tiny snapshot of the human genome so
uphill should imagine 3,000 letters from
the human genome and underneath them and
now Skippy to the bottom there are the
three thousand roughly matching letters
from chimpanzee and for miles and from
lad and then from chicken and they are
diverging away from us closest to
further this so what what's important
about the graphs of the bottom is that
wherever this graph Peaks that means
that that letter in chimp and inhuman is
exactly identical and then it droves
because they are not exactly identical
and then it goes back to being an end so
you see how the human and chimp DNA are
almost identical across this window much
less so between human mouse and rat
heels the region that's completely lost
in miles and then with between tuna and
chicken that distance is so far away
that you can actually align very little
it's not that there isn't anything in
chicken but what's the sequence here in
chicken is so diverged from here that we
can say with any statistical
significance that they actually come
from a common sense and if you go back
and you map how to make a gene and when
and where to turn it on you see that the
black so this is the Hound this is the
one where the black plot here is an
average over all of these so this says
how conserved is every letter in the
human genome compared to all the other
species that it seemed and that's pretty
much the picture we expected to find in
the human genome so the agent that
actually tell you how to be the protein
allemaal conserve and then in this
region is roughly 1000 letter region
that tells you when and well you know
there's a bleep that goes back away and
all kinds of other stuff that are there
pretty much the benign picture we were
expecting to find what we actually found
was very different from that when we
went into I'll show you I'll be able to
jump to the logic of how we got there
but I just jumped to one very surprising
discovery that we had at that year two
years ago so you know it's the same plot
that I've showed you before now i'm
showing you actually many more species
all the way out to fish which are the
farthest vertebrates from us that have
been sequence to day life in fish what
you see here is that this region here is
in no gene it's actually not even close
to energy and if you see this plateau of
extreme conservation just in the middle
of nowhere in our genome because we
started marching for all these genomes
and if you look at individual species
you see that these are hundreds of
letters or bases that actually haven't
changed all the way between us and
chicken there's a region here of about
300 letters that haven't changed a bit
between us and chicken and has changed
some but it's very well conserved all
the way out to fish okay let me explain
to you why when you see three hundred
letters that are perfectly consider the
cost 300 million years of evolution why
should be scratching I guess you'll fall
in so this is just a zoom in and we skip
that so yeah why is that so surprising
why is it that these regions are
perfectly conserved across these species
or the film is it so surprising so as I
alluded to before that means that there
was a sequence let's say three hundred
letters subsequent shield in the common
ancestor and along all these independent
lineages it has taken on all kinds of
small mutations bases global basis game
faces change and all of those were swept
away to keep exactly the same three
hundred letters in each one of these
species and now we have on the order of
a dozen of these close to twenty honest
action okay so you add that to the
following fact and this becomes really
surprising there's nothing in a genome
that we understand is encoded in it that
is encoding and normally doesn't fashion
everything that we understand was
incurring the human genome every unit of
information that we understand is an
coded in a redundant fashion okay let me
give you an example we wanted to make a
protein out of the DNA sequence we
wanted to explain how to make that
protein so we have a long string of an
alphabet of fall and now we want to make
a string of roughly let's say a hundred
little over one another alphabet of 20
so how do you call the word over an
alphabet of 20 if you have an alphabet
of for the solution that was chosen you
know in our genes for example is the
following just take contiguously metals
and every three letters give you sixty
four combinations that's modern plenty
to code 20 later so you change from
three of these two one of those every
single time and you've now mapped
yourself between 64 and 21 there's a
21st one that actually says stop that
that string is now ready okay so look at
that so you can pick anything you want
for the this table actually tells you
how to convert from the formulator to
the 20 later then let's look at an
example here of these blocks here so
pixie is your first letter and it's 30
in this code an alphabet another see it
doesn't matter what you pick as your
third letter you always get the same
letter in that position in the in the
protein now that tells you that if
anything happens to that third literally
along any of these villages there's no
way selection would prove that out there
is no way for selection to sweep that up
because you get exactly the same protein
sequence that's the type of redundancy
I'm talking about and that's why we see
these perfectly conserved regions we
don't understand what type of encoding
acquires that question yes my question
is you
did you say that this highly conserved
region is not a part of any gene I
didn't say that okay so say to me if I'm
a building 20 okay so all I said is that
what that one actually i did say wasn't
the part of energy you're right this one
is and I'll show you what the ensamble
looks like but so for hundreds of bases
hundreds of letters perfectly conserved
across hundreds of millions of years
just doesn't jive with anything when the
scanners &amp;amp; kareena genome because of
this redundancy and what is redundancy
selection cannot act you would think
okay so in order to go and show you the
set of all these things I have to take
you through another voice so we said
this is how to make a protein and this
is one word to turn it on that picture
is actually two for simpler organisms
predominantly unicellular organisms but
we said we are made out of 10 to 14 cell
types and what we understand now in
vertebrates in particular is that that
region that actually tells us when and
where to turn each one of these on
actually extends through three orders of
magnitude more sequence that way that
way so in about 2 million letters there
are all kinds of regions out there that
actually tells you very precisely when
and where to turn that genome and they
do it by the way because some of these
proteins actually go back and they bind
the DNA so they go back and they bind
that molecule some of them help me turn
this gene on some of them stop this gene
from the internal and/or dysregulation
there of these things coming on and
falling off so that's that's another
kind of a revolution that does undergone
attain the last 10 to 20 years in
molecular world in understanding how
predominant these regions are so and I
just said that so you know and and when
you have whole genome you can actually
see that there are many thousands of
these i'll give you a taste of that are
towards the end and reading most of them
have been previously invisible because
the
only way currently without understanding
how these are encoded to see that
there's the region there are controls if
genes just to see and it's highly
conserved in the saddle species its
other species in this other species so
all these things that we thought of us
junk actually now become these control
boxes okay so let me let me walk you
through these regions and I'll get back
to the question then so you can actually
set up once you realize that these
things are out there in your three
billion base string you can actually set
up a query that I probably would have
been a semi ridiculous one but only semi
ridiculous you can ask for all you know
the time we did this effectively we had
three gene on the other hand human mouth
and those were the three genomes and we
asked for all the regions of a substring
of 200 consecutive letters Omo that I'll
perfectly consider the cross these three
species so we do the pretty basic like
back of an envelope map and you see that
if you take three billion letters and
you involve them independently along the
human lineage and then along the log and
speeding into mouse and rat there
shouldn't be a single one of single
sequence of 200 letters that is
perfectly conserved across the street
even in 3 billion letters and and what
we actually find is 500 of these almost
5,000 that's what we dubbed do to
conserve dynamics so let me tell you
about them abhi so a these regions
actually are not frozen so the perfectly
conserved of course between us inch and
let's say chicken actually and then
somebody in this room could have a
single letter that's changed from
everybody else they're not quite frozen
but they do involve 24 slower than the
rest of our genome most of these do not
explain how to build protein so we've
gotten very good these days and actually
understanding the syntax of how to build
proteins and we know that these do not
code for that they have stop codons all
over the place on them etc etc so they
say stop doing that stop doing that
that's not a way to build a protein
sequence etcetera etcetera that I don't
want to go into monitors but the about
three quarters of these do not hold for
pudding that was one of the fun
surprises the ones that do not
actually there is not just peppered
around the genome but we repeatedly find
them just controlling effectively genes
that encode DNA binding proteins
remember those are the proteins that go
back to contort to bind the DNA and
control what the other genes get turned
on and off so they are part of the
regulation machinery attends things on
and off and we can do this experiment
i'll talk to you about them in a second
well you can take one of these regions
and show that in this mouse embryo of a
11.5 that one particular agent that will
talk on serve the element make sure that
it is only expressed in the eye at that
particular developmental stage and if
other developmental stages it would
confer a very different pattern of
expression okay we'll get to that in a
bit now the ones that do tell you how to
code for proteins also focus on a
specific subset of porting to do a
specific function again implying but
there's something functionally important
about these regions that have to be
perfectly conserved rather than some
fluke accident or regions that are just
copied better for whatever reason than
others okay and on this graph I've shown
you before but any are the tip of a
continuum who's heavy tail we don't
really understand of highly conserved
elements that we have to understand what
are the function the forces that but not
all them and then let me show that
actually in the next slide so the super
conserved elements means define them
between three mammals this is the tree
of life and they found all across
variables all the way out to this raving
fish but then when you cross this
boundary between vertebrates and
invertebrates all these regions are gone
so it's a surprising phenomena in the
sense that almost all of them were found
within the subtree you go one step
beyond and the whole thing goes away so
the question is where do these regions
come from that's one of the questions
not only what do they do and what
actually maintains them perfectly but
where did they come from now walk you
through one story where you can
understand where they come from and that
source is actually was pretty surprising
to us and you'll see how this
fascinating fish that kind of sits here
between these two branches was able to
tell us that's them okay so we move on
to that question so the question is
world
decisions comfort they just disappear
out here whether they come from is it
there there we can't see them or do the
action just land someone over here and
start evolving from them so here's one
of them we had four hundred and eighty
one of them being super conserved
element 338 that's the one you can see
the same plot of conservation of
shadrach full here's the plateau he of
perfect conservation across multiple
species that's a guy what you see down
here our matches from air through in the
human genome and then coded by
chromosome identifying chromosome but
effectively everywhere in the genome the
all kinds of matches only to that
particular region okay in all kinds of
places within our general very curious
about that is a graph feel that's
missing so some of these matches
actually so these are all regions that
come from a common source that's what
this thing is telling us somewhere there
was a common knowledge into all these
regions some of them actually explain
how to build proteins but they explained
how to build only a small portion of
very different proteins you look at the
proteins whose structure whose gene
structure they make and there's nothing
in common between them so we wanted to
understand what this whole family of
things with an ultraconservative
presented came into being in the human
gene okay so i just woke you now to the
clues that actually made us understand
what these families unraveled the
history of this family so the first
surprise we had remember i'm showing you
how this region is so similar to all
kinds of other regions in the human
genome so you ask you you go to the
public databases and the public
databases now are filling up on a very
pleasing rate and those DNA sequences
form all kinds of critters out there and
you can go to that repository and just
ask what is my sequence most similar to
it is just a sorted list by species name
of what this water conserved element is
more similar to unsurprisingly at the
very top there you see six legions from
a species called attamellam in advances
which are closest to the ultraconserved
elements and all these family members
within the human genome itself so you
look up the species and that species
silicon silicon is
fascinating lobe-finned fish I'll show
you that in the context of a lot but it
effectively it has followings like a
suggests did something different to them
so silicon's let's look at the tree of
life heals well invertebrates and you
come into vertebrates that's life in
fish and that's on three beyond
tetrapods all developments that have
gone on to occupy the land and there's
two fascinating branches he'll run into
lungfish and wanting to sin account that
of actually you know they have their own
set of vine and foldings so the first
thing there's a nice sociological story
if you like behind that species was it
was thought to be missing for 100
million years because we could only find
find it in the fossil records and then
in 1938 you know a fishing trawler went
off the coast of South Africa and
effectively came with a live dinosaur in
the name so that was a big surprise but
the fascinating thing is that the
specimens now we have you know dozens of
specimen of that species the specimen
that we find today are almost identical
morphologically to what the four cells
that have left behind about 100 million
years ago and that will dub the species
into being called a living fossil so the
phenotype the actual morphology of
species hasn't changed of the hundred
millions we don't know what that implies
about the genome and how that encodes it
but the authority hasn't changed of
animals so we had multiple hits of
volatile conserved element in human to
that thing and in order to explain to
you why what what what is the story
there is i have to tell you another bit
of how genome actually works okay and
that actually goes back to a question
that I Dodge before so here's your
genome now I've chopped it up into I
guess eight strings and within many many
genomes they're actually regions that
are called the pits or mobile elements
of selfish DNA there are some things
that I've learned to duplicate
themselves within our genome that's all
they do they actually know how to hop
out of the genome hop back into a new
place okay they copy themselves at a
random new location pretty much pretty
soon you actually have tons in
tons of these and actually when I was
saying before that more than half of our
genome is junk exactly those regions are
just faded away now so they learn how to
duplicate themselves original part
actually a powerful doing that for the
loan sake the cell method uses them so
the part of the junk and when something
is a part of the junk and you start to
applique ting it from one generation to
the next generation it fades away
exactly what I've shown you here because
there's no reason to preserve it in any
state so they multiply when they stop
jumping around and they decay away
that's a known phenomena within many
genomes including half of our own at
least half of them so what did we have
let me show you again on the tree of
life and we can search all these species
because we had Geno for them what if we
have would expect that ultra
conservative element we had actually
there's like a tiny bit of that of the
gene of silicon the gene of silicates is
laughing on the order of hours on the
order of a billion bases we had a mega
base we had a million letters of that
genome that's less than a thousand okay
we had a million out of a billion and in
that meeting we had 60 instances 60
substrings very similar to a water
conserved elements and they were very
similar to each other suggesting that
what we've seen silicon's is actually
one of those repeats that is hopping
around that's the only reason to see 60
of these in a million letters okay now
lungfish there's even less DNA we don't
know what happened there but in all
these species all the tetrapods what we
had is a very different picture so we
have whole genome Hills all whole
genomes here on the order of a gigabytes
of a of a billion letters and in each
one of these we had a hundred copies
very dissimilar to each other but
similarly enough for statistical
significance a hundred copies per a
billion letters okay a hundred very
dissimilar in a billion letters versus
60 in a million letters very similar and
the most parsimonious the explanation
that requires you know the least
hand-waving is the one that you had a
repeat the one i've shown you before you
had a repeat that was born
here before these cleaning it is split
off and that repeat is active to this
day in silicon and then it died either
once or multiple time along this lineage
okay so it started out here jumping on
the genomics jumping to this day or
until very recently in secret you know
and then it died away and all these
other genes so if we died away in all
these aliens what are these hundred
copies that we actually still see them
right I just said that you know that
thing confers no function to the the
cell and it just gets swept away during
evolution so let's go back and revisit
that the picture so there's a phenomenon
known as co-option wherever I told you a
something learned how to jump out and
then suddenly there's many many copies
of it now what happens and this can
actually be in the hundreds of thousands
in a long genome there are actually
things keeping calling there in the
hundreds of thousands and what happens
I'm going to have to apologize for my
world of in the world I guess I'll show
you down a second is that if you have
enough of these if you have a hundred
thousand every now and then maybe every
once in a blue moon what happens is one
of these copies length in a genomic
context that's what I'm trying to say
that lends it a new meaning okay so you
have a genomic context Atlantean you may
want this HAP what this means in a
molecular sense is that suddenly that
thing clicks into action suddenly the
cell can take hold of it and use it for
something functional so one of your
comments just jumped into a new place
and suddenly became a functional command
and this is what we analyzed happened in
the tetrapod genomes and that's why all
these other cop is the unlucky you know
the unlucky masses faded away and that's
why in tetrapods we only see these
hundred lucky copies that actually took
on a function that was a Russian okay so
in order to make that stick say that
that's the handle that took on a cup
function and in silicon suggested
jumping that's why we see so many of
them we had to actually attach a
function to this guy okay so that was
the last name you needed in that respect
and in order to escape the technical
details but we
convinced ourselves that actually quite
a few of these remember in human is
about 200 of these quite a few of these
actually are involved in gene regulation
that's what they do the part of the red
boxes they turn genes off and attend
genome okay so if you want to
rationalize that if you say there is a
gene out there that's the green box and
that's the red box and I apologize for
the color but if you want to say that
that Legion you think controls when and
where that gene can turn on here's one
way you can test that we've done that in
collaboration with Eddie Rubens lab at
Lawrence Berkeley now too far for me you
can actually copy that small region
think of 500 letters copied out of the
genome and put it in front of an apology
never mind that bad thing in the middle
there that's a gene that when it gets
turned on you can actually color it in
blue so you can take an embryo and ask
yourself where does that thing turn on
in my genome so you build that construct
of a couple of thousand letters and you
inject it back into one fail embryos and
that thing hops into the genome at that
stage and then it goes through the
embryo and you can stop the embryo
whatever you like and ask where is that
gene that was never in the genome before
where is that thing turned on and that
thing is turned on only as a result of
this thing either driving it or not
driving so you can do that on one side
and on the other side you can ask just
take a plane wild-type embryo and ask
when is that gene actually turned on at
the exact same developmental stage so
that's exactly what we're going to do
not take one of the region's that came
from a repeat from a selfish piece of
DNA and make and ask where does that
drive expression of our apology and
compare that to the wild-type team okay
let me show you so these are quite
expensive experiments they take over two
months let me show the 10 presenting I'm
going to talk about today so here's one
of the strings of DNA and this is about
a million methods of your genome a and
we picked that thick milk over here in
that 1 million letters does a single
gene a single green board
that tells you how to be the protein and
presumably all these expanses of space
next to it is where all the red boxes
are large and you can actually see that
visually so there are three other late
boxes that have been verified before
hours these you know nobody knows about
the revolutionary Allah genes but there
are three other eight boxes next to the
chain but when you compare this whole 1
million million letters let's say
twofold nothing that evolved neutral
issue the line between us and for the
only regions you see aligning between us
and fold presumably out there because
the functional and selection sweeps away
all the sequences that I fell from a
common code all these tick marks feel
presumably act to make sure that this
gene gets turned on at the right time in
the right place and we understand early
three of them one of them by the way is
another will to conserve their me I
won't talk about down so we had this guy
over here one of the things that go back
to folks all share the clothes oil
tetrapods coming formerly periodic
sequence and we said that guy controls
that gene so we went and done exactly
the experiment I told you taking that
thing out of context put it in front of
a new gene or apology and ask where is
that thing experts what you see on the
left is how our several hundred letter
region drive expression drive expression
of the reporter gene compared to the
wild-type islet one gene that sits there
in the middle of that picture you can
see that the patterns of very well
matching you can actually zoom in and
see these of genital eminence here you
can see the outer edge of the developing
limb very clean matching patterns you
can actually go ahead and section
through the head the brain the thorax
etc and you can see that the sections
also match very nicely between where our
small agent drive expression of our
apology in versus the wild-type gene is
being expressed so you can tell yourself
what we've done is we've proven that one
of these leads come to all boxes this
one is actually very following five
hundred thousand bases letters from the
gene it regulates can actually come from
these repetitive sources that's that for
the big news that came out of that word
so let me come
in the last few minutes I guess
explaining why that last observation
that these control boxes can actually
come from these things that help around
you know genome-wide that is so much fun
so when I told the DNA replication is
imperfect right and we focus before on
how things happen at small scale one
letter falls off another one adds what
actually happens is that these changes
happen on all scales and sometimes quite
often you get whole substrings
replicated twice in the next generation
sometimes hold sub things fall off but
let's focus on the ones that actually
get to replicate so if you can imagine
this being a gene this tells you how to
make a protein suddenly in the next
generation you can have two copies of
this thing okay now if you have two
copies of this thing this guy typically
was already doing let's imagine 10
different roles in your in your cell so
when it got actually made into a protein
that boating was busy doing all kinds of
things now we can make it from two
different templates you can actually
imagine this guy taking on five of the
function the other guy taking on the
other five and then each of them can
actually accommodate new functions by
changing the sequence it's just that the
common you know the subset of both of
them actually does or that that guy was
doing before and a bunch more okay so
what we're thinking before the genomic
era is for these type of duplications
you just make no jeans and you have a
more complex organism that was part of
the thinking so we were supposed to have
many more genes than simple organisms
and that came out of the resonant
resonant know okay so this is about is a
bar chart I guess of how many genes /
all these sequence individual sequence
organisms you can see that we before
this thing started with opportune had
100,000 genes and that thing kept
shrinking and shrinking and shrinking
and now we're quite a shrink to this
there by the way and we're actually
quite in Pearl with its won't c elegans
that has a thousand cells to the adult a
thousand serve vs 10 to the 14 hundreds
of different tissue types in human etc
etc the same level
of jeans okay that was one of the big
messages that came out of these these
genome projects and reading what we
understand today is that it's not the
genes that actually matter to a loud
extent you know everything matters in
biology but it seems that the biggest
footprint is actually in diversity is
that of the control boxes so actually
adding on new control boxes and taking
them away has a profound effect on how
an organism looks and what I'm showing
you these two examples one out of Shawn
Carroll's lab and you Madison another
one from Stanford David Kingsley and you
can see how you add a single control box
in front of a single gene and you get a
new spot on a fly wing and that happens
because this gene now gets turned on a
very specific time the very specific
place remember these are typically genes
that then go on and bind DNA elsewhere
and they turn on other genes but turn on
other genes the turn on others you get a
cascading effect same deal here you take
one of these out and you have a lead for
the cliffs reduction in these hind
behind are in these pelvic bones here so
very very much phenotype so regulatory
genes actually we think now are the
major driving forces of phenotypic
diversity in vertebrates and reading you
can compare little bit to envelopment
and you can find the same genes doing
pretty much the same thing but you can
never match the control box as between
vertebrate in environments we think that
some of that is because it's been so
long ago that we actually need to know
better how to compare them but
definitely some of the things are
available specific and the world you
know I just shown you one that was
teleport specific so some of these
control boxes can land out of clear out
of thin air click into action and give
you a very clear phenotype that's part
of what we were showing okay and let's
just keep that it's you know that the
puzzle is even greater because for in
this particular example that's actually
one of the most I think fun things when
you're working in genomics these days
you write up your work and you answer
maybe one question or two questions but
immediately you raise many more
questions and you've actually
answer so in this particular case he is
the repeat here is the selfish bit of
DNA in that fish okay you change it very
little and that thing actually code for
protein this is the altar conserved
element i shaii we thought that one
actually called supporting you change it
very little in a different way and that
thing is the one I showed you
controlling the mouse embryo we haven't
a clue of how you can make something
meaningful here that will last hundreds
of million years something meaningful
there and what exactly they come from
what is that junkie really working on
that so you know pretty much this is
really the shape of the human genome
today I love this caricature actually
navika my website it is interpretation
right we've assembled the thing though
it's already a symbol but as far as
things go let me give you one last
example maybe maybe I won't give an
example there's all kinds of things that
are mysteriously i'll just say line a
second this is the whole genome three
billion bases and that's what needed to
xerox out of the genome in order to make
protein coding genes another technology
that just came into being allow the to
mention allows us to mention how much is
actually copied out of the genome that's
the number so we don't know what the
vast majority of these things that are
zero start of the genome do so it's not
just an owl end of the field is is in
flux the whole thing is perfect in fact
so let me wrap up I just tell you so
I've told you about three works I think
predominantly that I've done through the
postdoc and now I'm starting up my own
app may be the focus of that lab would
be understanding what these regions do
there's thousands of thousands of these
they'll clearly huddled around
developmental genes these are the genes
that have to control this beautiful
temporal you know project to it and
multiple trajectories within to you
think that there's you need for all
these control boxes you can definitely
see in the genome what you see in the
embryo so these are numbers going from
fish to human you can see how the very
similar when they start out and then
they failed your weigh-in further
develop way you can see the same thing
in the genome our genome shares all
kinds of red boxes with fish genomes
those actually well
only pattern this phase and then as you
go further and further out the boxes
that have similar to less and less
species that's what in common with these
guys and then then etc etc until you get
to human specific sequences so the
far-field to work with there's all kinds
of things to do we actually want to
understand this code it's a regulatory
call it the regulatory code and
effectively we need to break way to
understand how all these boxes control
when and where the genes are turned on
we want to understand how they evolved I
show you that some of them can actually
land out of thin air and finally last
but definitely not least but actually
you know a lot of focus has been taken
over the last I don't know 20 30 s and
under thing that genes themselves how to
make a protein and when that goes bad
from a replication between one organism
and another and some jeans on some
proteins are not done the right way you
get all kinds of disease but there are
all kinds of diseases that we can either
not explain for the genome that we know
already telling or we can explain
portions of which and this is just one
striking case with a single letter
change in one of these control boxes
actually matches perfectly in families
or they have this phenotype of
polydactyly that's extra fingers to the
hands of the cliff six of them i think
in eternity so just understanding the
regulatory code has a lot of potential
going for bench wet and dry bench to the
bedside okay and finally from a
computational perspective they're all
these fascinating challenges of these
large databases very challenging data
etc it's an iron tools and we need
thousands of users out there that you
can serve as well as self your own
interesting in pursuing time okay to
wrap things up those really is a lot of
flux these days about understanding
genomics and it call came about because
we through those sequences on the table
we now have whole genomes to look at not
just looking under the lamp at the
regions with thought will important now
we see all kinds of other things and
technology is really the driving force
these days so all kinds of technologies
that are able to measure all kinds of
things genome-wide
and the revolution Allah revolutionize
what we understand what we expect to
find in our genome I've talked about a
couple things these extremely
conservation these other conservatives
which will play pretty much in the dark
still about what exactly they do we
think it has to do with DNA structure
there are reasons for that I won't go
into them now but presumably there's a
very specific structure that they have
to take in space and that accounts for a
hundred percent conservation we think we
want to understand evolution of apology
to these boxes and definitely contribute
to treating human disease and finally
there's all kinds of things that's the
copying out all kinds of things about
genome that are in flux okay so let me
wrap up by thanking people are kind of
encouraging or please myself hopefully
everybody first and form of David Howser
who's my man Erick UC Santa Cruz it's
been a just a brilliant trip and other
people in santa cruz and elsewhere that
I've worked with to the postal and you
for your patience thank you we talked
about timing about some of the
regulatory
issues are you to return to your cells
generation or what is what is the time
basis no let me get back get back so you
know you have a process there with a
single cell becomes two and the two
becomes full etc etcetera actually and
that is the process that I talked about
so individual cells have to make the
right type of proteins for themselves
and then they have to interact with
other cells that's when I work so well
this whole trajectory out there what
happens at all levels this is a single
cell and have to make the right proteins
in order to become to serve and then
these two have to make sure that they
are in sync with each other and they
also produce that the same building
blocks the same are working molecules in
order to go to the fourth stage cell
etcetera etcetera that's what i mean by
temporality i mean we need so you can
imagine each cell as an autonomous unit
it has to do the right things in order
to do the right things at the right time
it has to produce the like molecule to
do then that's what the genome kicks in
the genome is the template of how to
make the things and when and where to
make them but the way is the generation
number in and divisions sake
then when I that haven't seen one in
play but if you want to get down to the
nitty-gritty the wind is actually other
protein molecules binding next to that
gene and turning that one on that's what
I won't bother with that but that's what
all the circuitry was about it's about
one going on one gate let's buy one
going on and turning on the next one
turning on the next one etc it's an
accident but that has to do both in what
happens within a single cell and both in
what happens in its context all these
signals have to be a simulator at the
right time and somehow they simulate
predominantly to those bindings
opponents other processes work might
have smoothed out a lot of biology but
these are key players they're turning
things are at the right time to have the
right molecule and delight quantity or
derived tissue etc etc yep learn faster
somebody like looking at the barbers
viruses and bacteria which have you like
a much more durable
so
like yeah so the question was can we
learn anything from simple organisms
about this higher level one so the
simple question the simple answer is
absolutely the problem is that the
models breakdown because it seems that
our count on the thing that we've
already dealt with and even in very
little very complex in their own ways
but i think that there's things that the
vertebrate subtree of the tree of life
does that others do not and that's these
boxes that lie up to a million letters
away that seems to be variable specific
if you believe that you're kind of stuck
with vertebrates to understand those you
can understand the regions that are
close by to the genes but not the ones
that are filtered out there and when you
want to understand them you're pretty
much invertebrate land one of the things
that I gloves too is actually we're
hoping to come up with decent metrics to
maybe map some of these back to
invertebrates I mean to some extent it
doesn't make sense that we make the same
organs let's say or similar organs from
the same sets of genes and we share none
of the control boxes it makes much more
sense that some of the control boxes are
shared that the sequences of they felt
so father if you have no idea what they
encode fall and we don't at the moment
you have to allow statistical similarity
you know Eddie distance essentially and
that goes away at some point and you can
still keep the function so it's a mixed
bag pretty much will stuck in vertebrate
land for the regions that are found out
there we think at the mount yep like a
different question and there is
studies have you found any parts of the
genome which were introduced introduce
some external services that come from
their common ancestor violation sir so
so the question I'll casting the terms
that are commonly the question is
whether we can see something which is
called horizontal gene transfer I figure
if it so I think it's always on top so
the question is can you actually see
pieces of DNA that didn't come from some
common answer to what I've shown you
here I'll pieces from the common
anthologies hop around the question was
can you have something come out of an
external source so in the human genome
for example you have a viral infection
that balance flexion actually goes to
the cells that actually make up your
progeny it affects their genome and
sunny the genome that goes on to the
next generation has been there's a chunk
of DNA that was never for the common
Hanson you know from the parent of that
child that goes on beyond that in the
human genome when it was first sequence
it was thought that we were seeing
several of these cases all of them
pretty much have been dispelled that
doesn't mean that there aren't any but
there aren't any known we know in other
vertebrate in some types of fish of
clear cases like that so you can show
which species of bacteria actually
donated a chunk of DNA to that I believe
Salman subspecies so it does happen even
these higher more complex let's say
organisms there isn't a single verified
case in human but I didn't say the wrong
thing I'm curious how much in these
databases we kind of tend to ignore the
3d information and you see what's the
basis until I Frizzles for your control
blocks if you're a million bases apart
do they actually have any spatial
locality or
you have so the question was what about
the spatial structure that presumably we
acknowledge so the other thing that we
sweep under the rug you definitely in
treating them as sequences one of them
is really this spatial confirmation i
don't think i have and have a slightly
but what there are two predominant ways
of thinking how something that's a
million letters away can affect
something that happens here one of them
is that thing falls in 3d space who
comes close so it's following sequence
space but when you actually see the
thing packed it's actually very close
another way of looking at it another way
of I patha sizing is that things bind
over there other proteins bind and then
they slide along that that length of it
and everything's going here and there
knowing biology there might actually be
cases that that won't listen that way
but definitely structure is a key player
here but we haven't addressed directly
part of what you assume is that it's
encoded in the sequence therefore those
leg you'll allottees that make up the
structural features could already
possibly be there and be modeled if you
apply the exit istic on tues even if you
don't understand it but it's definitely
a key player and i think i wish i had a
slide for that back long molecule the
DNA it's not just floating there in the
cell it's actually wrapped up in your
structures and the yoga structures are
themselves they come in packets and the
packets coming bigger package so there's
a whole structural aspect of the thing
in the yo-yos can be wrapped to this
side and that side and suddenly
something is accessible and something
isn't I've smoothed a lot of stuff that
has to do in structured definitely okay
flip you take a control
structure and
indicator of all of you yeah according
to how do you know it it's controlling
the recording gene you're taking it out
of context somewhere else in putting in
somewhere else you started it the same
distance or you one of the magic so let
me stop by the end because the end would
be more clear and then I'm confused when
I get back so the question is how do you
know that this control element that
you've taken out of context actually
controls the apology so the methodology
there has been worked out what you do is
you take the reporter gene your
indicator and then you integrate it into
the genome without that books and you
see that it's never one that's one of
the things you do and then you add that
thing the only change in your experiment
is you've added that works you ask
exactly the same question what happens
at eleven point for Dale Evan point five
and suddenly you see turned on and and
another thing that is very important is
that you never only see it in one embryo
you actually need to have your result
replicable of course multiple
individuals unfortunately in something
in some respects but you definitely
replicate your result of course multiple
embryos so you say without this piece of
DNA there's nothing there I add it on
and there's a clear pattern that I see
across ten embryos exact same pattern or
near exact same part and the only
rationale is that piece of DNA that you
added is the one can fill that change
because that's the only thing that
changing that that's why now having said
that these magic boxes that work up to a
million bases away you place them a
hundred bases away of the indicator and
experiment you place them in this
orientation and place them in that
orientation they work so the all kinds
of things and I still haven't told you
how exactly they integrate into the
genome that would puzzle you even more
but let's say that they that's that has
its quick as well but as far as we can
see it conserved very precise control
and that control just smashes very
nicely typically as a subset of the
patterns of the gene from whose
neighborhood you took it away which also
tells you that you actually did grab a
part of the little fun
