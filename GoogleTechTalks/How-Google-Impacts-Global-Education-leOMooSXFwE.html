introduced me and I came from george
washington university in DC I am
educational measurement person and then
I happen to developing a assessment
system which is computer adaptive
formative assessment system with two
other colleagues last year actually
we're working on few years for the dis
system but inside of you know in the
process of the development and we use a
lot of Google API so today the main
major purpose of this presentation is
actually you know an explaining and
showing how those Google API has been
used for this particular new development
again I working on the Kappa which is
computer adaptive formative assessment
engine and this engine had a many
application and client system and you
know an inside of engine and many client
system and i've been using of a lot of
you know google application so probably
it's good to start with what is computer
adaptive formative system which is kappa
computer adaptive formative assessment
system is combination of computer
adaptive and formative assessment it is
very simple formula because this is
combination of both of them probably
it's very nice to explain this kappa
system from motivation first why I why
we have to develop this kappa system
first of all in theory there's some
evolutional assessment theory in 1902
1950 we call it a classical test theory
error and a lot of mean mode media and
percentile ranking t value and that kind
of stuff has been developed this area
and this is then next 30 years and so
called item list man theory like old
mode you know probably most of our
standardized test SI te GRE and computer
adaptive testing system is rely on this
IRT model and 1982 the 2010
diagnostic assessment pro and you know
right now in San Francisco there's a
huge measurement conference going on
there's a hundred people gathering
around and you know and then they are
talking about this irt and diagnostic
modeling right now in san francisco and
this weekend especially as a scholar i
was very interested in what is next
generation of this diagnostic model
which is from today to 20 years and 30
years and what will be the future of the
assessment and then many people talk
about future of assessment likely to be
a formative assessment so how and then
this is actually one of the motivation
why I need to think about the formative
assessment model and there's another
motivation to which is practice the
reason is nowadays we have a shoot so
much emphasis on assessment but the
emphasis on its assessment and you know
and those going to put much weight on
the assessment not necessarily helping
students out the for example you know
teaching to test studying for tests you
know not necessarily teachers are
teaching for student learning but you
know teachers are teaching for text and
the students are learning for test to
maximizing score that's why they're
learning so that kind of side effect is
there and also you know there's a huge
dropping out and here's giving up for
example math exam they just gave up now
they're not studying anymore at some
point and also try adding student in the
classroom practice and then still we
straight we still struggling on the
lower achievement even those assessments
so why we even we spend a lot of money
and a lot of energy and a lot of effort
on assessment why those things why this
kind of you know vicious cycle is still
there because we spend more money and
energy and cost to assessment still you
know practice doesn't help and some at
some point our practice getting worse
because of that assessment issue
the main reason I identify the Y
assessments and the practice is not
getting along well is possible we had a
too much emphasis on summative
assessment summative assessment the
major purpose of summative assessment is
monitoring and ranking students and then
summative assessment purposes gathering
information for decision maker basically
that's actually major purpose of
summative assessment but however there's
another side of assessment which is
formative assessment formative
assessment is major purpose of formative
assessment is assisting and helping
student and especially we are gathering
information from students to helping
students so that is actually fundamental
differences between formative and
summative assessment and you know
formative assessment is educational 101
and anyone take basic education course
and assessment course and there is a
like you know this definition has been
around like a hundred years so but the
one of the element key element of
formative assessment is modifying
teaching and learning activity and
providing feedback and you know and then
you know details of a contents and
performance and you know a related to
contents and performance so providing
this kind of feedback and modifying and
teaching and learning activity is very
very cool but there is a reason why this
is not practical yet because most of
practice in our in a classroom and you
know accountability system we heavily
rely on summative assessment so I
studied and why this kind of cool
formative assessment is not so much
popular yet and that there are three
major reason I able to identify the
first one is the standard based larger
we determine the what is taught in
classroom because teacher need to teach
is based on sir motive criterion so
standard that has been set up for
majorly focus on summative sense or
summative sets fashion and then second
of all and the lack of the connection
tuen classroom approach to teaching and
national monitoring system in short like
accountability system if you are good in
terms of a formative assessment teacher
not necessarily you are good in
summative assessment you know some good
teacher and summative assessment sense
because national monitoring system is so
heavily rely on some Eclipse ends so now
lets you know teacher one of your
formative assessment formative teacher
but they couldn't beat it the reason is
there will be evaluated and monitored
and that they will be guided by
summative this accountability system and
third of all the lack of resources for
the classroom practice as we as we see
the definition of formative assessment
they have to tailor the feedback instant
feedback they have to manage you know
modify their curriculum and instruction
based on information but teacher do not
have time to you know providing the
individual and you know Taylor the
feedback in the classroom because
there's absolutely no time and lack of
resources of this beautiful formative
formative assessment in practice let's
reason why ok and then if if we wanted
to make this formative assessment as a
practical what kind of things should be
done first of all and then it should be
the formative assessment should beast
you know strictly based on standard
second of all and we have to we have to
let computer or network to help teacher
to providing the kind of feedback and
instruction and we have to help then you
know how to actually teacher can make
this formative assessment becomes a
practical and the third one is we have
to have a clear accountability system
which is are you good teacher in terms
of formative assessment and we have to
build in this accountability system into
the you know new development and the
last one it should be formative which is
treatment centered you know treatment
center is the dis system need to focus
on how to help student how to
effectively help students a program need
to
generating information immediately and
effectively and practically and how to
practically how to help student so what
is it and then I start to define this
big picture of okay if I want to end a
new system which is computer adaptive
formative assessment system need to
include those kind of element standard
waste should be formative of course and
computer-assisted or computer adaptive
and need to be psycho matically valid
which is my major which is educational
researcher and including accountability
system too so last year I had a beta
version with the other colleagues and
the colleagues are dr. Sonny Kim he is
math content expert and also dr.
connealy on his computer science people
so me as assessment and educational
measurement people and the three of us
we decided to make this computer
adaptive formative assessment system
last year and then any education context
we need to have some kind of application
and for application winter but so called
the subject so we can shopping around
what kind of subs it will be the best
fit for this system and we decide to
tackle mathematic first so there's an
English version we just thinking about
it but right now that this computer
adaptive formative assessment as a
subject matter that we decide to math
because math is very very easy to tackle
at the first first try er alright though
you know so far we talk about motivation
or computer adaptive formative
assessment and we will get into
component of the computer adaptive
formative assessment there's a computer
adaptive formative assessment kappa
system had a several layers and i want
to probably you know this structural
layer is best way to understand what's
going on and what you know how this
computer adaptive formative assessment
has been built up first of all very
inside of the system there's auto item
general
component we will talk about in detail
later and outside outside there's a
cognitive map cognitive knowledge met
theatre in there and also there's a
computer adaptive future and then also
next layer we put it into lots of
applications client server system and
then the very end and to meet the actual
practitioners and outside of world
people we are doing globalization layer
as a very very outfit first of all let
me introduce auto item generation alter
item generation system is if you had a
one pattern at the one pattern
generating very very many instances
because right now we are working with
the math instead of 1 plus 2 equal to 3
we make assists like you know pattern as
a plus B equal to C and that we
randomize a randomized be and that we
will get a randomized to see so if we
based on that one particular pattern be
able to generate many many instances so
computer adaptive anacapa system gear up
this aig auto item generation moderated
the most essential part of the system
why why you gear up this aig as a most
essential part of computer system the
region is first of all you know and if
you want to do the formative assessment
and you need to cover provide adequate
contents coverage because to cover
entire content area you have a huge
amount of mathematic items so because we
can jump just in a hand you know it
takes so long and then there's a huge
demand of the building of the hughes on
item bank that's first the reason why we
we we treat this auto item generation as
core part of this kappa system second of
all cody team knowledge map approach
which is we break it down and that
mathematic mathematic skills in the very
very fine details and that we basically
Common Core State standard into our
system there's a thousand skills and
each skill requires to measure each
skill which is thousand skills recorded
many items so eventually it item banker
should be humongous so that's reason why
that's a second reason to measure all
those you know many details are
mathematics skills we have to gear up
this auto item generation model and item
exposure control too because we should
able to expose our item for the security
region because we can use the same item
over and over and over but but if we
have a one pattern still we have a
security issue for the each specific
pattern but at least they need to solve
that particular pattern and then last
one is this computer adaptive formative
kappa system is engine can have a many
application for example jeelani game
game learning environment or a workbook
environment many other type of
application require this kind of many
different type of items generation so
that's reason why we also that this is
less the reason why we gear up this
author item generation has core part
alright can we go we can you go to the
example of this aig module this is one
of the example of auto item generation
this is like in this the one of the auto
item generation challenging is there's a
huge amount you know energy generation
inside of there because if we want a
high quality of math item there's a
chart there and mathematic equation
there so you know on the fly if we have
to generating those images right and you
know under that's reason why how you
know the first but first the harder we
have to get through is how we taking
care of that those images and then you
know one of my colleague which is doctor
Yoon and the one
and come back Hey aha how about we are
using google api which is emmy gee
google image API providing those on the
fly image generation system and the e
take advantage of those google api and
and we can you know generating all those
math equation especially is it for free
so i didn't know this kind of api exist
by then but he find out that this google
api so now we hate be able to generating
all those pictures and math equations on
the fly and whenever we want and we
using this API and we move up to our
auto item generation system quality to
the next level most of auto item
generation system in a conventional auto
item generation system to not you know
fully taking care of to those math
equation but we have a square root 2
there in a division there in a matrix
there but you know Google API you know
let us to open that entire new world so
we specially thanks for the deaths this
API uses and also this is Korean another
math item I know some of you are
familiar some of you are not familiar
because a lot of math item can be
translated into different languages
because this is math item so it's
relatively easy to translate and then
you know when translated and then we are
using google translation api and then it
excel in a huge amount of time to
translate the other languages and also
there's a beyond those math equation and
a lot of you know math item require
chart so we also use google api chart to
enabling this auto item generation and
the inside of engine so this chart and
this proportion and can be you know
dynamically changed you know according
to certain you know to certain situation
so you know based on okay this based on
this google translation module and we
can translate one you know English item
two Korean Japanese and Chinese and all
other languages we
very easily all right next component of
copper system is cognitive knowledge map
system cognitive knowledge map system
before moving on to the cognitive
knowledge map system let me introduce
this Common Core State standard cop
instead kappa system is strictly rely on
this Common Core State standard night on
2012 government some coordinated by NGA
this Common Core standard has been
published still this is prototype beta
version but in short in common core
state to standard mathematic and they
break it down the entire k12 mathematic
contents into approximately 600 skills
so we take this 600 skills and we also
benchmarking Korea and Japan and we
extending those kind of k-12 k-12
education system is slightly different
from each country but their mathematics
kill itself is pretty much you know
pretty much too similar but only
difference is for example Korea Hara you
know calculus inside of k-12 system so
we amended those 400 calculus related to
skill set and that we got approximately
thousand skill set very very very unique
and very very very in operation
elizaville mathematical skills that be
able to get it we call it as common core
caliber standard because the reason why
I call it as a common coracle over
standard and these standards taking care
of the most of you know k12 system in
the world all right based on get those
Common Core standard let on I'm treating
this K 12 cakes case of K as standard
for example we have a unit thousand
columns each column representing each K
representing each mathematics
skills and I representing each item so
we start the building up item bank using
Auto item generation module from you
know to cover 2k to Kate you know k to k
thousand for example so first item we
first item is the as an example is only
connected to k 1 which is the this
particular first item is to measure
specifically and it's only require k 1
as you know as a skill and an also for
example last item require k1 k2 k3 this
item representing to solve this
particular last item we need to know a
sum someone need to know k1 and k2 and
k3 skills this is relationship between
each item which is module for us auto
item generation module two entire thus
the skills and standard so in
psychometric term we call it as this
matrix as a Q matrix because this
government relations between instrument
and the thing we supposed to measure
which is skills and then above and
beyond those standards were there but
those standards are just you know approx
sequence follow the proximate sequence
of each grade is a fifth-grade there's a
domain a for example geometry domain be
and domain see and the sixth grade and
we also had a domain ABC but we know and
then you're likely we sub students
supposably know the fifth grade nology
to move on to the sixth grade but not
necessarily because they have a lot more
detailed relationship which is
prerequisite relationship between those
you know standards so we start the
building building up the next part which
is start to connect because those you
know those each grade standard and more
details an expert actually disconnected
is providing this prototype of
disconnection
and then we collect the data and the
based on the data we hypothesizing this
relationship and empirically validating
those relationship too so there's some
expert validation and empirical
validation on this you know knowledge
map in other words that the the process
what I did it in the you know bottom
part of here is basically we building up
the relationship between each K and K
which k had a pre-requisite of the other
k because when you solve some particular
math problem at some time at some point
you have to know that the other
mathematical skills to solve one certain
thing or the other way around and the
other you know and then to solve a
particular mathematical skill item you
don't have to know the other thing so
that's reason why the thousand you know
this this matrix illustrating
relationship between thousand skills and
a thousand skill week I called it as a
cop a matrix which is relationship
between among those cakes so element up
to these things getting a bigger and
getting a bigger at some point is
computationally extremely challenging
business to how to estimate those things
because it's easy at you know contents
expert providing this map itself is very
challenging and require huge amount the
data to validating this relationship too
but inside of our engine will keep doing
this business because this map is very
very crucial part of entire system which
to providing on adequate feedback to
students anyway figures on Brandon and
then next the purpose of the dis system
is finding out a particular type a
particular set of skill set works at the
bottle egg because now we able to
identify students and the given
information a you need to study this
that's a reason why you stove under
eighty percent not anymore ok you are
eighty percent pass/fail now we able to
diagnose nice
diagnosing students a skill set and
they'll be able to provide feedback and
pinpoint feedback based on their
diagnosis which is treatment I call it
so the the particular skill set
mathematical skill set they struggled
and that they need to master in urgent
matter I call it as epicenter epicenter
is just another name of particular skill
set they supposed to study as a very
very early and I mean urgently okay this
is another way of you know illustrating
this epicenter for example you know
first grade to the seventh grade and
that there's an itch grade that there
have you know standard and height
representing their mastery level of each
standard so in this system we try to
find out what particular type of skill
set need to be improved to maximizing
entire surface can be treated up because
every standards is connected to each
other it's not independent so it really
really depends on which one need to move
up to maximizing entire surface move up
so this is fundamental algorithm idea to
defining epicenter so a presenter is the
best like you know you know best
position they need to study and you know
if they mastered that particular
standard and that they will easily move
on to the next you know learning process
inside of the dis model and for example
between subject mothers give it a time
frame work and then we for example each
standard this each standard skill can be
measured by several item in psychometric
term we call this item item theoretical
IRT model and once we measured those
standard mastery level relationship
between standard which is latent
variable can be estimated by structural
equation modeling which is another
psychometric
and this relationship because most of
students are nested within teacher and
the teachers are nested within school so
we also adapting multi-level modeling
hierarchical linear modeling approach
and those estimation should be done with
the Bayesian approach the reason is we
have a few small information to you to
cover a lot of you know unknown
parameters technically there's a huge
amount of you know too many unknown
parameter compared to our known
information so we need to rely on strong
you know informative a prior in Beijing
framework so this is actually
psychometric term again this is we call
it as a latent variable modeling and
your social behavior science people
doing it and as I mentioned to you we
have like 100 people in San Francisco
right now in a are a conference doing
all those latent variable modeling
techniques so I'm the one I'm belong to
one of those you know psychometrician
another challenger up that this
particular system is this is because we
provide feedback and we have to monitor
student progress over time and each
skill set mastery level which is mastery
level 0 to 1 which is founded and we
need to we also think about this kind of
nonlinear growth mulling this over time
how those standards either aggregated or
each standard progress so sometimes a
lot of you know there for example this
is one students over three skills
progress and each skill one that
particular student it you know three
skills are starting from the fairly
bottom line and but each skill get a
different awesome totti in upper
asymptote the other example is they have
a different type of lower asymptote they
started and but they separated into the
different type of you know upper lower
sim totes differently and upper
asymptote differently and the last
example is they started with a very
different type
starting line but eventually they you
know they were able to master all
different skills so this kind of
variation and over time change can be
estimated by this for primary logistic
regression model logistic growth
modeling and there's some you know
papers and references I'm working on it
so especially two days ago I propose a
particular method methodological
approach how to evaluate in this kind of
particular copper system in logistic
growth modeling framework right
cognitive map so far i talked about
cognitive map and let me move on to the
formative assessment model again
formative assessment model is so far our
assessment model is fairly focus on how
they you know the major purpose of the
traditional assessment model is how to
accurately measure where and how student
ease but treatment centered is nowadays
you know people's are sick of the dose
right now okay knowing knowing knowing
the reason is to know is not enough we
have to help them not just understanding
where they are and there's a strong
demand how to help students so that's
reason why we move our paradigm to
treatment centered approach treatment
centered approach is the model
estimating the assessment model is
estimating what kind of things to the
need to study now instead of where they
are what's their percentile rank or the
accurate relative location because
mother try to estimate so what they need
to study so model please mother generate
what they need to study to help student
immediately so you know there's a first
generation and third generation i call
it the fourth generation model is
formative assessment model which is
given data there's a person primer and
item perimeter and diagnosis perimeter
and in on the top of this diagnosis
parameter we caught we also estimating
this treatment primer so let me let me
explain what kind of uniformity versus
model role inside of this kappa system
kappa system basically estimating
treatment treatment is treatment can be
unfolded into epicenter list which is
number of standard they need to study
with priority priority is very important
because you know not just that you we
point out the three epicenter a dis dis
skill set need to be study earlier and
next and the d others so we also provide
this priority of the epicenter and also
expose your way to so how many times you
have to spend on this particular skill
set and how many time you spend all
particular skill set and later and how
many times you know how much time you
need to spend under the layer of the
standard so in indeed this kind of
treatment and the ders folded into three
different direction to first of all
student feedback or treatment to
students and treatment to parents and
treatment to teacher so this system
generating three different type of
feedback or treatment we call it a study
guide for students we call it parental
guide for parents and we call it the
instructional guide to teacher so this
system generating these three different
type of feedback or information to
maximizing student learning this is just
in diagram and you know how those things
are work out and an average student
providing information to kappa engine
and this engine generating feedback to
teachers parents and student and a
student feedback or student treatment
can decompose into like a book
information which book they need to
study and witches study video they need
to learn or watch and what kind of
practice problem they need to solve and
what kind of game they need to do
so we provide those you know detailed
information study information to
students and you know and teacher and
parents to all those informations are
you know you know tailored feedback and
tailored information computer generated
this kind of tailored feedback and
teacher and parents and students able to
taking on barrage of those kind of
computer generated and in tailored
feedback let me getting into more
specifically for the district study book
information study book information is
the first facet of the student feedback
basically we provide the textbook
information to strengthening each
student fe center because we know that
we have a complete known epicenter list
and this system identified what kind of
each student what kind of epicenter they
need to study and we are mapping this
epicenter to book information so
sometimes we system actually the
building of the database and what kind
of book they need to study for the
epicenter or we are using google book
api or product search and we are
searching up the books and what kind of
book is best book for or book
information for students to
strengthening this particular you know
textbook information angle the other
anger is study video because we have you
know for example thousand epicenter and
the one students gather like a three
epicenter list so each epicenter they
need they have a specific mathematical
knowledge e and also we are we are using
YouTube API the what kind of video is
best fit for that particular students
epicenters right now I know you know
there's a thousand thousand videos there
and it's not fully matching this
epicenter the great news is every year
you know an appropriate video has been
developed by other people so instead of
we developing our own video we are
taking advantage of the other people
developing we are
happy those other people you know
YouTube video to our content so over
here I think is there's dramatic change
on the especially last two year three
years because a lot of people's are
making generating those specific
standard unrelated to study video so
student able to taking advantage up to
those on video video treatment through
this YouTube API again we also provide
practice practice problem which is
strengthening their epicenters because
kappa aig mazel as I also explained and
aig module had a lot of Google API on
there so based on that aig we generate a
lot of practice problem almost the
infinite number of practice problem to
students to until they able to master
particular set of skills okay
applications there are several
applications there kappa engine is the
reason why i call it as engine is
there's so many application so available
number one is elearning be able to you
know be able to provide the learning
opportunity to students based on this
you know kappa engine right and second
of all we also apply this to the testing
service like a formal education web
based computer adaptive testing service
this are you know full item bank which
is geared up to AIG and diagnostic and
treatment process can be integrated into
regular testing service and also this
kappa engine can be applicable to eat
workbook or workbook on demand or tailor
the workbook type of thing electronic
workbook not anymore if this this is
just beyond PDF and electronic workbook
and we can make their own individual
workbook based on their progress so on
the fly we able to generating those you
know computer-generated workbook taylor
to particular students skillset
portfolio and also we also apply this
cop
engine to G learning environment a lot
of you know right now I'm working on the
panda games penta games company to
setting a protocol from this kappa
engine to game application because game
application require a lot of different
type of you know eh they really really
appreciate aig module because they don't
have to keep up to those huge amount
choose size of item bank inside of game
they just communicating our server today
able to getting up to those on math item
and they're using storytelling game and
pure math game or action game and their
apply work quiz game and their apply
those meth item into the game context
and an e-learning application meal or we
last year we launched a ms test calm
which is which provided daily tailored
math worksheet entire k to 12 standard
base so it covered entire k to stem k to
k 12 standard and you know especially
for free to all students in the world so
in a lot of students are taking on the
balance of this mstest calm but you know
then they thanks to ms test calm i also
want to thanks to google because as i
explained to you the reason why we able
to provide this math free worksheet to
entire student is we were able to you
know i use google api m.ed charts and
you know google search api is inside of
this engine again this k12 standard base
like in a more learning type of
application can be extendable by helping
of those google translation module two
for example right now is all math items
are in English but is expanded to Korean
Japan and Spanish and over here and over
here but relatively the cost of
translating those math item and using
google translation API is a lot cheaper
than you know method and creation so
relatively cheaper so it's easy to
expanding to is
to serve global service in different
culture or language the application in
future we had another particular armed
service to which is in Korean serve in
the party this service is slightly
different from k-12 service and EMS test
calm because it's KSAT mstest rom this
is particular for the s80 this is korean
s80 prep test so this is not anymore in
a k-12 and higher direction but we only
focus on high school and we separating
entire high school standard the 400
standard and we do the like you know
more like you know summative practice
type of test so the orientation is
slightly different and that we will
develop this similar type of application
with you know just SI t and you know a
CT or all other you know standardized
test prep service is available is it
possible actually and another
application we are working on it is
workbook on demand and a workbook
service based on this assessment server
through assessment server and if
students getting or people getting into
assessment server and that they take
some assessment and based on that
assessment information and a workbook
server generating their Taylor to work
before death so they can shoot that PDF
file you know the only the electronic
video file to customer or they can send
or simultaneously the electronic file
can be sent to some public either
printing company and that printing
company printed and you know shipping to
their like for user for example kinko
you know we we email to that information
to customer information to the king co
and kiko print that out and the shipping
to the customer so still not not anymore
like in the exactly same workbook they
will get it nowadays they able to get
them at least a math workbook
individualized math workbook whenever
they want and we we working on this part
right now we don't have particular
application exam
yeah and another one is we using we
developing a lot of mobile device so
beyond just the web based and then
everything we developing this mobile for
example this android you know android
you know under android the system and we
developing very different type of client
application so client application in you
know gathering for example at school
client providing activities and
information in at school and then there
you know those all those mathematic
activities and learning activity
information is gathering to the server
system and also though that kind of same
information can be gathered in after
school and at home to just the weather
student playing in the game whether
student doing a classroom activity at
the classroom with teacher whether
they're doing a home activity after
school activity and all information
communicating with the server so we have
so-called ubiquitous assessment system
and you know those kind of you know to
enable the kind of ubiquitous assessment
system this android system is you know
one of the best platform that we are
developing our client and server
application to okay closing remarks and
I exactly got a 45 minute so there's a
lot of educational technology emphasis
in education world we call it elearning
and mobile learning smart learning and
ubiquitous learning I just introduced
ubiquitous assessment system and G
learning too but the reality is nowadays
you know because this everything is
connected and network base and people
and I realize and I have to learn a lot
about what what kind of you know Google
API you know I can be you know we can
use for the day enable this educational
technology whether Google developer or
Google when you guys providing those AP
is
it can be used for the disc educational
technology but I think that this is
great example from my side to introduce
this kind of example to my colleague to
assessment and educational technology
people and also i want to mention this
kind of example to you guys because you
know we especially tends to you guys in
api to enable this educational
technology especially mstest calm a lot
of students are taking the badge of the
free education service because of the
google api is okay thank you so much for
your time have any questions okay
particular a presenter and we have to
break it down several piece particular
epicenter mastery level we call it as
item response theory model because
epicenter is in the end one particular
skill set right skill that indicated by
several several items so we built up a
lot of item and the widget for example
be generating a workbook and they do the
workbook and the workbook provide the
information and they get right they get
right and they get wrong so based on
those workbook activity and for example
they do the game and they get it right
on the dead math game and they did it
well under the math game and base
collection up to those information
actually you know and using so-called
you know irt model we estimate those
latent trait which is skill which is
unknown actually but we have information
about they got right and wrong on those
instrument but basically their skill is
latent variable we estimating those
latent variable through IRT model but
given IRT model and given those you know
skills that what is epicenter is which
one they need to study they mastered
urgently or a priority that is actually
epicenter so there's a some psychometric
term but
irt mother but it's not that much hard
if you if you email me and then I will
shoot you more details of irt but
there's a there's a standardized
psychometric model which is item
response theory model which is exactly
the same way we our GRE score SI t score
is graded and you know scored scale
music once you determine this tunities
to the X amount of skills how do they
actually accomplish that and I'm
thinking other aspect passing motivation
engagement how much they practice
personal practices are some started at
the ration connotation that's actually
very challenging part because we provide
information hey you guys need to study
this one based on this book and this
game and this workbook and this study
video and we cannot fully you know
measure on all those in you know for
example we call it at a treatment like
we went to the doctor and doctor do the
same diagnosis and doctor give me a pill
and which is treatment but fidelity
issue is did you take that pill and let
you know tonight or not it's completely
you know next level of information right
and then through this you know
ubiquitous assessment system we try to
measure every little piece okay today
open up the study video or not and they
watch the study video or not measured by
when they do the end right and that's
the best information because we don't
know we can measure their brain activity
directly and and they did it or not on
practice problems it's very easy to
measure because they need to submit and
that they got submitted answer and we
get to know the way how they did it were
not so fidelis we call it a fidelity of
intervention or fidelity of treatment
issue but that's also good but because
in this kind of you know you know you'll
be caught us assessment environment and
then there's a lot of room to gathering
all those activities now all of sudden
becomes too many information and then
so-called like you know large data
analysis skills need to be you know down
and but right now again it's estimation
process and in how to use that kind of
object in firm ation to you know also
measure those fidelity to those
intervention that's actually future
future on study issue we not future at
currently we you know holily working on
the how to cooperating that kind of
thing which is result or fidelity of
treatment right now we heavily rely on
providing treatment but absolutely we
have to gather that information sir
first of all let me say I really try to
talk thank you very much miss of work
but if you allow me to be
okay at the beginning of the talk you
were saying that you know there is this
true where students are studying for a
test and you know they just weren't
specific skills from this test and you
know we don't but here with your system
that identify these epicenters and
encourage students to you know bridge
this gap aren't we doing the exact same
things of course instead of being for a
test it's for you know reaching the
comments
but at the end we're still
make every student fit in the same
boards right I I I can say we are the
last last year description you know we
try to we try to make all students to
Indian the same what same simple okay
I'm not sure I understand your question
correctly but again this for example in
our purpose of let me through this let
me explain let me explain this your
question by this epicenter the my answer
is yes or no and likely to know the
reason is the the main purpose of this
system is we want to help students in
pinpoint information we provide
efficiently help students and move on to
the next step so we are not necessarily
all student get an eighty percent of
mastery level right or we are not
necessarily concerned about all student
getting into an a certain level and I
think I completely understand different
student had a different portfolio but be
able to unfolding for example you gotta
eighty percent of mastery level or never
easy and you gotta eighty percent
mastery level on average but they have a
completely different skillset portfolio
but finding at the center is you want to
move on to the next step but you stuck
on the figure example you header like
you know you don't know the parentheses
rule that's the reason why you keep
getting wrong on items require the
knowledge of the parentheses rule right
so we try to find out that pinpoint
information try to resolve in epicenter
but how you actually what is your
beautiful picture of entire on
skill set portfolio yeah eventually
everyone got a like a perfect mastery on
the entire skill set that's good that's
good but we are not expecting Austin to
do it they have a different skill set
some still a very good at geometry
that's okay very good eat inside of
geometry some student had a very good at
you know a particular type of geometry
but you know Anna company and employer
and other people want to know that one
instead of you know SI t score and you
know 800 they wanted more details than
what's going on over there so in the
pool portfolio so we are not make it all
still in the same fit or you know a
certain but if we want to apply this
there this is them into for example
policy-relevant cut point eighty percent
that's okay when whenever we want to do
they like eighty percent traditional
summative type of you know cut point yes
we can do it but this system provides a
lot more information than traditional
eighty percent ninety percent a or b
pass or fail type of thing again we can
use that system for that matter
traditional matter but major purpose of
this one is instead of decision-making
we want to help student to providing
what they need to study so main purpose
of this assessment is not anymore
ranking or this is making only we can do
it but the more fundamental reason why
we are doing is how to effectively help
students in a instantly
yeah if the copper matrix
each column was that skill set
yeah yes exactly what kappa is another
name is skill set and epicenter is
particular skill set one particular
students need to be study very you know
originally so epicenter is individually
a particular stick skills at first
students they need to study ollie or
other thousand skills
he's actually
the question so I think I briefly
explain that part and then you know the
bat is the accuracy of feedback epic
accuracy of finding epicenters 33
depends on you know Bella dirty of this
kappa matrix so first of all contents
expert provided this relationship as
hypothesis and the gathering data and
that we tested that hypothesis and
system generating oh and then signal hey
could you could you check up this
relationship because data doesn't
support this relationship could and then
some relationship data strongly
endorsing particular relationship
otherwise you know in a different
content expert at a different opinion
about this you know relationship among
those k but that's reason why mstest
calm another reason why we open up
mstest calm for free is the free data is
gathered by every day so those data
actually you know tuning into this
copper matrix to accurately in a
building of this kappa matrix it takes
for a while and then it's not fully
automated because we have to download
the data and using statistical software
we have to estimate hypothesis test for
exactly using IRT and sem matter and
that we have to communicate with that
information we have to communicate
contents expert and contents expert to
revise that map again and then provide
again on other information so we're like
you know it's not fully automated yet
but eventually it it's nice to fully
automate it but up to so far number of
number thing to be estimated because
look at this this is relationship
between k in a thousand times thousand
and element is too much and estimating
all those relationship simultaneously is
i know there's a lot of heuristic
algorithm able to do it but also require
humongous among the data and pinnacle
data to represent you know behaving that
relationship so it takes for a while
but we working on it right now we are
like you know more primitive way
download data statistical software doing
it getting in it take every month and
every other month we download data and
estimating those relationship yes good
question and copper matrix is key point
of the accuracy of diagnosis yes
yeah why not a mess this time is to sell
whatever you know there's not structured
public education system so a lot of
students just doing by themselves with
their parents but we again we are
developing some more mobile application
so using you know nexus for example
Nexus and the teacher and student can
use in classroom but those activity and
those items generated by server and then
you know Nexus is one of device for
example you know phone and you know
those mobile devices just gateway
terminal to communicating with server so
whether we did it activity in classroom
and whether we did it activity it at
home as a workbook whether we did it
activity in by phone and game all those
informations are gathered into and
communicating with server so we actively
working on this developing their kind of
in multi multi scenario different
scenario I organized it at at school
after school at home application using
different type of device because you
know one website sitting there it cannot
cover everything so we have to actively
divide those different occasion and
different purpose of applications to
communicate this server assessment
server which is cop assessing server
any other question
that's a very good question it's it
arguable you know kapa matrix i estimate
this way an expert provide prototype and
data tested it but you know i have to
rely on the theory okay there's a
fundamental global structures there God
gave us how to learn how to build up our
mathematical knowledge II from what path
to counting 2k standard to beautiful you
know application of you know integration
into high school level but again some
people had a different route but i
believe the Godhead like you know for
more like a common round of which is
pathway to build up their mathematical
now is or bury in a popular way how
about that because data generated at
just a big a very popular way to achieve
their building up cumulating their
mathematical skills up to the next month
yes absolutely each individual had a
dare different pathway but right now
statistical model is like a kind of
aggregating those information and
provide more like a likely you know
information or aggregated information so
so yes and we are tackling to that issue
by aggregating student information
I ok the one of the great criticism or
suggestion for this system is always a
tailor can this is not a curing system I
want to say yes this is not a tutoring
system but right now I don't want to
compete with human tutoring system but I
want to I want to provide this system to
when tutor teach tutor can use this
information for example like a teacher
account each student if teacher know my
students are struggling in what kind of
trouble spot which is epicenter oh you
did it this kind of activity last night
and the dead activity provided me
information about what you are
struggling on their particular skill set
and I really am designing the system to
providing that information to teacher
instead of computer actually taking care
of everything to them because that yeah
that's actually my Invisalign I never
envisioned this entire system completely
autumn eyes it and you know becomes a
you know like a cyber tutor personally
no yeah
but instead i'm making this system to
very very easy to use ready to use and
you know pinpoint to use but other
people teacher student parents to use
this information to you know helping
student efficiently
any other question okay thank you so
much for your time I really appreciate
it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
