thank you can make them make the
questions easy so I can answer and don't
make me look too silly and the way this
talk will work is because I've got a
cold in the head and hardly any voice at
all if you want to interrupt please
interrupt any time I don't care and
we'll take it as we go I may cut you a
bit short if I think it's more important
that we do the whole presentation but
ask questions as we go I thought that I
was going to give a talk today that
talked about successes of the metric
system in Australia but it didn't work
out because there were so many issues
that kept coming into my mind about the
importance of metric issues and
metrication the process of metrication
which is my speciality I don't much care
about the metric system because I reckon
I could learn it again in under a week
it's a pretty simple thing but the thing
that fascinates me and has fascinated me
over the last 30 years is how people
react to the metric system with absolute
hate thread sometimes
with absolute enthusiasm at other times
and all of those issues fascinate me and
it's a the way that humans react I think
that gets me let's talk about one of the
issues that came up in a cooking book
and the purpose of telling you a story
here is twofold one is to talk about the
whole tradition of how measurement
systems work and basically this story is
about my wife and she her mother was
suffering what proved to be terminal
Alzheimer's and she was in a nursing
home and my wife decided that she would
prepare a cookbook and she'd get all the
old ladies in the nursing home to
contribute to the cookbook and she got a
great stack of papers some of them in
old school copy books some of them on
pieces of paper some of them written
around the sides of newspaper qualifying
you know the recipe in the country
magazines and one particular recipe came
and it came from a lady who was in her
late 90s and in a very shaky hand at the
top of the page were written the words
this recipe came to me from my
great-great-great grandmother and Wendy
put this in front of me and said what's
a gilt
was it I don't know I'll google it
which I did then discovered you can
pronounce that Gil or Jill and but she
said how much is it because I need to
tell the people if we're going to be
able people are going to be able to cook
this old lady's recipe how much do you
tip in when you get a Gil of stuff so
it's been a half an hour on the google
google google and soon had a little list
of 35 different definitions of what a
Gil was my favorite was a French coffee
cup politely filled but the whole heap
of others and I then realized that Wendy
had a problem not a measurement problem
with her cookbook but she had a problem
with tradition here was a recipe that
came to me from my great-great-great
grandmother and that old lady wanted to
pass it on and she had some great great
oops sorry
great-great grandchildren granddaughters
in fact so how could she pass on that
tradition because those two young girls
in a few years time if I inherited this
book had come across the word Gil maybe
that Google at the same way I did and
then get so totally confused that they
couldn't make that fruitcake for their
families so the tradition would die so I
pointed out to my wife that she had a
little problem a little problem that was
that she only had one choice and that
was to write the entire cookbook in
metric units and then she would have to
test cook everything there's proved to
be a very worthwhile experience and the
purpose of telling you that story is to
tell you about it's not always just
measurement issues there's cultural
issues there's there's tradition issues
and so on in every measurement thing
let's talk about another small issue a
big issue I was looking at this because
some people asked me to write a
submission to the Australian government
on energy and the energy requirements
that we have a Senate over there and I
was putting ass in a submission to a
Senate inquiry on how to measure energy
and I was looking at this and I looked
at it first of all in an energy context
and there there's a whole heap of old
pre metric energy units syslog Gill
those ones were all got different names
here's some of them and I soon realized
that there were I found Google Google
Google I did that a lot I found all of
these different names and things like
British thermal units because British
thermal units are so temperature
dependent the British thermal unit at
naught degrees Celsius and believe me
there is one is not the same as the
British thermal unit at 16 degrees and
it's not the same as 68 degrees
Fahrenheit and so on similarly if you
get into calories those of you who read
about calories and especially in wait
watching and wait King magazines I found
22 different kinds of calories the most
predominant differences capital C
calories versus little C calories which
were a thousand times different but all
the others are percentage points above
and below above or below what there is
no norm in in calories there is no
standard definition because people make
up their definition all the time in fact
the lady who introduced the word calorie
into human food calc health human food
discussions was a lady by the name of
dr. Lulu hunt Peters and she when she
introduced this into the United States
she defined a calorie
I suppose it still is as the amount of
heat needed to heat four pounds of water
by one degree Fahrenheit but that's just
for the physicists amongst us so when I
looked at those and I realized I was
writing this report four senators now
senators in Australia probably much the
same here they're what you call
politicians now politicians in Australia
I imagine that in the United States of
America a great place like this would be
no trouble at all for a politician to
understand exactly all of those 95
different ways of describing energy so
when when a politician here was thinking
about global warming and energy issues
in global warming and have no trouble
and that have no trouble with the
different eight thousand nine hundred
and thirty conversion factors they
needed to convert between one and the
other I suspect that the Australian
politicians aren't so smart and in fact
when they got their report and they
looked at all these things they right
away a lot of letters to our scientific
organisations saying what is an inch
pound force and stuff like that because
they didn't know and our very small
nuclear industry put in issues about
atomic energy units how very large oil
industry put in lots of words about
barrels of oil equivalents whatever that
might happen to mean because I was in
the United States two years ago I went
to Texas to the oil museum down at
Midland I think it's at the Permian
Basin oil museum and asked them what a
barrel was and I kindly told me that it
never existed and I just make it up at
random for when they so that was the way
that polished our politicians I think it
terribly confused because otherwise I'd
have to consider the metric unit of
energy which as you know is a Joule oh
by the way that's a complete list and
it's been a complete list since 1889 all
those others have been redundant
sleep since 1889 but people habitually
use them sometimes it's just out of
habit
sometimes it's to give credit to one of
the one of their friends you know that
might be named after heart free or might
be aimed after a person but the only
metric unit of energy is the Joule and
of course sometimes the tools are fairly
small and sometimes you have to use the
multiple skimmer it was it was part of
an old metric system that's why I said
old pre metric
yeah that's an inaccuracy on that slide
thank you
sorry yeah wasn't an ERG an old metric
energy unit yes it was but since 1960
when the SI the system Internationale
donut I came in it is now regarded as
redundant and no longer useful so these
days I use pace and when I did the
report to the Australian government I
used petajoules for Australian energy
requirements and I also did a comparison
with all all of the energy use in the
United States of America and I used
exajoules it was but then you can say
straight away that the energy that comes
from wind energy in proportion to size
if they're all in exajoules it's just a
matter of comparing the numbers where
some of our marine atomic energy units
and some of them in barrels of oil
equivalent is very difficult to make any
comparisons this slide is a remnant
really of my first approaches to talking
to you today and it was one of the
things we learnt early on in our pretty
successful metrication in Australia that
metrication is inevitable since it
started as you know or as most folk now
I'm sure the met
system was invented on a Monday and
since that Monday the metric process has
been unstoppable it's been unstoppable
in every country in the world it even if
there is absolutely no government
support for it at all
say for example in Burma also known as
Myanmar if there's no support for at all
their entire drug industry sells things
in kilograms mostly to the United States
market but the international trade all
goes with the metric system and there's
a number of reasons for that no I'll
explore those but metrication is
inevitable and it doesn't matter where
it starts
consider metric cars metric cars started
probably one day don't know which day
when an engineer fella by the name of
Ferdinand Porsche decided that he would
make a metric car he engineered the car
he looked at all the possibilities for
that in that particular car and he
discovered or no he deliberately made it
so that it only had three three nut
sizes on all the bolts there were 28
millimeter nuts on the four wheels and
on the steering wheel so there five
allows and you didn't need the span of
the wrench for that very often so he
could hang that on his garage wall every
other every other bolt on that first
cars a 1934 car that he made every other
what bolt on that car was either a ten
millimeter bolt or a 13 millimeter bolt
and that meant that a mechanic were the
pocket on the side of his trouser could
have the one-and-only spanner he needed
with a 10 millimeter end in a thirty
thirteen millimeter end to engineer the
entire car
the savings in cost in labor costs in
understanding costs and so on were so
great for Porsche that that car
eventually became what we fondly knew in
Australia is the pregnant pasty or the
Volkswagen Beetle and that car was so
successful and so economically sound
that now every single car in the world
copied off Ferdinand Porsche now when
you bought your all-all-all metric car
the one you now drive I don't think
anybody here drives a car pre 75 yes
yeah what is it hey you don't have it
anymore I still have my 75 Volkswagen
with a column minibus scene but it too
was an all metric car with the 2 spanha
sizes the point is that every industry
every car maker in the world in the
United States in Japan in Europe every
single car maker in the world
copied of this engineer and Porsche even
with his own cars that still sell in his
own name all have all metric parts and
so on in an average car just as a
throwaway line in an average United
States car there are 10,000 parts they
take an average of about 10 measures the
washers have outside diameter inside
diameters and thicknesses but a panel
like that front mudguard might have as
many as 30 so it's about a hundred
thousand measurements in a car and they
are all metric part the industry in the
United States is very very clever and if
you put the letters mph in front of the
driver he won't know that he's driving
an or metric car and that's common here
motorbikes were the last to change over
to metric fully the harley-davidson I
think was the last one
and it now is all metric as well metric
earth-moving equipment as what sorry
about that
Petric earth-moving equipment has been
metric for a fair long time probably
about the 70s and if you take something
like the Kennecott mine in Utah this
little truck here it's tires 4 meters
high from top to bottom and this truck
sits in the bottom of the mine and it
gets loaded by that one bucket full of
that loader there and the loader dumps a
hundred tons at a time and they're towa
yes those tons because every from the
blasting from the rock face to the
putting of the all the parts in all of
the digger and in all of the trucks are
all metric then they get carded up to
where they're chemically treated but the
minerals and ores are chemically treated
at the top of the mine and chemists have
worked in total metric all the way along
the line then they have an electrolytic
process to purify the copper all using
metric amps and metric revolts and so on
and then you bring out this lovely ingot
of pure copper and your label at 500
pounds otherwise people would know and
how shameful it is that you're working
in metric because in the United States
it is there are many many industries
that are sort of seizing up with all
this metric stuff but they don't want to
tell anyone however that doesn't stop
the fact that metrication is inevitable
it's unstoppable
it will continue doing it's something
and think about the computer you drive
there's only one here hasn't got a
pepper and to the component parts that
are designed and cut and so on and in
nanometers
and the dimensions of the of the
conductors all across the chips in
micrometers and then the little legs
hanging off the side in millimeters and
the design of the thing across here and
the case itself all done in millimeters
and then just so everybody can know what
you're doing you call a screen fifteen
point four inches or something education
is inevitable
I haven't over made this point have I
just I want to but I do believe that no
individual no group no company no nation
that's ever uses metric for any time has
ever gone permanently back to using pre
metric measures yeah
yep and what I'm hearing from some of
the engineers is they're now doing the
engineers in metric then dumbing them
down for the contractors so that the the
contractors don't know that they're
doing metric design work because the
metric design work once you get used to
doing it is quite easy the same thing
happened in the United Kingdom but let's
consider the extreme case they're they
have they do all the design and all
their construction in the United Kingdom
in metric and I was driving over there a
couple of weeks ago and every hundred
meters along the roads a little blue
post that tells you how many metres you
are from one city or another then when
you go 1609 point three four four meters
you get a sign that says one mark and
that's for the the equivalent of the mph
on cars it's just the government there
has made it legal to have mile signs on
all metric roads I don't know how much
there is in this country but I do know a
lot of the engineers that I deal with
here hanging in there for the metric
because it's so easy but they're having
to put the signs up in thing yes sir the
permanently modifier there is that think
about when Napoleon came to power in
France he said right I was stopping all
this metric nonsense and the people had
been using the metric system for about
10 or 15 years by then they kept using
it underneath the bringing back the old
measures and then about another 20 years
on the whole country went back to metric
again I don't know of any case in the
United States is still in abeyance but I
don't know of any case where anyone as
they do the digging bit you go to metric
away from it
away from it and then say oh the hell
with it and we'll get on with it
is the sort of thing we were able in
Australia a friend of mine was one of
the technical experts on the metric
conversion board and we were able to
identify four main ways that Australia
went to what metric that might be useful
to you we had four approaches one of
them was what we call direct metrication
the direct approach where you took
metric as an opportunity to reengineer
your whole your whole job for instance
in the building construction industry
our stud spacings in walls used to be 18
inches apart
and when the metric conversion
possibility came along the industry the
construction industry said oh right we
can get rid of all those old for be twos
or I think you call them to be force
here this is a technical difference and
we made them exactly 35 millimeters by
90 millimeters gave them a little bit
more structural strength by specifying
better product before it went into the
wall and shifted them from 18 inches out
to 600 millimeters so effectively from
450 millimeters out to 600 millimeters
which meant that in every wall you are
saving one quarter as a quarter of all
the studs in every wall in every house
in every building in every flap in every
apartment in every high-rise
construction and the industry saved a
lot of money by doing that I'll mention
that here they estimated that they saved
10% on turnover in industries where
they're able to do this direct
metrication I reckon they saved about
10% on turnover and about they increase
their net profits by about 15% I don't
know if that's interesting to Google but
they're interesting things we also had
this hidden metrication where people
went metric but didn't tell their
customers or
tell their partners and this is the one
I described to you before that the
English are doing with their roads a
they do em all in metric but then they
don't tell the public about it it's also
what the United States motor industry
does with their cars as well metric
conversion is a very interesting issue
metric conversion is where you sort of
say okay let's go metric but we'll have
double-sided rulers okay let's go metric
for clothing sizes for instance and
we'll have cloak women's clothing for
instance for a 24 inch waist and we'll
make the skirt length 37 centimeters and
a lot of that went on as it happened
Paul mentioned that I farmer by
background which is not a good trade or
a practice in Australia because we have
the biggest and the best trout's
that you have ever seen and in between a
good quality drought you get bush fires
anyway I'm no longer in the farming
business but I went into building
construction so I know a little bit
about that and then later I went into
the textile trade and worked in in
particular in wool production and in
wool testing and measurement so I saw a
number of trades who went use direct
metrication I saw not many using hidden
metrication I saw a lot using metric
conversion and I saw a few but not many
in Australia who used the philosophy if
you ignore it it'll go away and there's
still a few around like that let's talk
first of all about direct metrication it
what you need to do is you've got to
really be clear on what goals you've got
and how you're going to achieve them
they've got to be written if they're not
written and you have a general policy we
are going to go metric then people will
make individual decisions and some will
decide on direct metric
and Hummel desired on metric conversions
some will decide on ignore it it'll go
away and others do other things one of
the successes we had was with things
like M days and other time markers road
signs were an example our road signs
people keep in mind that the continent
of United States the continental United
States is about the same size as
Australia so we've got a lot of roads we
don't have as many population as you but
we've got roads going all around the
country especially on the east and south
coast so we had a lot of road signs to
fix so what they did was they created
their budget this way I let the old
signs get run down basically over about
18 months to two years they then picked
an M day a road signs day and that was a
Sunday and it was the first Sunday in
July in 1974 and they chose a Sunday
because the traffic was light of that
day and they didn't have you know going
to work traffic and such and for the 18
months before that I spent their budget
on new signs put them in position and
then covered them over with Hessian
sacking and stuff then on the Sunday and
I talked about they went and I cut them
all off from the public's point of view
it looked like the whole nation had
changed over the metric signs in the day
there were letters to newspapers that
it'll be chaos on the roads
I'll be murder they'll be mayhem didn't
happen in fact the two weeks after the
signs were put up there were less deaths
on the road there were less injuries on
the road I suspect because people were
more more cautious for those two weeks
but that Australian plan is subsequently
used in India it was used a year and a
half ago Paul wasn't in Ireland and I
just changed the whole lot over home in
a day in Canada
I used a slightly different technique
instead of using the sacking technique
over the new sign
they let the signs run down and then
made themselves decals I think they're
called stick horn signs and they went
around on their Sunday and just stack
amount worked for them again it looked
like it was done in a day with direct
metrication there's no conversions
you're not converting from one thing to
another because you change over to the
new thing and you just do it in need
strong leadership because and strong
strong implementation from all of the
industry that you're doing it in some
industries changed over did that day
plan and had a metric day or an EM day
plan but you needed pretty good
leadership from the top to do those sort
of changes you also had to have clear
policy statements and most of them use
the opportunity of metrication to
resolve other issues for instance in one
chemistry laboratory I was associated
with they decided that they would have a
tea day for all this among all their
temperatures so they changed all the
temperatures over to Celsius in one day
and to do that I also took the
opportunity to get rid of all their old
mercury based thermometers that they had
in their laboratories because I always
were dangerous whenever you broke them
there you got mercury fumes through the
place so they decided that I'd get rid
of all of those and as a health and
safety issue at the same time and so
there's always opportunities once you
start on the process for instance this
is an example Australian building
construction policy simply stated that
the metric units for linear measurement
will be the millimeter the meter and the
kilometer but they knew that they'd get
into issues with people who reckon
Darbar this gives us two bigger numbers
and these centimetres
bitter will be better so they specified
that the centimeter couldn't shall not
be used and the centimeter shall not be
used in any calculation and that should
never be written down the net result of
that was the metrication of the building
construction industry in Australia was
smooth rapid and effectively completed
within one year
I now have only two subcontractors who
maybe went for two years and one of
those at least I know the managing
director was going home at night time
with those metric drawings crossing out
all the metric numbers on putting in
fruit and inches so you know there were
people who fought hard to keep the old
things for everybody else changed over
within a year and keep in mind when I
was working in the building industry of
this I surveyed them fairly closely and
we came up with figures that it was
saving in turnover a rat at least 10%
but we figured about 10% and increasing
net profits by about 15% not only for
the building contractor themselves but
also for all their subcontractors the
plumbers the bricklayers the carpenters
and so on they were all getting the
benefit as well on one occasion the
company I worked for Avery Jennings and
company they were the biggest makers
home builders in all of Australia I
can't remember how many we were doing a
year but we're working we only have six
states and we were working in four of
them and we were the biggest in those
four and we were building a lot of homes
and so the boss
Albert Jennings taught us to build two
houses side-by-side one was built in
imperial measures elfine inches and the
other one was built in metric measures
and we kept all the wastes on the site
so that we could see how how the the
comparison at the end of the job when we
looked at the wastes from the imperial
feet and inches house there were two
five ton trucks of waste was taken away
from that job
and the waste from the metric house
wouldn't fit in a wheelbarrow so we had
a dramatic evidence that we were saving
a lot of money and we reckoned those
figures I told you 10% and 15% some
people decided to issue instructions to
their organization to go metric without
having a policy and without having a
written documentation and suchlike and I
remember when that happened you have to
ask your question who is going to
actually set the policy because it would
do that generic sort of thing
you can't know I remember in a school
that I saw I decided that I would have
dual scale thermometers or if people
looking at that school you would say
they decided in fact it was the
receptionist who decided because part of
her job was doing some purchasing work
in another construction and there was
the construction company they were
furniture read company they decided on
dual sided types and rulers because the
Stormin decided and so without a policy
you can get some funny things happening
and they did happen to us you know
laboratory that I was associated with
they all finished up with dual scale
weighing machines because one of the
laboratory technicians got the job of
doing the the research and she thought
that jewel would be better because then
they could do old and new on the thing
what we came to realize was that it was
an important principle and I think a
principle that we learned from England
that you don't duel with jewel if you're
going to do a sorry about that if you're
going to do a metrication programme you
do it get into it get it done get it out
of the road and always a quicker way
that cheaper if it cost you anything at
all so don't Jill with Jill one of the
issues that's pretty moist in all of
this and this is something I had a lot
of
a extreme trouble with this is an
intellectual problem for me I noticed
the difference between direct
metrication programs and these
conversion programs and these ignorant
little go away programs and all the
others but what I didn't realize the
difference in time between them and it
was the timing difference that becomes
crucially important with a direct
metrication programme well-planned you
can do it in a year part with a metric
conversion program like all of these are
part of really it can take a hundred
years now that is a hard thing for this
poor little brain to get around how
something is silly or as simple as using
Joule scales can take so much longer but
I had to accept it because I saw it
again and again and again and again in
various places in Australian education
programs but then when I began to
research there's over the whole period
from when the metric first harder to
remember on that Monday I told you about
when the metric for every single time
people decided on this conversion thing
then or it was decided for them perhaps
by their receptionist or their Stallman
the the difference between one year and
a hundred years was too great I had to
accept it eventually that you don't deal
with you another thing that I had a lot
of trouble with was whether mandatory
conversion programs versus voluntary
ones I was told that mandatory programs
work quickly and I was told that
voluntary programs worked eventually and
I found that didn't matter the truth is
that both work and it doesn't really
matter as to their timing whether it's
mandatory or voluntary as long as it's a
direct metrication rather than a metric
conversion is the important thing if
you've got this the speed depends on the
method you use not on whether you
somebody's made it mandatory or so on
just on the mandatory thing I mentioned
earlier that in Australia we have a lot
of bushfires and one of the early things
with our voluntary Bush virus I push
firefighting associations was they made
metric measures mandatory so that if say
these three guys in the front here were
on a truck and one of them says are we'd
better go over there 15 yards and put
that out his truck leader would have to
report him for using yards because is
just endanger the life of everybody
there potentially because we don't know
whether a charge or food or once we get
into that thing and so we did have some
mandatory things like firefighters
firefighters in Australia do not use any
of the old measures and they're trained
in how to estimate how many metres a
thing is away how to look across a
valley and see whether something's five
kilometres from here and all of the
other things and if they try to use old
measures that is mandatory okay the
other thing we learned about early on
was this whole business of whether we
should use vulgar I think they call
common fractions here is that the right
term yeah same thing common fractions
and decimals and engineers and generally
numeral like mathematicians scientists
and other people who have strong
numeracy skills they'll almost bleed at
meat and say but but but all you have to
do is move the decimal point and I
remember being at a session with a group
of plumbers and the plumbers came out
for their morning tea and I remember one
plumber signed to the other one
what's a decimal and his friend said
here and what's the point because I
didn't understand this move and there's
more points things around
they did things differently and they had
a better mindset so in the building
trade we came we had a better thought
that no fractions are necessary at all
ever and we took a number of decisions
that would go down that path and that
has proved to be enormous ly successful
and I've used that in a number of trades
and it mostly comes around because of
big numbers versus small numbers if you
get a number like this 23456 millimeters
a lot of people's first reaction is are
that's too big a number people can't
understand that that's by the way about
the length of my house I got a
four-bedroom house and that's the length
of the one side wall just to give you a
size of scale and a lot of people would
like that to be written in centimeters
and you just move the decimal point same
length whatever as soon as you do that
though others will use this technique of
taking it back to the old mixed number
the thing where you do it in meters and
centimeters and millimeters the Italian
I have seen in Italy on working drawings
on a jobsite there this this number with
two days more points I know I was in
Paris about four weeks ago and they on
one buildings hot I was looking at they
were using this technique as well with
two decimal points inside that's a big
issue in on an Australian building site
if there's a line to show the back wall
of my house it will have this number
there it's written like that and
somewhere on the drawing it'll have all
dimensions in millimeters and it won't
have any units at all next 20 number and
just have numbers all over the place and
they're all in millimeters now the big
advantage we had with that sorry I'm out
of order here I'll go with this order
what we realized was that why direct
metrication works so well is that all
your numbers are alternately simple but
even though 23456 is a big number
it is a simple number it is a number
that you can put into a calculator it's
a number that a bricklayers labourer can
put into a calculator and he doesn't
have to have an engineer camera and
tomorrow to show him how to do it to add
up some lengths and so on the all the
numbers that you use on a building job
are honest you know they're honest you
know that they're the same kind of
number the and they're specified in
overall things I remember back in 1958 I
was looking up why the International
measuring community were trying to
redefine the inch and then I realized
that the United States had two different
inches and one of them was a statute
inch and one of them was a legal injury
or something I can't remember what I
didn't know then but I know now that in
1958 the British government had two
different inches one of them was for
armaments who comes and such and one of
them was for the on streets and houses
so they had two different ones and so
every time you use the word inch it
didn't know whether which inch they were
dealing with but you always knew which
meter in which millimeter you're dealing
with the you can always check up is open
that you can always check up how a unit
is structured and so on and they're
world wide you can compare them if I if
I tell you my yeah my house is twenty
three thousand four hundred fifty six
millimeters long you can all find out
how long that is this is opposed to the
old older units all of them are more
complicated
think about
energy units if you're considering
global warming the units for measuring
in metric are simple the units for
measuring in all of the old measures are
complicated
they usually obscure you usually have to
have a long discussion as to what the
meaning of any of those words mean if I
say to you the word calorie then you
need to consider what its definitions
and what its meanings are often they're
secret the the unit for measuring oil
which you see the price of in the paper
every morning is a barrel but that
barrel never actually existed it was a
secret of collusion really between the
oil companies actually I withdraw the
word collusion because I did it
independently and they made a number
around about 42 gallons or 159 liters or
something like that but it wasn't open
to the public and it still isn't let me
give you an example this morning say the
price of a barrel of oil quoted in the
New York Times let's say it was about
sixty four dollars at 159 liters that
makes it about 40 cents a liter or in
u.s. gallons say where am i up to here
about fifteen dollars or something sorry
dollar fifty how much you paying for
your gasoline at the moment three
dollars so it's costing the company a
dollar 50 and it's you're paying three
dollars that's fair and reasonable isn't
it okay now in all of your minds
there are fair and reasonable arguments
happening that are but I've got to
distill it I've got to market I've got
to who transport it etcetera etcetera is
that fair
20 seconds ago you couldn't have done
that calculation because you didn't know
what a barrel was because of a secret so
these are the sorts of issues that
happen and most of them at Eric
Oriol that they belong to one particular
group of people and often this will be
some sort of jargon and people will hang
on to jargon units they've named it for
some famous fellow in their in their
business or something okay back to
millimeters or centimeters I did a
comparative study between the building
industries in Australia and Canada we
did our entire metrication programme in
a year
I was in Canada only a week or two ago
and they in Canada it's taken them 37
years to try and do the changeover so
far and it'll take him a fairly long
time I had high hopes for them and I
still do because they're starting to
look at the Australian experience and
they're saying 37 years is too long why
don't we go back to the Australian Way
and do it in a in a year so maybe
that'll do that Kodak is more or less a
controlled experiment in many ways Kodak
in 1910 decided George Eastman was their
managing director and a very vivacious
sort of a man and a decision maker of
some note and he came into the business
and 1910 said right we're gone metric
and different people made different
decisions as to how that might work in
the film division they decided to use
millimeters in the paper division they
decided to use centimeters the film
division was was all over by the shout
by the shouting by the end of 1911 now
these weren't just the little film sizes
are also the big films for chest x-rays
and all that stuff so there are various
sizes was all over by 1911 if you go
into a store anywhere in the San
Francisco area all London hauled your
long where I come from and go to into a
ask for a Kodak thing they will
we've got these lovely four four by
sixes or six by fours which because
their paper division decided to work in
centimeters centimeters almost always
take with them conversion factors on how
to get back to inches and so where are
we nineteen hundred and ten until two
thousand and seven ninety seven years
later they're still struggling I also
saw the same thing happened with
builders and textile workers builders
were all over finished in a year using
millimeters textile workers are still
struggling 37 years later using
centimeters one of the reasons for this
is that millimeters come as whole
numbers the precision on a building site
if it's to one millimeter will be in
whole numbers and you'll get the people
will work and try to cut something to a
millimeter
if a textile worker is say making a
tailored vest she the tailor might want
to work better than the centimeter
accuracy so when they get past
centimeters they usually then go into
halves or quarters and there's one
notable person in your trade fellow by
the name of Bill Gates I think his name
is and if you you look in Microsoft Word
converted into metric units and we'll go
into centimeters and the centimeters
will be divided into halves and quarters
it's no longer a decimal system the way
it's applied they're also millimeters
gave all whole numbers where centimeters
gave mixed numbers like how many meters
of cloth might be three meters plus 23
centimeters plus some millimeters or a
half or something and these proved to be
difficult for the workers in the
factories to deal with so let's look at
the approaches to the metric system and
summarize a bit that if you try the
ignorin will go away and procedure
one organization that have done this
pretty consistently are the theologians
and Bible scholars when they translate
from old texts in Aramaic or Hebrew
Hebrew or whatever when they come to a
measuring word like Hin or bath or cubit
they don't touch it they leave it there
and there's a reason for that over the
various books they change in length and
size according to the context but so
they just ignore it and hope this all
this metric measurement thing will go
away and basically they're working on a
probably about a 10,000 year time scale
the hidden metrication thing one of the
measures that you're all experiencing
right now is a thing called shoe size
when you go to buy some shoes and you
say I'll have a pair of shoes of the
size seven or eight or whatever do you
always get shoes that fit perfectly and
wonderfully and and so on I don't how
bad is that in my case I'm a very bad
shoe buyer and to me maybe one in four
will not do what it needs to do and I
say things like our perhaps they'll
stretch or you know are where I mean but
generally it doesn't so shoe sizes were
set at that length of a Barleycorn
fooling around a chosen from the middle
of the year in 1215 when Magna Carta was
signed so I think in terms of hidden
metrication perhaps taking a thousand
years metric conversion the experience
seems to be that that takes about a
hundred years minimum ish and direct
metrication 85% of industries in
Australia about a year and that's just
the way it worked out for us
we were lucky that a lot of our
industries did that and that direct
metrication was successful for us for a
social reason which I'll now look at and
that is the idea of social proof think
about this you're in Singapore and
you're standing on the side of the
street and there's a red light
pedestrian light a red character
standing with his light there three
people come to stand next to you three
people come to stand opposite the road a
man still sitting there with a red light
two of these people start to walk across
the road and all three of those start to
walk across the road how do you feel the
red lights are still there do wait for
the red light or do you look at what's
happening to the local people
you think the local people and you go
with them I don't know mostly I go with
them especially in Singapore and in
London you do that in their night United
States I don't I have no courage at all
in the United States because most of the
drivers are driving on the wrong sides
are right pedestrian lights give you a
feeling for this social proof idea and I
think this is absolutely crucial to most
metrication programs all fashion is
about social proof you wear this color
garment this season or this shape of
garment this season because others are
doing it or because you are a leader in
a particular fashion area and this is
you are providing the leadership and the
social proof and others will follow you
you see this with pop groups how people
simply go along the way I saw it this
year in a group of the Royal Society no
the Royal Society seems seem to me all
through my life to be a pretty
worthwhile organization for leadership
so I went to their summer science school
that display this year was
at the Royal Society building in London
I had 23 poster displays all around the
place and seven of those poster displays
as soon as I stood there and looked like
a farmer from Australia they dumbed
everything down off the board in two
pounds ounces feet and miles and these
are people who are being funded for
their PhD programs and their postdoc
programs by the Royal Society to
progress science as we know it I was
reasonably flattened by that until I
realized that they were reacting to what
the others were doing around them in
dumbing it down because that's what you
do when you're dealing with the public
and it's a the others are doing that
therefore it's right for me to do if
those people walk across the road and
I'll go - that's what it's tough I then
came here to the United States and I was
invited to speak to a group at the
National Institute of Standards and
Technology and I talked to the people
there and they kindly then showed me
around various sections of NIST as it
happens I have been a science reporter
for the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation in
Australia and they showed me how to do
some installation now I worked with an
installation group for about five years
so I know little bit about that's just a
little bit so I went into the NIST
program and this guy tried to tell who
did tell me about how many British
thermal units there were produced
thermal units per barrel of oil
equivalent and that was 2007 about a
week ago if you look at the the history
and so on of social proofs one of the
dramatic things as in suicides that if
media organisations television radio and
me papers newspapers will not give you
all the gory details of a suicide
because they know full well if
I do within the next couple of weeks
they'll be copycat suicides social proof
takes all sorts of things I was reading
in the washington post an article again
about two weeks ago and the washington
post was giving an an i eyeball
description if you like of the 911
people who are jumping out of the
buildings in new york and one of his
remark struck me as a very respondent
about the article anyway but i this
struck me he said i didn't all jump at
random he said it was almost as if
they're waiting until somebody jumped
and then that all jumped together
because i'd seen somebody else do it and
then the mayor up and read the
washington post anymore it makes me
upset so while i was mucking around
doing all of this i happen to have the
chance to go to oxford university and
investigate the question of who actually
invented the international system of
units or if you like to call it the
modern metric system and i needed to
know what it was why when where and who
did it and what was invented was a
decimal system including decimal money
an international system as standard
length of as it turned out in when i
translated in in the modern unit was 997
millimeter so I was bit shorter than our
present meter it was based on an idea of
a universal measure that you could get
anywhere in the world
it was Universal also in the sense that
it was you could use it for all human
activities and it also combined all the
units so that there were time based and
time and length and area and volume and
mass which they called weight at that
time using distilled rainwater were all
coupled together which we now know to be
the case in the modern metric system
and I then looked at why it was done and
why it was done was because the sky was
writing an essay towards a real
character and by that he meant a set of
would call them letters in our alphabet
but he wanted real characters that would
apply to all languages so that he could
use a set of characters and write out
Hebrew if he wanted or Aramaic or
whatever and he wanted to find the
philosophical language and this was his
goal he wasn't writing about
measurements he was writing about a
philosophical language because he
believed that Adam and Eve in the Garden
of Eden spoke in a language that was
perfect and pure and he was seeking what
that language was and what sort of
characters that had and how he might
look at it when did he do it in 1668
when did he do it on a Monday I told you
that and it was April the 13th we know
this because he did this in Oxford
Cambridge in London and we now know that
the metric system was invented in
England this has some interesting
repercussions for the English people who
have decried the metric system because
it's foreign so and since this is going
to be an interesting piece of research
who did it fella by the name of John
Wilkins and why was he so religious he
was a fellow of the Royal Society but he
was also Dean of Ripon which was a
church in I think near London and later
on he was a he was promoted to bishop
but he wrote this book and this is the
back of a title page showing when it was
sent off to the printer on that Monday I
talked to you about and he was I think
the third or fourth book that was
approved for publication by the Royal
Society and it was a little thin number
six hundred pages long it included all
of the
the basis of Pitman shorthand it
included all of the basis of Roget's
thesaurus it included a hundred and
fifty page Dictionary of the English
language which was I think the second
Dictionary of the English language this
is about a hundred years before dr.
Johnson did his Dictionary of the
English language and about 200 years
before Noah Webster did his so this guy
was very early in all of those things
you'll met remember I said that he was
at Oxford and at Cambridge is the only
man ever who was a leader of a college
in both Oxford and Cambridge nobody else
has ever done that
he also was the really was the creator
of the Royal Society he had to use
people like Branca as his money men and
he got to be President
where Wilkins was the secretary of that
society this is what his work looked
like when he wrote about measure and he
described the whole of the modern system
International System of Units in four
and a half pages and a lot of it was
spent like here this bit here where
really he's always showing us there is a
thesaurus sort of thing what one means
it means and a some instrument stuff
like that and this is the rest of it and
some more and more in the last page
there are fire down the page and that
described the title modern metric system
it's interesting I wonder then how it
got from John Wilkins work in 1668 how
it then got to France in the 1790s and
one of the things I realized was that I
had previously read Thomas Jefferson's
report to the Congress
saying what he was recommending a
decimal measuring system for the United
States of America in 1790 John Wilkins
had done his in 1668 and I don't know
and I'm still searching for how this
intriguing parallels came about both
Wilkins and Jefferson were decimal men
they believed in decimals both Wilkins
and Jefferson believed in basing the
length of the standard the universal
measure the universal measure by the way
is where we got the name meter from when
when universal measure was translated
into Italian by burro teeny it was
translated as metro catÃ³lica so the
metro was where we got the meter from
but both of them had the idea of using a
pendulum deburr standard length of a
meter they also both had extremely
interesting parallels about what you
should call the various parts
neither of them used the word meter and
what they did do was said that a foot
should be 10 inches at an inch an inch
would be 10 lines one of them said the
lines would be 10 points etc and so on
and the parallels are so great that I
need to investigate this further and
find out the part that Thomas Jefferson
played in this Thomas Jefferson you will
recall before he was president the
United States of America prior to that
he was vice president and prior to that
he was Secretary of State and prior to
that he was ambassador to France and he
was trained almost like an apprentice as
ambassador to France by another
character pala name of Benjamin Franklin
and Benjamin Franklin was the man who
pushed through the idea of decimal money
in the United States Thomas Jefferson
and his friend George Washington were
there people who pushed
through as law in 1790 and that's why
the United States caught the ferry first
decimal currency in the world that every
other nation is now followed it took us
until 1966 or a bit slow waves on our
side of the pond but that's so that when
the metrication process started way back
with Fibonacci giving us decimal numbers
Simon Stevin with decimal arithmetic
edmund gunter you can look at him and
ganas work anytime you like if you're
flying in a plane over the United States
of America because was all surveyed
using Edmund gorgeous chain that's why
all those squares are there was mr.
Gunter John Wilkins of course I've
mentioned Blaise Pascal if you've got a
minute afterwards I'll show you the
first what I think was the first
calculator in the world probably the
first calculator and Blaise Pascal made
a decimal calculator in 1640 thought he
was kind of make his fortune there he's
adding up machines and if one of those
who made a fortune was Simon Stevin who
came up with a set of tables for working
out compound interests on money loans
and it was in print probably till twenty
or thirty years ago from 1595 you know
Benjamin Franklin was involved in the
process I don't know how but he was very
much a decimal promoter and decimal
currency promoter and Thomas Jefferson I
think was a really really important
character in taking the whole of the
decimal system and the metric system
back to the French in the 1790s in
Thomas Jefferson's collection I was in
the Library of Congress the other day
and they were kind enough to let me have
access to Thomas Jefferson's books the
ones that he left from when library
Congress burned down a night in 1812
when the British Army burnt down the
Library of Congress so in about 1814
Thomas Jefferson sold a more or less at
cost he
personal library and what you now see as
the Library of Congress is actually
Thomas Jefferson's library with a few
add-ons quite a lot of that often safely
but Thomas Jefferson's library is still
there and I was intrigued to see there's
a book he had I think thirty seven books
on arithmetic and there was one book and
had notated what a journey is wrote this
what a great book this is the way to go
and it had laid out very very carefully
all of the how to add up decimal numbers
and it had numbers like 399 test more
marker oh one two and he had a three to
three decimal places and so on as
written by a gentleman by the name of
this is arithmetic book my Georgian know
this existed a gentleman by the name of
Isaac Newton and as a matter of interest
Isaac Newton when he was writing his
arithmetic book used a comma as a
decimal marker didn't know that Newton
went in for that high Isaac Newton by
the way was a student of John Wilkins
John Wilkins was one of his masters so
back to my earlier point and then I'll
finish up I've gone far too long
your metrication is in inevitable the
metrication of google is inevitable you
can't stop it you you can choose slow
going ways of doing it I wouldn't
recommend it or you can choose fast
going ways of doing it which I would
recommend there's no doubt that you and
your children's future will be metric
the whole of the United States as I say
it now it's more or less I say company
after company after company seizing a
way to get the advantages the cost
advantages and the lack of error
advantages and so on within their within
their company structure and in their
purchasing and where they can in even in
their sales but none of them want to
tell the public about for their
politicians probably
but you I think just cause you're here
today you are metrication leaders and
you will have a part to play in this you
will make the sort of decisions that
will play out within Google and you'll
decide what you're going to do and you
will be the people who do that so take
care
choose the quick ways thank you the slow
ways and have a good look at the sorts
of things I've been saying today and how
they apply to these wonderful principles
that you already have here the some of
them will be in conflict I think point
three has a democracy and measuring
system since you have to agree on
standards and ways of doing things there
may be some conflicts I'm not much
interested in how you resolve those but
those are the sorts of issues that you
want to do if you need any more support
from me I'm happy to give it and you can
find me at these addresses and if you
want to go Google Google Google just get
the spelling of Lawton right it's got a
TI in at the end of it and thank you
very much for your time and your
patience
so you talked a bit about in going
metrics some of the some standards is
like building construction standards
would change along the way I guess so
two questions one is how important is
that had to be obviously different as
you go completely metric and then two
how do you deal with the things that
aren't there yet let me describe the
Australian experience first what
happened was the metric conversion board
that we had was that was our political
support our government support just that
it was there it
it provided a cocoon in which the
industry could work the industry then
put their heads together they made a
committee was extremely broadly based
they had carpenter a carpenter there who
owned his own firm and was gonna
actually do it they avoided having
somebody like who the Secretary of the
the Master Builders Association because
although he nominally had some authority
he didn't have the actual heaven hands
on to do it they were bricklayers there
there are painters there there were
plumbers they were various other people
but the Chairman was also a member he
was a real estate agent so they were all
looking at cost edges and things that
they could get they also had a technical
expertise that they could call on of
building they had their own building
research scientist in their group but he
had access to an entire division of
about probably 150 research scientists
and so they sat down and they rewrote
all the building regulations and the
that was went through the legislative
processes more or less as regulations
rather than as blue leather law you know
the difference between the two
that legislation through the houses of
parliament wasn't required they did it
all as regulation and the Uniform
Building Regulations they're called and
they'll signed off nationally and by
each state so we all use the same ones
prior to that each state had their own
so we use that as an opportunity to make
national laws as well yeah there was a
cost to it
so one place where everybody still has
vocal fractions is in in time 24 hours a
day six minutes an hour
is there any initiative towards metric
time what is your opinion on it to the
best of my knowledge there is no
feasible I've seen some I've seen some
good attempts of that but the social
issues are going to be far greater than
the technical issues personally I think
as a step in that direction this is a
pure personal view from Pat Norton I
have a problem as a practical builder
that the metric system the international
system of units the SI none of those
gives me something that I use as a
builder every day and that's a right
angle that's a right angle that's a
wrong angle and I like right angles and
right angles there isn't one in in the
metric system I have a Radian which is a
ratio thing but curiously when the
French realized the problem with the
pendulum method of getting a universal
measure they decided to do a measure of
the line of longitude as long as they
could so they started theoretically in
Barcelona in Spain and went right
through up to Dunkirk I think it was at
the north end of France as far as I
could go but they were really dealing
with the quadrant of the earth a right
angle and one of the reasons I think
they chose that was that in 1790 all the
rage around the world I mean computers
and Google technology and these are buzz
and technologies of the now right now
today but in 1790 go back 20 years they
had only just discovered that measuring
time around the world
would give them latitude and things the
watch that Harrison made had only just
been done 30 or 40 years beforehand
James Cook had only just started to map
the hull of the Pacific and the northern
Atlantic Ocean and so on so all of those
issues were happening then but I never
took to that quadrant think of a
quadrant divided into a thousand parts
let's call the unit of one quadrant
let's call it a quad and then divided
into milli quads then a hull time issue
becomes a separate one angles is
probably more important in buildings and
so on as far as I'm concerned I don't
think I answered your question I don't
think I can anybody else so one of the
things that we're seeing as computers
become popular is the the binary system
and since that's based on a power of 2
you get 2 to the 10th as 1024 it's
almost a thousand so we say a thousand
bytes or a kilobyte even though it's a
little bit more and as these numbers get
larger you know you get up to a gigabyte
these fractions are actually adding up
and it's creating some discrepancies for
example if you buy a gigabyte hard drive
that's actually you know a billion bytes
on the drive whereas your operating
system is going to expect the extra
fraction there so we're seeing
occasional discrepancies here do you
have any advice for how to deal with
that or maybe our Triple A has already
addressed that issue and they came up
with a new set of prefixes that instead
of being say kilo as a thousand so a
kilometres a thousand meters I came up
with something called a kibbeh I think
it is somebody else will know about it
and it's a thousand twenty-four and
Gibby's maybe and suchlike look for
those
and I think it was on trevally that did
it but not my area over here I think can
please Paul hey thanks you mentioned
some time ago that metric UNIX resulted
in vastly less waste in that
construction industry could you give
some examples of how that savings comes
about a number of ways
first of all simply errors in
measurement to measure in feet and
inches in fractions of inches inherently
difficult and you make cuts that aren't
necessary they're too short or something
in the waste a whole piece and so on
I've done that done that a lot the other
thing they did was to get say a priests
to before was always nominal and so the
actual to before might start at three
and five-eighths or something and then
the next priests you pick up might be
three and seven eighths so to get a
smooth wall you have to pad some of them
with some sort of like plywood or
something and other times you'd have a
bow in it or you'd have ahi and then
you'd have to plane it all off so that
you had flat surfaces and when you put
the platter platinum talking the
Australian air plaster sheet I think
you'd call a dry wall when you put that
on you're going to have flat surfaces so
you had to pad or a plane or whatever
there's a lot of time spent and I think
most of the savings were in better
quality of materials because they are
built to tighter specifications so when
you buy a piece of 90 millimeter
scantling in Australia it's 90
millimeters it's it that's why they
ain't well that's what you get Thanks
