life team and we are happy to present
the sleep ozium today um I want to
introduce you to Cena from Swan medical
and he is going to take it from here
introduce our physicians and get us
going Thank You Lindsay thank you to the
entire wellness team here at Google I
want to say welcome also to Googlers
joining us yeah GV see we've got people
from Ann Arbor Cambridge Chicago
Kirkland la New York San Francisco so
welcome to you all pocket closer okay so
I just wanted to say again that I think
it's wonderful that we're doing this
event in 1999 google was an eight-person
company and today obviously it's one of
the largest and most well-known
companies in the world and I think
actually you know we're seeing a similar
thing going on with sleep I didn't
really used to be part of the
conversation in a corporate context but
really now it's starting to you know get
a little bit more attention and you know
it's it's a wonderful thing to see
Google in particular making sleep a
priority and I think really it's a
testament to the leadership in Google's
wellness team that being said let's go
ahead and meet our guests immediately
next to me here is dr. manoj y car he is
a board-certified psychiatrist with
private practice here in Silicon Valley
next to him is dr. sue Kim Google's very
own dr. Kim he was double boarded in
internal medicine and integrative
medicine she also completed her
fellowship at Andrew Wiles program at
university of arizona next to heard dr.
jerry Hester he is an otolaryngologist
who is focused on the diagnosis and
treatment of snoring and sleep apnea and
next to him on the end there we've got
dr. Steve Brooks sport certified sleep
specialist and also former attending
physician and clinical associate
professor at the Stanford sleep Stanford
sleep clinic we're also fortunate to
have congressman Michael honda
with us today and he's actually going to
give the closing remarks so welcome to
you and before we get started I thought
it'd be nice to have each of the doctors
actually go through and give sort of a
quick personal introduction just kind of
background and your interests and sleep
and that sort of thing so after white
car we want to start us off right here
me yes okay it's a pleasure to be here
I'm a psychiatrist which normally is
like saying I'm the boogeyman but um
there is a tremendous overlap between
issues related to emotional and
behavioral health and sleep i would say
virtually a hundred percent of my
patients have sleep disturbance of some
kind or another and the converse is
actually even more interesting which is
a majority of people who think that they
only have a sleep problem end up having
some emotional or behavioral connection
to that and so a lot of my practice has
ended up moving in this direction of
helping people optimize sleep and
everything else follows hello okay um so
I have a specialty in integrative
medicine I also practice internal
medicine i'm also a medical
acupuncturist and i definitely have an
interest in sleep i think it's pervasive
and it really affects quality of life
and i'm really interested in lifestyle
and nutrition and how that affects sleep
as well as many other issues
otolaryngologists which is your nose and
throat doc the overlap here is that once
disorder sleep apnea which can occur in
pediatric and adult age groups is
commonly not diagnosed not only can it
lead the problems with functioning and
maximising how we all complete our day
but actually has pretty significant
health concerns associated with it such
as heart disease and stroke and so been
working the field for about 20 years in
the diagnosis and treatment of that area
in here I'm delighted to be here today I
think this is going to be fun and
hopefully we'll be able to tell you
something you don't already know I'm a
neurologist by background came to the
sleep feel relatively late in my career
but it was attractive aside from the
fact that I think it's just very
inherently interesting most sleep
disorders are treatable maybe not
curable but treatable so we can help
pretty much everybody that comes into
the clinic so it's been been very
gratifying that way thank you all and I
think we have such a wonderful panel of
doctors here I think we're going to
really get we're going to be in for a
treat here with such a great kind of
cross section of disciplines Before we
jump right in to the questions I thought
it might be nice to sort of set the
stage and look at what they call sleep
architecture and dr. Brooks I thought
maybe you could help us kind of tell us
what we're looking at on the screen here
sure um this is a graphical depiction of
what's going on with sleep across the
time line of the night you keep in mind
that sleep is a very active process it's
not just a downstate a lot of things are
going on in the brain in the body
neurotransmitter systems or coming
online going offline interacting with
each other so stuff is happening across
the night and by convention we have
broken sleep down and what we call
stages which are periods of sleep
distinguishable by form and also
probably by function we tend to go in
and out of these stages in cycles
through the night which roughly lasts
about 90 minutes at a time just very
briefly what we do when we look at an
overnight sleep study is that we examine
every 30 second period of time and based
on the brainwave pattern we assign it to
one of these categories either
wakefulness stage 1 2 or 3 of non-rapid
eye movement sleep or rapid eye movement
sleep which we call rim
it's a different animal than in the rest
of sleep we start out awake and then
hopefully go into stage one after a few
minutes this is the ideal situation of
course things never look quite this
orderly in the real world we enter stage
one which is really just a transitional
state you might call it light sleep
there may be some imagery you may be
able to remember that if somebody wakes
you up it's usually easy to to awaken
the sleeper from stage one and then we
go into stage two which looks a little
bit different in terms of the brainwave
pattern it's sort of the plain vanilla
sleep that's where most of us spend most
of the night then shortly after that we
enter what's called slow-wave sleep or
deep sleep stages three well we call it
stage three now it used to be three and
four and again this is based on the
amount of slow wave activity that we see
on the brainwave pattern what we see on
the EEG is just a bunch of wavy lines
and we look at the predominant waveforms
in terms of frequency in amplitude stage
three is interesting it's hard to waken
somebody from stage three if you do
they're going to be very very groggy
this is where a lot of weird stuff
happens like sleepwalking and the
various iterations of that it's also
probably the most restorative phase of
sleep a lot of hormonal activity is
going on including growth hormone which
makes this particularly important for
young children who are still growing we
tend to lose the amount of this as we
get older we probably spend maybe five
percent in stage one in adulthood fifty
percent in stage two in the rest is
maybe twenty five percent in RAM and the
rest is a slow wave sleep you can also
see a little bit of a pattern on this
slide most of the slow wave sleep tends
to be aggregated toward the beginning of
the sleep onset and then gradually
tapers off toward the end the opposite
is true of the REM pattern the rim
periods tend to be longer arm rim is as
I said a diff
animal it's a very very active brain
state the brainwave pattern actually
looks very similar to what we see during
wakefulness we also have to look at
muscle tone and eye movements in order
to to designate this sleep stage this is
where most dreaming occurs not all of it
but most of it it's more easily more
easily awakened or arouse from Ram than
you would be say the the stage three
sleep and we still don't know exactly
why we have ram it probably has
something to do with neurological
processing of information that comes in
during wakefulness and also organization
of memory and maybe even deleting some
of the synaptic connections that
subserve memories that we no longer need
so it's sort of cleaning up the hard
drive a little bit arm I think that's
about all you probably know as much as I
do about sleep stages now so that's all
I'm going to say thank you dr. Brooks so
as you guys can see there's a lot of
stuff happening during sleep sometimes
there's a tendency for people to think
well you put your head on the pillow you
wake up and that's really it but as we
just heard there's a whole lot of stuff
going on from hormonal regulation and so
on and so forth so now we're going to go
ahead and jump into questions now that
we kind of have the stage set in terms
of the kind of what's going on under the
hood so we'd like to open it up to
questions maybe we can kind of alternate
one from the audience and one from the
dory so I'm going to ask Jay maybe to
help jump us on the dory here by the
meantime let's go ahead and open up the
questions go ahead yes please
so great question let me repeat it here
for for our audience across the world
the question was about tablets and kind
of looking at you know reading books
that sort of thing and how that might
interfere with sleep so maybe dr. Brooks
you want to start us off with them sure
the main issue with the exposure to
screens and such is the luminosity of
the light and that has an impact on the
melatonin cycle so if you get a lot of
exposure particularly to bright light
near bedtime it's going to going to tend
to suppress melatonin and make it harder
for the brain to enter the sleep state
you can minimize that by turning down
the luminosity on your screen and it
seems that the in terms of the light
exposure the blue area of the spectrum
seems to be where most of the the money
is so I've even asked people to wear
tinted lenses that will filter the blue
light like a red red sunglasses or you
could even put a piece of cellophane
over the screen that would be helpful
also but the other the other element of
that is that depending on what you're
looking at on your screen it might be
very activating and that's going to be
make it harder for you to to go to sleep
and dr. why I was going to just ask is
there any kind of psychiatric sort of
implication from this well actually I
was going to I was gonna say it's a
great opportunity for a nap right
imagine if you could create an app that
changes the luminosity as well as the
color of whatever you're looking at on
your screen then you could call it a
sleep sleep safe app of some sort but
but you know I think the issue is
certainly what dr. Brooks said is
absolutely right but beyond that it's
just the tip of the iceberg as to why
you know is it just a normal thing that
you're up and this is how you like to
wind down or is there something wrong
and you can't sleep because there's too
much on your mind the voices
in your head what not so I mean it
always helps to know you know just the
basics well what what are you doing you
know why are you up so late reading you
know is it actually you're online on
your tablet gambling playing poker till
four in the morning like some of my
patients or is it just routine stuff so
there's always a question any time
someone asks about sleep for themselves
the sort of investigator in us has to
sort of wonder well what else is going
on I'll give you an example about eighty
percent of people currently age 55 and
older they could on a structured
interview show all the signs of major
depression which is a serious
life-threatening condition and yet the
only complaint they'll make is I can't
sleep and you know we could send them
for a two-thousand-dollar sleep study
only to find that they don't have apnea
and whatnot but in the meantime they
could commit suicide now I'm being
dramatic but the point is sleep problems
present as a tip of the iceberg for a
whole host of underlying issues dr. Kemp
please yes so you know on a sort of less
serious note I think it's also important
in terms of what you're associating your
bed with so you know this is sort of a
common theme that arises but sleep
association so if you're spending the
majority of your evening reading in bed
or you know watching TV or doing other
things and better you know lying awake
then your bed starts to become a place
where you don't sleep and so then when
you see your bed or when even your in
your bedroom you think of everything but
sleep and it sort of becomes a struggle
and I think a war so I think sort of
resetting those associations is helpful
and this is kind of a good concept to
also implement with new parents and
their and their children and teaching
them about sleep associations thank you
dr. Kim actually you mentioned new
parents were actually going to be having
a workshop here for Googlers on you
parents coming up you can check out go /
0 y el for that now let's take a
question real quick from the dory we've
got a Googler writing in saying I always
feel sluggish when I wake up do you have
tips for maximizing the quality of my
sleep and feeling
awake more quickly so that kind of
dovetails nicely on what you just said
as a quick side note dr. Kim actually
took some of your advice and I had some
chamomile last night and I had some
protein this morning it seems to work
just fine thank you thank you so maybe
you can start us off with kind of some
tips and then maybe some of the other
doctors can jump in as well little
sidetrack so the the topic yeah yeah
feeling sluggish when they wake up and
then for maximizing quality of their
sleep so you know there are so many
issues and this is why it's important to
go to your physician have a discussion
because it could be anything from you're
simply not sleeping long enough and
being for example aroused during deep
sleep so you know if you're being awoken
by an alarm clock and you're maybe not
ready to get up that could be one issue
the other aspect as you know are you did
you drink or what is your you know
intake of other types of substances it's
such a host of issues but you know I
guess the first thing to look at would
be are you just spending enough hours in
bed and you know the other question I
guess is being awoken by an alarm clock
you know as opposed to allowing yourself
to sort of get up when you can or that
kind of thing dr. esther lately the only
thing that i would touch base along the
same law is as you may get as we discuss
this to say how complicated this field
truly is and on one hand whereas a lot
of things are attributed to psychiatric
issues the converse can be true so i
think the bottom line should be is that
we should start it be expecting out of
our sleep like we do with many other
things in our health that we should not
tolerate poor sleep and fatigue as part
of our daily lives I think all of us see
many many patients who come in whose
self diagnose and say the reason why I'm
fatigued first thing in the morning is
this or that happens don't get me wrong
any of us if you go to bed at two and
you get up at five you're going to be
tired when you get up the question
really is is if you allow yourself to
spend enough hours in bed and you're
still not feeling well many many many
times there is a diagonal diagonal
reason for that and I think that's a
different
five or ten years ago in the medical
community so I would really encourage
people who have a difficult time with
that if it's something that's constant
chronic not to write it off but try to
get to the root problem that's there dr.
white cargo head please recall the slide
that dr. Brooks put up one at least you
know good nugget from that related to
the question is dr. Brooks was talking
about this slow wave or deep sleep that
stage of sleep being the one that is
traditionally thought of as being
restorative now it's very interesting
because just aging alone decreases our
ability to get slow wave sleep but if on
top of that I tell you for example that
even the mildest form of anxiety or
depression directly decreases slow wave
sleep because it often gets replaced by
an in at an inordinate amount of REM
sleep you can end up sleeping eight
hours for example and still not feeling
restored in the morning so you know dr.
Hester is absolutely right i mean it is
not something anybody should tolerate
because there could be a host of reasons
and each of us you know from our pie in
the medical field can provide several
good explanations but bottom line don't
take it sleep is important the phrase
I'll sleep when I'm dead simply means
you're going to die earlier well said
dr. Brooks anything to add or do is you
uh well in terms of the the question
about grogginess when you wake up
everybody has a little bit of that it's
what we call sleep inertia and it's a
function of your sleep debt whether
you're sleep deprived it's a function of
what stage you're in when the clock goes
off it's a function of your circadian
rhythm most people I think I can say
this most people in the tech field or
night owls and this is a
forward-thinking company you probably
have flexible work times here but most
of the world does not so most night owls
are forced to live in on somebody else's
schedule and it makes it very tough to
do that arm without some help either
bright light or caffeine or or what have
you
just just as an aside that's also the
reason that you've heard the advice if
you take a nap in the afternoon keep it
short keep it 20 minutes or so if you
sleep much longer than that you're going
to enter the the slow-wave sleep and
that's why ye a lot of us will feel more
sleepy if we take a longer nap it's just
harder to recover from that so these are
the sleep pods that I know that they
have here at Google should be limited
maybe to something less than 30 minutes
yeah ideally I by the way I'm very
impressed that you guys have those i saw
one I didn't get to climb inside of it
but I think that's an enlightened thing
to have in the workplace one point I
just want to make also is that I know
that it's you know the end in this world
it's very common for all of you to sort
of be up late at night but that's
actually not what your body wants to do
so you know what you can artificially
try to manipulate melatonin levels it's
actually much better for you if you have
the option to try to keep with the you
know the rise of the Sun and the set of
yeah the rise of the Sun and the rise of
the moon so that's always a bit better
and it has some impacts on your health
long-term too they've looked at some
studies it's you know sort of looking at
night owls versus larks who are morning
you know early morning risers and and
you know and I think again just staying
with the rhythm of of the Sun and the
moon is a good good idea if you can
thank you so let's take another question
from the audience then we got one from
the dory let's get from the all the way
in the corner there
so so let me repeat the question for our
audience the question was about the new
york times article about second sleep
and whether there's you know something
to having different kind of buckets for
sleeper to sleep at different times dr.
Brooks maybe you can start us start us
off well I don't I don't know what we
were meant to do I think the important
question is what can we do and i think
the poly sleep question getting away
from just a monophasic major sleep
period is is complicated and very
interesting both from anthropological
interest in and also from practical
interest you know can we find a better
sleep distribution that is more
efficient and allows us more wakefulness
to be productive or have fun or do good
in the world that would be a good thing
a lot of people have looked for that and
I don't I don't think anybody's found it
yet I'm an advocate of biphasic sleep
meaning a major sleep period and maybe a
brief nap with the circadian dip of
alertness that occurs in everybody in
the mid afternoon but of the the people
that have looked into this Thomas Edison
was was probably the poster child for
this he hated sleep thought it was a
waste of time but a lot of people have
tried breaking the 24-hour cycle into
discrete episodes of sleep multiple
episodes maybe in an hour and a half
every six hours it's hard to do that
it's hard to maintain that and from what
I can tell the people that have been
able to maintain it for any length of
time have done so at the expense of
sleep deprivation arm so having said
that it's it's okay to experiment for
yourself and and see if you can find a
better pattern but it's going to be hard
to do the main reason is you can make
yourself stay up later in a variety of
ways but it's hard to make your brain
turn off it's hard to make your brain go
to sleep if you're if you're battling
the circadian alertness mechanism that
comes from the brain arm interesting
interesting stuff yeah n either
doctors have anything on polyphasic ER
ok so let's go to a quick question from
the dory which types of mattresses do
you recommend and which ones should be
avoided any thoughts on that s all
starts it's a sort of a lifestyle
question um you know clearly I tend to
say a little firm but not too firm
because you don't want to be in pain
while you're sleeping the other aspect
is you know doesn't make sense to have
an eco-friendly and sort of a a more
green mattress and from my perspective I
think it does make a difference because
ideally if you're spending a third of
your life sort of in very close contact
with with your mattress it'd be nice if
it wasn't sort of you know off-gassing
all kinds of em chemicals so if you have
that option and i think they sort of
make these um you know there's a lot
more options out here these days and
especially out here so yeah yeah anybody
else have thoughts on mattresses and
that sort of thing ok so let's let's
take another question from the audience
yes you over here please
so the question was sort of managing
sleep debt if I can sort of summarize it
that way or knowing when to sleep more
or less depending on different factors I
could talk forever but I don't want to
take the stage away so you know in my
experience I think it's better to aim
for to you know to sort of regulate your
rising time and then your sleep time
will come more often because if you're
not modifying or if you're trying to
modify your wake time then you're going
to run into problems like grogginess and
then you know your whole day will
actually get thrown off but people
actually seem to do better even with
sleep deprivation if they're sort of
maintaining a regular morning rising
time I don't know if anybody has
anything to add dr. Brooks yeah I
totally agree with that you can you can
manage your your arising time a lot
you're in more control of that then you
are your turn off go to sleep time I
think an answer to your question I'm
glad that you're aware of the concept of
sleep debt and the need to do something
about it just in general it's better to
try to make it up in small increments of
in all at once arm but if some is better
than nothing so it's it's almost
impossible to ask people who are sleep
deprived all week to not sleep in on the
weekend when they have a chance but just
try to keep it don't don't go six extra
hours on on saturday and sunday maybe an
hour or so and i guess one caveat to
that is that it's really difficult to
make up sleep in that sort of way so
it's kind of better to look at your life
and I know it's hard because you know a
lot of it's sort of project-based here
but to look at life as a marathon and so
you kind of just want to pace yourself
and you know and I think sleep is a good
place to begin for that thank you so I
know we have a question over there I'm
going to get to it a real quick let's
take a question from the Dory that kind
of follows up on this so it says Googler
asks i know we are all different and our
bodies have different requirements but
why is it that some people can perform
so well with four to six hours of sleep
while others are train wrecks what can
those in the latter profile do to boost
cognitive activity doctor why car maybe
you can talk to cognitive function and
leap okay well you know this is a real
can of worms i mean i don't really
almost want to go on record of saying
that there's any one way to to solve
this problem i mean there are so many
different even temperaments look at
children from the very beginning we show
different abilities to handle stress and
fatigue and all of us in our jobs i mean
i remember in medical school different
people could thrive on 36-hour shifts
and others would be just zombies now
there's some interesting if you're
looking for answers it has to be
speculation but i can give you a little
bit just to get you thinking about it
there's a notion that the longer you go
without sleep there's a buildup of
literally chemicals in your body that
have been appropriately termed some
negan's and one theory is that sleep
debt is simply a reflection of the level
of psalm negan's that you're carrying
around with you everybody's sleep once
is okay you tell me if you can hear me
it's not it's not entirely clear how
much efficiency people from person to
person there is in clearing those saamne
genes so for example if i'm clearing
them at a very high rate I can feel more
restored than someone else who's
clearing them at a low rate now this is
again a highly conceptualized
explanation but the bottom line is there
are biological individual differences
that explain why some people can handle
sleep deprivation more than others
there's also a very pathological
explanation as well and that's something
called bipolar disorder and there's
milder forms of bipolar disorder where
people in the hypomanic stage which is a
high-energy unhealthy but very
productive stage they're hypomania can
go on for days weeks and during that
time they appear to be at the top of
their game but there's usually a heavy
price to pay in terms of a crash later
on now some have argued that the valley
here actually selects for people that
have that
tendency and it can get very colorful
because the other aspects of bipolar
disorder and hypo mania in general are
very flamboyant very dangerous there's a
lot of promiscuity spending lots of
money and doing risky behavior but the
work side can temporarily appear to be
very very intense and productive thank
you any other doctors have thoughts on
what was the original question why does
some people tolerate deprivation better
or why do some people need why do some
people function better on less sleep and
can anything be done to optimize their
cognition and I'm not notice I did not
say take a five-hour energy drink do not
well there's four so there's a variation
a wide variation in sleep need there are
short sleepers and long sleepers and
you're talking two standard deviations
from the norm on either side of the bell
curve but these folks are genetically
programmed to be able to get by on for
hours or require 10 hours and as far as
we can tell nothing else is wrong with
an assistive biological phenomenon in
terms of tolerating sleep deficit we all
have our various coping mechanisms there
probably is a biological basis for
tolerance just like there is with pain
tolerance but the other part of that is
that people that appear to be
compensating for it well may not
actually be doing so some of the some of
the aspects of our life that are
affected by sleep deprivation are subtle
and difficult to measure on so none of
us tolerate it very well one thing I
want to add is that um you know life is
such a rat race when you're awake don't
make it a rat race when you're asleep so
you know don't I mean I know it's really
difficult but don't try not to compare
with other people and because it's you
know there is such variations thank you
let's get a question real quick the lady
in the back there yes
a great question so it was about how to
sort of stop your mind from racing when
you're trying to get to bed and also any
thoughts on hypnotics sleep medications
that actually takes care of the next
question on the dory too so it which is
can each panelist give their number one
tip for falling asleep more easily so
maybe we can just kind of go down the
line here I'll try to answer the
question which wouldn't necessarily
apply to everybody because that's a very
specific thing which is having a lot on
your mind when you're trying to fall
asleep can be a wide variety of
categories or let's say levels of
severity if it's literally at the level
where your thoughts are racing randomly
and you can't control them and it's like
a runaway train you know then obviously
you need to see me separately but if
it's regular stuff like what's been
happening over the day or what you have
to do the next morning or you know what
basic we won't call it ruminations but
we'll call it just general noise there
are things related to sleep hygiene
which is the process of coming down at
the end of the day that can definitely
help with that and I'll hold off on that
for dr. Kim but back to the question of
should I just take a sleeping pill i
prescribed lots and lots of sleeping
pills however for me I'd like to say
that a sleeping pill is almost the last
resort right I look at a sleeping pill
as if if I'm working on a problem with
you and we're it's going to take some
time at the moment if we must get sleep
at all costs yes I will prescribe a
sleeping pill but there's a lot of
downside to using sleeping pills
especially if you haven't learned about
good sleep hygiene right because then
you can become dependent on the pills
once someone is dependent on a sleeping
pill the last thing they want to do is
the boring and tedious work of sleep
hygiene so I really make a point to
educate people almost like saying the
sleeping pill is a train set of training
wheels but we're going to teach you how
to ride the bike you know this is a
perfect setup just to to become addicted
just because this is more of a lifestyle
issue so in a person you know just a
personal I guess your personal approach
to life because what you're using the
sleeping pill for in this situation is
trying to override your mind noise so I
think rather than trying to override the
mind noise it's better to think about
reprogramming the way that you think
about you know about all of these issues
and the way you approach it so sometimes
a sleep Journal can be helpful like
about an hour before you go to sleep and
you just write down everything it's sort
of like your place to purge the day and
if you have you know some people call it
a worry journal but you just write down
everything that's on your mind that
could possibly be you know bothering you
and then you kind of write down what
you're going to do about it the next day
or if there's anything you know or
there's nothing to be done about it in
which case you can and just have to
cross it off but i think it's sort of
better to get into this kind of habit
rather than into the kind of habit of
relying on a sleeping pill that may be
changing your sleep architecture and
affecting your deep sleep and you know
affecting you on a longer-term basis
there's no but the treatment to help
that and i and i think one of the things
if you listen there's there's always the
five-minute snippet on how you can
improve something like this the reality
is it's not always that simple and in
all of you obviously have access to
information for simple answers to this
but again i think it comes home to roost
that in today's world if that's not
satisfactory and if you can't cleanse
the things before you go to sleep in its
leaving to poor sleep there are
individuals out there that can now help
working with you just like you would go
see a physical therapist just like you
would see in many other aspects in sort
of this dogma that's been attached to
sleep is really no longer true dr.
Brooks knee yeah I think just
practically give yourself a transition
period uh when you back off of your
activating activities at the end of the
evening before you lay down on turn out
the light don't don't go from playing or
war of the witchcraft world doom five
and then turn out the light and expect
to go to sleep the other point i'll make
about sleeping pills you know i'm not
trying to push drugs here but they're
their tools like any other new piece of
technology and they're useful in a lot
of situations for a lot of people but
you have to use them skillfully the
current generation represents a dramatic
improvement over what we used to have in
terms of less habituation longer
long-term efficacy shorter action in the
the bloodstream in the brain arm so i
won't say don't ever use them but use
them wisely ideally for for a shorter
term than a than a chronic part of your
lifestyle I know dr. Kim you're going to
yell at me go ahead yeah I don't yell I
was just going to ask you to maybe I'm
clarify what judicious use of sleeping
pills might be uh I think they're useful
for jet lag in particular um if there's
a something in your life that is created
an upheaval that's making sleep less
attainable in the short term I think
they're useful for helping you turn off
the turn off the brain nightly or you
know for a period of two weeks I'm I'm
just kind of you know I don't have a
magic number there's their studies that
show continued efficacy which wasn't
true of the old ones the old ones people
would develop tolerance and lack of
efficacy after within 30 days there's
good science now to show that efficacy
can last up to a year and some of these
and again it's a you know I don't want
to get into moral issues about taking
chemicals on that there are people that
take them every night and you have to
wait it's a cost-benefit decision there
are people that do better with that
paradigm then walking around
sleep-deprived all the time it's a great
point so let's get a quick comment from
dr. why Carter sorry I just want to make
sure if any of you know my patients end
up watching this on youtube I want to be
very clear there are people for whom
chronic illnesses
chronically affect their sleep have
benefited tremendously from chronic use
of sleeping pills but if we're talking
about someone who does not have a
chronic illness that's the asterisk I
would like to put on the conversation
that just happened when we talk about
two weeks four days periodically so just
want to be clear on that that sometimes
unfortunately we don't have a cure for
an illness and if the illness includes
severe sleep disturbance as a side
effect we have to do what we can to help
the patient dr. Kim and then yeah please
and then we can move maybe to the next I
guess you know I mean for me in my
practice I think having someone on the
sleeping pill like nightly for years a
bit long if you know in the absence of
some kind of chronic disorder just
because in my understanding and my you
know my education and experience the
sleeping pills don't always induce
normal sleep patterns and sleep
architecture and sometimes the way they
make people feel better is that they do
sort of an amnesia so you forget that
you didn't sleep well the next morning
which might be better for a lot of
people I don't know if you want to speak
to that well i'm not i'm not advocating
that anyone in particular go on these
these pills for a year what I'm saying
is there there are people that can do
well taking them that way and if there
are other ways to to deal with the
problem without taking I'm sure but
those don't always work we see a lot of
hardcore insomniacs in the clinic and
the sleep hygiene stuff just doesn't
work it just doesn't they've tried it
and it's not enough very good point and
dr. Brooks you'd mentioned jet lag i
just wanted to mention real quick my
company's swan we're going to have a jet
lag app coming out pretty soon just FYI
i got actually curious are there any
questions on snoring i'm surprised that
hasn't come up yet anybody have a
question on that yes yes please
so let me repeat the question so the
question was about potential underlying
sleep disorders maybe airway disorders
with people that appear to have insomnia
dr. Hester maybe you could start us out
with sort of some some information here
is you're exactly right airway other
sleep disorders I'm in cause disruption
and in your question about it doesn't
actually qualify for sleep apnea I think
that also is a difficult area in our
field because many times there are very
defined criteria use for that diagnosis
but there can be milder aspects of that
and it really leads to being evaluated
by somebody who has a comprehensive
understanding of sleep disorders and
particularly airway sleep disorders so
you're exactly right this may manifest
itself in insomnia in fatigue and again
getting back to the fact that this may
all be multifactorial whether it's a
psychiatric underlining whatever but
airway has to be one of those issues an
improvement of those air issues even
though I'm a surgeon I can tell you that
anybody I see with an airway issue i
recommend CPAP to and kind of like what
we're talking about with sleep sleeping
pills it it is because it is probably
the most conservative aspect of way to
treat that patient but the compliance
with cpap it depends on humans data you
choose to believe is not a hundred
percent and there are all sorts of other
alternatives to be used for airway
obstruction leading to sleep disordered
breathing that can be anywhere from
appliances to procedural therapies and
procedural therapy work but we use them
as in most cases as a last resort to be
able to solve that problem but to answer
your question absolutely can be a
component of this treatments can range
anywhere from CPAP up to procedural but
if instruction then that obstruction has
to be alleviated some way in order for
you to get into the cyclist sleep
and in get good sleep I've seen it even
in my practice that rhinitis from
allergies or whatnot are just a chronic
congestion can contribute to sleep
problems and sometimes just you know
prescription or nasal rinse can be
helpful as well I it again starting from
sort of the beginning moving on up but
the problem is is that even those of us
who've been doing this for a while
there's no one person in the world can
that can look at someone's airway who
has a discordant sort of issue and know
exactly where they're obstructing and
how much they're obstructing that
doesn't mean it's a random guess we're
pretty good at it we're just not perfect
and so you therefore it can approach
them anyways but one of the problems is
is there are many dogmatic statements
made about this in a field that probably
does not qualify for a field that we're
dogmatic statements can be made and so
you really want to approach this in
involving the patient of outlining the
possibilities of what can be done
perhaps starting most conservative and
moving up the road to more aggressive
treatments if mandated by the severity
of their disease thank you dr. Hester so
obviously there's lots more questions
and unfortunately we're getting a little
bit low on time but I believe the
doctors are going to be able to hang out
with us a little bit afterwards so we
can maybe chat with them a little bit
more at the meantime in the meantime
though it is my pleasure to introduce
congressman Michael Honda who's going to
give our closing remarks today
congressman Honda
they can see then uh thank you very much
well the panelists I think it's um it's
enlightening there's a couple of things
I just wanted to be able to emphasize
one is awareness software pneus the
reason I say that is about 12 years ago
is listen to radio remember dr. Dean
Adele he was talking about snoring and
then related that to sleep apnea and
then you talk about obstructive CF sleep
apnea and he described it I said that's
me but I denied it and I mean I didn't
pay attention to it then I started
noticing really that I start to sleep
behind the wheel I'm you know anybody
that sleeps behind the wheel raise your
hands and you know we all do how many of
you have a sleep partner that snores
yeah and those kinds of things are
really irritating really affects
personal relationships so I think once
you have a personal awareness you should
do something about it it's like any
other disease that hampers your health
in your you know lifestyle I'm a policy
maker I was a schoolteacher and I
started to understand that if I don't
learn from myself and do something about
it then I cannot be a good steel or a
good teacher I want you to Stanford some
sleep center disorders sleep disorder
center and saw dr. Dement and they put
me in a little room but chose all over
my head and my body whole bunch of them
I thought I'm not gonna sleep with all
this stuff on in five minutes I was gone
and they kept talking to me about I
could hear them saying keep counting i
said i am colleagues know you're asleep
it was supposed to be an eight hour test
for hours they had enough information on
me to convince any insurance company to
cover me and to pay for any kind of
equipment that needed to be adjusted for
my own needs well i found that in the
next four hours they put a CPAP only a
continuous pressure air
a positive air passage in four hours and
next the next four hours I woke up my
mind was clear it was I was sharp just
24 hours and my staff hated it ok here's
the point if you think about learning
and being alert and being innovative
especially in your field or you have
children that needs to be alert at
school then we have to pay attention to
the kind of sleep that they get and be
as pay attention to kind of sleep habits
they have one of the things i learned
about three or four years ago mom mourn
death 10 years ago my daughter graduated
from high school that summer her friends
drove to the different colleges three of
them died on the road not to drugs not
alcohol sleep deprivation they fell
asleep behind the wheel she was
devastated but the families who lost
their children could not understand how
this could happen so I think those of us
who are watching young people especially
seniors or if you know anybody you know
change policies policies need to be in
place so that we start to pay attention
to how our lives affect young people and
I think that personal awareness is going
to be a very good oh great critical kind
of a mom thing that we need to learn and
then we pass it on i snored i snort and
I stopped breathing and my wife used to
go and watch me and then sometimes she
would shake me so I go right you've seen
that that's obstructive sleep apnea my
dad had it too he had an operation the
operation went well but at his age other
organs started to not function well and
he died so there's a long-term and
short-term impact on doing something
that could be cured or at least
addressed overnight and I just wanted to
let you know that if you know of
somebody or know yourself
take action CHP is one of the things I'm
looking at is hopefully that when these
run across an accident that occurred
without drugs or alcohol they need to
report it and take down the information
of how that happened because we think
there's over a hundred thousand feet
tall tees and in this country but there
might be more because we don't take all
the reports so more information better
policy better policy or healthier life
so I just want to thank you all for this
opportunity I just want to thank Google
again for having us host the sleep home
here and like I said we'll be hanging
out with the doctors a little bit
afterwards so thanks again everybody for
coming in let's get around with Klaus
for the doctors also</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
