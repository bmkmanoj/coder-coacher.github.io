hi everybody my name said Faulk
and I'm happy to bring as Mavis here to
speak for you as may got her start with
municipal wireless shortly after the.com
bust she found herself looking for
something to do and she decided she'd
educate herself about wireless and she
learned a lot and then she decided she
was going to blog about wireless and
then eventually she became the renowned
expert on wireless excuse me and today
she runs a small business called muni
wireless comm it employs about eight
people it has its own magazine and they
organize conferences and esme travels
around the world working on municipal
wireless and with no further ado here's
Esme thanks everyone I didn't think
anybody would be here because it's the
Friday before the memorial day weekend
so I'm actually surprised anybody here
if if this were in Europe there
definitely be nobody here and it's a I
live in Amsterdam and this is what we
call the hey Malark weekend they you
know that's the Christian holiday when
Jesus supposedly went up to heaven
bodily so whether or not you believe it
but that's a big holiday weekend and I'm
glad there's actually people here Thank
You ed for inviting me I think this is a
great interest to a lot of people not
just in Google but in Mountain View and
the bay area in large part because San
Francisco itself had recently issued a
request for proposal and for a someone
to come and build run and maintain a
citywide Wi-Fi network just as a matter
of introduction muni wireless comm I
started it in june 2003 and my idea then
had been that I was bored I'm an
intellectual property lawyer my last job
before this one was as the general
counsel of spray network that was a
pan-european internet portal we were on
the road to an IPO in two thousand on
three stock exchanges Nasdaq Amsterdam
the Stockholm Stock Exchange and our
valuation had been at a billion dollars
and then slowly
up down to like 550 million we had to
sell the company to like us at the end
of two thousand and so I started my own
company I was still a lawyer doing work
for a lot of American software companies
and then 2003 there was nothing
happening so I started muni wireless
because I was doing work for a company
called why finder which is the hot spot
directory and even at that time I
realized at some point that cities and
regions were going to be carriers you
know a bit in the traditional sense of
the word a carrier a telecommunications
carrier so I started seeing actually
municipal wireless deployments pick up
around 2004 and I don't know whether
that has something to do with the fact
that I had aggregated all this
information because before I set up my
website which by the way the name came
to me in the dream I just woke up one
day and spilled out of my head and then
I registered the domain name but back in
2004 I started seeing this pickup in
municipal deployments and I don't know
as I say whether it's something do with
aggregating all the information that in
fact when you actually put together all
the information about what different
cities are doing that people realize hey
you know we can actually do them to the
problem i saw in june 2003 that inspired
me to set up Nene wireless was that if a
city is thinking of doing a citywide
Wi-Fi project for example San Francisco
where do they find the information on
who's doing it who the vendors are how
much it costs and what the business
models are so that's what led basically
to me setting up mini wireless and at
that point in time I had no idea where
it was going to go I just knew that it
was going to be something big and I
thought well if it doesn't work i'll go
do something else anyway today I'd
actually like to talk about five things
that are very interesting to a lot of
cities through vendors to partners first
I'm going to discuss the current
business models and the future business
models that I see coming down then I'm
going to talk about the players in the
municipal wireless market these are you
know not just the municipal governments
but the telcos are starting to get into
this space and I will move on to
barriers immunity points as you all know
the incumbent tell
and cable operators are not sitting
still they really don't like this
happening after all and the differences
between the US and Europe I live in
Amsterdam and I've noticed that the
deployments have taken off in the US but
really not so much in Europe and there
are many reasons for that not just stick
not technological or regulatory and
finally I will actually talk about ad
supported networks in particular what
company called one-to-one media is
planning on doing I had met the CEO of
one-to-one media few days ago actually
last week in London the state of muni
wireless there are about 250 cities and
counties in the united states that are
actually running a network or have
definite plans to set up a network when
I say definite plans they've either put
out an RFP or they're about to put out
an RFP or they've already gone through a
feasibility study so they're definitely
thinking about it I don't think that any
there's a city today in the US it's not
at least thinking about it you know
where one of the city council member
says you know maybe we should set up a
citywide Wi-Fi network and the reason
for that is that there are all these
applications that they want to put on
these networks that actually will save
the money the first thing of course they
want to do is cut down the
telecommunications costs so any way you
can get them to cancel the t1 lines and
cancel their GPRS data subscriptions
that's a thing that they're looking for
and of course they just want people to
be a little bit more efficient instead
of a building inspector going out to
inspect the building and finding out
that the developer had sent him the
night before revised plans now he has to
go back to the office this is very silly
what they'd like to do is to have people
like that anyone who goes out in the
work order anyone who inspects anything
out in the field to be able to just
access that information from the field
and that can be a police officer that's
checking federal state and local
databases that can also be somebody
who's checking on the status of a
project so there are 60 currently 60
live city and county wide networks in
the US that have public access by that I
mean they offer some kind of internet
access to their their residents and
businesses whether it's free paid or a
combination of both there are 35 cities
with giant hot zone
so these typically cover the downtown
area or an area that has the convention
center 36 offer public safety or
municipal apps only so that means it's
closed off to the public but the city
self uses it for code inspectors or the
police department and they're about a
hundred or so with plans we're in the
RFPs out and feasibility studies and
more and more come out every day it's
very difficult for me actually to keep
you know on top of this market there's
so much going on the business models uh
currently the business models fall into
about three categories one is the
classic paid subscription model this is
where you pay you know twenty thirty
dollars a month and you get access that
you know that's been around for a while
the second kind of business model is the
one that's been talked about lately
which is the free ad-supported model
this is what metro Phi is doing actually
Metro Phi in case you don't know it's an
ISP that's based here they have a
purport to have wireless service
throughout the entire Santa Clara
sunnyvale and Cupertino and they
recently won the bids in Aurora Illinois
Portland actually is their big win and
they're there unwired foster city and
ontario california which is down near
pomona now the founder of Metro Phi was
one of the founders of covet so it's a
person who knows a lot about networking
and a lot about serving customers in the
traditional isp sense now the last model
which has not been really discussed much
in the press because not that many
people use it is the free model like
they have in st. cloud florida this is a
community of 28,000 people whereby they
justify the expense that they went
through in building the network and
through the savings that they would get
by having the city employees actually
use that network intensively so what
happened to them is they actually they
went through this this roi process and
they said okay let's see if we put all
the cops on the net
work so they're just around and they're
patrolling they spend more time on the
street we will cancel the t1 lines for
the schools and then calculate also how
much money we save by canceling the t1
lines that we lease today and so here
are some figures fear the police
department let's say has 100 patrol cars
they figured that by canceling the GPRS
the slow GPRS data subscriptions that
they have today for accessing databases
they would save on the order of you know
seventy two thousand dollars a year the
schools are ten school so if they cancel
their t1 lines they were going to save
120 thousand dollars the savings for
full-time employees because of the
productivity in other words you don't
need so many building inspectors going
out anymore and this is it down by the
way that's growing quickly it's in
Florida and because Orlando is very
expensive a lot of people are moving the
st. cloud so they figured that the
savings on productivity are on the order
like 900,000 so you know a small growing
city could save 1.3 million dollars
every year when you think about how much
it really costs to build these networks
it's not that much it's a wireless
network you don't have to dig many
cities on their own fiber so there's no
backhaul costs either the city you
typically donates the fiber to the
operator the net network and you know
when it comes to wireless mesh nodes
they cost between one thousand two
thousand dollars per node but if you buy
them in bulk you can actually get the
price down very low and if your city
does sort of group buying a deal with a
company that provides wireless bridges
like pep link they can get the price
down to under 150 dollars so for
residents it actually need a wireless
bridge in their houses to get the signal
in the house they have to buy a bridge
but because the city by Z's in bulk they
can get the price down fairly low so
that's what they're doing st. cloud
where if you go there everybody has just
free wireless there's no billing there's
none of that nonsense they have hired
hewlett-packard to deploy the network to
run it and according to the consultant
to that project they had staffed up
there the hewlett-packard had staffed up
their call center for the first month in
which the network was in operation
because they were expecting
a lot of calls from people many of the
people who live there are retired and
they're not really tech savvy they have
trouble you know setting up their own
home networks but they were surprised
that they had staffed up actually three
to five times more than they they had to
so it was fairly easy to get started
that's not to say that there aren't any
glitches or there are a number of
glitches namely that there are some
black spots and some people have trouble
getting the signal in but that's coming
for for all wireless networks I mean you
know when I go down to to capitola I you
know there's lots of places down there
where my cell phone doesn't even work
and that's not that far away from
Silicon Valley so it's just wireless so
we've got you know the typical charge
for access the free ad-supported model
and then the free supported by municipal
roi model the future business models
what I'm seeing right now is that a lot
of cities are deploying networks based
on automated meter reading so Corpus
Christi Texas which is a city in the
Gulf that's very important for oil
refining they decided two years ago to
replace all of them the meters in the
houses that are currently read today by
a person they go to every house and they
read the meters and they set up these
wireless meters that talk two nodes on
the street and they decided well if
we're going to set up an AMR project
anyway we might us will also offer
wireless service through the residents
and then use it also for municipal
purposes so we're seeing out Corpus
Christi Texas Burleson Texas a few other
cities in the Midwest where there's
actually a public utility that owns
fiber and they want to replace the water
meters that is more or less the business
model they say okay if we set up this
network it saves so much money because
we don't have to have all these people
reading meters and the meters will be
read automatically and more efficiently
cuts down on fraud to then we can
actually use this network and just offer
free access why bother now putting in a
billing system which is very cumbersome
why bother putting in you know all kinds
of subscription levels and having people
go up and down trying to figure out
what's happening the other future
business model I see which is
interesting because I think this will
happen in Europe first before here
so what I call the virtual network
operator model whereby you have a
company like earthlink or perhaps even
an operator like BTW british telecom
simply wholesaling access to a company
like nintendo that has a following
because nintendo and sony have these
gaming devices portable devices that
work on Wi-Fi and Nintendo lately has
actually been expanding their their
hotspot footprint and I can see a
company like that say buying access from
cities from Earth link from bt from
verizon and saying look we're just going
to offer it as part of a package for a
nintendo users they could charge for it
or maybe they can't they can bake that
into the price of the device but it
seems to me that groups that have
companies that are very strong following
like myspace nintendo sony and in the UK
there's a company called carphone
warehouse it's even giving away very
fast dsl service together with a voice
over IP package that those are the
people who are actually going to be
facing the customer in the future and
not the telcos the telcos are just going
to run the dumb pipes that's my
prediction whenever I give this speech
do it you know audience full of telcos I
sort of roll their eyes and tell me it's
never going to happen but you know in
Europe I'm starting to see it happen so
I think that'll happen in the United
States but at a later date so now that
we're talking about telcos and miu knees
and service providers I'll move on to
who are the players in this market while
the first players in this market were
really the small municipalities that had
no broadband it's all dial-up in
particular there was a town called there
is a town called scottsburg in indiana
population 6029 miles from louisville
what happened in that town is happening
to a lot of towns in the United States
there is a big Chrysler dealership and a
repair center there right and it employs
a lot of people there are also a lot of
people in town who do medical
transcription from home so their home
workers and their Chrysler workers the
town and have broadband until two years
ago and what happened was today you know
when you take your car in to a dealer
they hook it up to a computer and what
happens is that the mechanics actually
get access to the
database that is sitting somewhere in a
server somewhere at the home office or
whatever to figure out how to fix your
car to do things with your car so that
if you are a dealership and a repair
shop in a place at home he has dial up
you can't do that so Chrysler was about
to decommission and decertify this
particular dealership and their repair
center and that would have meant that
this the city the town who have lost all
those jobs and the medical transcriber
themselves were handling more and more
work and and the people were sending
them work said well you're in dial up
you you know we can't keep giving you
the square because we want to do this
isn't this and most of them would have
moved to Louisville so the mayor had a
choice you either had to you know bring
broadband through this town or just
close it down so he went up the verizon
and said hey how about it you know why
don't you set up a you know there's a
demand here why don't you set up a
broadband network here and offer service
to the resin but it sit down with 6,000
people they weren't interested so the
mayor went out and just decided he was
going to set up a broadband network so
they got a company called al Varian to
deliver the equipment and they hired
someone who had been an ISP before to
come into the town and set up a service
provider and that's what they did and
they save the jobs and the medical
transcriber sat in the town they're
still there and they're doing very well
but this you know this story is just
repeated everywhere now in the United
States but the sad part is that there's
still 14 states in the u.s. that have
some kind of restriction against towns
setting up their own wired or wireless
broadband network which is very silly
because it's precisely in those towns
that the service providers like Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T don't want to go to but these
are also rules that were put into place
by legislators who are friendly to these
incumbents so the whole thing is just
completely screwed up after you know
after the big the smaller towns started
setting up these networks and and we're
getting them rolling the ISP started
getting interested because of course now
the whole Muni broadband thing is out of
a hat everyone's looking into it so the
service providers the traditional ISPs
are saying hey maybe there's something
in it for us and there are a number of
cities for example in towns that don't
to be their own service provider means
scottsburg is very much of an exception
they had to do it because nobody else
was going to do it there wasn't any ISP
in their town so what's happening right
now actually is that when you see an RFP
for us a network put out by us a town or
city or now a county they usually seek
you know someone to just build it run it
maintain it they're not saying oh just
set it up and don't worry we're going to
do it ourselves that's very rare so the
RFP of San Francisco Philadelphia
Portland are very typical examples of
what we're seeing out there today and so
aside from Metro Phi here in Silicon
Valley there's a company called neo
reach which is a subsidiary of mobile
pro they've set up a very large network
in Tempe Arizona it's up and running I
think it's been up for three months now
and apparently it's going very well
there's a company also called us
wireless at setting up more in the
Midwest and in the south in Louisiana
and it's funny because once these people
start actually going in and delivering
service and everyone sees oh they have
subscribers there are actually people
signing up and using the network now the
people who used to oppose it but Elkins
the cable companies are submitting
responses to bids so I've seen bid
responses in different places from AT&amp;amp;T
from cable companies from public
utilities for example Toronto Hydro
telecom which is the city-owned utility
in Toronto Canada is deploying a
citywide network there and when I talked
to the guy from Toronto he said well
it's just a normal extension of what
they want to do with their service
because they provide electricity water
they have a telecom so they provide
telephone service so why not wireless
broadband and what I'm seeing in Europe
especially not so much in the United
States but in Northern Europe and
Scandinavia the public utilities there
are have been responsible for building
out fiber infrastructure and what they
do is they wholesale access to ISP so
that they are basically a
the owner of the passive infrastructure
and they wholesale access and it's part
of their way of getting more revenue
because electricity water you know how
much money can you get from that but
that's the next step for the public
utility so you'll see more of that
happening in the US and Canada the
regional telcos are also very interested
so Misch tell which is a michigan
telecoms operator is now doing a project
in oakland county michigan so this is a
countywide project very big and you're
wondering well why would a county do
this well one of the problems with rural
areas is that if you have little towns
each of them putting out rfps it's not
very interesting for a service provider
to come in and serve a town at 10,000
people or town over here at 15,000 so
what the county does is basically it
aggregates demand it puts out an RFP for
all of the cities and towns in their
region and it's it's something like a
template agreement right so once the RFP
is out any town that wants to have
wireless broadband service for a service
provider they don't have to negotiate
each and every single time with a town
they just use this template agreement
and it's a very good way of aggregating
service and that's actually how Swedish
municipalities did it for their fiber
optic service in the northern part of
Sweden they aggregated the demand and
that's how they actually brought fiber
to the home in very rural areas in
northern northern Sweden which is
sparsely populated the incumbents are
now getting into it uh recently British
Telecom announced that they were going
to unwire 12 cities in the UK they've
signed deals now with six cities the big
ones leeds birmingham manchester and
it's really interesting because I spoke
to to the the head of that of the
wireless broadband division of BT last
week and he told me that they have an
interesting model but when you look at
Europe it's very different in the states
when you look at Europe broadband is
very cheap I mean in in the UK a company
I mentioned before Carphone Warehouse
this is one of these you know their
traditional business model had been
selling car phones you know little big
big bricks and then they went through
mobile phones and it's a giant retailer
like a Best Buy so Carphone Warehouse
has this deal now where for ten pounds
a month you can get voice over IP
service and they throw in free broadband
8 megabits per second down one megabit
per second up just with the service as
you can see the broadband market in
Europe is like DSL it's very commodity
and there's so many competitors in
Amsterdam there's probably 10 to 12
providers of DSL service plus the cable
people so I asked this guy is not
interesting for you why should British
Telecom do this you know its murderous
the competition and he told me they have
they view the wireless network is
carrying for business models for them
the most lucrative for them is in the
muni and enterprise business so what
they're going to do for these
municipalities is the following they're
going to set up these networks for them
obviously also for public access but for
the municipality they will set up CCTV
these are the closed-circuit TV police
public safety applications parking and
traffic control transportation control
you know for the buses and and and the
trains in that area and also of course
for the mobile office and BTW actually
has a systems integration arm called BTW
systems which is a competitor of IBM on
a lot of these different types of
projects so you can see whether what
where they're heading to already it's in
the high value high level systems
integration business they also plan to
help large enterprises for example the
city of london they signed deals with
the borough of westminster to set up a
network there and you know if you have a
large enterprise and you say hey I want
you know my employees to use this
network variety of things you just go up
to BTW and you have them set up your
your applications that's one of the
things they're selling with this network
then of course it's voice over IP
British Telecom is one of the few giant
telcos in Europe that no longer has a
mobile operator subsidiary unlike
Deutsche Telekom which has t-mobile kpn
in the Netherlands and has K KP and
mobile BTW got rid of 0 2 years ago that
means that they are actively competing
to get customers away from the mobile
operators and one of the things are
planning on doing of course is giving
people cheap voice over IP handsets
that they can use on this network most
people call people in their city kids no
parents they just call locally so why
use a mobile operator when you just call
within your shall we call it intranet so
now you've defined the intranet as just
a wireless community intranet the last
one of course is public access now BTW
still has a dsl customers right so they
plan to offer this as part of their
service and in a very competitive market
if you have the more you can bundle
things with the more you can keep your
customers or steal customers away from
the competitor so assume you have BP dsl
service today and they say to you
tomorrow hey don't leave don't go to
carphone warehouse because no matter
where you go in the UK all the major
cities were there too and it's wireless
broadband so you can access your your
your your email and the internet from
anywhere using your own you know
username and password it's very
appealing as you can see for many
customers especially people travel a lot
in the UK eventually though i believe
BTW didn't save us it eventually i can
see it coming i believe that BTW we'll
just wholesale access to people like
nintendo myspace virgin carphone
warehouse because those people have very
strong customer followings and it's it
makes more sense for those people to
deliver service to the customer instead
of bt because this thing is so
completely commoditized so i can see
them for example selling a package like
they do today actually in the mobile
phone world the mobile virtual network
operators selling a package of minutes
or in this case bandwidth to someone
like myspace or someone like nintendo
and getting out of the customer market
all together what's interesting about
this whole discussion you know of
traditional business models of paid
subscription the free and everything is
people say to me how can you be behind
free service there's no such thing as a
free lunch and it's always a traditional
ISPs that scream about this you know
there's no such thing as free this is
communism you're promoting communism and
i have to say look anybody who's been on
a train or a subway lately at least i
know in amsterdam they have these free
newspapers have you seen them they're
like you know when you're walking into
the train station they're piled up there
the
often called Metro it's a Swedish
company that has free free daily
newspaper that's free you just pick it
up well that's free but it's paid for by
advertising TV you turn on the TV even
if you don't have cable you know one of
the three networks you watch a show
clearly desperate housewives that's not
free in the sense of the word those
people have paid a lot of money to act
to produce the show to write the scripts
so I think what they're talking about is
how can you promote completely new
different innovative business models and
then they wrap it around this sort of
the saran wrap of communism which is
just completely insane because I've seen
that on my website I have a blog people
comment a lot and I find myself taking
down those comments very frequently and
when I look at email addresses of the
people commenting in that way it's
usually from traditional ISPs so now we
come to the barriers to muni deployments
talking about traditional ISPs and
people have traditional business models
so the telcos and the traditional ISPs
are all screaming oh there's this unfair
advantage that muniz have because they
you know they can get taxes from people
and roll out these things and all
subsidize what they fail to say of
course is that the incumbents are
heavily subsidized too and that they
just this old business model that
depends on this artificial scarcity so
what is the artificial scarcity what
they try to do of course is say to you
that broadband is really scarce
bandwidth is very scarce so we have to
charge you so much money per megabit of
bandwidth and when you look at the
prices that people paying the United
States versus what people pay in Europe
and in Asia on a you know megabit per
second amount it's really high because
over here in most cities and towns
there's only two providers there's a
cable guy and then there's a telco in a
world like that of course there's only
two people they'll keep the prices high
in places where there are more
competitors surprises go down so what a
lot of these muniz actually are trying
to do even in areas that do have cable
and do have dsl is to introduce a third
player that can be the municipality
itself or it can be the network
commissioned by the municipal
to be built and operated by a company
like earthling for example and as soon
as this third parties introduce all of a
sudden there's competition and if that
third-party is even required to
wholesale access to other service
providers like Metro 5 maybe or maybe
Nintendo all of a sudden you get
competition that is in fact what has
happened already in the last 10 years in
Europe on the wired broadband level
because the incumbent operators were
forced by the European Union to open up
their networks to competitors on a
wholesale basis at very low prices you
got more than two competitors in every
market and that's created competition
that is ultimately what the city's want
to do and that is also why the incumbent
operators and the cable companies have
been sending armies of lobbyists in
various states like texas nebraska
indiana and also to the felt on the
federal level today to try to put in
legislation that prohibits
municipalities from rolling out
municipal wired or wireless broadband
networks I'll give you an example of a
fight actually to backtrack there are
about 14 states today that have some
kind of restriction missile broadband
and these were laws that were passed
before two thousand five starting 2005
up until two thousand six a number of
states had proposals introduced in the
state legislature but surprisingly maybe
not surprisingly all except Nebraska
were defeated why is that because by two
thousand five people were very conscious
about this subject people were tracking
them there were in Texas for example
there's a huge battle a state senator
named Pete sessions had introduced a
very restrictive law of prohibiting
Texas municipalities from rolling out
wireless and wired broadband networks
and the the coalition that came together
to defeat this particular measure was
amazing it was you know wireless
activists from Austin tech companies in
austin like Dell apparently you know I
heard Michael Dell even placed a
personal
phone call to the legislature to speed
session saying you better not pass that
I personally was emailed by a very
wealthy very wealthy very conservative
Latin American or you know Mexican
American businessman near Laredo Texas
who said to me that he was personally
going to go down on the hearing day
itself and actually tell this Pete
sessions that if he if this bill passed
that that the Republicans who backed it
would never get money anymore from the
Republican Party and he was so mad about
the whole thing and it's just amazing
coalition of people from very
conservative no wealthy Republican
donors to you know sort of Austin
wireless activists that got together and
defeated it that the same thing happened
in Indiana there was a bill that was
proposed there and all these mayor's
like this mayor from scottsburg they got
into buses and they went the state
legislature and just basically said
don't you dare pass this because it's
just terrible for for everybody so it's
not very difficult to get this thing
that sort of thing passed but still
there are 14 states in the US so now the
battle has gone to Congress because as
you know they are trying they are
rewriting the telecom act of 1996 so
that's where the battle is taken and
wrapped into the whole thing is the
thing about net neutrality about
municipal access about franchising and
all that so this is not over yet and I
suspect that the incumbents will do
everything they can to try and stop true
competition from coming into their
markets so what's the difference between
the US and Europe in this matter and why
why is it that muni Wireless has taken
off in the United States and not really
that much in Europe well the first thing
of course is just competition there's
just so much competition on the wired
broadband level in Europe prices have
dropped that municipalities are sir
truckers shoulders and say oh well why
should i why did I worry about that
we're already paying you know 15 euros
per month for really fast broadband and
you know I can't be bothered about that
the other thing is that the regulations
in the EU at least are quite strict on
the issue of municipalities spending
public money for infrastructure like
broadband one of the things that they're
really paranoid about is the following
and this has happened before France for
example you know today there are rules
against state subsidies to companies
like France Telecom right so what
friends used to do is they do this in
direct subsidy business they would spend
public money to build a broadband
infrastructure and then they would say
oh yeah but only France Telecom can use
it so it's an indirect subsidy so the EU
said okay we're going to put a stop to
that from now on if you're a
municipality and you want to actually
spend public money on on
telecommunications infrastructure one
you have to do it if there's nothing
there yet so for example in the region
like Catalonia they're spending 500
million euros to set up a fibre network
not fiber to the home but fiber to do
various municipalities fiber and and the
other rule is that if you're going to
spend public money you have to open up
that network to all competitors of your
local incumbent the local comic clearly
can buy access but you have to open it
up to you know maybe France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom and kpn and all that
and that way they stop these countries
and giving indirect subsidies to their
telecom operators so that's another
reason why it's been easier in the
states to get these done these things
down than in Europe the other thing is
that power regulations in Europe when
you look at the the amount of maximum
radiated power that you're allowed to
emit from these wireless mesh nodes
which are what we're going to hang on
the light poles right and buildings in
order to get wireless coverage in Europe
the maximum radiated power is 100
milliwatts in the States it's about you
know seven to eight times higher it's
really the maximum is a thousand Millie
wats but no one really gets there so as
you can see in Europe if you want to set
up a wireless network you have to hang
many many more nodes and in some cases
that will destroy the economics of the
deployment plus it's very difficult to
get city permission to hang these things
and it makes the buildings look ugly if
you have all these nodes sticking up
somewheres
just very difficult to set it up in
Europe the other reason why wireless
broadband citywide Wi-Fi hasn't caught
on is really a cultural thing and I
think this is something people miss um
the cafe culture in Europe is so
different from the one here when you go
to San Francisco you see lots of people
sitting got faced with laptops everyone
just working there with their laptops
when you go to Amsterdam it is very rare
to see people working on their laptops
why is that because people go to cafes
not to work people go there to socialize
so you typically go there either to meet
someone you know you've made an
appointment to meet someone or you go
there with the purpose of you know
people watching or hopefully meeting
someone now the interesting thing is
that over the last year I've seen more
and more people using laptops in Europe
but they're mostly Americans traveling
or younger Europeans who don't see
laptops as sort of working but if you go
to a cafe today and you open your laptop
and everyone around you is just
socializing people look at you like hmm
why is this person actually working no
everyone's drinking beer watching the
football game and you're working it
feels weird so the actual use of white
public Wi-Fi in Europe is much much
lower than here and so people don't
think about oh gee wouldn't it be nice
to have a giant citywide network
somewhere so I think its cultural but
again it's catching up and people are
really more mobile phone centric over
there so again that has something to do
with the fact that mobile phone service
there is very very cheap there's a lot
of competition there's roaming
everywhere so if you go to Spain you'll
get access there the whole thing is just
so much better developed than in the
United States people there are very gsm
centric and not laptop centric and
finally advertising so here's what's
interesting with advertising you know
all the paranoia and San Francisco about
advertising supported networks about how
people are you know Google's just going
to snoop on everybody and find out
everything about your life and suddenly
throw you ads for hemorrhoid cream or
something like very unpleasant so I
talk to a company called one-to-one
media it's a new york-based company that
I i believe it is publicly traded and
this is interesting what they're going
to do actually one to one media is there
they want to work with ISPs right so
let's say I'm an ISP 1121 comes to me
says hey you know what we can share
revenue with you know we'll split 50-50
all the revenue from advertising and
this is what they do so you know my say
I'm the ISP and my my customers will
click you know they'll look Wall Street
Journal Financial Times and actually
what they do is they put a cookie on
every cookie a JavaScript small piece
there at the end of every page you visit
so they track you not you the person but
you know you a person sitting in a
particular area of the city and they
track you looking at all these different
sites so let's say an advertiser like
BMW goes up to one to one media and says
we want you to show an ad to a person
who visits The Wall Street Journal the
Financial Times and any one of these car
companies websites volvo Audi Mercedes
now what happens is one of two things
you either get a small ad that just pops
up at the bottom of your screen here
like a little a little bar that goes up
like this it's fairly enough you don't
even really see it but it's there and
you sort of see it like this for BMW or
they do it like like the New York taught
the New York Times or you click on an
article and then you get this blank page
with an advertisement and then there's a
link here that says go through the
article so they've one of those two
things there's also an opt-out mechanism
so actually the ISP has a lot of control
or the ISP can do if it does not want to
bother its customers too much say for
example oh we have this deal one-to-one
media do you want to opt out now or you
can opt out when the ad is shown to you
so that you're never bothered again by
advertising and what what they're trying
to do actually is trying to get profiles
of users so that they can sell it to
advertisers or advertisers can say look
we want you to show our ad for let's say
shampoo to people who visit the
following website so they could say
people who visit
New York style magazine people who visit
you know estee lauder or no cosmetic
company sites or people who visit style
calm so that and what happens is that
it's more like a behavior typing so that
you and someone else who visit the same
website will actually see different ads
because you've been visiting other
different websites and that is a little
bit more targeted in what we have today
where we see you on the side the google
ads of course it can be narrowed down to
country you know there's certain places
where you would never see an ad but if
you're in the united states and that
page is showing you you would see that
ad but this really goes down to your
actual behavior like what the websites
are you visiting and one-to-one media is
very careful about the privacy side
because they're they're going to start
operations in Europe and as you know the
European regulations on on data
protection and on privacy are very very
strict you cannot collect in private
information that identifies a person you
know my name my social security number
my address unless you protect it in you
know you don't send it to the advertiser
so they have a mechanism where they
really do try to protect the person's
identity so that's only a profile a
person may be sitting in this area if
you have a citywide network where the
nodes can triangulate where you are a
person visiting these particular
websites please show this particular ad
so that is what they're planning on
doing and what I heard is that they are
busy making deals with a lot of ISPs
around the country so and I will open up
the field questions since we have 15
minutes if you have any questions yes
we're talking earlier about how maybe
Nintendo would by Blanco
the wireless bandwidth ersten like that
and then how they would run it and just
get the service provided by whoever's
running back it seems like I don't know
right now I have comcast cable and I can
barely get them to respond anything when
it goes down how would Nintendo not
screw over the user life okay the
question is how would Nintendo if
Nintendo worked by access from a telecom
operator for example actually provide
this service actually the service will
be provided by the original operator
they are running the network the
responsible for making sure that there
is coverage in that area and Nintendo
what they'll do is they will simply say
to the operator look we want to buy will
pay you this amount of money every every
year now or every month for this amount
of bandwidth we have three hundred
thousand users and you will allow our
users to have to user their user name
and their password on let's a Nintendo
screen so let's assume for the minute
that you're in London and British
Telecom has this deal with Nintendo open
your laptop and you're in a city
provided wireless access by British
Telecom now perhaps a list of partners
on the right side and Nintendo will be
one of them you click on Nintendo and
you come up with a screen with
nintendo's you know logo and they're
using and then a little box with a
username password you type it in and
there you go so ultimately Nintendo
isn't actually responsible for the
service it is ultimately British Telecom
and why that would work better than
comcast because today British Telecom
has to serve all these customers right
millions and millions of people but
assume for the moment that British
Telecom got out of the business of
retail they didn't have the serve
millions of people anymore in that
fashion you know billing them directly
having a customer service center dealing
with people who cancel service and
everything why you know I think they
could use that money or perhaps you know
cut down their staff lemoore focus it
more on delivering access to all these
different groups of people through
Nintendo instead of having a billing
relationship with the end user it's
actually Nintendo that has a building
relationship with you and that you can
actually see that today in the mobile
market so there's a company called easy
mobile in the in the UK and of course in
a virgin mobile all they do is they buy
buckets of minutes right from another
operator called tmobile and they
themselves do not run that network yes
what's the total cost of deploying
Americans Wi-Fi networks based on a
certain size and how is the in terms of
per number of dollars for the initial
rollout and give it operation what sort
of what sort of what gifts under ok the
estimate let me see I I just saw one
this morning actually st. Loup st. Paul
Minnesota had done a feasibility study
were they estimated that the cost of
building a wireless network over st.
Paul is about seven to ten million
dollars just the cost of building the
network and then if they were to run it
over a 20-year period the total cost
over that 20-year period that includes a
10 million and that includes the actual
maintenance would be between 21 million
dollars and 27 million dollars and they
estimated that they could actually may
break even at the end of year 3 if they
sold subscriptions for at least twenty
dollars a month to fifteen percent of
the potential subscriber base so when
you look at that cost right and you look
at let's say building a
fibre-to-the-premises network in st.
Paul the fibre-to-the-premises network
would cost 296 million dollars and they
would have to write it off over a period
of 30 years or more but of course they
could put more applications on it more
services like video voice and all and
very high bandwidth applications that
have nothing to the internet but really
for other purposes for the enterprise
and municipality so that those are the
costs were looking at is you can see
they're not trivial which is why cities
like to you know outsource the building
of these networks to private providers
questions yes
is it easier to deploy these municipal
network municipal Wi-Fi numbers in
smaller cities where it might be a
little harder or the harder for the
large telecoms or the larger common
carriers to wield political influence
over the long term over the local
politicians question is is it easier to
set up these citywide Wi-Fi networks in
smaller towns where it's more difficult
for the incumbent operators to wheel the
amount of political power at the wheel
and deal obviously with the local
politicians the answer is yes it's much
easier in a small town first of all
because there's very little politics
usually we're talking about a City
Council of five people on it all of whom
have known each other probably forever
the second is just not very interesting
you know I'll give an example st. cloud
in Florida it's a town with 28,000
people okay it's growing quickly but
it's a town at 28,000 people i mean how
many you know why would SBC spend all
their time screaming about that and in
fact what's very interesting about st.
cloud is that you have to ask yourself
maybe it's not necessarily worth it for
SBC to go in there because the town did
their homework what they did is before
they put out before they launch their
network they held so many community
discussions about this network they
wanted to find out what people thought
about it what they wanted from it they
address the health concerns for example
something that's not done in very big
cities for very obviously reasons you
know doing this in a city with a million
people it's just hairy I mean how many
city meetings do you need to have the
second thing is that in a city like st.
cloud there aren't that many factions in
San Francisco there are so many small
groups you know with their own ideas and
how to do things as people are worried
about getting cancer you know because
there's all these wireless signals
there's all these people who also think
well you know we really should have a
city-owned network or we should have
fiber and not wireless and when you have
a smaller town like that this does not
many things to fight about and so it's
much easier and yes um SBC's just not
interested yes
well what about 3p over the competition
with 3g the question is what about the
competition 3g that's a very good
question because three weeks ago in
Amsterdam or in the Netherlands t-mobile
launch their wonderful supposedly
wonderful 3g well it's like an evdo
service right so they're charging
something on the order of I don't know
like 60 euros a month and when you read
their advertisement online it's all like
this we provide you up to 1.8 megabits
per sub to 1.8 megabits per second of
super fast internet service and it's
just like the stuff you're used to in
your house and in your office now I
don't know about the people work at
t-mobile but I can assure you that
hardly anyone today at least in places
in the Netherlands where people like
that would buy this service they
definitely get more than 1.8 megabits
per second right so it's expensive the
carriers have been trying in Europe have
been trying to do this for years it's
not working why because the capacity is
really limited I posted on my website a
PowerPoint slide from Qualcomm you know
have they have this media flow thing it
actually from Qualcomm and it talked
about how South Korea telecom had
launched some kind of a video service
like unlimited right so it's like oh you
pay you know 30 bucks a month and just
all you can eat just use as much
bandwidth it didn't work the network
died they had serious serious problems
delivering the bandwidth to all of these
people who wanted to use it for all of
these things that people normally use
broadband for in South Korea so what
they had to do basically is they
couldn't give people unlimited access
you know just one fee and you just eat
all you can eat you have to meet their
people and that is just deaf people
don't like to be metered why because you
know how they meet are you it's like
okay bae 30 bucks a month but if you use
over a certain number of mega
you send and receive well how do you do
you know how many mega bits are in that
photo you just sent to your friend what
about that little film that you just
downloaded from your other friend I mean
humans don't go around calculating the
number of megabits that they're
consuming on a phone it is very
unpopular and I don't see it happening
anywhere it will be popular for a few
people some people will buy it but
honestly I don't see it working and I
think they know that which is why
they're all scrambling now trying to
find something to do in citywide Wi-Fi
and especially now that the Wi-Fi gsm
phones are coming they'll have to find
something to do yes it's the question of
what happens to voice trembles voice
I'll give an example kpn telecom which
is our incumbent operator they are
losing ten thousand landline customers a
month they all go to mobile but you know
mobile voice and most of the
subscriptions are not post paid their
prepaid so people run around you know
they just pick whichever is cheaper so
maybe you know the six months you use
tmobile next six months i use orange and
that's yes giving completely in fact
i'll leave you with this one time warner
cable right ty i have a conference in
santa clara from jun 20 jun 19 to 21 and
one of the speakers who is from time
warner cable time warner cable right now
is actively looking for a city to unwire
and they want a city where people live
work and play and one of their ideas is
to give people these cheap voice over IP
handsets that they can use anywhere in
the city to call their friends to call
relatives whatever i guess walk around
the city network to bundle that with
their service see the key today's these
people are so desperate to retain their
customers right the price of marketing
of getting an additional customer so
high they'll do anything to keep you and
that's one of those things you know
voice is just sort of something you
throw around like this and so is you
know in Europe apparently a broadband
Carphone Warehouse so thank you everyone
