to have Katsuji from the University of
Tokyo with us to share his recent work
at google Tech Talks katsu is professor
of the institute of industrial science
at university of tokyo he's been there
since 1996 part of that he was a faculty
member at Carnegie Mellon and a postdoc
at MIT zai lab catch is a pioneer in the
field of computer vision and robotics he
currently serves as editor-in-chief of
the international journal of computer
vision and is currently director of
Microsoft's Institute of Japanese
academic research collaboration let's
give a warm welcome to Casa ikeuchi
thank you very much so today's talk is a
monument closet and what is a monument
basically a idea is to scan this kind of
cultural heritage object and then to
pass down to the next generation over
area to the locate remotely located
areas and why because monument priceless
and irreplaceable and she'll pass down
to the future generations and applauded
by the computer vision and computer
graphics with ample of frontiers and in
this particular re monumental project
there are couple of issues first one is
how to sense such a 3d data and how to
compare how to make a contents as well
as how to communicate such a huge data
to remote areas and how to display and
today are mainly talked about sensing
issues and also there are two issues one
is 3d and 2d but today 3d sensing issues
mainly a little bit about a display to
then what is a 3d scenario first floor
monument 3 a 3d model is generated and
from this brie de meaux
the image is generated this kind of
cultural heritage obtain the range data
from various viewing directions 3d data
processing and generate 3d contents and
for this we choose one of the temple
called our bayon temple in Cambodia
let's see
there's a song duck sorry
and the tradition of Khmer the temple
was constructed around the end of the
12th century to bring relief to the
crisis in the uncle era it is well known
for the appearance of for example come
smiling faces on towers and double
corridors curved in beautiful
interesting relief then why we are
walking or we choose this Bayon temple
first of all this is 150 150 45 so quite
be and provides good challenge secondary
as videos explain beautiful and complex
method or e central tower is DeGraw
including a year by year so there is a
possible crops in near future so before
option it's good idea to data to deck to
take a 3d data and in this 3d domain our
first step is data acquisition and since
various viewing direction we can
determine the dirty relation Mars and of
course at each step there is already
commercially available sensors are the
address of the earth why we are working
then where the size of the bio-temporal
provide various challenges to be solved
so let's take a look at each challenge
first of all data acquisitions usually
we obtain color image and lens images
and as you know color image is I wish to
a red green blue image at each pictures
while range image we saw a distance from
this particular picture to physical
point and one knows I and how to obtain
this lens images usually we can use
laser range sensors to project laser
light to the object and then
applied time and from this flight time
we can determine distance and
commercially available sensors such as a
mock map used to work in oside locks and
this kind of sensor can measure plums
limited to up to 100 meter accuracies
five millimeters and example of the
range data is this one this is a one of
the range data of Nara bigger Buddha now
of course from psyduck psionics through
be beat we have all range of the range
sensors why we need to work well problem
is all ground based sensors basically
you bring sensor on tripod and wait
couple of minutes or couple of seconds
then you can obtain range data and of
course from the ground this kind of
pagoda you can obtain all data it is
visible from ground but due to the
occlusion some potions data is missing
and what we can do usually we can build
a scaffold around out there and then we
can bring such a grandma sensor on the
scaffold and digitize but we are talking
about the bayon temple 150 meter hundred
fifty meter 45 meters of course you can
build a scaffold what you know it's not
the good of all sightseers so what we
can do well what we did was we hung
razor any sense under the value of
course by using this we can guarantee
various viewing direction and this is a
scene which we are painting by using
balloons answer this is balloon this is
not important this is important and of
course you know you can guarantee
various viewing direction such as like
this high positions this is a good idea
though one problem is of course you know
by dividing the data acquisition sensor
moves so this kind of
distortion look at how we can solve this
problem as Mark explain I come from
Carnegie Mellon so I hope to use famous
Takeo canal factorization method
basically given image sequence by
tracking each features theoretically we
can decompose this observation matrix
into motion matrix and positional matrix
this is famous paper written by Thomas
Ian Connelly but unfortunately this
isn't good though this is not so
accurate as rectified razor rain chances
letters what we can do well Hodges we
think about distorted range data image
motion and battle motion and we can
extract three constraints later reaction
what is three constraints and by using
this three constraint we can set up
nonlinear minimization of metal by using
a coastal function to estimate Cameron
emotions and by using this accurate
estimation is obtained now what is three
constraints first of all in any case
factorization method provide you feature
appointed 3d data that may not so
accurate in any case that provide you 3d
data also factorization measured provide
you motion of the balloons or emotion of
the sensors also since this TV camera on
the line sensor is synchronized to the
laser signal so we can also obtain 3d
point with respect to this laser any
sensor there should be classman
basically data obtained laser any sensor
should correspond to the rain dance data
obtained by factorization method based
on
motion parameters if this motion
parameter is correct this is past
constraint second constraint second
constraint second constraint this is
so-called bounder adjustment if we will
obtain 3d data then by projecting back
by using a rotation translation that
point should correspond observed data
point this is standard in bandar
adjustment this is often used in stereo
system so van der adjustment further
constrained the reason why I avoid
helicopter and use balloon is balanced
news motion is smooth while helicopter
has a high frequency vibrations so we
can assume sensor motion is smooth
enough so we introduce smoothness
constrained motion of the camera is
smooth by combining ds3 constrain band
or adjustment smoothness constrain and a
laser constraint res early disappoint it
should correspond to the factorization
result we can set up minimization
paradigm however for this minimization
we need a good initial solutions initial
estimations and original initial
solution can be obtained by using
factorization laser that provide you
motion of the sensors so by using this
initialization we can define motion
parameter by using cost function given
by this tree constraint and once you
obtain precise motion parameters by
using this motion we can recover shape
let's take a look at the result this is
one of the range data obtained by
combining image sequence obtained by TV
camera mountains are particular sensors
we can liquefy it turned out this method
is better when motion is severe like
this and given this distorted arranged
data and image sequence obtained at a
time we can rectify another example this
is a plus one you know this distorted
data plus email sequence rectified
besides this balloon sensor we also
develop a ladder sensor a combining
disbalance ensalada sensor and sie doch
we can obtain data in order to scan
large architectural structures such as
the bayan temple we have to use
different types of sensors depending on
the location of objects in the side
to scan the deity faces of bayon we used
a long-range laser sensor named cyrix
we measured each face from many
positions such as the ground scaffold on
the roof and a bucket lifted up by a
crane
the data from different directions were
integrated and a 3d digital model of
each face was built to scan the narrow
space between the terrace and the
corridor laser sensor named climbing
sensor which moves vertically along a
letter have been developed and with ease
by own temple is a huge architectural
structure with a large number of high
towers and it is not practical to scan
the upper side especially the roofs from
scaffold
for this task we use the balloon sensor
a laser sensor suspended under a balloon
which had been developed for this
purpose two different types of laser
sensors small turned 23 equipped
depending on the distance to the target
balloon was manually controlled by four
ropes pulled from the ground
to minimize the effect of drifted do so
this is a story how we obtain data now
from various viewing directions we
obtain then settles in this case 10,000
land images and of course if we are
talking about the five to ten ren's
images there are commercially available
alignment algorithm determine deductive
iterations but if we are talking about
10,000 kota terabyte user software
doesn't work well so we develop various
alignment articles based on actually I'm
mark Backus this is actually and what is
alignment basically if there is a to
data one date and seconded make a
correspondence between a feature point
over our data point and then try to
minimize the distance and this is a
nonlinear method so it'll a debris
minimize and obtain rotation translation
went to data obala now what is the issue
in alignment well first issue is as I
told you a huge data due to that
requires large amount of memory and long
computational time so we develop a
two-step approach one is quick pairwise
alignment using a graphics processing
unit on site for sensor planning and the
data checking and it's provide you
initial alignment for the next step also
based on this initial alignment with our
parallel simultaneous alignment on pc
clusters first why we need this quick
pairwise alignment algorithms where if
computational time is wrong student
would be dead under severe sunlight and
I'll be fired from the University and I
would like to avoid such a situations so
quick alignment is definitely are
necessary and one of the most
time-consuming portioning alive
charisma is to such corresponding point
and that is usually n square operations
if number of boxes as temple as 6 12 10
then a computational become 20 power of
10 and just wrong computational time so
we run quick dirty algorithms basically
corresponding search by using graphics
processing unit and as I told you if
this is a little interpret are cheating
because this is not precise alignment
but it's okay this provide you initial
estimations how can we do basically are
assigned unique index color to each mesh
and project that mesh to the graphics
memories lattices so each triangular
part has own colors and that is open to
the graphics processing unit of memories
now we assume particular building
directions we project second image to
this graph explain and find which point
this point was rounded with triangular
part by checking color of the particular
angular patch and from this color we can
define corresponding machine on bar with
respect to this particular point by
doing so operation become order of N and
actually number vertices like this and
this is a computational time then
certainly dogo / an operation although
again once we obtain this initial
alignment large dataset well one of the
issue is a sequence alignment lr
kimmeridge so we have to make a
so-called global simultaneous alignment
loading all the data and determine
deductible addition of entire relations
our game if we do large amount of matrix
and so we need a localization and
efficient efficient computational method
so linearization basically r cosine
becomes one unsigned become theta
something like this and we deal eyes and
of course this linearization only works
when initial solution is correct and
that initial solution is already
obtained by using previous yeah
collecting into that maybe box you know
just maybe one but they know for that
you have to know which data is yeah
that's another area but in email in our
case we did this one and of course this
become a sparse matrix so by using ICF
with jeremy lin and the computational
time become drastically decrease and so
the issue is a memory efficiencies and
over her local maybe as he pointed out
you know if we only use a sparse number
register that we can avoid this problem
but in our case since we outlaw in
entire data so if we directly allowing
entire data set over local so however we
know from the initial alignment which
data corresponds which are lovely so we
can make a data dependent groups groups
and each small group is assigned to each
pc class a pc capisci on in the pc
clusters and run in parallel manners and
the resulting a corresponding result
matrix is sent to Sabah and Sabah cooked
all the matrix informations and
recalculate
then issue another position to each a
client and client again make a
correspondence like this repetitions a
single measurement is not sufficient for
modeling a huge structure like the Bayon
temple there for multiple measurements
from different viewpoints are required
in order to construct the entire by own
3d model is necessary to align multiple
measurements given an initial guess of
the positional relationship between two
mesh models a developing algorithm can
align them as we were putting a jigsaw
puzzle together in 3d the result is
correct estimation of the positional
relationship iteration of this alignment
process construct the 3d model however
this alignment method lines only two
mesh models at each step therefore
alignment errors accumulate in one
location so we implemented a
simultaneous alignment algorithm which
can align not only two but multiple mesh
models simultaneously and this is a
aligned result I took so high we are to
collect these data's
however this data is just a point cloud
data and are not mesh data yet so
opposed that we need a merging algorithm
but are roughly similar story so I'll
skip this component basically merging is
to connect to regulators and one one way
is to directly collect but since this is
not good so usually what we are doing is
a volumetric alignment and again this
equal directory do overflow card so we
run in parallel computers and I'll skip
this component and this is a result
which you obtain a 150-meter 150 meter
45 meter by on temple is representing
two centimeter resolutions ah ask mark
the noise is coming home side axle and
that's well there is no noise actually
are you see some time seems to be noise
but that not know is rather sometimes
human beings you know we already
obtained data including side to see are
two and also trees so not know is
actually we are data but maybe you know
in terms of ion temples read by your
models that may be noise but and of
course since this is 3d data so we can
enter in this 3d data by the way this is
a ten-centimeter resolution and not to
two centimeter resolution and this is a
human actually this is how a human human
yeah my student try to remove such a
human data but they know
and this this case since Allah boring
little body metric emerging algorithm
use a ten-centimeter alliteration due to
that this kind of horror calls
additionally humans because we cannot
avoid it I know aside the cr-z they be a
lots of money and visitor cambogia so
and actually the main reason why I event
this violent improve our I originally
scan big buddha in comic actually an
oral history when I was a CMU with mark
and yo EG we tried to make a model of
relatively small inside object and when
I returned to Japan were this modeling
business is interesting so why don't you
make independent project but object
itself is last one to scam secondary
since I know small inside object so how
about outside large object and it's
worthwhile and there is one idea target
in japan called Kamakura big buddha la
35 meter big bronze buddha sitting
outside under the sunshine Sun sunlight
so first we scan Kamakura big buddha and
in Japan there's another big buddha
corner a big buddha so i also scanned
not a big buddha and i exhausted the
historical a big buddha in japan so I
went to Thailand and I skintight and Big
Buddha and then a people are saying well
Nick neighboring country cambogia there
is a temple called volume that has 173
Big Buddha so I went big you know
cambogia and see that temporal the it
turned out of course it's interesting to
scan face but also interesting
registers entire Bayon temple so I
decided by own temple what are the side
the business of course I deter this data
faces and this is one of the example
cover 50 on e de spion temporal consists
of 50 towers and each tower has four
faces relatives so it means are 200
paces but somehow someone is already
gone so current 373 and I collect all
phases and especially this one not
sensor noise raza when religion
converted from Buddhism 02 hindi mo some
of them try to destroy facing due to
serve this kind of situation no curve
so that this is a hundred seventy three
phase library of big buddha in cambodia
by own temple now people are saying we
can classify this 173 faces into three
groups people saying i would have to
check whether it is possible or not so I
don usual phase classification program
by using this range data and it turned
out yes we can't do that one group
consists of daiva one group consists
debe de and one group was a schwa and
destroying divide made on female this
line / god and devil so this is a female
good idea this is a main good idea this
is a man deputy areas I don't know
whether there is a female Deborah
unknown but maybe but anyway we can
classify this 173 into debe Nevada Aras
and this is available one of the typical
day of things
this is a typical Devolder phase
this is a typical Asura face
now another question or a la salut ma
says well when we when Jay Raye they
construct the Bayon temple there are
couple of independent work igloo
packages and construct these faces and
in order to examine this conjecture
Aruna what we did was to cluster based
on similarity of each faces and set up
this similarity group this is one
similarity group this is another
similarity group whether this number
corresponding to our numbers so as you
see near where this map is so one
similarity group agrees here one
similarity group is here one similarity
group is here here so similarity phases
exist at proximity positions meaning
probably 10 alkyl group are the
responsibility of this area one worker
group has a responsibility of this area
like this proximity distributions so we
can safely say maybe few independent
team of work I've exist and also why it
December is another dumas says the
master came central face and then our
student came by looking masters caving
due to that such similarity oh god
that's another luna and there is no
documentation just luna so we are not
sure whether it is it true or not so
what we should do is in terms of beauty
centralized more beautiful than a
peripheral areas we can see but right
now we have no evaluation function which
face is beautiful which face is not
beautiful so we are investigating how to
improve this our conjectures and third
whining was when we make this kind of
flu a plan somehow this bayon temple
rotate 0.94
Oh degree counterclockwise and there is
no room of our such a situation of God
but that's a fact and maybe change ass
petitioner I don't know that in any case
there is 0.94 counterclockwise rotation
of this entire value so these are the
story of volume and also what more
finding there is a many pediment
deputies and maybe this pediment eggless
like this areas or pediment is a kind of
decoration of windows and as I told you
this temple converted from Buddhism to
Hinduism at that time most of this kind
of window window decoration is hidden
and currently even though you visited by
own temple you cannot see this kind of
temp pyramid so before us there are no
picture at all of this hidden pediment
and actually I gave this talk at the
back late last week and then one of the
Buddha Department of Berkeley is excited
quite excited about this pediment and
according to him a lie interesting is
originally good diabetes but somehow
they came out and then try to put this
Sheba and by the by der this is not
world premiere this is 20 times or of
world premiere you know maybe I gave
this talk 20 to 30 times so that but the
deductively did and also you know even
though you see this kind of figures but
because there are no picture at all some
people some people try to take a
pictures but they fail and so you know
in the sense you know I'm very proud of
this you know we can't generate this
kind of pictures and of course what we
did was a witch can this area this area
this area DC area like this by using a
laser instances by using resin sensors
and meters due to that we succeed
actually but
not low-tech solution so I shouldn't
expect too much but anyway a laser tees
are quite important and especially I
didn't know that they know I originally
where this is not happy in a junk rain
or decoration but according a cool
according to that presser this is the
most important figures I don't know what
yeah well resolution was it luckily same
but there are two reasons maybe one is a
this is a rendering program so due to
the effect of rendering secondary decay
may occur you know actually you know
this area there are lots of the pot and
due to the you know I don't know English
never but BatB it bad bad bad bad and
actually there are lots of the residue
of bath so yeah we clean up but uh yeah
now another issue is a texturing and
maybe two issues one is how to determine
deductable relation between Colossians
and others are any sensors but this is a
well one of the typical program so I'll
skip this one another issue is
elimination variations and the biome
temperature are large temple so even
though you start taking picture from
here to here when you come back you know
maybe dark due to that color change your
cars now of course in the graphic
society there are many ways to remove
this kind of job but that doesn't
provide you the real color of the
surface and why the article is necessary
because we are talking about cultural
heritage and in terms of preserving
cultural heritage we should obtain the
other color meaning we have to remove
effective Sun so issue is fast there is
a illumination and heat surface and
surface spectrum is multiplied and you
observe I shouldn't say too much pitino
our graphics is a kind of straight not
stirred were Latino are from elimination
Morty prior service Cara obtained
observation here vision from obtained
result can we decompose surface color
and elimination color this is issue and
in order to simplify the situation we
assume narrowband you know particular
band is only sample so let amines net
surface and dead elimination and also
there is ambiguity in terms of intensity
if surface color is dark and
illumination is strong or if surface is
brighter but the eliminations are
reserved to the same so
there is ambiguity in terms of
brightness so in order to cancel out
this ambiguity we use chroma so-called
chromaticity green channel is / blue and
let the channel / blue then we can
cancel out this kind of elimination
effect until this chromaticity space
previous our product of surface color
and elimination color box so now at each
point we obtain elimination of red you
know most of all we obtain our cara and
g color of that particular observation
but from that we can only set up two
equations why we have one two three four
unknowns even you can include this one
we cannot resolve we cannot reduce
unknown numbers so this is ill posed
problem what we can do we assume
illumination is a black body Ardita what
is Brock body related originally this
kind of black body is heated up then
gradually it color changes and that for
a particular locus called plankin locus
and alone is a prank and orgasm variety
of illumination can be murdered at this
plank andhakasura colors such as snow
ohta a blue sky raja shadow blue sky and
average daylight noon Sunday and early
morning and candlelight rock this
meaning out of the elimination can be
modeled as a blackbody radiation colors
plankin locus and more importantly
emboss of this plank and 0 cos exiting
XXX existing particular straight line
whose inclination and
residue is known and in order to verify
this actually disappointed out Henderson
in order to verify the story we also
took this kind of a Tokyo data and these
are the blue data is obtained in in our
Institute and exactly yes they are
visiting this particular straight line
now by combining this plank and locust
and previous equation we can do little
bit better job now this is observation
equation so when you observe you obtain
IG and ir and suz on this SG e g SL ER
is unknown this equation can be slightly
modified the refugees in order to make
inverse creations also basically what i
did was we divided this boston by IG and
divide I easy and IG then it turned this
component is i 1 over e g 1 over u EG
obama mucho well one well one we want
one will be no by G and SEO by D
refugees so this is a equation model
equation and here only IG and ir is
known now previous a plank and locust
formula we can set up this equation 21 /
easy equal m multiplied 1 over e r plus
c where m and c is known of course easy
re EG ER is unknown we probably in this
one here probably in this one here now
we can set up this kind of occasion
where s g i-- g and multiply ID then we
can set up this equation here this is
observation component observe the green
color and red color and m is known
values I Z's again observe the color
SZ ir is unknown meaning when you okay
one particular positions color you can
say original surface color existing one
particular straight line we don't know
where it is we don't know where it is
but we can say that is existing one
particular straight line whose
inclination and bias is known so if we
obtain one particular surface color
under one elimination condition we can
make one straight line exactly samples
you're under different illumination
conditions we can obtain another
straight line and we are talking about
surface color so surface Cara never
change if we are talking about the same
picture so this intersection is real
colors unfortunately dismiss or the
little relative and this is a kind of
example 1 p.m. image 4 p.m. image by
checking exactly same positions colors
we can obtain the are color of the
object this method is relatively
unstable so Rosa we constrained a
solution area is a visible area plum for
4000 to 7000 using this kind of
constraint we obtain better more stable
solutions whether we are talking about
this surface color under different
illumination condition l1 l2 l3 l4 exist
so these are the input data of this
particular part and within with this
particular constraint we can obtain this
estimated surface color we don't know I
surface color
maybe this is a true colors and this is
yahya so this is a surface color this is
a surface cara and these are the
suitable color under this elimination
conditions and that is recovered by
using our method and original vessel and
what we are saying is our method is more
stable than original just straight line
intersection mesle another surface part
like this we obtain similar result so we
are claiming our method is more stable
and today I didn't explain but our
method need exact exactly same positions
different illumination condition but
actually if we can assume boundary of
shadows and if we assume at the boundary
bright side and the shadow side has same
surface cara even from one particular
image we can obtain to illumination
condition and we can estimate
elimination color of the area's from
shadows yeah if specularity exist our
solution methods become much easier
because specularity provide you
illumination color so the reason why we
are working very hard is sort such as
dichromatic model model are pretty much
we solved we solve the problem but this
kind of lamberson color constancy is
much more difficult than color constancy
over by a diagrammatic mother actually
okay slick sorry one is you know
lambertian surface one is dichromatic
service one is a couple service i got
metal surface and metal surface of
course we cannot handle this one because
you know in any case a metal surface
depend in a metal surface itself has own
color so
we cannot use that vessel secondly if
surface is a diagrammatic diagrammatic
service solution is by assuming
specularity holds the same color of
elimination condition elimination colors
so by dividing the elimination color we
can also recover body-color to and issue
is how to obtain a specularity point and
we also develop a method to demo we also
develop a method to detect such a
specularity point but but today i'm
talking about when surfaces run version
what kind of message can be possible and
this is that one was a solution ok now
by you and you know so by using are
measured from this picture we can
rectify the color but still you know
intensity is different so by making
histogram of two regions and adjust and
intensities of 10 degrees and one of the
Japanese printing company took our data
and make this kind of walkthrough videos
and they are showing this video in
Cambodia I don't know I'd it is
necessary
well let's skip did I show this one okay
uh maybe five maybe ten moments when you
have this kind of 3d model what we can
do is by using this kind of 3d model we
can generate ancient lost our shape this
commoner nara big buddha originally
built our 8th century but burned twice
and the current one sixteenth century so
what we did was by using a current to
the current to data and our literature
we can obtain original big buddha
the Nara Great Buddha into ice temple is
the most important and greatest Buddha
in Japan the 15 meter bronze buddha
image surrounded by the Great Buddha
home was originally constructed in the
8th century unfortunately however
several disasters critically damaged
these architectural Marvel's the
currently existing Buddha in Great Hall
were rebuilt during the 17th century we
have been attempting to restore this
great cultural heritage object to its
original state through the use of
digital techniques first the current
view was captured with three dimensional
laser scanning
using the digital model in the
literature survey enabled us to
synthesize the original
in May 2001 we spent two weeks for
digitizing this Great Buddha in order to
retain the higher viewpoint scanning was
done not only from the ground but also
from the ceiling first 180 range images
were converted into a triangular based
mesh model then all partial mesh models
were aligned together avoiding air
accumulation by using our simultaneous
registration algorithm after aligning
all mesh models are oak tree based
parallel volumetric view margin
algorithm is applied to determine the
consensus surface and generate a unified
mesh model of the Great Buddha this
information is vital for cultural
conservation and will be useful for
further simulation of original state
restoration
in the history of Japanese Buddhism
temple architectural styles have
gradually changed the current Buddha
home built in the 17th century is
distinctly different from the original
style fortunately about 100 years ago
architectural historians build a manager
of the original state according to the
literature survey and a comparison of
the architectures of the same period we
have also scanned this model using laser
sensors
due to the limit of the senses accuracy
and measurement configuration however
the final portions of the miniature
cannot be acquired at a satisfactory
level toshio Dodge temple is the
construction of the 8th century and
retains the ancient styles of Buddhist
architecture in june 2001 we went to
tosh.o dodgy and took the partial 3d
model totally 780 range images were
taken for 20 parts of the architecture
from the miniature model the global
positions and rough dimensions of the
parts can be acquired we extended our
alignment algorithm to be able to
determine the optimal scaling parameters
the miniature model was combined with
quartz models into the final one through
this extended algorithm the last step
was the restoration of the Great Buddha
the literature survey enabled us to
determine the dimensions of the original
Great Buddha the current model was moved
into the original model using these
dimensions through digital composing
morphing technology using the
archaeological knowledge we can
synthesize the original view of the
nurburgring
actually this is not the end of my story
five moment is okay now one another
issue is how to display this kind or 3d
data and of course you know one way is
to use this kind of dark room and
shoulder videos but the in my opinion
this is not interesting Raza you know
when you go to this kind of side we can
enjoy son died as well as cultural
heritage too and lava when you be this
kind of a heritage side people don't
appreciate this historic site at all and
rather in for example our students
children student student kids beast here
and just have lunch box and return
that's not good and so what we did was
we will discard a virtual reality system
exteriority system to show this kind of
object on side felissa we have to worry
about a couple which one is a geometric
consistency objects will appear exactly
same positions and for this so we saw we
use this kind of hardware solution this
premise a device a project magnetic
field and then from that we know the
direction of this haha Go Go gross and
on this google we show this kind of a
virtual object then people appreciate
what kind of objectivity this is a
geometric solution but the geometry of
solutions not enough for example are
just to overreact upper exactly same
position but somehow this looks floating
or decides on the table and why because
you think I don't have a shadow over
Jessica of shadows so shadowing
conventions are getting quite important
and of course you know for that we have
been working and also other people are
working how to generate shadows for
example if there is a budget observe
this potion is occluded so this picture
only obtained partial energy well if
there is no budget object entire energy
so multiplied is a partial energy /
taya energy to each pixel point we can
generate this kind of shadow information
and avocado that we hope to measure
elimination environment and for that we
also developed we develop our user
fisheye lens and measures mbaka
elimination environment actually this is
roughly same period as a portable
co-develop Sofia elimination but somehow
our paper was rejected this cigarette
Nexus p pi z way way and we can generate
this kind of movies of course but this
is a maybe seven or ten years ago so it
takes a week to calculate this video's
now in order to make this real time and
a good point is a shadow on the
elimination ABC is a shadowy adobe
shadow see linearization so again we we
prepare this kind of component images
and then by measuring illumination
conditions or we can generate a shadow
on lines but the problem of which method
is prob course and we can do this kind
of real-time shadow but the problem of
this method is based on the image so you
cannot change the viewing directions so
what we did was we set up this kind of
shadow planes and on this shuttle plane
we calculate component images and
depending on elimination condition we
calculate current shadows and of course
this shadow plane can be represented as
a graphics graphics processing unit as a
graphics memory so we can down in the
air time again and also we develop a
method how to decompose complicated
object into more simpler shadow plane
and this simpler shadow playing we
calculate a component a shadow images en
current elimination condition is
multiply and generate the shadows now
this is a hardware which we implement it
and another issue is a whereby on
temporal case we can use a 3d data
volume but this particular case doesn't
take this anymore so unfortunately how
to did I standard line drawing from
Akkad and to caddo details so
fortunately this site is heavily
investigated by Japanese researchers so
we can obtain line drawings of ancient
our building and we build this kind of
color models textures we beat all the
temporal similar period and took various
pictures and page that one and generate
this one now this is a complete model of
that are gone template the template
wrong already and by combining this
shadow informations we can generate this
one now we mount this CAD model to the
previous mixed reality hardware's and
also this is the flying of the ancient
capital called Oscar village in Japan
now what we did was this is a equipment
to measure elimination environment and
then if you like some in front of this
virtual object and with shadow which is
deflecting current international
environment and even just kind of kid
can enjoy
so go gooo you can enjoy an ancient
appearance of this temple and also we
will do this kind of system on the pier
and from our hero you can look look down
then you can see originally dis kinda
but on this current appearance you can
superimpose virtual city
and the amount pinion we have to use
this kind of hardware so it's not good
so my proposal is many Japanese company
turned down but my proposal is recently
most of the Japanese phone has a camera
so download this kind of care the model
on this camera depending on the position
based on GPS information or something
and because we have to worry about
geometry consistent little bit but when
you see through this camera if you can
see this kind of ancient capital as well
as since this is downloadable so boys
guidance then you know every time you
child 1 y 1 cent was housing there but
anyway I think we should go like this
direction now also we are talking about
maybe we should the motor bicycle type
of card type and we can convert this
entire village into a kind of park so
this is the today's topic sensing issues
balance sensor and huge data hollander
alignment algorithm and the photometer
consistency elimination cara estimation
by using a plank and 0 cos and I've on
roughly 10 million u.s. dollar over this
ten years on this particular our topic
and if you are interested in this entry
by using the result we edited book which
consists of maybe ten PhD thesis along
this line of Alyssa so please buy this
book and also if we are interesting with
this website thank you very much
