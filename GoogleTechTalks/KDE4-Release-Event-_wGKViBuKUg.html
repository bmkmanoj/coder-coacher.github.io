were in Glasgow for Academy last year
this is kind of like this is like going
to be the illegitimate love child of the
talk I gave there with the talk that
Claire lotion gave about research from
Acadia community and before I'd to get
on before what this is really about I'm
gonna start with a question if I hit the
right button how far we got with the
desktop in the 30s years and the GUI was
really kind of bored and i'm willing to
offer a big cash prize for whoever can
give me a reasonable answer aids run
away with the mic okay come on help me
out here how far we got in 30 years no
answer can be too stupid parity with
commercial desktops nice but doesn't
come in the correct units so you don't
get the big cash prize almost the sabres
we had a nineteen seventy-three you are
probably going to win the big cash prize
you didn't give me the units but Eddie
Eddie one more answer seven parsecs
seven parsecs at least it's given in a
sensible unit ish but it's totally the
wrong order of magnitude rocket you win
the big cash prize one u.s. dollar I've
got another competition mater on for a
pound so there's twice the value ok
right how five we got we've got 6.3
miles Zarek park is just up the road um
I'm really kind of has it actually
really changed all that much it has ish
um I'm going to come back to a little
bit later on
what this is really all about I'm really
kind of what I want hopefully people to
take away from my talk is that arm as a
community we are excellent at
development it's what we do is the very
nature of us and we're also now maturing
off as a world the free software world
that we do the other stuff as well so
it's not just about development anymore
we do our marketing we do our artwork we
do our sounds we do the whole shebang
but something yet as a community that
we've still not quite got a grasp of
whether it's a lot better now that it
has been in the past is it's actually
about doing research whether informally
or formally in order to improve the
development that we're doing to make
awesome products and actually the free
software world katie is actually better
than most out there so really what we
will talk about today is a little bit
about kind of what's actually going on
in katy in terms of research where i'd
like to kind of see things go in terms
of integrating the culture of research
into the project and there'll be stories
about fish heads and stuff on the way
okay so briefly a little bit about me
I'm the head of research and development
for a company called serious serious is
a supporting member of the EV my
particular interest is in software
quality is my particular thing I'm
working on just now and more long term
I'm particularly interested in how
agility is implemented by three software
projects and what the ramifications are
in that for the final product I also do
other free software stuff with a british
computer society i could tell you about
now over a beer okay so what's not
really changed all that much in the past
30 years icons I really love icons not I
want content so why do I have to have
this little thing which is kind of like
the gatekeeper to the content it's been
around for 30 years now and yet we still
click on these things um why are we not
just being presented with content that's
scalable if I want to make it small like
that so icons are still about they've
not really changed much in 30 years yeah
they have aesthetically and stuff like
that but they're still gatekeepers to
content
any news they're still about they not
really changed much either again
aesthetically yes but they're still
there sitting at the top of your window
doing menu type stuff pointers it's kind
of really hard to change them yes again
aesthetically they look nice they do
magic widget tree thing to let you know
what the system is up to but
fundamentally they just point that stuff
and that's pretty much what they were
always going to do it's nice that we
have things like you know multi-point
and stuff like that but fundamentally we
have things that point that stuff
they're not changed maybe they won't
change maybe they don't need to change
but let's face it they've not change
much in 30 years what has changed
windows so during the whole kt4 plug
there now plasma and in particular the
plasmoids on the desk a great because we
effectively just got rid of the windows
I'm going to clock on my desktop so just
give me the clock I don't want to square
box around it which says clock I'm very
well aware that the clock is a clogged
so plasma awesome because people like
stuff and they don't want the frippery
and it's really good it basically says
give me the content I'm going to worry
about the rest because I know my clocks
o'clock and it's fantastic and that's a
really good thing to come out of the
development of KDE 4 search so stretchy
is going to be something to come back to
a bit later because of Nippon work but
Striga is really important because
people like to find stuff now
historically people put things in the
file system and they had folders and
hierarchies of folders and folders
within folders and we kind of force that
upon ourselves people don't necessarily
think that way so after the ability to
tag our content and say come back later
on and say I want pictures of giraffes
that have been said to me by John
terpstra then you can do that and that's
really important that content is
something that we can get easily
considering now we are all sitting in
front of computers as content consumers
multimedia Reese tough for one of a
better term
um yeah phone on because I just want to
listen to my music and I don't want to
have to configure a million-in-one back
end to you know make the universe of
sound work in my sort of consultancy
work are in the past I've done stuff
with ltsp we're trying to get sound to
work over a network to a thin client is
a absolute nightmare and it's kind of
you just wanted to work because people
its content people sometimes forget
musical content because you can't see it
but it's there people want to consume it
so again things like phonon really make
life better for ourselves and it's again
it's something in the desktop world
which really has changed and it's really
important that it has been
it's not my laptop the battery's dead
it's a sad story dude it's not plugged
in where's your plug sorry about that
that's right I forgive you I have made
myself look foolish in the past in much
more glorious ways and having a laptop
run out absolutely I could so make a
joke but it'd be far too rude
sorry I just like to make a statement
about yeah so they make the guy from
serious look foolish I just like to say
that hewlett-packard make fantastic
laptops the battery life is phenomenal I
would never ever substitute my lenovo
fall of these
haha
ex works last time awesome okay give
another video works i would actually
swish my mother before it
ok so this is a Katy for quick you may
have heard of it
sweet great cameo from Kyle Cunningham
everybody now I just have to remember
where I was oh I was here safe okay
right yes so here's where it all breaks
down floor of the metaphor the desktop
my actual desktop my physical desk does
not have windows on it it doesn't have
icons on it either and it was certainly
well okay Friday night it does have
menus on it it does have pointers
whether I've talked about this in the
past people say well you desperately
have pointers on it desktops do you have
plate is on because well at least what
I'm sitting in it because i have my
pointers but yeah windows icons and
menus they're kind of a bit your rare to
find them on desks there's the proof so
yeah why do we still insist on putting
them like why do we still have the WIMP
paradigm within the desktop metaphor
maybe it's the medical paradigm to be
the other way down I don't know but you
know why we still doing this 30 years
later why are we not making it easier
for ourselves to get to the content in
the age of you know your content
consumers so that's just a question I
really what I want to talk about today
is kind of like how does research work
in a free software world or how can it
work and what a kind of the
ramifications for KDE and when people
think about research they think about
you know sort of the academic sitting on
their pedestals thinking lofty thoughts
not getting paid enough but they have a
very nice lifestyle and all that kind of
stuff hey it couldn't be more wrong what
it's really about is we're just using
your head and using your imagination and
asking interesting questions using your
imagination is not very hard just the
other side of things you can get away
with people shouldn't be afraid to think
stupid things and I really didn't mean
that when I was about eight
um my father works in R&amp;amp;D for the
printing industry and his company makes
ink for these big massive printers and
the printers are designed so that you
kind of you not just do like 10 copies
of something I want you thousands and
they're quite decent sized so actually
companies put them in their company
offices to do like Prince of internal
newsletters for around the office and
stuff like that and I said to my dad one
day I bet secretaries sit by these
machines for ages they go and they start
a job and rather go do something else
they should just sit there so why did
the machines not dispense cheese uh-huh
I was eight and I really like cheese um
and you know right ad laughter thought
the whole thing was really funny um but
now you know some years later okay the
machines do not dispense cheese um but
they do actually have functionality to
have people entertained while the
copying process goes on so it takes a
long time so people should really not be
afraid to think stupid thoughts because
sometime later they might actually be
really important to whoever the other
thing about asking interesting questions
now asking you to do questions there's
not necessarily about okay um yeah yeah
okay examples all right so we have
high-level questions the other thing I
should surprise about agency of course
it is subjective I'm suggesting these
might be interested some people ah so
yeah so go back to my first example okay
so what are the viable alternatives to
the wind paradigm a desktop metaphor now
thankfully we start to see these kind of
questions answered like any of you've
had ever had the chance to play with an
XO the desktop metaphor has been kind of
throwing out the window and they're
phenomenal little devices to play with I
would never suggest on the metaphor they
users actually going to work for people
in their offices or whatever but it's
really good at people have thought about
what's really going to work for the end
user of those devices we then have sort
of lower level questions I'm sorry a bit
more relevant Katie here why do we get
rid of file dialogs which allow us to
choose file save files etc and just
provide strizzy search boxes instead
why do we still have the option to go
through the file system and go into that
folder into that folder and then choose
a file why not just search for content
so instead of going file open and
getting your usual file chooser well it
just presents tribute and people could
just say John charger F and get what it
was they were looking for from here we
then have a lower level we have the
questions which are kind of like the
most fundamental we're simply thinking
and asking these questions causes wave
functions to collapse and Schrodinger's
cat we let out of the box and you know
we end up with things like who knew that
Sebastian kogler had a three-piece suit
research really can be informal and this
is something I really want to impress my
people today doing a PhD or masters or
whatever in order to train yourself to
actually be a researcher is really nice
if research is your chosen path I'm a
software engineer by training but
research was kind of like my chosen path
where I mention before my father was a
researcher he kind of brought me up that
way and it was kind of an effort was
going to be this way it's Who I am but
you know the community is mostly made up
of artists software developers at sech
we're not career researchers so do the
PhD is great but it's a lot of hard work
it's not necessary for everyone but you
don't need one um 88 has just finished
his PhD he submitted it he's waiting for
the great and good to tell him how
wonderful it is is that the printer on a
scale of 1 to 10 how hard can it be 8 ok
his PhD was easier than mine they really
can be tough sometimes they're not for
everyone but they don't need to be
people inside KD are already doing
unashamedly cool stuff without
necessarily having any kind of formal
training whatsoever this is something I
just reaped off the the blog a few days
ago I scaled back my hardware just to
see what would happen with KDE 4 it's a
really awesome question to ask when you
consider that you know if you're sitting
there with your laptop developing
something nice you've got the shiny
you kit but you realize of course that
there's lots of people using older kit
out there it's a really important
question to ask someone have the guts to
ask the question and then do a little
bit of experimentation not necessarily
formally but just say here's what I felt
and it's really important that the
community gets its head around doing
this kind of work and communicating it
so people know what's really going on in
our development I was talking with the
Air America it's a Academy and he was
just saying stuff like you know he he
pays attention to the commit rates in
KDE and gnome and how you know here in
KD we have a a culture of are more
frequent smaller commits compared to
Nome where there are less frequent but
larger commits which you know as we all
know the release early commits early
commit often mantra is obviously
something that most people could have
subscribed to and so it said something
about what goes on in KDE and again
things like the ebn just keeping a track
of what's going wrong and how many how
much stuff do we have to fix it's not
formal but it's something that people
should get their heads around and start
thinking about because ultimately it's
all going to help make que te even more
awesome that it already is there is
formal stuff gradual and this is where
katie is really a head of the curve with
the rest of the project Katie's taking a
part of the project called squash's i'm
assuming i'm hoping most people heard a
squash by now hands up if you've not
heard of squash dad
hi my name is Paul Adams I work for a
company called Sirius and where the
chief disseminator of the squash project
for the pastor has it been now 8 18
months 18 months squash has been alive
and we still have not much to show for
it so we got two and a half million
euros from the European Commission which
is not a small amount of money by any
stretch of imagination what's really
nice about it is the EV actually got
funding and this is where katie is
really kind of ahead of the curve was
that the organization was kind of
represents Katie actually got money from
the European Commission basically to do
work that's going to help make Katie
better it's phenomenal what we're doing
is we're building a tool which is
growing we're basically sort of
re-engineering Coverity I think that's
kind of the short version of it if
people want to know more about it please
come and talk to me afterwards they're
already kind of why were to talk about
today but we're basically building a new
system which looks at how could we
evaluate software quality automatically
and spirit results which actually means
something to people because what we all
think about quality is very different so
the idea is to have a system where you
can tell it what you think makes
something good quality and then it lets
you know if the code and all the other
data you can get out of a project
actually lets you know if that code
meets your expectations of quality and
that's what squash is really about ipoh
look right we all know it we all love it
11 and a half million euros okay that's
a huge amount of money and although the
EV is not a partner in this project and
it's obviously a much larger projects a
longer project at eleven or a half
million euros which is basically you
know indirectly got into the KDE back
pocket and I think we're all kind of
aware of the influence that this project
has had on Katie for pointe-noire and
how it's going to continue to have
impact for some time to come it's really
important work it's interesting science
it's making us think differently about
how we produce our software why we
produce our software and you know most
importantly it's about how do we get
content and help people get content
better and what content actually means
to the system and it's really important
work
so how could people get involved with
research at KD the first thing I say
just simply good talk to the people who
are doing it and ask them questions tell
them things what means something to you
and what are the problems that you think
would be interesting to solve so please
aide said bass they're both being paid
by a Greek University to work on the
squash project as part of that funding
me please feel free to come up and talk
to me about things that you think might
be interesting problems that would help
make it any better I'm always willing to
hear these things cover play with the
other Katy researchers online there is
KD dash research it's a list of much
promise low traffic so if you want to
come along talk about things there
please do and if you don't want to play
with the other researchers play with
yourself Aaron saigo does you know you
know Aaron does not post very much
circadian has aaron ever posted acadia
research no i don't think he has however
I talk to them Academy because actually
did some pretty cool stuff just by
himself so if you don't wanna work with
others seriously just do it for yourself
if it helps you learn something more
about the product you're developing then
go for it i don't know how it makes
things better the other thing and this
is the really important one share the
crazy ideas if you want que te to
dispense cheese say so now because in 10
years time people may what the KD e
cheese dispenser um they're also a
places where you could actually go and
work with researchers kind of outside
the KDE spheres we want to share some
crazy ideas those of you go to falls
down there's a research room at falls
dam where a lot of these projects like
squash NEPA work other european funded
things things that have been funded by
the NSF here in the united states we all
kind of get together the idea is to
actually physically bring our scientific
results to the free software community
so people can tell their address and say
what the hell were you smoking it's
important we get that kind of feedback
because if we as research
just kind of say magic things and it
doesn't really relate then so research
what was then the other one this is a
new initiative which is actually quite
started yet but keep an eye out for
research friendly dog the academic
community and I really mean kind of the
academic community is not necessarily as
well in with the free software community
like the back that I have need to know
how to work with free software community
better and how to solve problems that
are interesting to the free software
community and how to helpfully get data
out of the free software community
without getting in the way of what we do
so I'd suggest also i'm not quite sure
where it's due to be other news about
month or so time research friendly org
it's going to be a way of finding out
how to work better with the research
community and what it means for
improving your project ok here's the big
one big companies the proprietary firms
which do all their development and have
lots of R&amp;amp;D money behind them actually
cannot be afford to be too adventurous
because they have shareholders who'd
quite often fear change there are people
out there who would gladly do all sorts
of crazy stuff in there hidden away
proprietary world but then ultimately
can't because they have customers who
pay a lot of money who have expectations
and quite often one of those
expectations is continuity therefore you
very rarely see massive radical changes
in the proprietary world and look at
Vista ok enough said ok you they can't
afford to do anything too exciting for
the fear of what their shareholders
might say and even better they're
spending too long stealing each other's
ideas anyway and this is the real killer
of innovation in the proprietary world
because they can't even say can i attach
a cheese dispenser because they're too
looking at too busy looking at the other
guy at saying no his dispenses fruit
okay they're so busy licking each others
ideas and they're not looking at the
bigger picture and not necessarily
looking at what what's going to deliver
something new and sexy and exciting
that's going to make the world a better
place they really cannot afford to do it
and this is our strong point so where
the free software community really has a
judge to make a huge difference and we
really have for quite some time now I
mean very simple things like you know
tabs in your web browser okay we got
there first all right just little things
like that make a huge difference so we
could afford to ask the cheese dispenser
question now they really can so we
shouldn't be afraid to do so because
it's going to make a huge difference
later on when let's face it the war will
be won and the real reason and this is
kind of the one thing I really really
really want you to walk away with today
is that we can do this I've always had
this feeling that research within the
free software community one of these
things where people say I'm not so
interested or Adele if we can actually
do it or whatever we can it's just
making sure you understand that it's it
doesn't have to be big formal stuff just
asking little interesting questions
makes a huge difference so I want to
finish by saying so very simple serious
really kind of became part of the
community just in the most to squash
project started basically I got time
phone Eric dough great I've got time
fanatic though the anecdote is how did
how did serious become a que de vie
supporting member well the deal was very
simple it involved five half naked wet
men drinking beer on a beach in Greece
and 22 of them suggested to two people
from my company that it would be a good
idea and the whole situation was very
compromising we decided probably would
we're a free software services
integrator we actually do very little
work on the desktop actually it's near
enough none however KD is
the enterprise class desktop and we
really as a company want to do what we
can to help make things better help make
things easier so you know as a
supporting member you know we pay some
mighty Evie but really we want to do
other stuff as well and the research is
kind of as part of that so um we're
proud to be a supporter of the EV and we
really want to thank you for the work
that you've done as developers of KDE KD
4 is conceptually quite phenomenal
four-point-oh is a really good start and
you know we're all really looking
forward to what's going to come up with
4.1 and beyond so originals they are
thank you all arm just to say well done
thank you Paul we've got a couple of
minutes for questions Celeste would you
want to say something about the research
you do say yes say yes at you with big
cash prize it's a pound you know so
you'd mentioned that an advantage free
software has is that large companies
have shareholders but we have an
equivalent to that in our user community
who also often fear change now we can
choose to ignore them and we won't
necessarily be destroyed but that is a
consideration absolutely now this we
don't necessarily have to deliver the
crazy dish to give an example kind of
like from my own background dub for a
while I was as open blown developer and
zope went through basically an internal
fork where they said so choose quite
good we ought to be ball I've Ruby on
Rails so we're going to call that soap 3
and it was quite a and it wasn't just a
number shift it was really quite a
massive change of the philosophy of the
project of things like this and yeah
that hurt because there was a holiday
users who said what is love three
nonsense and so the soap to stuff is
still under active development
but so 3 is now mature it's nice people
are using or whatever so there's an
example of where quite a radical change
of the project eventually delivered
something quite nice I'm something we do
have the time to do in the free software
can have the time to do rather than the
free software community is to do stuff
that we don't necessarily deliver
experimentation and crazy stuff is
something that we can certainly do and
not necessarily have to deliver and we
really shouldn't be afraid to do that so
we could invest time arm into doing
stuff like this I could just be like
little bits of chunks at a time just to
see what happens and not necessarily
have to deliver it where the big
companies really can't afford to do that
so this might at first sound like kind
of a joke question but I'm actually
serious about it I love drug questions
you you were talking as like a lot of
the beginning we talked about interface
design and desktop and all seriousness
what are your thoughts on Microsoft Bob
okay um what am I sort of a Microsoft
Bob Microsoft Bob okay to give me a
second
microsoft bob was colorful and probably
didn't get as much attention as probably
should have paid to it that's the paul
adams serious corporation political
answer no seriously i think is it was
colorful and people didn't pay enough
attention to it hi hi i bought one of
Sirius cybernetics new traumatic pink
drink dispenser and never it's mighty
bright please help serious side effects
actually made the doors on the well
you're just happy when you get through
there they're superficial design flaws
and then you encounter the fundamental
design yes did we have other questions
out here don't be afraid don't be afraid
hi my name is Celeste and Paul and I
work with the kitty usability project
also good one too and I'm on the kth CIO
working group and some of the research i
do isn't necessarily tech-oriented such
as in code but it's more on the ends of
the users we do a lot of well we the
group and professionally we do a lot of
usability testing a lot of interaction
design and testing a lot of new
interface concepts not just of similar
to plasma new ideas to try to test these
out before we spend all the time coding
I don't know what else they want me to
say but i guess i do do research it's
just in a little bit different realm
than what serious does so we have
research in all circuits at you who
young we have research in all corners
and all directions of human endeavor
that's cool alexander hi so um that all
right so um we in the open office
community those a lot of research and
development we actually a community's a
lot of people that has nothing to do
with technology remark there's their
different type of their lawyers to
differ type of disciplines and income
and they say well we have our very
particular demands of for openoffice now
one thing that we have being and this is
more like an internal project management
question is how one thing that we have
been seeing challenging is how can we
translate that into code without burning
out our resources on really important
development that is basically going to
stabilize in the office we don't
stabilizing the project and as a project
manager I think I would like to know
what is perspective on that situation
since I think you may seem yourself into
that or something so I think so the
abstract level of that question is how
do you
manage the time and resources to do
slightly risky stuff I think it's kind
of the abstract version of our question
there's numerous answers which I'll
share with you over a beer but i'll
share with you the easiest one get
external funding either talk to existing
sponsors of the project go to people
like the European Commission who are
constantly looking for projects which
meets our guidelines talk to the
National Science Foundation in the
United States do the same thing because
what that will inevitably get you do is
the financial resources to then take
some of the burden of the subsequent
work you can basically pay some of your
developers to do the work that they've
been doing forever as a job so you free
up more of their time to spend on the
project and things like that so I'd
suggest what are the easiest ways from
the project manage management
perspective of getting into Rd early on
is to get external funding to help free
