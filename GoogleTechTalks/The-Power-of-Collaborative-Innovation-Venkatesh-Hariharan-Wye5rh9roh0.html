help in some small way but I think it
takes a lot of energy and effort to keep
at the struggle there was a lot more
about this pretty interesting stuff and
it actually has a huge impact on lot of
things that all of us do we don't
realize it but it does so maybe I let me
thank NPR in the dominating team are
further from your policy payment they
need to put inviting me good my name is
liquidation most people in the US we go
get a slinky I having a journalist
covering Insp for about 15 years and for
the last six years I've been working
with midnight I need look after the
public policy issues on the attack
basically that means I usually you know
I'm on one side of the goal so typically
it's you know there's been so empty are
myself p are being involved in the bunch
of boxing shoes the open standards by I
have been on behalf of protective order
issues like software patents in india
and i think this is so what I'd like to
do is give a brief background of why we
see so much of growth in open source
what are the implications of that for
India what we can do about it and select
country and we also do micro picture of
you look there the entire and I'd like
to start with the story with something
which has been a fascinating story when
I budget the first time the ball during
the Battle of Kalinga information now
after all that bloodshed and violence he
gave up he gave up violence and he said
that I will have to do a penance for the
number of people that have been killed
like the violence that I have inflicted
upon society so what he did this he went
across all economy right defends to bars
and different city converted to Buddhism
he used to go to alter and one st then
mr. parson at every one st that he went
he would donate a lot of money and he
was extremely generous because
the richest wealthiest person in the
world at one point in his super he left
just one he would like people ask you
why is it that you you know you who have
been so generous why is it that you have
not really shared much at this
particular one has to be so he said the
month to us the the head of this
particular manasa team wasn't any
Burnett person but he did not share this
knowledge with others so to me there are
certain interesting things about you
know what the wisdom of Ashoka and our
digital age because if you look at what
you did he actually had to fight for
land and final property but I think you
also realize the value of infinite it is
knowledge and the difference between
finite property is that the more you can
you find share it with us sharing
finding property red line etc is a very
different difficulty but sharing
knowledge is something that is extremely
easy in fact it's probably also you
could say that you know a moral
imperative when you look at society in
fact I think most of us in India we are
kind of energy of growing up at least
you know in my particular case as I was
growing up I learned this is also the
other than I which said that how
wonderful is your gift of knowledge the
more you share it the more it grows the
more you hold it the more it declines
and if you look at the open source model
if you look at you know and if you
compare that with trainer typical
propriety models of knowledge creation
this huge differences that we see if you
look at the open-source licenses for
example in the general public license
which is the most popular license and
then you can compare that with a
proprietary software licenses you will
see a massive amount of difference so
the general public license has four
freedoms the first freedom is that you
have the freedom to modify the source
for you have the freedom the freedom to
you know look at the source code improve
upon it so basically if you look at
licenses of the open source community
you see that these licenses are
basically designed and structured around
your freedom and you are to protect your
right to share knowledge if you look at
proper
any software licenses like that of a
particular word processing package you
will find that it says that you do not
have the right to modify the software
you do not have the right group of it if
there is a technical drawing the
software you do not have the right to do
anything you have to depend on the
manufacturer of the software now if you
look at what's been happening globally
because of the general public license
because of the legal framework or open
source what you see you like linear
stuff works in September 90 91 put out
10,000 lines of source code and a period
of fears people said okay you know you
have built this doesn't really exist I
wanted to modify even adapt that for
some other particular platform so one
bunch of people in over the last 18 19
years about thousands of volunteers have
contributed to the source code of limits
and the port base of Linux and can you
take a guess as to how many lines of
source code there is in an average linux
distribution today in September 1991 it
was about ten thousand nights of source
code so any guesses on how many lines of
source code there is it not just the
linux kernel but it had typical linux
distribution likes a fedora 13 million
you can keep going a little higher
anybody wants to take another guess give
me a couple of sizes maybe the lady is
there 30 million i want to hire this may
be one in the back give me another yes
so here's the thing you know in
September of laughing 2009 there was a
study for estimating the source for
source code of linux and excitement the
average distribution which is basically
this time does hint of Federer's the
base contains 284 million lines of
source code so think about it ten
thousand lines of source form in
September 1991 204 million lines of code
in September
right now just think of a project we
know the thing too also the fact that an
operating system is an enormously
complex body of knowledge it's probably
the most complex IT project that it can
actually become because you look at the
colonel you look at the amount of
hardware elements that it has to
interact with look at the amount of
software elements that it has to
interact with now how did such an
enormously complex body of knowledge get
created and what are the implications of
that for society so let's keep limits
for a minute aside and let us sleep a
little body of knowledge wikipedia
September two-thousand 10 any guesses on
how many increase there are let me keep
you get ready tens of million yes but
nobody wants taking is 74 I think I have
no secular expectations too high so the
last day tech triples about you know 13
million entries and 275 languages of
them so just think about data from a
standing start in 2001 you now have 30
million entries in in 275 languages so
wikipedia has become one of the largest
you know reference point and the
knowledge repositories in the world and
if you get so I what I'm trying to do
here it's going to come back to what are
the factors that are driving this kind
of a knowledge creation ah so I am going
to take a flashback into you know
seventeen hundreds and in seventeen
hundreds the London Phil illogical
society they said that we want to create
additional and v1 at data and external
to be an invasion of all the words in
the English language so telling that
particular point in time most
dictionaries were random compiling it so
there would be a great guy likes a
Samuel Johnson and he with all his
knowledge
all this wisdom you'll be able to
compare when we see a maximum of twenty
thousand words so the london zoological
society said that at dicks tiny has to
be a compilation of all the words in the
English language and the only way to do
that is that you actually have a
volunteer effort where people Japan and
content and everybody wins in and then
there is a team of editors who you know
review the source review the entry and
then kind of added in voyage so does
that sound a little bit like open source
team it does right so now think about
one more thing so you know how many
years it actually took to put the Oxford
English Dictionary together so we keep
area we saw that in 13 just service
eight or nine years was about fucking
million increase so it took 70 years to
put the Oxford English Dictionary
together in fact there were people who
are actually contributors in darjeeling
and think of those days when you know
people are too there was no airway
nothing like that and people would send
a postcard or a vector from darjeeling
it would come down go to the ships and
then you look through the ship's you
take months and then it would be
assembled in the ewer in the UK the
whole thing would be put together so to
create the Oxford English Dictionary two
tons of written material was actually
shift back and forth and it took 17
years to put 0 utt but now if you
fast-forward to the age of Wikipedia it
took just about eight or nine layers
from Wikipedia when people scattered all
across the world you know speed of email
communication the speed of the internet
so in just about nine years you have had
13 million entries in to identify
languages and if you keep looking at
Wikipedia then I'm going to a clean
every six months keeps kind of jumping
like magical it is not kind of a linear
progression it's more like a you know
the more and more people who use
Wikipedia of the more valuable it
becomes the more valuable it becomes the
more people party to go to so it's kind
of a virtual cycle so if you come back
to the next like that will i if you say
one of people who are using goodness in
the last eight or nine years we have
seen some remarkable changes
if you says go to say the top 500
supercomputer list it's quite stunning
because for the last four or five years
have been following that and the NEC wat
simulator was the last proprietary
supercomputer at the top of the
supercomputer list that was about four
years ago so good if you look at the
let's take a random Ian out of the top
five mins of the computers how many of
those are actually running on the next
any guesses 1 150 years old you are
saying he 500 340 446 how many are
running windows five so so question I
what is driving these days whatever
factors that is finding so much of
innovation so much has changed so much
of technology development so much of you
know impact on society one of the facts
in living when I'm sure the people here
at Google must be the most familiar with
this is that if you look at the Internet
how many people how many people are
connected to the Internet how many
people are connected to the yes in
another two years well I think it's 1.4
million in another 600 million more
adaptive in it which same notes mobile
yes which basically means that there
will be 2 billion people connected to
the neck now think about practical 2
billion people connected to the neck
what is the population of the word
one-third of humanity is connected to
each other never in the past have we had
such a massive collaborative platform in
the history of it if you look at the
reference it is a one-to-one kinda if I
am talking to Andy I cannot talk to
anybody else but if you look at say a
broadcast technology like television
it's a very command and not going there
definitely kind of a network but you
have never in history had such a large
massive peer-to-peer the defendant work
so to identifying kind of put an update
on say Facebook or if I add something to
my blog I as an individual
castor so you've never had this kind of
a power of technology anywhere I am on
flickr for example you know one of my
favorite application name you see for
example require that you can create such
narrow slices of communities if you say
that you know you create a community
only for yellow colored flowers you see
that 700 people are there on that
communities that kind of the power will
never possible with you know pick red
colored flower there is another 700
people northeast India hiking there's
another eight hundred of thousand people
so this kind of ability to create
communities is kind of ability to share
knowledge the kind of ability to
manually add to a growing pool of
knowledge has now been there before in
history of mine and this has you know
this is probably the most fundamental
difference between the previous century
and heart surgery the way we can take
knowledge share it splice and I said in
my blew up on it and it has got huge
implications for India and partly I
think that is what is he really the most
fascinating thing for me to kind of be
in it in black my interest in
open-source basically started here in
background because in two thousand i was
teaching at a tutelary bangalore editor
we had started a non-profit funding
clinics and the objective of influence
was that we take the limits and you know
when user interfaces in indian languages
on top of that if you look at India for
example four hundred million people
speak Hindi but how many you know that
point in time clever new software and
even see available for the people so
today until all the work that of the
last ten years people have done we have
actually localized Linux to about 17 or
18 Indian languages we have also had you
know countries like butta and Iran and
others to you O Christ for their native
languages now if you look at the corpus
of Linux this 204 million lines of
source code that has been created the
commercial value of that is estimated to
be ten point eight billion dollars if if
same in fee or a TCL sore ni PMO's
we was contracted to write 204 million
lines of source code that is what the
commercial cost of that will be what we
are doing is taking a platform which is
what that 10.8 million dollars and then
willing or not so when we are creating
Indian language user interfaces we are
building on top of a platformer that is
already tried and tested and proven I
ditto we are I in value do that so the
localization that we do add some value
on top of that platform were 10 wide
range vision of this I don't know how
much value rehydrate but you know we
can't quantify them but when somebody
acts marathi interface interface another
interface it keeps adding to that pool
of knowledge that has been created and
the value keeps kind of you know
multiplying and for us when we were
looking at localizing lyrics I intention
was not so much to popularized linux our
intention was how will we take Indian
language computing to the masses and
when we looked at the landscape we
looked at you know PSV and other
platforms and bs he was in a while it
was open so it was not a spell operative
limit see movie you like extremely
collaborative end of a platform and we
said okay let's take linux as the base
and build on top of that and one drink
at one can generally obviously you know
if we had gone to the proprietary
software vendors it well then we want to
limit localize your operating systems
first of all they would not even have
entered a Venus and second thing is that
even if he had localized appropriately
platform like windows how do we capture
the value of it you know we wanted the
value to go to society but if you had
localized or double the proprietary
platforms of value would have gone to
the vendor object or a platform today
what we do is we take this software that
we let me share it freely we kind of
distribute that freely so we don't
really have to worry about your who is
capturing written the value much to
subtracting that we wanted to belong so
there's a general sort of feeling that
bsd is much more for myself then let us
write linux actually gives you a lot
more constraints so what is your
personality technologist yes ok number
or whatever I if I have to give
off to her away yeah license license
yesterday was easy is we when we moved
in to keep your license we found that to
be more interesting or more you know
properly for our objectives because we
wanted to ensure that you know anybody
who had your space what we do in fact
that is I think the beauty of the of the
GPL license if anybody who builds on top
of our work also does it share and share
alike and so they are also kind of
freely share the knowledge that we have
leave so we didn't want to use their
licenses where you know it could be
taken up into a private road in you know
native so that that's why you wanted to
kind of stick to GPL and I think that
was in retrospect the right choice so so
basically if you look at the internet I
think that is where you know you see so
much of what you will see one of the
interesting things about this is that i
have given you examples of IP you have
the software industry are given you an
example of content now the thing is what
are the if you try to abstract the
principles of open source what are the
fundamental principles are open source
the one in first one is collaboration
obviously if you do not have thousands
of people across the world collaborating
with each other you cannot have
knowledge artifacts like Wikipedia or
hair or elements Aria in OpenOffice of
these kind of open source tools so
collaboration is one of the first ones
the creation of communities learn people
across the world finding each other and
creating communities of common interest
and the third one which is like a very
different very unusual if you compare it
would be you know the other licensing
models or other models is the shared
ownership of knowledge so let's say with
open source tools neither you nor I
trend among the knowledge it's something
that is everybody's property it's
something in the comments and the model
of open source the model of
collaborative innovation in open source
it is going to create more of
collaboration
more knowledge that belongs in the comp
list let me give an example so any of
the thing is for the collaboration
community the shared ownership of
knowledge if you look at these three
principles there is nothing that is
specific only to the software industry
or to the content industry so one
example is the open-source banasthali
project of the government of india so
the he sends council for scientific and
industry said that the typical cost of
creating a track and bringing it to
market is about 1 million jeans now how
do we how do you think you know
medicines for said problem like
tuberculosis if you aggregate the entire
market for tuberculosis medicines that
inner market is just about your three
hundred million dollars all across India
so you need to find different methods of
creating clucks you need to do different
kind of technologies so what did it is
like they said let us find the open
source model and they created the open
source this w project which is kind of a
30 or 40 million dollar project funded
by CSI and which is under the Ministry
of Science and Technology and they got
in a whole bunch of people from across
the country and some people even from
around the world and said light lettuce
and obtain the tuberculosis bacteria and
see how we can create drugs for
tuberculosis so that project has been
running for about 11 and half years and
in the last one and half years there
have been successful in a rotating the
Google closest the G the bacteria so so
in the if they were trying to do a
propriety model for that they may might
not have been very successful or you
know it might have taken a long amount
of time but using the open source model
what they said is that we will put the
knowledge that we have online and people
will start annotating it in some ways
it's like the google map description
that we had so you put some basic
knowledge out and then people keep
adding on topic and because it is open
source there is an incentive for a lot
of people to contribute to it because
there is the fact that you know whatever
you are doing is what you getting back
to society it's adding value to society
so you see that you know there is more
and more people are now
starting to talk about how do we use
open source and the open source model of
collaboration community to kind of
create knowledge that is beneficial to
society you now have too much like the
public library of science which is you
know basically a set of encyclopedia of
journals scientific journals which are
in the open domain and if you look at
the proprietary kind of publications and
scientific research papers they're
extremely expensive and if you you know
even some sometimes even the large IITs
and others may not be able to you know
effort buying a whole bunch of
scientific journals so you now have this
kind of alternative movement and you
also have these existing trends of
intellectual property and proprietary
software which kind of brings me to the
kind of challenges that we are facing
right now so over the last few years
what has been happening is that
governments around the world have been
investing a lot of money in e-governance
and if you look at India for example
with the uid database and you know the
eagerness databases and the public
distribution system databases these are
all databases returning to millions and
millions of records so the government
has been worrying about how do we govern
these databases if if they store the
data in proprietary formats like the
proprietary word processing formats etc
then the problem is that the longevity
of government data runs into sometimes
you know hundreds of years in India we
are still using land records that lead
back to four hundred years ago when
under the reign of emperor akbar raja
todar mal actually you know created a
system of maps and and we're still using
those maps which date back 400 years ago
so when you are creating a government
data the question is how do you govern
it for the next 400 years of mixed in
the 500 years because that data is like
perpetually redundant now you have
software vendors who keep coming and
going and even the most you know
seemingly indestructible software vendor
today may not be around 50 years down
the line so 50 years down the line if
you know we have stored that a time the
format's owned by those appropriately
how do you retrieve that data or you
know if the preparatory vendor says okay
I want licensure for my dream what do
you and the problem is that you know the
more and more data had to keep
accumulating if it is logged in the
proprietary format then the bargaining
power of that particular vendor keeps
going up because you you completely
dependent on the format of that window
so the last few years there has been a
global move towards open standards
countries around the world like Brazil
South Africa have all started to
maintain open standards and they are
saying that government formats
government data will be stored only in
formats that are publicly known people
with that people are aware of and that
has been a huge battle in India in some
ways that you can actually argue that
you know how the data is stored is
actually far more important then you
know the the software that access it
because you know we for example what we
say is that the government must mandate
open standards and it must prefer open
source because there is social benefits
to using open source but you know the
applications will come and go ten years
down the line will be using a whole
different set of application but that
the attack should be forever and one
good example is of course obviously they
should get internet you can steal today
access the very first web page that was
created by tim berners-lee in soil but
can you access what processing the data
that you created ten years ago you know
you've shifted from wordstar to
WordPerfect to poured on dost word on
windows so with every generational shift
you have lost some amount of data via is
that can you relate to that so but
actually if you look at that sort of
time scales that you have talked about
right through and find out here nothing
really has been preserved that wrong
other than line of just plain text well
land records I mean if you go through
the analog and uh you know you still use
those those landed what's still used as
of date so the land titling
stir when the maps accept are still
being the cadastral map exeter so i
think that is the problem with eagerness
you know that's a peculiar challenge of
events now if it is data that belongs to
you and me it will may not be extremely
valuable to somebody else but II
government guitar when the government
creates data and manuals it you know in
some ways it doesn't actually own that
it is actually the custodian of your
data so your birth record your debt
record your you know the it's those
kinds of data ten years down the line 50
years on the limits will still be the 11
for statistical analysis if you want to
kind of you know graph population growth
etc you need to have still those access
to that end up date so so the open
standards battle has been basically that
and you know the unfortunate thing is
that you look at the formats like
multimedia lipid formats like one person
these have all been dominated by
proprietary standards so think about one
question you know in the in the physical
world we do not pay for standards
recognize we do not pay for standards
like great adventurers so every time you
go and buy some vegetables there is no
nobody'll actually charging your
identity of say five five point five
percent or something on the using the
standards but in the digital world when
you are using standards somebody are the
early signing siphoning off some amount
of money at one point in time the DVD
standards you know half the price that
you used to paper a DVD player wash on
royalties so the Chinese used to make a
DVD players for about hundred dollars or
a period of time the cost came down to
twenty dollars and they are still paying
twenty dollars as royalties so they
would manufacture the hardware for about
$19 their profit would be one dollar and
twenty dollars was going as royalties to
organizations change in the rest so the
Chinese government and basically said
that you know they are now cover with
the policy it says that any standard
that we decide deemed to be a national
standard for China all the patrons of
so the Indian bomb you have been working
on the policy for the last three years
idea and myself but I will need we have
all been fighting on that particular
front end telling the online that if the
government's close it data restore it in
open formats must not store it in
preparatory formats and you had seen you
know huge amount of patterns some of you
how you follow if you followed the void
some will find the ev1 I think it's a
fight over unloads every country was are
all different the way we think played
out was different in a single country so
it was pretty interesting because during
you know it's an issue Microsoft
submitted a particular format to the
international standards of the rejection
and said that we want this particular
format to be considered as an open
standard there was already an existing
standard for documents called ODF and
the challenge was that there was some
elements which were open some elements
which he thought that were not open so
there were parts of that standard which
said that this must function like word
95 or something like that and how do you
kind of if you want an open standard you
cannot have those kind of references
embedded in that you cannot have
references to a proprietary product
because you should be able to take that
document and those specifications be
completely able to implement that in
your own piece of software now if it
refers to the parental product and how
do you kind of go back to that it's not
a self-referential kind of a document so
we found that out to cosmos alien months
to find it out in india in india we were
able to kind of defeat that particular
standard and say that you know there was
a bureau of indian standard summit even
said that out of out of 21 people some
15 people voted against it and five what
in flavor of it and the rest of the
world it was pretty interesting i think
suddenly at the last minute you had in
countries like Pakistan and Pakistan
become voting members of iso and
obviously voting in favor of it so what
happened in
background is like you know you can
pretty much imagine I'm so standards are
intensely political and the reason is
that anybody who controls this kind of
just imagine working with the Queen of
England controlled the English language
and charged you money for every sentence
that you spoke you would stop thinking
twice before you started asking a
question right so standards you know
look at think about you if you have to
pay for communication standards if you
have to pay for multimedia standards it
is literally a tax on human
communication and the amount of money
that you have to pay so today for
example if the government of india says
that we will put linux on desktops all
the karate schools all across the
country they can do that for free they
basically because the source code of
linux and the next distributions are
free but if you want to use the
multimedia formats if you know the kids
say ok I can't see my videos of this end
on that one desktop the cost of that
comes to the licensing costs of the
Codex comes two thousand six hundred
rupees so many people are now starting
to argue that you know that developed
countries of the West have lost their
engine services they lost their against
manufacturing IP is the now the new form
of convenient if you control
intellectual property you literally kind
of you know have the power to say that
the others are all contractors it you
know look at the Chinese for example
what they are doing is there now they
are working on a plan to get some 10,000
different standards of living if you
look at the political battles around
standards the reason the standards right
in the so intensely political is anybody
you control this kind of it is the king
once you control the standards you
pretty much control everything so
Chinese are saying that your telecom
standards we will create up and we have
the market muscle to load it up to
hundreds and thousands of customers all
across time if you look at the
communication standards if you look at
things like wimax etc they are saying
look at me as if
right within our own standards so these
are kind of issues that we are facing
and as a related issue with the
standards as that of software means and
the open source community usually what
happens is we kind of share the
knowledge but the problem with software
makers is that well I'll kind of back
off illness of the old patent system
when we when it was created the idea of
the patent system was that the innovator
will basically declare his innovation
and tell you that you know this is how
we created it because what used to
happen during the industry that I was
that a lot of inventors went to the
grave and then you know whether when the
Creator is spinning wheel or something
like that that end time in my innovation
actually created recreated from scratch
so that knowledge was being lost to
society so basically the policymaker
said that instead of having to knowledge
loss to society we create a system of
paintings where you tell us what is the
method and the working process of this
particular machinery and in return for
that we grant you a 20-year movie now
question is do we need hair strand of
monopolies and software if you look at
some of the largest innovation and the
technological in orda stories and the IT
industry well many one came at like
three nineteen eighties if you look at
say word processing it was a bit i think
the item 8 invention you could send the
IT industry was the spreadsheet because
it basically enables you to do something
which you could not do in the physical
world if you look at the IT industry lot
of the stuff we do is actually a
replication of what we do in the
physical world searching for information
etc but with wordpress is where you are
able to do something which is quantum
leaks Adam what you could actually do in
the physical world so that would
probably be having you know you could
say that one of the best in duration but
that innovation happen without the fit
in protection all these people who argue
in favor of IT basically say that you
know without an ID they will be later
which then the question to ask us how is
it that there has been so much of
innovation in the IT industry before we
had the air of software patents
the practical problems with software
patents are also pretty huge there are
close to some 200,000 software fittings
that are filed in the US and the problem
is that software britain's not work as
properly if you cannot identify what are
the boundaries of a particular blatant
how do you ensure that you are not
violating it today people you're right
ecommerce software and online shopping
tools that close to 5,000 patents on
e-commerce they're close to some 11,000
returns on online shopping and if you
want to if you are you're writing in
e-commerce application you think that
you will be violating some of these
freedoms in the US it will cost you five
thousand dollars to get a legal opinion
on one of those fittings so how do you
kind of you know spend multiply that
across you know all the patents that are
there so software patents has become a
huge challenge for the software
developers around the world and that's
kind of one of the arguments that will
be put forth with the generated office
and in 2005 the government said that you
nailed on the truck that came up with a
fitted amendment act and said that any
software that has a technician effect
will be protected and we went back to
the government exit that there is no
software that does not have a technical
effect so the whenever we had a big
fight with the government and then
finally it was rolled back and you know
this like that okay it the law now see
is that come from mathematical
algorithms business methods and computer
programs per se cannot be bitten tit so
now the fight is on how do you define
Percy so say to them finally we fought
that a movement and then ensuring a fuel
so we knew that this person is going to
be like a very dangerous kind of a back
door and in 2008 the government came up
with operating manual and guess what it
said it said software how does a
technical effect can be built into it so
he gave the example of image processing
algorithm thing if that processing
algorithm is better and more efficient
and some other algorithm it can be
predicted so he said you know went back
to the government in check this is
exactly the language that is thrown out
in the patron coming week so how can you
bring it back so then that has been
removed from the policy and but you know
the fundamental thing is that all of us
will follow the notes and domino thank a
lot of bending wins and these kind of
people basically software is and applied
for mathematics so if you cannot patrons
mathematics how can you fit in software
so these are kind of you know and then
and their religion addiction retina if
you cannot fit in software then how can
you have you know intellectual property
or IP our own standards versa which is
how the entire edifice is being in
control and even people like Andy Grove
are saying that the same time thing of
pretending and is now become like the
derivative trading industry the building
a house of cards the building you know
differences on top of things which you
know you really cannot you shouldn't be
building it's kind of the foundation of
that entire edifice itself is so weak
that it could collapse any time and if
you look at the US for example what has
been happening is that they had
extremely pro I'd be kind of a policy in
fact the u.s. is like probably the most
liberal I feel your software patents I
think country in the world and the one
person came up and said that I want to
pay attenti method of managing Methodist
which was the recent bilski case I don't
know anybody followed the whiskey case
so this was a very clean hugely
controversial case where the lawyer for
the arguing for the Bilski case like
that anything should be protectable and
that a method for managing weathers
should be patentable weather risk yeah
so so the what finally happened is that
the
that wench of the Supreme Court sat down
and actually heard that case and some of
the lawyers and some of the judges were
asking so if any method can be patented
then would you say that a method for
speed dating should be patentable and
the wire have to say yes so the idea
that and the problem from the software
industry is that unit 8 software the
software an actual prototype lying trade
secrets in the case of providing socket
it is also protected by copyright so now
the question do you actually need a
third layer of protection which is
software patents and what value does it
serve the society now in the olden days
the value of separate invoice disclosure
that you know you could look at the
baton and try to understand how a person
arrived at the particular spinning wheel
or whatever but in the IT industry who
looks at software patents do you do you
actually read a software patient before
you write a piece of software nobody
does that so what is the value of that
disclosure is zero in fact it's actually
negative because if you read a patent
and then you write something similar in
a fourth of the other damages that the
court can award the other side is
actually three times more so you
actually have an incentive not to read a
something the other problem is that see
with copyright if you write something
and I write something that is similar as
long as I can prove that I do not copy
you I am NOT a playlist i arrived at
that language on my own I am clear but
it software patents the problem is that
you have a patron of the particular
method of shopping and I have written
something independently without without
any reference to you are painted I can
still be liable for infringement and
reporters and if you take me to court in
the US the minimum custom that is about
a million dollars and the damages it
could go into three four million dollars
so i guess this is exactly the case
somebody asked me to comment on the
Oracle versus the new bill case that's
happening right now have people being
following that so if they said why don't
you comment on this specific case and my
parents kind might reply one time I mean
if the word is full of pot on somebody
or the other is going to fall into it it
may be a good little tomorrow it may be
right had day after tomorrow it may be
somebody else i mean- have returned has
been subject to so many patron costumes
Red Hat has recently sector in some
pending lawsuits all these the cost of
that is meka no it is actually in the IT
and spi endurance training eviction so
let me now kind of philosophical bracket
come back to the open innovation effect
so so you see that you know the open
source drug discovery the other tools
like Wikipedia except I you see a youth
amount of innovation happening and some
of these tools are actually valuable
ignorant of offenses it is estimated
that the economic value of Wikipedia
commercial value of experience goes to
something like seven billion dollars but
if you look at the social value of
wikipedia that would probably be
multiplied in period of seven million
into maybe 100 short analysis here is a
reasonable to suppose that we can use
and possibilities energy education and
in other areas of Indian society what
does it move to us as Indians to
universals so if it takes a nation as a
the main and say that you know we create
a knowledge encyclopedia I'm saying the
marathi gujarati punjabi and all these
languages it starts really sharing that
instead of using the proprietary model
we can actually create a model where
people contribute to creating these
encyclopedias tools etc and freely share
it if you look at the fact that you of
some hundreds of millions of students
are studying in the indian school system
if you look at the fact that they will
also need to end up use computers to be
equipped for the 21st century then how
do you kind of create a platform which
can take idea to them as fast as
possible the best way to do that is
actually
whistles right amped actually sponsored
a study done by IM manual and it's that
study found out of a very conservative
estimate if india used open source it
could save at least two billion dollars
in the next few years and there were
specific case trends so for example in
kerala the ninth and tenth standard
students are all you know today on open
source the catalan government decided
that a few years ago they said that all
the schools will migrate to open source
so the software the applications the
operating system the word processors all
the all that is being used for the eight
and nine standard is all on business and
then study found that by switching to
open so let's get at least fifty groups
and this is just two standards of
Education it isn't able to kind of
percolate down to the lower levels of
that and this is just one state
government if you multiply that across
state governments across different
standards just think of the cumulative
money that you can save eloquently one
of the projects and product and an
organization called knowledge Commons we
are working on is something value school
loomis and basically what it says is
that you know we create a set of open
source tools for education and then you
work with teachers and the students to
kind of customers like two different
standards and different state ground and
syllabus also so with that basically you
have a huge set of you know a massive a
repository of educational tools which
you can freely share so the Sampo filter
is basically that in the old model of
open source the whole model of open
source in education etcetera is
something that is an extremely powerful
model in India we are not really
invested too much in the proprietary
model and in some ways the proprietary
model might be actually a model of the
past when you can freely share knowledge
by using you know these kind of
artificial constraint you like
proprietary standards
three patents what we are actually doing
is you know in during the growth of
knowledge so if you kind of use open
standards if we kind of use open
licensing models like the GPL etc we can
rapidly disseminate knowledge all across
India and make india more of a knowledge
society much faster then we would have
done using propriety statics so I think
conclude basically I would like to say
that the John Lennon had this beautiful
song but imagine and he said that you
may say i'ma dreamer but I'm not the
only one someday you join me in the
world will be one so I think this is
open source model everybody working
together kind of brings together that
kind of a revolution and using the open
source model we could probably lead to a
renaissance of the knowledge you know he
thaws in the culture that India used to
have many thousands of music so that I'd
like to thank all of you and that I
requested I'll be happy to do so so one
question in terms of the whole
cross-licensing thing that's happening
across countries yes and it becomes very
hard for just one country to say we will
not honor software patents or soccer
fans are illegal in it within our
boundaries because then you no longer a
part of this cross-licensing richmond
and you're not part of the whole trade
free play situation across the words how
do we kind of go about that how to
stranahan jangle isn't here I think you
know the at least when it comes to
software pages what is what had happened
is that different countries are given
the freedom to decide how they want to
decide on the pages so today I think
it's probably the u.s. and Japan which
are the most permissive in terms of
grantees of the vehicles but if you look
at Europe they have a similar language
to India so in Europe they say computer
programs as such cannot be pitted india
since computer programs per se cannot be
put it and what we interpret that to
mean is that if there is any innovation
the hardware in that hardware also
contains software that ensemble has a
whole can
but software by itself cannot repeat it
otherwise what do you what people are
trying to do is write survey's of
software attach it to a general-purpose
computer and say this is Peter now and
I've seen some amazing paintings there
are patients on online auctions for
example and all it says is that there is
a buyer there is a center there is a
reading room there is be a reading
session there will be Ben said if the
bids going to X I mean these are exactly
a replica of what happens in the
physical world so how can you take it
that but the Patent Office has granted a
fitted on online online auctions so you
know the problem is that for society a
method that could have been freely
practiced has now passed off into a
private domain so so I guess bottom line
is what we are arguing is that you know
IP IP IP is not everything you there is
IP is my private property it's a private
monopoly granted buying the government
to any individual in right now freddie's
that should be balanced by the knowledge
Commons so you need private spaces like
this but you also need playgrounds and
you also need open spaces for people to
kind of play around it so you need to
have a balance between these two and I
think a lot of introspection is also
happening in the US on the old IP issues
so I think the u.s. itself is kind of
going through a bit of churning looking
at that particular nation some of these
books that are coming along have some
alarming titles of page there's a book
called fate in failure and it says the
subtitle is how bureaucrat judges and
politicians have put innovation at risk
and kids it shows that in Rome in the
pulpit rating system almost one-third of
all the patent litigation is happening
around software so there are royalties
people are getting along software else
like maybe you know one fourth of the
entails bunch of litigation and this is
not true for other industries like
chemicals it's good where you have a
chemical entity you can clearly defined
that this is my butt in software you
cannot define that you know this
so sliding it seven country to country
specific thing like me about Muslims
think about Amanjit is a question
thankee what do you think of the idea of
using patents to protect the knowledge
Commons you may have seen that recently
even mo Glenn who's the head of the
software freedom law center dangled the
idea that perhaps that perhaps at the
the issue a patent laws become so
explosive and so I p maximalists that
perhaps it's and it's time to take a
Creative Commons approach to it and
perhaps have an open innovation fund
which files patterns to protect software
and then uses that as effective manner
to protect the knowledge Commons rather
than let the momentum stay with all the
people using patterns to try and reduce
it as such because that's one idea
that's come out which is interesting and
it's particularly I know a divisive
since from dr. Mullen said it but what
do you think of that because it ties
into what was done in the area copyright
law if Creative Commons is used to
protect the Commons as such in the
public domain could the same idea paths
working patterns paths are approached on
trying to stop patent expansion is not
the right way to do it it's really
expensive way of treating knowledge
because you know I did but I in the
interim I think that is probably the
holding of operation that we have to in
such time that the system is change
whether I think it takes reforming this
system will let you know maybe another
15-20 years who knows by the time your
system changes significantly but in the
interim I think these are the kind of
methods that we will have to let me give
another example you know so I was quite
surprised to know that this reduction
here has actually predicted by the art
of linear com use very yeah and they
have greater needed exactly for the same
reason because they didn't want somebody
else to come in protected and say that
you know KW contract is the same so they
have created to the solution to the
airport a loss like that liberally you
know this is anybody can practice it but
I guess they have some stipulation that
you know it's all
this is it people were training from
there this can practice that but isn't
that I guess the prior art should
invalidate that pattern this is
something that was probably not since
the Vedic times would be you know I
reverse quite fascinated with your match
so I think what you're suggesting is the
right thing in the sense that case for
the derivatives such time that we have
significant bit in reform across any
other tracks thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
