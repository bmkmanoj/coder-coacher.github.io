and had been a professor at the
University of Reykjavik and done a
couple of startups he's a very broadly
knowledgeable security person as you'll
see but also one that is interested in
applying the newest things to make a
difference in an extremely important
domain because we all know there are
significant security concerns on the
internet broadly he'll be talking about
the intersection of how security and
cloud computing fit together which is
exactly the bridge we want as we move
from cloud computing in the main agenda
into security offer thank you thanks so
maybe I'll start by talking about
security research at Google since I
actually joined into Google research and
so people have asked me multiple times
already since yesterday so what's the
difference between research and the rest
of Google and to be fair really there
there isn't much difference so Google
has a very integrated research and
development sort of environment and so
both in all of the product groups the
infrastructure and and other groups
there is actually what one would think
of as research there's also a security
group and Eric gross leads that and
we'll give a talk this afternoon and
there's lots of advanced work there on
security privacy cryptography and so so
if there may be within Google research
the difference would be slightly longer
term focus more external collaborations
although there's a lot of those already
from our researchers and there's over
100 or just about 100 publications that
are on the research website and security
and a lot of those are in collaborations
with external parties so the eventual
goal of trying to look longer term is
that security is not exactly where we'd
like it to be and so it's worthwhile to
try to actually attempt moving sort of
taking a slightly larger step forward
and so on that I'm going to talk about
security and cloud computing and I feel
kind of embarrassed because I just
joined google recently and so unlike a
lot of the people here I have and the
people that will be giving talks
afternoon I have not been working on
this exact topic security for cloud
computing for a long time unlike Andrew
Fox I haven't actually built real
massive skin systems that serve millions
and millions of users but I'll try to
give some perspective at least and and
maybe starting with sort of how how is
this different from what comes before
and of course their habit has been large
infrastructure and plans for large
infrastructure multiple times throughout
the years starting with maybe multics
but even earlier time-sharing systems
and there were also been online
communities starting with systems like
the play-doh teaching network in
Illinois in the 70s and all the way
through bulletin boards and multi-user
dungeons and and CompuServe this is an
ad for socializing over the Internet or
actually not the internet but over the
compuserve network from 1983 feels quite
appropriate for what people like to do
today or is cloud computing really maybe
more similar to scientific computation
large data centers lots of machines and
lots of important data that's being
processed that needs integrity
guarantees etc and so in trying to
resolve this in my own head and trying
to figure out so what is cloud computing
security looked a little bit at the mist
definition of cloud computing and also
was at an ice at workshop a couple of
weeks ago where this was sort of a
recurring motivation and so the NIST
definition of what is cloud computing
really feels quite similar to what one
would think of as scientific computation
so it's these very scalable network
services these massive capabilities and
then you have good access to them and
the access is metered or controlled in
some way and there's a categorization
into software platforms and
infrastructure but but overall it's very
much a infrastructure like definition
and a lot of the thinking has sort of
been in in that vein although security
is perceived as a top obstacle and so
maybe coming from the outside I'm a
little bit more naive than people have
been working for a long time on the
infrastructure but to me what seemed to
be sort of maybe more interesting where
the existing very successful cloud
services what one can really think of as
being cloud things like Gmail things
like the YouTube bloggers even the image
sharing and Picasa and so on and so
there I observed that there's various
commonalities that seem to be sort of
more to the line of thinking where I
would think that cloud would be and and
how that touches on security and the
first one is is the really strong focus
on users and data so so cloud being
really about following focusing on the
user and moving data that previously sat
on various devices or in homes and sewn
into ubiquitously accessible cloud
services where they can also be more
easily shared even when you have very
large or complex data items where they
can be more easily maintained up to date
at the very latest fresh coffee so
instead of having multiple email boxes
in various places that you have to
synchronize and so on there is one of
them and where you also have more
reliability because unlike any one of
these devices where you had where might
might have a copy of the data and that
might somehow get lost you actually have
multiple copies and redundancy in the
cloud of course this centralization of
user data cannot be done without giving
the users control of that data and
google has been very good at doing that
and dealing with the issues and privacy
authentication and public policy and
we'll hear more about that this
afternoon this logo is from the data
liberation front of that if users give
data into these cloud services they
should be able to take them out and
permanently take them out now of course
there is the massive scale which we also
heard about this morning and so to
actually you utilize all the world's
information well all the world's
information is getting larger all the
time now a lot of it is is video so as
every single device out there
seems to have a video camera in it and
videos are very large so every the
infrastructure needs to get larger and
larger and larger so Jonathan Smith in
this i SAT study for him from upenn had
a very nice sort of term for what one
really would like one has a short query
and an infinite data sort of in the back
end so you have a very easy way to
express this simple query you want to
make and you have this infinite data set
that that's infinitely available and and
and fresh and so on and you want fast
answers that are correct and up-to-date
even when machines fail and machines
will eventually fail without doubt and
to deal with that of course you need
redundancy but you also need redundancy
just for availability and performance as
well and since all kinds of partitions
and so on can happen you need even to
your distribution of redundancy this
redundancy is not just on the server
side it also has to be on the on the
client which really comes into the
client needs to be mostly stateless
which also helps utilizing a new client
to access your data so clients can fail
so they have to be stateless now a third
property that seems to be common amongst
all these popular cloud services is
there's really a new definition of
software where software is the first
time well as you just open that web page
you've got a new copy of the software so
maybe you had some previous version of
the software cached already so large
properties like Gmail have a tremendous
amount of JavaScript and and other code
that actually is is used to implement
them but through caching and various
other means you're always running the
most up-to-date version of that software
and this of course simplifies greatly
management you don't have any
applications to install or remove or
maintain up-to-date so even on the
desktop as we'll see in a little bit
we're actually getting to this point
where you're always having the most
up-to-date version which of course helps
with security vulnerabilities making
sure that any fixes for those are
actually in it also helps for all kinds
of randomized experiments and
instrumentation it helps with
fail stop error handling because the
clients are actually stateless or even
in the server you have redundancy and
you also have statelessness you actually
have all of a sudden this very draconian
measure if you think something is wrong
actually can do that you can roll out
new versions incrementally etc so as a
final sort of going back to the user the
there's really a new user model of what
is software what is an application and
so as a user picks one of the hundreds
of thousands or even millions of
applications to use at this particular
time on their device they're really
interacting with a single user device
that may be running multiple
applications but each of those
applications on that local device is
relatively isolated so they can
communicate through the cloud but within
the local device up until this point in
the different implementations of this on
phones on in web browsers and so on
local communication is actually not that
easy so so this is actually very
different from the time shared
multi-user systems of the past so
there's really a relatively fundamental
change especially when coupled with the
malleability there's this very dynamic
nature of software and and the scale of
the backend cloud services so that's
sort of my short summary of what is is
cloud computing so is a particular point
of view but I think especially this
notion of the different application
model that's that's really a big change
that's happening and I'll get back to
that later now what are the challenges
here and and so in all of the existing
large-scale infrastructures be they
bulletin boards or muds or even games
Lords you always have security problems
and commonly when you have users you
have the same security problems again
and again so people would hack into
bulletin boards to for various purposes
people would cheat at games etc so when
you have users when you have something
to gain you will have people trying to
actually get those games
and so that's one commonality now
actually in this new world that the
biggest new thing because there is this
emphasis on user data is is really
privacy and so they're really have to be
means for pervasive privacy protection
and and there's actually a lot of
research to be done a lot of work to be
done and on that topic and and Betsy
Masiello will tell a little bit about
what Google has done that on that in the
afternoon also Dirk Balfanz will talk
about authentication which is another
big topic so to protect the users data
you actually have to control who is
accessing it some data might be
completely public other data might be
for your eyes only other for families or
people you have chosen to share with and
what's interesting is that this
relationship has to continue for for the
long haul so so cloud services or
something where you put the data in and
you might actually keep it there for for
a long time then the final thing which
actually is sort of where I have done
most of my research is is really the
problem that software has bugs and so
one actually has to deal with the fact
the software is not correct software has
bugs those bugs should not allow
arbitrary things to happen now just
looking a little bit deeper into this so
Google has as one of if you look at the
google web pages and and and sort of
about the company one of the things
that's very prominently displayed there
is that the privacy principles and this
is very nice early in the spirit of what
alfred was talking about the setting
setting some clear objectives and then
working towards them and the first one
is simply that any information that's
brought in it's actually utilized to
create value for the users so so
collection of information is not just
there because it's actually there to
bring valuable services to the users and
all of the processing and utilization of
that information is in accordance with
the highest laws and and and privacy
standards in the sort of state of the
art practices the user is aware of what
data has been collected so making all of
the
information transparent and they have
choices they can take the data out they
can delete it they can move to another
service provider in particular they can
chose choose to have certain data not be
collected etc and then finally because
the data is there it's in massive data
centers and so on a lot of effort has to
be put in place to protect it so to the
question that Emmett asked earlier about
is data actually lost so absolute
emphasis has to be taken to actually
protect the users data so on the next
sort of these three points privacy
authentication and software security I
was struck when actually going through
making these slides that some of the
longest relationships that I've actually
had in my life had been with cloud
service providers because I got you know
so they so I was realizing that sort of
about 15 years ago I opened these email
accounts and they've been accumulating
information since then and so really all
that's protecting that information from
being deleted or from having you know
some bad access is somebody getting a
password so that actually we have to
work on on improving that and we have to
work on making sure that we really have
strong guarantees both about losing the
data but also but who is accessing it
and so on the the integrity and
availability and I might have an
accident I might not remember one of
these passwords I sometimes have
difficulty remembering them when I don't
log into some of the early cloud
services that I became a member of so I
have to struggle so so maybe one day
I'll forget that password so as to be a
mean for accounts recovery but that
cannot then be a means for getting other
people's data so i thought that that was
sort of an interesting observation but
so to the sort of point where I actually
know what I'm talking about and where
I've actually done research and which
will be sort of the most of the rest of
the talk is software security and
software security really stems from the
fact that computers don't obey people
Computers obey software and you don't
really know what this offer is doing you
don't know how it's written you don't
know what behavior may be induced in the
software for any given set of inputs
certainly even the best friend and most
benign software will have some bugs and
care has to be taken to actually
constrain what can happen despite those
bugs and and so even the most basic
questions like what software are we
running is this a particularly known
that piece of software what's going on
right now is that really what should be
happening if if something bad happens
can I get my data back so those are all
traditionally extremely hard questions
to answer and so one of the things that
Google has been working on is actually
to try to make those questions easier to
answer in various means and so I'm going
to focus a lot of the rest of the talk
on on that so so really improved
security in particular for the clouds
client and I'll sort of explain why I
focus on the cloud client so the data
center we control we have very good
people we have lots of very good people
you'll meet many of them this afternoon
and we sort of have a handle on what's
going on there it's a state state of
affairs is is relatively good
comparatively so so this is actually
some slides that i took from brad chen
who gave them sometime last year and so
the client is messy and there's a lot of
sort of bad elements the rule of law is
is not all that it should be maybe so
you have you don't really know whether
your machine is part of a botnet
controlled by somebody trying to send
spam or for other nefarious purposes and
you don't really know where information
is going there's no real strong
guarantees about privacy etc so it's
worth trying to really change that and
so going back to this notion of actually
the way applications and software works
is really
changing quite rapidly you have these
locally isolated applications that are
connected through the cloud and so
instead of in time sharing where you had
multiple users and so on on the Android
phones user accounts it runs linux so
it's sort of on that legacy of
multi-user operating system but it uses
the user accounts for different
applications so it's really application
accounts it's not user accounts and this
is partly because applications really
should have different rights the right
to access email services and potentially
update your valuable cloud information
should not be given to a particular game
etc so a lot of the work that Google has
done is very impressive at least to me
when I was outside Google is on the
chrome web browser and so it's fast it's
simple and it's secure and it really is
is quite an improvement sort of the aim
was for a fundamentally more secure web
browser and I think to a large extent
that has been a success and it's also
influenced the other main browser
vendors so it's an open source project
so so everything is pretty open chrome
google chrome is is really the packaged
instance from google and the the basic
security story of the architecture of
chrome is is really to move the
expectation of the user closer to
reality and actually move reality closer
to the expectation of the user by having
sort of a more read-only experience of
the internet so so when you visit a web
page arbitrary things should not
basically happen so you have this green
border here around all of the activity
related to going to this web page and so
all of the effects should be contained
within that green border sandbox and
there's various other technologies that
are implemented in in chrome as well
phishing and malware blacklists and and
so on and they've been really leading
and security features one of the things
that they've been leading in is actually
making software updating faster and so
it's interesting to note that according
to some public statistics that I saw ten
percent of web browsers users of web
browsers right now are running saw a
vision of a browser that really started
in 2001 so
might be running an up-to-date version
of the latest release version but really
the running a web browser from 2001 so
chrome has a built-in auto update
functionality which downloads in the
background latest version of the browser
and then next time you start a new
browser instance it will actually use
the most up-to-date version so this is
relatively seamless from the point of
view of the user and it seems to really
work so here are the some some various
browsers and on Google Chrome we're
seeing that more than ninety percent of
the users are running the latest version
of the program within a week so which is
quite an improvement from running
something that was really built in 2001
which is ten percent of users right now
so and this so there was a recent recent
announcement that they're actually
moving to a six week update cycle so
this will happen every six weeks
basically that there's a new version of
the browser and then within a week you
should see a curve like this ninety
percent of users now of course this will
help with getting fixes to bugs out
there but that's not all you have to do
you also have to deal with the bugs that
you haven't fixed and there's a wide
range of mitigations and technologies
you can apply there you can randomize
the address layout you can use various
stack cookies and so on is it sort of
general term is mitigation here and
there's various things that are actually
applied there and then a new one that I
learned of only recently is for instance
not allowing instructions that perform
direct syscalls system calls from the
regions of code we're just in time
compilers like the JavaScript
just-in-time compilers puts their output
machine code but this raises the bar but
but attacks will really still be
possible so more even more sort of
strong guarantees are warranted and
that's actually where one of the really
impressive projects I think that Google
has spearheaded is making some ideas
that actually started in the late 60s
but but we're really revisited and made
concrete in the in the mid-90s on
software fault isolation to make those
ideas really reality and there's this
Native Client project which is again an
open
project which aims to make machine code
the code that really runs it on your
computer as safe as JavaScript whereas
running a new program should be as safe
as visiting a web page and so there's an
open source implementation for now three
architectures and what's important and
interesting is this really allows for a
arbitrary low level even optimized code
that uses simdi instructions and so on
for four to get really good performance
it's actually making more efficient use
of the world's computing infrastructure
in particular it allows so the
guarantees that it gives it come from
being able to see exactly what code is
those were one of those early questions
that I said are surprisingly hard to
answer like what code am i running and
Native Client actually allows seeing
exactly what machine instructions what
will the hardware be actually utilizing
and by doing that you can actually
circumscribe like if there is no integer
division instruction you know that none
no such operation will actually happen
or more to the point if there's no
debugging system call you know that no
debugging system call will actually be
executed at runtime and this comes at
some performance cost but that
performance cost is actually much less
than the gains you gain from going to
low-level code so if you try to
implement this in JavaScript or Java you
would actually have more performance
overhead and so the aim here is for high
assurance so there's both academic
papers oakland and sort of the I Triple
E security and privacy and use next
security have papers on this in the last
couple of years and there's also been a
public competition etc so I won't really
go into the details but suffice it to
say that there are slight changes into
what actually is the machine code that
executes on execute on the system this
is where the overhead comes from 2 to
some extent and in this case it's really
just making sure that when you're
jumping around in bytes that actually
determine behavior that you have a
certain alignment property that you know
you're actually going to a 32 by the
lines block and those are the blocks
that then can be stitched together an
arbitrary sequence this is a relatively
weak form of something
control flow integrity and but looking
individually these block you can
actually figure out what are the
possible machine code instructions that
might execute so why do this well web
applications we want lots and lots of
apps and the users want lots and lots of
apps and there at i/o google i/o there
was an announcement that there's
actually going to be a Chrome Web Store
where you will be able to get lots and
lots of apps and those apps might
actually come as very rich native client
applications and here are some examples
of applications that exist already I'm
not particularly thrilled about this
lego character so it's a star wars lego
character i wish there had been a sort
of more pretty one that i could find in
a screenshot but here are three example
applications that actually run at
relatively native performance with 3d
graphics in your web browser completely
safely ave as if this was an image on a
web page or at least that that's the
goal the goal is a high assurance
guarantee of that and the anatomy of the
internals of such an application is
basically as follows you have some
application in this case a calculator
actually behind the scenes it's composed
of JavaScript and a red module which is
contained by the Native Client sandbox
and the red module is is just purely
native machine code running directly on
the hardware now the Native Client
sandbox and this module actually sitting
within a new plug-in interface that has
been developed by google called Pepper's
oh and there's the nat goal and pepper
sort of makes sense if you think about
it in certain ways now so the javascript
component then would dictate high level
user interactions mouse input and and so
on the pepper plug-in interface which is
a new variant of the NPAPI meske plug-in
interface actually is then hosting the
rest of the program which might in fact
be most of the work happens there all of
that work happens within the sandbox and
the sandbox is really driving the
execution of these bundles of a line 32
bite sequences of machine code so with
this you can actually imagine a platform
a whole platform where you have lots and
lots of rich applications going all the
way down to the lowest layers sort of
extending this notion of trying to have
low level security that is a very rich
platform and offers good performance now
one of the things that you would want to
know there is again what code am i
running and once you get into the sort
of operating system realm of things you
actually boot computers and you would
like to know well one have I just booted
and so in the Chrome OS which is sort of
the extension of the chrome effort into
hardware that is actually going to be an
implementation that sort of for that
particular type of open consumer device
is the first one that will allow
verified boot where the very early
firmware that's on the device actually
will verify the next state of the
operating system and then that actually
will verify the final stages and the
applications etc and importantly this
will allow people to have guarantees
that even if they lose their device or
there's somebody installs the wrong
operating system or something their data
won't fall into the wrong hands so so
the data will be accessible only when
they're running the real operating
system without any root kits etc I'm
going to just speed up a little bit i'm
not going to talk about the details of
this but i'm going to go back up to the
user so all of this low level security
is not going to be very important unless
you actually have secure means of
communicating with the user and and that
really means giving the user
abstractions and ways to think about
things which are actually come somewhat
naturally but also fit with what
actually happens underneath the hood you
have to sort of remove the impedance
mismatch between various security
dialogues of asking questions do you
want to allow this strange thing you
don't really know what to do to do this
strange thing that you also don't know
quite what to do is is the wrong way of
doing things so you have to have
abstractions and mechanisms which are
closely aligned with the users models
mental models and with how things
actually work and so one of the things
that we have start
in Google research since i joined this
is actually an effort to look into those
types of secure user interfaces that
provide stronger security guarantees and
also high usability using capabilities
as as sort of the way to think about
things and capabilities have some
primary promising sort of intuitiveness
properties there also a principal
abstraction that can be distributed and
all of these cloud computing
applications are distributed and they
can go all the way to the lowest level
so with that I'm just going to finish
with a couple of slide on what are the
cloud opportunities I'm afraid I went a
little bit over time maybe so there's
not a lot of time for questions but
we'll see so the real opportunity here
that I think is changing with with cloud
computing is this new application model
this is very different software from
multi-user shared computer software
where you had a single server with
multiple users connected in trying to
protect against each other typically in
the days of the design of that software
each of those users was also a
programmer if the machine in the center
actually went down if you actually had
to terminate some processing there that
was a very big deal for potentially all
of the users in particular if there was
a shared service like the file system or
something you thought might actually be
having trouble terminating that would
actually cause everybody to suffer so we
know about planned outages and so on so
this is the new model of software is
also different from the model of
software appliance server computing in
the 80s where you had relatively thick
clients and you had again these shared
servers and if a thick client servicing
some purpose actually went away people
were not all that happy it might be
difficult to reconnect back to the
server establish the session etc might
you might lose even stayed on the server
so the new application model is really
one of logical applications that really
exists sort of in as an emergent thing
in the cloud you have millions of
applications you have billions of users
each user has lots of devices and is
running a number of applications at any
given time on those devices but none of
that really matters the applica
patients are logical so and you have
location and device transparency so
thinking of this as the end-to-end
distributed systems actually seems to be
the right way to make progress at least
from the security point of view as far
as I can tell and so important there is
the statelessness of the devices and the
malleability of the software so one can
really determine what software is
running on any given one of these
machines both in the in the background
in the server each of the servers that
in the replicated instances of this
software might actually be slightly
different might be specialized to a
purpose might have some randomized
instrumentation or experimentation
applied to it again fail stop
enforcement is actually an option across
all of these machines that provide the
logical application abstractions so and
just as a final point one thing one
could possibly do is actually to
leverage what my colleagues here at
Google have written a paper Peter
norwick and I so Peter norwick is one of
the authors on the unreasonable
effectiveness of data so when you simply
have a preponderance of evidence that
something is in a certain way you can
actually take that as the ground truth
and say conservatively I that will be
good enough to to allow all good
behavior and the example that might be
useful to think about there is the
solitaire game on windows which was
there already in windows 1.0 and has has
moved forward now the solitaire game
throughout all these years and even
today can do absolutely anything you can
do and it can do any networking it can
debug other applications it can
definitely grovel through your file
system and that's kind of wrong and it
certainly doesn't fit with this new
model of thinking about applications and
assigning rights to applications but how
do we actually figure out what the
rights are well throughout those 25
years of the lifetime of the solitaire
game it actually hasn't been debugging
other applications it hasn't been
groveling through file systems and
sending data over the network so so that
type of pre ponder
of evidence can certainly be applied to
determine those types of models but of
course there's lots of other things like
which parts of the program are slow and
buggy so it's not just for security
which parts are dead code so actually
eliminating dead code is a very
important security goal and the nice
thing here is that we can sample both
the good executions and the bad
executions and and compare and contrast
so anyway with with that I'll take
questions so that's a fine question the
a lot of security is reactive and
pattern based and so on everything that
I sort of talked about in the middle
there in particular Native Client and
chrome and so on tries to be proactive
and so tries to actually build defenses
that innately give strong guarantees now
you may still have zero-day attacks but
you will have switched where they might
occur if you really have strong
guarantees then you will know that
they're not zero-day attacks that are
violating those particular guarantees so
so that's one way of answering your
question is try to actually have strong
guarantees in in some areas and and at
the level of the machine code simply
knowing that execution proceeds via a
sequence of 32 byte bundles it's a very
strong guarantee but it's a very weak
guarantee at the same time that it turns
out that just that simple guarantee
allows you to make other guarantees as a
consequence and so starting from sort of
bottom-up is is one approach and of
course there will be zero-day attacks
because there will be security
vulnerabilities at various levels of the
system and so the you know I'm from the
Nordic countries so so there's the joke
of the the Norwegian virus which is an
ascii text message which asks you
politely to to forward to all of your
friends and then delete all of your data
and so
now oh yeah this is within the
Scandinavian countries you make fun like
that but so you will have so the
Norwegians are honest they do you know
if you ask them politely they might do
it so the but but this oral goes to show
that you will have problems at various
levels of the systems that's not a
phishing attack that's but you actually
have to take a multi-tiered approach so
any other quiz a sort of ring based
protection model yes in fact in various
oh sorry so the question was what about
multics ring layered protection models
so they had seven rings of protection
may be based on Dante or I'm not quite
sure so we're at the core there was
something very small and very secure
that you had strong guarantees from and
then as you moved further out you have
fewer guarantees and sort of more
permissiveness and I actually think that
sort of pervasively yes we're going to
see more and more of that and so back to
the sort of notion of this verified boot
as you go up the stack to mord's
applications you're actually allowing
more and more things to happen and now
multics the multics ring model was not
really a huge success in hardware and
and and so on so there have been
implementations like the 386 but
typically only use one or two rings but
actually I think we're seeing more and
more layering of software and this goes
back to the talked previously about
layered storage services that each level
of those layers you need guarantees
because you're allowing more permissive
behavior above you so yeah
so I think eventually if you look at how
a lot of those things are used you
actually have applications that look
very much like what I was describing
running on top of those back-end
services so but I guess there's a number
of things you actually need to do when
you're running back end services in
general and there are some new things
that are exposed when you tried to
resell like Amazon does those back-end
services and that's sort of in the NIST
definition of things but there's there's
not a whole lot of new security
challenges there that I could identify
so so I'm guess that sort of has to
suffice I think yeah okay yes right so
it may be back to these sort of you know
what's the real change here right having
infrastructure that you can run on is is
a change but it's somewhat it's a new
form of the centralized multi-user
computer that we actually have been
using since the 70s or the multics
security model you have a centralized
service you have lots of parties using
that server with maybe you know
different interests and you have to do
this securely so so there's been a lot
of work in that field I think this new
application model and the focus on the
user actually is a bigger change because
it fundamentally redefines what is
software how does it work in a way that
hasn't happened before so I think we
actually should go and have lunch
