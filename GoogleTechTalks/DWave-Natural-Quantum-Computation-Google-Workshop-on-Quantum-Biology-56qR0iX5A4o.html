the speaker list until last night at
about 10:00 p.m. so I've just put
together a very short brief introduction
to what we're doing and the some of the
philosophy behind the the approach that
we've taken I'd also like to thank him
for that introduction this morning I
think it was in some ways very moving
you know I think that it's a specially
of coming from the condensed matter
theory side you see quantum mechanics
everywhere and in the world at large and
especially in biology people ignore it
and I've never understood why I mean
even this is segregation between the
seemingly trivial and the things that
are a higher level expressions of
quantum mechanics I don't understand
that division myself because if you
asked the question what about this thing
could be the same if it was classical
the answer is nothing because electrons
in matter as we know it doesn't exist
it's not calling mechanical there's some
essence at the very bottom of all of
this that you requires quantum mechanics
and I have never understood why people
draw dividing lines between behavior at
the electronic scale and behavior at the
macro scale because sure there may be
dividing lines there may be areas where
a system may be modeled classically but
you can't pretend that the thing is
classical it's not nothing is classical
under the hood everything is quantum
mechanical and so you have to be open to
the possibility that the things that you
care about as a scientists or as a
builder of things can be made better
more efficient or have to understand you
have to understand how these things work
in order to make progress
so this theme is explicit in the
exercise of trying to build quantum
computers because in some ways quantum
computers are this idea made manifest
that you want to somehow amplify the
behavior of the world from the
electronic scale or the the
the scale of the very small and very
cold up to a level where large hot
macroscopic things such as humans can
can play with these things and and and
make them do things that we find
interesting
like solve hard problems so I'm going to
talk about one such effort which is the
one that we've been involved in for some
time now so d-wave is a is a private
company it's been around for about 11
years and we only do one thing and that
is build superconducting processors so
these are processes that are fabricated
out of metals in particular metal called
niobium run at very cold temperatures
designed to embody a very specific
quantum algorithm which is this quantum
annealing thing that Hartman referred to
earlier on so these things are not
Universal quantum computers for those of
you who are familiar with the field
they're not gate model quantum computers
which is a particular type of quantum
computer there are another way of
looking at how you would use quantum
mechanics in order to compute something
useful in the world it's a fairly small
effort as these things go but we do have
some unique infrastructure including
what's commonly believed to be the most
advanced superconducting chip
fabrication effort in the world which is
run by Eric who's sitting back there so
if you want to know anything about
superconducting chip fab he's arguably
the world leading expert in all this and
it was his what something like the crown
jewel in our efforts our ability to
fabricate these things efficiently and
quickly has differentiated this effort
from a lot of others so I'm just gonna
very briefly talk about where we got to
where we are over the last 11 years and
there's really two phases to this effort
and I think that this model of how we
did this applies to all sorts of basic
science commercialization exercises so I
think it's relevant to this group so if
you have something that is inherently
involving a huge basic science concept
or concepts and you want to bring it out
into the
world this is a path to doing that that
has been very effective for us and I
think there are some lessons to be
learned for others so the effort is
differentiated in two phases the first
phase was one where there were some
conceptual notions about how you'd
proceed to build a quantum computer back
in 1999 and there were the first vistas
of experimental data that suggested that
you could actually build components of
these things in the lab that had
something like the properties that you
wanted but back then this was like
imagine the task was to map the entire
us the area that had been mapped with
this tiny little hundred square meter
area right next to where the ship landed
so there were some things known about a
very tiny amount of the types of things
that you'd need to build one of these
systems so being young and foolish me
and a bunch of other people in the early
days felt that it was a worthwhile
endeavor to try to map more of this
territory so we wanted to understand
what was known and what was doable not
just in principle but in practice it's a
very important point I'm going to come
back to about all of the different areas
that you need in order to really build a
computer so quantum computers or
computers and the way that I look at
them is they're more computer than
quantum and that's not the way that most
people in quantum computing view this
field the quantum for them is a capital
Q in the computer as a little-little see
for me it's the other way around the
most important part about building a
computer is building a computer and this
is this is not just semantics it flavors
the entire philosophy behind this
project so we entered into a bunch of
research agreements for the with
universities and research institutes
around the world with the intent of
trying to answer some of these questions
about what was doable in principle here
in practice so that went on for a while
until it became clear that the the
original vague conception of how this
would all turn out which was that
someone would try to build a quantum
computer for real and that we would
somehow
be involved or help this effort along
that was not going to happen no one
really seriously tried to build one of
these machines and they still happened
being just being realistic about the
amount of effort that's required in
order to really build a computing system
I mean imagine even a conventional
silicon processor a might like the cell
chip it required billions of dollars of
investment and in some ways that's just
an incremental step over what was
already known it was it so-called
engineering project there's nothing like
that in quantum computing even the
effort that we've put into this which is
in the sort of hundred million dollar
range is nowhere near the effort that
even a single semi new semiconductor
chip gets so the scale of effort that's
required to do this is not being
invested by anyone for good reasons but
anyway so what we wanted to do was to
try to implement an idea because we
didn't see any value coming from this if
somebody didn't do it so we figured why
wouldn't we again we were young and
foolish back then so what we decided to
do was use the knowledge that we gained
to try to understand was it actually
possible given the limited resources
that we knew that we'd have to try to
build a quantum computer and the idea
was to focus on architectures that were
extremely tolerant to the types of
faults that you get in the real world so
when you build a semiconductor chip or a
superconducting integrated circuit you
have to deal with the real-world
consequence that not all of your devices
are going to be the same that they're
going to be variations across a wafer
across a chip not every two qubits is
going to be identical you're going to
have to deal with the issues that
there's going to be defects and all this
so how is your system going to work in
the presence of all of that realistic
stuff so the thing that we've ended up
building isn't is is not the be-all and
end-all of quantum computing in fact I
think it's it's in some ways just a very
early faltering first step but this
effort and things like this are required
to get to this future that everybody in
this field dreams will some
happen which is that we have control
over nature at such a fine level that we
can start exploiting these things that
we can see you can take a microscope and
you can look at things and you know that
quantum mechanics is a very good model
of nature at these levels but how do you
actually use that and so this is the
very first early step on the way and in
some ways parallels some of the stuff
that we heard this morning about
photosynthesis is that it's just
beginning to dawn and the collection to
collective conscious that there are
things that you can do here for real
practically within timescales that we
care about and it's very exciting time
to be involved in the field all right so
what I'm going to do is show you what
one of these things look like so the
implementation that we use requires
cryogenic temperatures not simili kelvin
so we use machines that are called pulse
tube dilution refrigerators so these are
machines that allow you to cool a very
substantial block of stuff down to close
to absolute zero in our case somewhere
around 10 milli Kelvin the in the inside
of this metal cylinder contains an
insert which looks like this
where these circular plates exist at
different colder and colder temperatures
from the top being room temperature down
to the bottom being the near the base
temperature of the fridge and at the
bottom of this you see an assembly which
is a bunch of filters and shielding
elements and the chip itself resides
right down at the bottom now for us
there are two very difficult to meet
environmental constraints one is the one
is the temperature the other is that the
the processor type that we build is very
sensitive to magnetic fields and they
can't be anywhere near the chip so the
hard that people get amazed that the
fact that you can attempt to build a
computer that runs at 2 milli Kelvin but
that's really not the hard part here
it's much harder to make these low
magnetic fields than it is to make the
low temperatures for a variety of
reasons so we've done a lot of work on
magnetic shielding that thing at the
bottom there if you look a little closer
has something that's very much like a
motherboard upon which is mounted the
actual chip itself and remember these
are superconducting chips so they're
they're very much like your standard
CMOS based device except that now we're
talking about metals instead of
semiconductors and it exists right at
the middle there so this this see if I
can bring this thing here is one of the
chips this is a an optical photo of a
portion of one of the actual processors
and I'm going to explain a little bit
about what all this is but just to give
you some flavor these cross hatchings
are actually loops actually
topologically loose these lines are the
so-called qubits in this type of design
so this every time you see one of these
horizontal or vertical white lines that
look like lines they're actually loops
of metal and these are qubits in this
design their so-called superconducting
flux qubits the way that they encode
information is in the direction of a
current which flows around this loop so
if you imagine counterclockwise rotation
of this current around this loop
corresponding to binary state zero and
the other direction corresponding to
binary state one these things at low
temperatures are binary objects so they
can only have one of those two states
and those are the states that encode the
information that we care about so at a
higher level the way that the system
works is that all of this low
temperature physics gadgetry is
connected to the world and you can
access it remotely so all the stuff that
the experimental guys back at the lab
can do to the system you can do from
here if you could resolve the projector
issues I could show you so we're
actually sitting on one of the leaves
now and the way the thing is our key
tected it's allowed it can handle
multiple users at the same time
simultaneous experiments so the both day
of the processor I'm gonna I'm gonna be
a little bit philosophical here so the
dominant paradigm in quantum computing
is a model that arose from the computer
science and mathematics communities
largely and it is a beautiful model
which is universal for quantum
computation but it has one significant
flaw it makes assumptions about the
world that are not what you see in
nature so the natural world has a
certain way about it so when you go into
your lab and you might have a condensed
matter physics background and I think a
lot of my views if this was flavored by
this so condensed matter physicists
study real systems in the lab bulk
magnets and things of this sort where
it's simply not natural to think about
the the thing that you care about in
isolation from everything else because
almost nothing in the world is like that
all systems in nature have a thing that
you care about and they have an
environment and the vironment
significantly impacts the behavior of
the central system so the gate model
conceptually relies as a first pass on
the absence of that environmental
coupling now there are moe there are
methods that have been developed that
work in principle that allow you to
remove the effects of environments but
I've always been of the opinion that
they're not feasible in practice so I'm
gonna I'm gonna be a little bit
controversial about this and I don't
think that this particular model will
ever be built and that's not the common
theme that runs through the quantum
information community this is a being a
model that people have focused on for a
long time no but I think that this model
ignores some basic facts about the way
the world works that you cannot in
practice overcome yeah so I've listed
some of them
any of the experts in the audience who
want to debate me about this point thing
okay so back then I'd convinced myself
that this gate model was not a good
thing to try to do and so we were faced
with a decision and being ornery we
decided to do number two and the
inspiration for what we ended up doing
came from the same group that the first
speaker referenced it's based on ideas
arising from the field of quantum
magnetism so quantum magnetism study of
magnets usually at low temperatures
where the behavior of the system somehow
exhibits quantum effects and this paper
was very influential to me both as a
graduate student and and also in my
professional life at d-wave and i it's
got a lot of text on it but I included
it all because it's one of my favorite
passages from any science paper that
I've ever read and the stuff in the blue
is really the summary nugget of what we
do so the idea is that you want to build
a quantum magnet so usually in nature
quantum magnets are given to you you
have a crystal of something that has you
trium and holmium and a bunch of stuff
in it it just is what it is it's not
programmable you can go in and you can
measure things but it's not all that
useful as a computer because it kind of
does one computation that mimics itself
you know you can't program it so what we
wanted to do was take the exact same
paradigm but make it programmable we
wanted to be able to set all of the
different parameters in this thing
but otherwise make it virtually
identical to quantum magnet so I don't
have time to talk about what may be the
most interesting part of this which is
how quantum effects are used what I'm
going to do instead is I'm just going to
talk about what the thing is supposed to
do and not how it does it so what the
system does is it allows you to define
an optimization problem so this thing on
the left side is an optimization
objective function which defined over
binary variables so these s's are plus 1
minus 1 variables or you can think of
them as 0 1
this expression means that for any
particular setting of those s's i get a
number the ages and the J's are the
program for the machine so as a user of
this machine I specify what those are
and I set them to be real numbers
between minus 1 and 1 all of them so the
HS and J's are just numbers they are the
program they come from some application
or some idea about how I want to use the
system separate issue I give them to the
system and now the system's job is to
return me a configuration of all of
these s's so the settings of switches
and if everything works just so that
setting of switches will be the minimum
number that you can get so there is a
setting of these switches that minimizes
the subjective function
yeah so that's what we're looking for
almost I'm going to clarify that a
little bit just to kind of attach this
to the physics or the physical picture
of the hardware so recall I mentioned
that each of these little white guys is
a qubit
itself it's a repeating block that tiles
the plane so I'm showing them the part
of a circuit here but you can imagine
this with stretch up for a long distance
over each other this st. say I think
this cubed
this cubit has physical connections to
all of its intersecting guides so I can
couple this variable to this one dots
that I've shown our areas where you can
program this this pairwise interaction
so you can I can as a user look at every
single intersection and every single
join there and put a number on that
which is this quadratic thing I can also
put a number and it's local to every
variable that each thing on each of the
guys so my job as a programmer is to
figure out how to do that in order to
make something make sense now just a
little bit of a segue or a transition
here what you actually get in nature is
not the exact right answer every time
and this is related to the fact that
these things are real condensed matter
systems interacting with a bath at some
temperature so what you actually get or
what you would expect to get as a
realist is a distribution over these
answers so if you go back to heart MIT's
original picture about quantum annealing
any physical system that is defined by
this energy landscape this optimization
function landscape has many many local
minima and a bunch of junk in it what
you're going to expect to get from this
is a sampling from all of those energy
states you don't get the exact answer
every time and for some hard problems
you're not going to get it at all so
this is an np-hard problem it's likely
that quantum computers can't solve
np-hard problems efficiently it doesn't
matter because it's not the way we're
using this we're using it to generate
samples from some probability
distribution in the limit of zero
temperature and everything being great
you get the ground state of this
objective function which is the exact
answer but you don't really care about
that happening all the time all you want
are good samples fast so at a high level
this is actually a very simple thing
it's much simpler than a the silicon
computer it's just a lot different the
chip is a generator of probability
distributions the
you can tune as a user so those of you
who are involved in machine learning or
in pricing derivatives or in anything
that requires Monte Carlo where what
you're doing is basically trying to draw
lots and lots of samples from a
predefined probability distribution
that's what this thing does the way that
it works is you first program it by
setting these guys then you have to wait
because that generates some heat so you
let the chip cool down then you do one
of these quantum annealing algorithms
that I haven't talked about at all
then you read the thing out so every
qubit is a readout at the end that gives
you a bit string these asses and then
you repeat lots and lots of times and
every time you repeat you're drawing a
sample from that probability
distribution that you've defined so just
to give you an idea about how well this
works the thing is amazingly accurate so
the the probability distributions that
this thing generates are
indistinguishable within the errors
involved in extracting basic parameters
of these circuits like conductances and
capacitors from open quantum systems
models so we heard a little bit about
non Markovian density matrix approaches
this morning we we have to do the same
thing here when we model these systems
this is an open quantum mechanical
system you make a bunch of predictions
when you measure these in what you're
predicting are these output probability
distributions and what you see not track
exactly to the experimental data for is
the biggest systems we can simulate so
that's great so these things are working
quite well though just briefly the the
focus of the the company is on machine
learning applications and again if you
wonder it want to know why you can AskMe
on and I'd hope to be able to show you
this but apparently we've had been
having some technical difficulties with
connecting to the projector so if you'd
like to see an actual machine in action
afterwards come see me and all I'll plug
in and for you alright so that's it just
just just to summarize we have seven of
these things working now the the
generation of chips that I can show you
after
128 of these little devices and they're
they're quite highly integrated as
superconducting circuits go there are
all Hmong the most highly integrated
superconducting circuits that have ever
been built and the the next generation
is going to be considerably more complex
