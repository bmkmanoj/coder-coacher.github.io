creators oh so as some of me you know
that the you know Japanese government
actually are grants the title of super
creators to those very selected folks
and we are lucky to have you know full
super creators presenting for this tick
tock you know it is a very quick one but
we have data organization after this
talk so you know please stay you know
and ask lots of questions there so we
have four presenters our first presenter
is mr. Masato site oh and here's a PhD
candidate in media and government
governance at Keio University and he
have created very novel in 3d
visualization of the traffic network
traffic visualization software are
called a big test Network browser so
he's going to talk about that and second
presenter is tacky aqui Lucas ah
Commodus a mr. Lucas kamada he created
very arm this is also very interesting
one you know he's going to show the demo
of on-demand automatic data entry system
so please look for that the third guy is
mr. do tarot sugiyama of roy low low low
i ink and this this technology is very
interesting in two ways why is that
every it provides very intuitive editing
video editing user interface and the
other part is that it has super
high-speed video processing engine and
the last guy is a doctor tadich car or
zonal so his talk about the two
technologies wise mobile games and the
other data with them add balloon and the
first technology is very interesting
because age
converse the ordinary web contents into
flash so that the you know all the flash
capable cell phone can watch the web
pages ordinary web pages and second one
is that he talks about the technology
which allows to push up our web content
into a part of my page dynamically so
please look for that so then let me
introduce the first presenter mr. Masato
saito please and this software is the
one of the internet communication
visualizers and so it called a net net
web browser and this software does the
latter traffic visualization and also
the original and the important thing of
this software is mainly whole the
general computer users and daily use you
Victor species everyone had the pc the
seller and so since the target or will
our software is Mary hold the general
user so we try to build this software in
the simple and easy understood and
entertainment oriented policy and so our
surveys and host centric standard
applications use as the first camp and
so what can you nvidia lies the whole
general users and the users can the
first point the sea and learn the
internet activities of various
applications where they want today the
usually the internet connectivity order
a wireless connection mainly in this
room so for example that everyone has
this experience that when connecting the
wireless access point
of neighbor's home so this communication
is visible by our software and users see
and track the legal network accesses of
the earth the imagery information
leakage from applications for example
the spyware were the network dearest
attackers and the second point the may
at this point it may be but the ICT
literacy over pc users can be advanced
today is the internet connectivity is
mainly black box for general users but
by using this software users can learn
can learn and the seed intact
productivity and the third point is the
genetic activities of applications
including the person of high rolls over
the antivirus software's can be visually
check this by using this software so
univ ii either as a communication
validation communication validation
tools or what a compliance check tools
so i do the demonstration will even be
so the half of stories before that
demonstration i introduced the briefly
my software myself that view is the here
and this not p street is operating univ
ii o plating pc in this nothing and also
the this side the in the purple
rectangle earlier application icons of
the pcs users use the mail web browser
with the scape application and also that
these add green earlier is the local
area network in the green rectangle and
also that the other hand the other side
of the this earlier is the communication
correspondent
when you said the quick the web browser
so web servers over the mail service are
shown in this area so I study
demonstration this is also active unb
software this is a bill 3d view in this
time the this pc the net activity
they're all shown so now i use the did I
don't click the youth pieces but in the
background in this species the
communications done the tdma application
or the the the whole Dasha application
so when I use the creek with the web
browser o Sole it's destined for example
the oh so sad i justa sized there adjust
but his control so i click the oh I
clicked the web browser and this unb
showed visualize it that this
communication so here internet explorer
and also the web servers icon mainly the
internet connectivity is instantly shot
under the disappear so where HTTP
connection with the instantly disappear
but the example amazon.com uses creaks a
little bit slow
sir I'm a little Jake oh yeah I next
that Creek the dell website so there is
a fabric owns HTT favicons is
automatically detected there are so many
many communications than the background
users click the only website one website
but many many connectivity to the disk
machine and also related to servers so
in interest application network
application is the skype application we
click the skype application i clicked
this application so the that I log in
the oh sorry
I love in the oh I don't prick the
weblog intertext or about the website
any information sent my pieces is shown
and also that these blue icon the skype
icon so I don't I don't touch the skype
application by the skype is the minimal
activity of the internet world service
over the host so these are all of the
visualized in this application so at the
return destroyed and it and my time
cheaper we're going ok so back to this
presentation manage there are many
previous visualization servers but each
image or pictures is original service
though the solution or visualization
network of communications the character
point the mainly professional use over
the large-scale neptr it means the
larger network of the ISP networks and
also the maybe this visualization is
many how the professional use for
example the communicate computer science
research our idea de Madrid
administrator so is complex to
understand for general users the and so
our you will be positioned under I
showed so oh ok absurd IT administrators
sorry Adam straight and the downside the
general users and the left hand a light
handle less tired of the topology
visualization and the other side of the
traffic visualization previously mainly
Derrida this area is active business
over the service area
so but our target is here this yellow
lesion is undeveloped area so this
desire of a target area then also that
we have the odds as a screenshot you
will be as we called these are the skin
mother so other skiing is by using the C
motor packet shown the fish or the
goldfish right the this is the only
entertainment oriented and the next hour
architecture is mainly composed of two
components a wide the visualization and
the other is the flow analysis in a unb
everyone rest is done by the packet
capturing from network interface and
also the gathering realist processing
information so combined and also this
information incorporated visualization
component so we using the now the java
3d world and the strategy way and also
the by using this architecture I used
the US visualization component javis
instead of Java 3d flash or Google us or
the cocoa framework and also the same
thing is true through honors component
by the this information into the flow
analysis transportation networks or
something and also these are the Plaka
room so ok ok I i introduced the
security applications with our union
with software the first on the front end
visualizations of the whole virus ant
soft antivirus software where the
password files so we need to coordinate
with the security companies at the
second point did the reporting and the
information-gathering prime software
installed on the enterprise of at home
pieces maybe these are the holder IT
management department of companies and
also the ISP providing software
companies so the stylus pointed the
graphical localized software of the many
many long natak dumped information these
are so long and also the now is the main
lead character breast so our future
plant in the our UN vs may be the
shittiest games of water ICT networking
education software so thank you for
listening my presentation thank you take
a hero around thank you for opportunity
to talk my name is taka kamada and I am
a CEO of I Adam cop here is google so i
sold here is no paper but today i found
it is this is a meteorology user
satisfaction serving do you write it
user satisfaction that's what this is up
observing and this is writing a paper oh
and do you think how to input this data
right here yes you should import this
manually but it's very close full on the
boring work as we know please stop it
please stop it if you have microsoft
office and the normal scanner do you
have microsoft office urh and i found a
scanner in the copy machine here so you
can you can you can read it
automatically today and this yeah sorry
yes and this is my three summary we made
our own paper Oh paper is on demand
optical rating system for survey forms
and second old paper provides smooth
transition transition pass from paper
this solution towards the future
electronic devices instead old paper is
no supporting on MS office but I'm a
notifiable Microsoft so good so Oh
pepper will support google docs in the
future thank you and this is our system
if you want to make a sub you exist you
just design the seat with a visual
editor not only microsoft office and you
print out to the regular paper and do
sub a and after that you just can see it
with a normal scanner it will be
automatically read and you will get a
raw data on the chat soon and that you
reduce your cost on time to input this
survey about the time is a one-tenth of
money rebuilt and causes 17 some money
my own input if we use our ASB sabes it
costs the only a 20 cent per seat and
old paper is not only not only obstacle
rating system it's more you can make you
commit a smooth transition parts from a
currently paper based solution to
electronic devices for example once you
design forms by a WYSIWYG editor you can
make
out past for example you can input data
automatically from paper or you can
input data from PC or a PDA or some
smart phone and every data is input to
one database so you can you can make you
can make a data correctional system on
the WYSIWYG editor and old paper old
papers ode is not is alternative way of
only paper or only external account
devices so old people ode is not a DG
and now we support microsoft office but
but al-sabah is independent from client
so Google Docs can be can be a our quiet
and Google Docs is very powerful
authoring system but it's only half of
this circle that an old paper adds the
simple simple power input inputting
system so if we if we cooperate if we
cooperate we can complete this circle
and google docs will be the center of
the data cracking cracking under start
our video demonstration this is now cry
this is Microsoft Word and it is written
on some forms and this one is just just
word and if you print this a you should
input input to the results manually but
a the field new instruction it will be
it will
a it will be automatically did it forms
so read stud oh sorry if we press the
plan here is a window to define data
definition here is question and it took
input options under it will be bubbles a
show on the micros world and it's just a
picture you can move it free so you can
make any design any design well if you
have a rather see documents you can make
it a read automatically and you can
print out the on the regular paper and
we can handwrite and now you don't have
to input this forms manually just
scanned with normal scanner arrived this
or a scanner in copy machine and it's
now you can get results log data and a
chat or some statistical results back
this
and some people think about reality of
optical reading that's no problem we
have a friendly and quick purifier so
you can verify the result and fix and
the summer again Oh papaya on demand up
scale rating system for subforms and OT
paper is smooth transition pass from
paper-based solution to future external
devices and old paper is now supporting
a mere surface but I want or I will
support google docs in the future if I
have enough information so let's
collaborate with us thank you very much
hello I'm shelter from later and this is
mr. sugiyama co-founder of life we will
be presenting using loader scope
software for easy movie editing and
share nice to meet you
so recently there has been an increase
in devices such as video cameras digital
cameras cellphones devices for taking
movies and more and more people are
faced in two occasions where they have
to edit movies and movie sharing sites
such as YouTube and myspace have emerged
to let people share movies and these
sites are growing day by day ok movies
are a new way of communication and movie
data tend to be stored in personal
computers the question is are there any
movie software that can handle with
movies easily this is a questioner
taking at the end of two thousand seven
we asked what do you wish to do with
your current next personal computer from
left to right in order of most frequent
demands were watch and record TV movie
editing and managing and movie
downloading and managing almost all the
demands are associated with movies
we are able to take movies and share
however almost all the data are just
done in our personal computers current
software just cannot handle movies
easily so we lay low have developed load
of scope a combination of super high
speed movie processing engine taiko
engine and cutting all the logging time
and scoping you I to allow easy maneuver
thus making movie production a pleasure
load of scope is a software for handling
movies with ease we Lolo have developed
a super high speed movie processing
engine with this engine there is no
lagging time and can handle movies
without some our revolutionary scoping
you I makes movie editing astonishingly
easy from the first time you creative
movie editing and showing as possible it
is a new kind of non rendering movie
software
bilder scope allows cutting copying and
applying multiple eggs and combining
movies let me show you drag and drop
your movie files
each movie starts playing just assumed
as you hover your mouse over you can
find your movie by slashing and dragging
the ground
you can watch our movie by double
clicking
and we see left bar and
and the right part you can cut you can
also cut more precisely frame by frame
which the slope button
once you decide where to cut you can
make copies and your helps do another
cut make multiple copies
and to organize you can just slash it to
the left to the right wherever you want
mr. sugiyama now is slashing the ones to
the left for editing tomorrow and to the
right for 18 today and now we have to
hope something called the magnet for
easy file authoring and once the order
you can name it
change colors and
and now after you cut and copy now you
can apply effects now a preview of the
effect can be seen just as you hover
your mouse over you can apply multiple
effects but the amazing thing is that it
doesn't stop
okay once you apply the fix now you can
put it in a timeline and you can combine
it with other movies
you can also super post them and but it
doesn't stop
and
when you finish doing your piece of art
you can upload it with one click and so
anyone can easily edit movies and share
it with a bone
we are thinking of increasing the number
of installations with the cooperation of
movies sharing sites and file storage
services we lost the with loyal scope
movie sharing sites will have an
increase in high quality contents
visitors and registered users will
increase by registering ID or RSS to
loyola scope it can be used as a
personal web servers satellite TV
low-dose scope users will buy an unusal
functions totally p sets us free
constants can also be done Lola scope
will freely provide services for easy
sharing editing and managing for doing
all the media data stored locally or
upload remote servers we will increase
install base and sell additional useful
functions doing uploading time we will
show advertisement we are also planning
to sell movies and picture materials
multimedia I will introduce you to the
three members of the low-dose scope
family the one click upload intuitive
editing loyal scope is a present from us
so it's free for those using the normal
version looking for high higher quality
we provide super loyal scope the power
up version in just a few minutes create
cool professional level work of art
finally for professionals we propose a
perfect solution for speed and quality
like control production flow with Lola
scope pro enabling more time to be spent
in creativity now you got the Youtube
upload API so we are now thinking of we
wish a low dose scope can be used as the
official to in YouTube users will be
able to easily edit and upload and share
it with more people the contents will be
more fun and beautiful more users will
come and registration will increase
we are thinking of presenting the loyola
scope CTP version at the end of march
two thousand eight we will distribute it
across companies aiming at creating new
user experience okay for those who want
to use fluoroscope contact any person
where in this neck thing thank you for
listening we provide a load of scope for
fee but yeah if you want you no more
functions and you can well we haven't
decided a price but thank you thank you
hello everyone my name is teleca awesome
also a cheeky or at wisdom web
technology with some web i'm going to
talk about to up to our applications the
first application is named mobile green
vest which is a sub services software to
convert any web pages to brush fires for
three thank you which which enables us
to view well wishes web based on common
mobile phones and the necklace
application is never the wisdom of our
own this is our pushed every system
which which can use to send or any web
content to any web pages in real time
now our vision is so this this picture
shows our vision will chink the web
browser and the web browser or mobile
phone is like a satellite and the web
servers are based
as you know satellite has very limited
GP computational resources but the task
of satire is very important the base
station needed to support such satellite
with very limited bandwidth so wishing
my our our technology can make a new
paradigm to enable us to each satellite
it's very smart upper class mods mother
I'd like to give you a short description
of our products well grimps is a kind of
mobile document viewer with common
mobile phones and without were needs a
push the rail system on the web in real
time this is a key concept of mobile
Grimm's a mobile green post-its our
software the software makes fresh forest
forwomen for common weapons from HTML
Royce Hopi sheets ahead hidden servers
for with mobile green peas can translate
hm fights to fresh fresh write files
unsent to mobile phones users can she
can browse a pishet web based on common
mobile phones the Bill of all mobile
phones is quite similar to view of fish
species HTML files
this is the architecture of mobile
Olympus so mobile Olympus analyze the
contents given by the other system and
the mobile gram sabha extracts the
Bureau of the H web pages and contour of
web page like links and forms in
ordinary web pages and combine the
information on flashlight virus this is
like a kind of comparison technology for
web pages
this is this is a demo more green peas
we will show the direct application
where Olympus this is a simple mobile
phone not smart phone so you I'd like to
see I'll actually show you how to cut
power works product a combat how quick
our product converts the HTML document
in tavares files sorry now just input
the URL or pcs website and go right now
combating HTML site into fresh voice on
hidden servers you can see the baby may
be similar a view for pcs website we can
choose our pcs website on white phone
common word form and the other g speed
is very quick of course we can jump to
another page by clicking links
hunt
we can zoom the web pages to hips and so
a broad browsing we appreciate the
webpage so we like to make a mobile
phone with our King current or pcs so I
was up all of us on the saga with mobile
green peas and can optimize so original
web pages to reduce to save battery and
the boundaries for very phones
and the next application is with some
other bottom this is a push delivery
system so this this square shows the
user and this machine means our sabha
with the madrone sabha and this figure
shows our web server our system is
independent of the web server we our
system can push the dead body to the you
web pages a separatory I'd like to show
you a demo of our system
this space is a controller of our system
I think this is like a TV programs on
newspaper users can control the schedule
or program very easy but now we use very
simplified controller for demo and this
google page i dr. push the content on
the face
this is the simple hard to control for
our system if i push vista del putas sat
on the basement banner we shown on the
google page
sorry I'll try
Oh
the contents will be shown the time I
think it
okay also also buy movies
the new a new content will be shown at
ten o clock it's it's bigger it's in
five seconds before ten o'clock the new
document is pushed in the part of a page
so that the contents which is shown to
10 10 the content it's disappeared
and another demo it's a kind of report
system orbit with some other bar on the
system records or behavior or behavior
on users web pages I'll skip
now system is recording the activity or
users carry me about the activity the
results behavior
I always keep
on system can we pray the behavior this
can be upright to honor right sir user
preference and so on
so but in wisdom at the bar is I can
push the contents in real time and the
operation is very easy because the
interface is very similar to job TV
programs on newspaper and use a car and
all the report open the push delivery so
I'd like to summarize our my
presentation the first system is a
mobile Olympus which is a kind of move
our viewer Josh the hidden server with
mobile winds can translate hm fights
into fresh face and user can see the
franchise and the next to stay with them
at the bottom is to push delivery system
so again I can't show you a real time
demo rock so the wisdom of the room and
can can push the web contest in your
time and the system can be used as a
advertisement system thank you for using
my presentation
thank you very much so thank you for
those who presented would you presenters
stand up please um so yeah so please you
know thank you so um so I unfortunately
we need to wrap up but we have a
networking system place so if you have
any questions you know please follow us
and you know we have plenty of time to
you know discuss this technology these
technologies so thanks again for coming
and thank you very much for the great
