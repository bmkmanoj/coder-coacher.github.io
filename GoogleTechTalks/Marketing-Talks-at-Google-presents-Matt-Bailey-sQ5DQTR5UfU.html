first of all thanks for joining us and
lower this okay my name is Christine
sigh and I'm very excited to introduce
our marketing at talks marketing talks
at Google speaker today Matt Bailey and
he's actually fresh from SES San Jose
that's where he just came from having
spoken on another panel alongside
Avinash Kaushik hope I got his name
right who some of you might know from
google analytics and uh lemme see matt
is the president and founder of sight
logic marketing and he actually knows
Bret back from when Google Analytics
used to be called as called hn so he
actually sent his apologies you couldn't
be here to introduce you himself Matt's
here to regale us with analytics
according to Captain Kirk I'm actually
pretty intrigued by this even though i'm
not a big star trek fan but um he'll
share his insights into analytics and
how the original Star Trek series
explains many of the principles behind
analytics and understanding visitor
motivations segments and website
analysis and then finally how do you
make all of that actionable so if you're
like me whether or not you're a Star
Trek fan I'm sure this will be a treat
for you so without further ado may I
welcome Matt with Matt Bailey really a
this presentation is built out of
training on what I would call the front
lines I do a lot of training for the
search engine strategy shows I do a lot
of training for the Direct Marketing
Association and really I would describe
myself as being on the front lines with
companies who either they don't have any
analytics at all or they have a an
incredibly old version of web trends
that they got from someone's nephew they
don't know what to do with it they don't
understand it and when they open up the
dashboard they freeze because they just
don't understand what to do with it so
this presentation is really a product of
trying to introduce to a business owner
to a marketing manager here's what you
need to understand about analytics
here's the potential for what it can do
for you and hopefully here are some
methods that you can take to help
understand it so a lot of this may seem
really basic out of the box but please
remember that where I say on the front
lines this is earth-shattering stuff
they're not getting this from anywhere
and Avinash has been such a great
evangelist of getting the word out
helping people understand how easy
Google annex analytics are to use but
really it is a message that needs to get
out more and more into a much wider
audience because in general people are
just mystified about this subject and
really they're intimidated by it the
very first thing that we have to explain
to people is that there is no such thing
in act as accuracy this comes out of
question after question after question
of how do I know for sure these are the
right visitors that this analytics
package is showing me exactly who came
to my site and there are so many factors
that can ruin that and then the
follow-up question is why does google
analytics tell me one number but on
ature tells me another number and you
know coremetrics tells me another number
and so the first thing people realize is
not only is there no consistency among
analytics programs that how do we even
know what numbers right and so the very
first thing we have to get out of
people's heads is that there is no
source of accuracy there's no clear
source because every analytics program
operates differently and so we have to
get that out of our heads the best quote
that I heard was from John Marshall who
founded click tracks when I asked him
what makes click tracks more accurate
than anybody else he stopped me he says
that's a good question he says but what
we like to sell ourselves as is being
less inaccurate than everybody else and
that's really what analytics is all
about is trying to be less inaccurate
and trying to find what's going on in
your website so the first thing we have
to talk to people about is what should
you be measuring what are some of the
important things to draw out of the data
and we start with really more of a
comfortable landing spot we get into
unique
visitors the only way you can track
unique visitors is by using javascript
on the tags and also by using cookies
those are the only two ways that you can
get this information if you aren't using
javascript tagging or cookies then you
are just going to have visits you're
just going to have sessions because
you're not uniquely identifying the
people that come to your site now again
this is full of holes as well because
anyone who deletes their cookies they
show up as unique visitors again and so
this is one of the principles why we can
can't ever get to very accurate data
there's always changes going on so
beyond that we have to help people also
understand that cookies aren't
necessarily a bad thing the first party
cookies those are fine those are the
cookies that if I come to Google I get a
cookie on my browser from google now if
I go to site like CBS sportsline and
there are ads on the side for Toyota and
then I get a cookie from Toyota even
though I'm not on a Toyota site i'm on
the CBS sportsline site that is a
third-party cookie those are the ones
that are used for ad tracking that's
also the ones that have had some issues
and security and those are usually the
ones that browsers will block so it's
the third party cookies that get the bad
name when it comes to analytics and
privacy and things like that but the
first party cookies are the ones that
help you uniquely identify a person
where they came from who they are and
how often they've come back to the site
then we get into visitor sessions and of
course this is just how many times your
website was used how many people have
come multiple times as opposed to how
many people just came once and so you
can dig into the data a little bit there
and find out how much of your how many
people are returned visitors how often
do they return within a specific time
and continue to grow from there then
especially what SES is all about is
where are people coming from where is
our search traffic coming from how much
of my traffic is based on search engines
where what are they typing in what do
they want and so that's where we come up
with a search engine referral rate in
this shows how well your website is
growing in getting people who are
searching for what you want what you
have and that's where we get into
helping
understand that you can't brand the
market you've got to meet people where
they are you've got to use the same
language that they're using and so when
we come up with an average search engine
referral rate of twelve to fourteen
percent that's usually based on a site
that is focused on their branding
they've not really built out the pages
the way that would be conducive for a
visitor to understand where they're at
they're not using words that searchers
would use in order to be attracted to
that site and so we find when we do
optimize the site search engine referral
rates go up but it's simply based on
using the words that people use and
believe it or not that is still an
eye-opening subject right there of just
figuring out what are the types of words
that your customers would use and people
are still struggling with that in order
to communicate that on their pages the
exit rate or the bounce rate the amount
of people that hit your site and then
immediately leave these are the ones
that we struggle to understand what were
they looking for when they came to the
website why did they only stay for five
seconds and then completely leave what
is it about this and this is where you
can really start to get in and analyze
your site and get some great insight as
to are you meeting the customers needs
are you providing the information they
want on the site because if you're not
they're going to leave immediately one
of the best examples of this is I had a
client who told me that they wanted to
rank number one for the term ups problem
was they weren't ups they sold the
uninterruptible power supplies and so
they wanted to rank number one for UPS
the problem was as we started digging in
and finding out more about their their
sales cycle and who they were and what
they wanted that the UPS units were
actually not even a profitable business
they weren't even the major part of the
company they only wanted to rank number
one for ego reasons and so when we
started doing some analysis we found out
that people that searched for UPS came
to their site had a ninety percent
bounce rate within five seconds off the
homepage and that's because they
dedicated zero homepage space to UPS
units there was absolutely nothing about
ups and a home
so when someone searched for it got to
the page and there's nothing there they
left so your message has to be
coordinated across all channels if you
want to rank for something you need to
give someone a reason to be there when
they get there if they don't see it
they're going to leave and this is where
bounce rate or exit rate is just a
fantastic metric to just really chew on
get into and find out what's going on in
the site and then obviously the
conversion rate your conversion rate is
whatever you want it to be whatever you
want someone to do on your site that's
your conversion rate you can have ten
conversion rates you can have one
conversion rate ultimately it comes down
to what do you want someone to do on
your site and are they taking that it
can be downloads bookmarks contact forms
information requests orders purchases
whatever you want and then what we ask
people to do is to sit down and create
two goals for your website there's two
questions you need to answer if you have
a website the number one question is why
do I have a website and amazingly I get
blank stares at that question why do you
even have a website yes why do you even
have a corporate website what are you
trying to accomplish with that and then
the second question is what do you want
people to do when they get there what do
you want people to do those two
questions will then help you understand
well this is how I should design the
site the this will help me answer the
questions of do I put something here do
I leave it for later it helps you in the
design the formation the content
development when you measure everything
by those two questions then everything
becomes clear of why you have the site
and who you're making the site for and
that ultimately leads to increasing your
conversion rate and that's really what
we preach is focusing on the conversion
rate continuing to grow it and finding
ways of improving that looking at the
different things that people have to do
once they get to this site great example
of this is amazon.com that if I were to
go there and buy a book that is what we
call the macro action that's the number
one thing to do on Amazon is to buy a
book
however that number one thing requires
about twenty six steps in a usability
test these are the steps that people
have to go through that every time they
make a selection they have to locate and
click the next option locate and click
every time you are asking someone to
pause and find the next step that's a
micro action within the overall process
and so what we're doing is finding that
it's not really a smooth funnel it's a
funnel that's full of holes because as
soon as we start blocking people or they
can't find the next step we've inhibited
their prop their progress and so we need
to find out which of these steps are a
problem where are people struggling and
then we plug the hole in the funnel and
allow them to continue going through but
just doing that really what we learn
from this is analytics is not so much
about numbers as it is understanding the
customer experience understanding the
experience that people are having on
your site is really what we draw from
analytics it's not all about numbers and
visitors and things like that it's about
understanding where the obstacles are
that we're placing in front of people as
they come to the site and so
understanding this we want to delve more
into understanding behavior what are
people looking for how can we make this
better and so what a business has to
decide is are we going to make this leap
into analytics because if they don't
make the leap into analytics all they're
doing is reporting and by reporting
they're just grabbing the numbers out of
the dashboard putting them on a report
and then setting them up the ladder to
whoever wants to see them and that's
what a lot of companies are locked into
there are so many companies I probably
talk to one a week where all they do is
take the numbers off their dashboard put
it in a report and then they spend the
rest of the week or the rest of the
month justifying why their visitor
numbers are higher or lower than the
previous month and when you're locked
into reporting that's about as deep as
you get and unfortunately many of those
people that are trying to justify why
the numbers are higher or lower they
don't have access to any of the other
marketing data there could
than a mailing that went out there could
have been another customer contact that
went on they don't know all they have is
the analytics numbers and they're really
kept in the dark so if you're getting
into an analytic strategy what that is
going to require of you is that you do
much more work that you ask many more
questions that you dig into the data and
find out what's going on most companies
as I said are tied up in consistently
reporting the same things month after
month after month pageviews path
analysis top 10 keywords hits I still
see companies using hits as a metric of
reporting how successful their site has
been monthly visitors top 10 pages these
types of things are what I call caveman
analytics it's the exact same things
that we were reporting back in the 90s
when we thought that sites were
successful because they had a lot of
hits or a lot of visitors but it doesn't
go any deeper it's just reporting it's
so 90s that we've got to break out of
this and leave this behind I go to
companies they show me these things and
they they're asking me well why aren't
we getting anything out of this well
when you look at numbers like that it
doesn't tell you anything I really don't
care what the page views are I don't
care what your top 10 keywords are I
don't give a rat's ass about those types
of reports because they're not going to
tell you anything about improving your
site they don't give you any data you've
got to dig in you've got to figure out
what's going on Eric Peterson got to the
heart of the matter in his book web
analytics demystified that web analytics
works best when measurement expectations
are clearly defined in advance the
problem is is we've got thousands of web
analysts out there that are trying to
justify their job with no clear goal for
their job they're not sure what the
organization's goals are they're not
sure what the visitors goals are and so
they're trying to report based on some
ethereal goal that nobody knows and so
when you don't have a goal to report
towards you have no direction really
gets as simple as that
Socrates said the same thing that the
unanalyzed website is not worth hosting
so figure out your goals what's the one
thing that I want people to do and if
they don't do that one thing then what
what are the actions we want people to
take what are the things that we want to
measure what do we want people to do if
they don't make that number one
conversion what's the second conversion
and then the third question that I have
to ask companies is about their data
integrity nobody is using just one
analytics product everyone is using a
combination of omniture google analytics
Lyris Omniture and web trends and
everyone is using two or three data
packages for their analytics and the
problem comes that there are many
companies or many analysts I should say
that usually will find the highest
number out of one of the packages and
use that for their report that month
that's a lack of data integrity because
you can't just take what's the best
number from the best analytics package
that month and report on that there's a
lot of things that people use in order
to make their jobs look great and
unfortunately that is one of the primary
areas where I see some people taking
liberties so ultimately what we have yes
what is the driver for installing
multiple packages because they do
require engineering work and install
each one of them and some of them are
free
many different reasons I find you know
the primary reason someone with a web
trans product that they don't want to
pay for the upgrade so they install
google analytics because it's free and
we and really the people i've talked to
about that they're getting more
information out of google annex
analytics for free then they're getting
out of their web trends it allows a
little more flexibility with reb trends
you can't really play with the data like
you can in the Google Analytics I know
myself I used probably four different
packages but I have one specifically
that I use to dig in and do what I call
thin slicing different segments so that
we can focus in on you know a group of
people that was looking for red used
cars so we can look specifically at that
where they come from where'd they go did
they did they do these things really
what I call more of the forensics of
analytics it's just a lot of it you know
as soon as google analytics came out
because it's there people went ahead and
did it so a lot of it is just and that's
what leads to the confusion then is that
will these numbers don't match these
numbers and really it just keeps
confusing the matter all that much more
so the first thing we need to do is have
our goals intact understand specifically
what do we want to accomplish because if
we don't have what we want to accomplish
verbalized if the people doing the
analysis don't understand what it is we
want to accomplish then we're not going
to have success we're not going to have
anything to measure by so we need to
move beyond that and this is where I I
make the differentiation of analytics
one point oh and analytics to point o
analytics to point o is asking questions
it's not just looking at the charts and
graphs that you see in a dashboard it's
being able to ask questions of the data
in order to get the information that we
want Neil postman a fantastic cultural
critic used to teach at NYU so that
question asking is the most significant
tool human beings have and it's also the
most underutilized it's the most under
taught tool
and my main message to people who are
using analytics packages is that no
analytics package when you open it up
when you look at the dashboard is going
to tell you here's the two things you
need to do today to improve your website
change this page change this page and do
this on those pages no analytics program
will ever tell you those things you are
the only one that can figure that out by
asking questions so it gets down to the
three C's of analytics which is context
comparison and contrast if you really
want understanding of what people are
doing on your site if you really want to
understand how you can improve it the
first thing we need to do is build
context we need to build context in
order to tell a story and understand the
motivations of the people that were
coming to the site then we can compare
each of those stories one to another to
find out well this group was successful
this group wasn't what were the factors
that led to success what were the
factors that led to failure and so and
this is humanly how we learn we do this
every day we compare and contrast
constantly all throughout the day but
yet as soon as we open up our analytics
package we stopped because we see charts
and graphs that tell us what we should
think and so we need to get back in and
ask questions this is what I call
Socratic analytics so Socrates
questioned people he questioned people
in order to make them question what they
believed and why they believed it
ultimately what that means is getting
beyond the well we've always done it
this way when you start questioning and
finding out why are we doing this how is
that being done right are there other
ways that we've explored and just
continue to ask those questions really I
my feeling is that the analysts should
be the most subversive person in the
organization because they should always
be asking why so what we want to find
out what are some actions that people
take on our site that lead to revenue
what are actions that people take that
lead to branding that lead to success
and then also I get this question
constantly what's a bad bounce rate for
the homepage what's a bad exit rate
what's a good exit rate and the problem
is you can't answer that
someone says I have a 20-percent exit
rate is that good or bad I don't know
the problem is we're assuming that
everyone that goes to the homepage is
there for the same exact reason and once
we assume that we've lost all all
context of the website so we have to
understand that many people come to the
home to the homepage or to the website
in general with all these different
motivations they're looking for
different things they have different
ideas and so what we have to do in order
to answer that question is find out well
who's coming to the site what were they
looking for because once you start
asking those questions you realize that
the aggregate data does not give you the
information you need to make
improvements aggregate data assumes that
we're all moving from point A to point Z
in exactly the same direction using
exactly the same path and that just
doesn't happen on the internet so what
we want to do is start breaking this out
and we start analyzing our homepage well
let's look by who got there how did they
get there if they came from a different
website what did that website say about
our website what was the link all about
what was the context of the link because
by that then we can understand what did
they expect to see when they came to the
home page if they came from a search
phrase that's a great way of finding out
what were they thinking what did they
want in order to come to the homepage by
product group I campaign we start
looking at all of these different
segments and understanding now that if
there is a high exit rate or a high
bounce rate in any one of these areas
it's because of what they were expecting
to find so we can't aggregate that and
say it's good or bad we have to slice it
up and say well we're doing well here
we're doing poorly here and
understanding that we're not meeting the
needs of a certain segment I love
talking about segmentation because this
is where you really learn what's going
on on a website and the best way I have
of understanding segmentation is as
Christine said is the analytics
according to Captain Kirk we found this
one day and it was just so mind-boggling
that
really wasted the next couple weeks and
digging this out here because what we
the assumption that everyone has about
Star Trek the original series is that
red shirts die more often and there's
the joke that's constantly you know I
think if you watch lost the joke was I
think in the finale that all the people
that were shot were wearing red shirts
so it carries on in pop culture and we
had the assumption that more red shirts
die than anybody else so we said about
to prove it we started looking at the
data we want to find out how did in San
Ricky go from standing up to laying down
dead and so we have to build context
let's build context first we start out
with the Starship Enterprise has a crew
of 450 people we know that's true
because it's from Star Trek org
five-year mission 54 deaths and that
results in a thirteen point seven
percent mortality rate or for what we're
going to call it our conversion rate all
right now we got our basic information
our basic information is we have fifty
four deaths out of 450 people thirteen
point seven percent that's aggregate
okay this is like looking at unique
visitors search referrals conversion
rate we don't have yet any specific
understanding of why those numbers are
like that we're just looking at the
aggregate data as a whole so we need to
start slicing it up out of the 54 deaths
what we know is eleven percent we're
wearing yellow shirts nine percent blue
shirts seventy-nine percent we're
wearing red shirts so now on our initial
segmentation slice it's proven red
shirts die more often however it doesn't
tell the story it doesn't tell us why
and and we can't be satisfied with just
getting the answer to the question
because if we own our own website and
we're trying to get more sales we want
to increase the conversion rate so we
need to know why so we need to segment
the segment we need to dig further in so
let's look a little bit more about our
red shirt activity when we found out
that red shirts
on board died at a rate of forty two and
a half percent usually from fighting
Klingons or something like that on a
base or on the ship or anything like
that however 57.5 percent of the time
they died when beaming down to the
planet's surface with Captain Kirk so we
found the number one cause of red shirt
deaths which was beaming down to the
planet and meeting whatever was down
there fifty seven and a half percent of
the time we knew that that was going to
happen now we also thin sliced it to
give a little bit more dad as far as
what was going on that over 80 episodes
there were 130 fights 18 of those 130
fights equaled someone dying as a result
thirteen of the 18 deaths wearing red
shirts so it just continues the trend
shows that these red shirts are just
dropping at an incredible rate also what
we found is that half the time red
shirts die in multiples so by all means
you're better off being a loner and
staying on board and that's really what
we want people to be able to pull from
this is that the more data we dumped
into this the more we slice into what's
going on with red shirts the more
intelligence we're getting the more
understanding the more context we're
getting about why these numbers are so
high but now how do we get those numbers
down it works the other way too what we
found is when Captain Kirk meets an
alien woman the red shirt death rate
drops to sixteen percent so and we can
get into this only though thirty percent
of the time does he meet alien women
green alien women seem to be the best no
one died in those episodes if they
weren't green than just alien we had a
couple of deaths and if not green or
alien then yess yoman Ram did quite well
but we found here and we got all the
nice little data here so red shirt death
episodes 18 episodes with white 55 and
we just slice this to all the way down
but what we found is if you want to
increase
the red shirt conversion rate you beam
down to more planets if you went to
decrease the red shirt conversion rate
go to more planets with peaceful alien
women Captain Kirk was doing what he
could to save his crew that was our our
conclusion here but what you can take
from this is only by slicing the data
down only by digging into a specific
segment and asking questions why did
this happen what factors affected it we
now can take from this and understand
well here's what we can do to improve it
and this ultimately is we apply to
websites we find a specific segment we
start slicing it down how did they get
there what were they looking for did
they look at this page what did they do
after seeing this page is this a
stumbling block and by only looking at
one specific group a segment of a
segment we begin to understand what
they're looking for and then we can make
improvements to the site because we can
also then compare that to another slice
of a segment and see where we're doing
well where we need improvement where we
need to fix some things so this is now
enlightenment that there is usually a
fifty three percent probability of a red
shirt death if a fight breaks out
fourteen percent of the time they're
going to die however when an alien woman
gets into the mix it drops all the way
down to twelve percent so we begin to
get now predictive analytics and then
also what we realize is in excel is a
pretty good way of distributing data and
understanding the relationships between
the episodes hear that a lot of this
information we could have only gotten by
charting it out on Excel and you can see
where the red shirts and how they relate
to Captain Kirk's smiling face which I'm
sure you know what that means but we can
now get into predictive analytics once
we start understanding the trends and
how things work together we can start to
understand that well so many people are
coming to our site for this specific
thing we know we're going to convert
that much there and if we can increase
that so we start getting more and more
into predict
what people were going to do on the site
based on how they found it what they're
looking for where they're going doing
this is understanding that people are
not cattle people are not cattle because
we don't just move and a herd from home
page to conversion page to thank you
page and then beyond we don't move all
in the same pattern when you look at the
aggregate data just the unique visitors
pageviews things like that what we're
saying is people were moving and they're
all looking for the same thing there's
no difference between them and so we
have to slice that down and understand
that people aren't cattle just to bring
this around into a practical website
application let's say we have an
electronics website someone is coming
looking for a digital camera well we can
have an overall conversion rate that our
website is converting it may be a two
percent however we can slice it and say
okay our digital camera buyers they're
converting at five percent but still
that doesn't tell the whole story
because some people are looking for
digital camera reviews digital camera
comparisons some are further along in
the buying process and they're looking
for pricing so we can't even treat our
digital camera searchers the same way
we've got to slice up the segment there
as well understanding that even if they
were using the same keyword they might
be looking for very different things so
we also have to look at where do they
enter where do they go and then also
looking at what i call the keyword
bucket of terms that first we segment
out anyone who is looking for a digital
camera then we segment out digital
camera and pricing because they're
further along in the process they might
be ready to buy we should have a very
different conversion rate for them as
anybody else same thing if someone comes
to the same website looking for a game
system we can't assume that they're
going to act the same way we can't
assume they're going to see the same
pages and so we must look at them
differently we cannot have one
conversion rate we've got to have
multiple conversion rates and only by
building the context now you can begin
to compare all of your segments
an understanding who is doing what and
why because our review searchers are
going to behave much differently than
those who are further along in the
buying process that are looking for a
specific price or brand guide so we need
to build context now going beyond
analytics and understanding how this
applies what I have to tell people is
that just simply opening up your
dashboard and if you get confused don't
worry you're supposed to be because the
first thing we have to understand is
that something like this is just data
it's just a number that's associated to
a definition we can't do anything with
this this is the heart of reporting the
heart of reporting is taking the same
number every month and maybe expecting
something to change it's just data we
can't do anything with that now when we
add more context we had some more data
to it we now have three different data
points here visitors page views and an
average it's still just data still
information we can't take anything with
this we can't apply it to make anything
better it just is what it is now when we
start adding more and more data points
start adding more and more context by
building out then we can say people who
searched for this entered at this page
stayed on the site for this long
converted at a rate now we have
knowledge the more data points we've
added the more knowledge we have about
the motivation of the searcher and what
they were looking for and did they find
it and how did we convert them because
we're adding more data into it instead
of taking data out edward tufte is a
wonderful wonderful author and probably
the foremost expert in the visual
display of data and I love his
instructions which is if a chart is
confusing add more information charts
are confusing because they don't have
enough information you need more data
points in order to understand the
complex relationships that are going on
behind the scenes so we have our
information hierarchy
it starts with data add a little more
context you have information add a
little bit more you have knowledge and
that ultimately is where an analytics
program will take you is to the
knowledge level it provides the context
it gives you that visitor knowledge of
what's going on but then we have one
more level to go which is I need to
understand this how do I apply it now
that I have the knowledge about this
then we need to make decisions regarding
improving the website and that's what
understanding is all about and then
beyond understanding which is knowing
what to do wisdom is knowing when to do
it and how to implement it the
difference here is the analytics program
will only get you to the knowledge level
it's the analyst that will take you to
the understanding level and the
implementation level and the improvement
and that is where analytics can only go
so far and it depends on our ability to
ask questions because our ability to ask
questions is what's going to take us
beyond the knowledge level and into the
understanding and wisdom of how to apply
this and make things better just some
quick things these are seven reports
that I tell people or the first place to
start if they've not done analytics
before and the first thing is just
segment your keywords do some what I
call keyword buckets an example of that
is will we start with if we have a car
site Ford goes in one bucket Chevy goes
in another bucket Toyota goes in another
bucket then we segment the segment what
keywords were they looking for with Ford
and so we have a bunch of little buckets
there beyond that but start by
segmenting out why people came to your
site what were they looking for find
those motivations then we segment out by
referring you or else your people that
find your site from a link from another
website don't act the same way as search
visitors they're expecting much
different information they're looking
for other things they got what
essentially was a word-of-mouth referral
by clicking on a link to go to this site
so they're going to act differently
they're going to stay longer they're
typically going to convert
much higher rate because that was a
word-of-mouth referral also segment by
bounce rates who's bouncing out of your
homepage what did they expect to see and
when you start by segmenting the bounce
rates then you've got a much clearer
idea of why someone is leaving your page
and then segments by content what are
people seeing what content drives people
to go further into the site which
content drives a higher conversion rate
we worked with one company where it was
travel based and we found out that when
people watched videos they ended up
converting at 10 times a higher rate
than people that didn't watch videos so
obviously that was content that drove a
conversion so more of that content that
was the Assumption we put more videos on
there more things like that will drive
the conversion rate up that's exactly
what happened giving people more of what
they wanted immersing them in the site
allowed us to increase that but it was
only by segmenting based on the content
and looking for what was driving the
conversion and then also and this is
something I stole from Avinash but I am
giving him credit sometimes it's simply
changing the words that you use when you
report the information going from
instead of less than one page three
pages or less let's call them abandon or
flirt or browsers sometimes just
changing the words two words that we all
understand rather than using the Geek
Speak that sometimes when you get that
across someone with an O in their title
they just don't get it but if we put it
in their language all of a sudden they
understand it that much more and then
when we associate the segment's the
first reports are all about breaking up
segments the next the sixth report is
all about bringing it together and
trying to build that context here's one
where we found specifically that someone
was trying to rank for a very targeted
term and we found out for one of those
terms that they had almost a was at a
eighty-five percent bounce rate well we
found out that people were entering of
an old search result onto their error
404 page which wasn't customized it was
just that blank white
page not found so when they're in IT
department had taken down the page that
was ranking for their second targeted
keyword and they only would have found
that by slicing the data and slicing
based on search behavior and we can also
be able to find those great
relationships that just based on where
people enter the site we can increase
the conversion rate by giving them more
of the information that they want so
ultimately what we tell people to do is
you've got to tell the story build the
context by breaking down the data and
finding out more and more of what's
going on it's going to help give you
more information to tell a story of
what's going on behind the scenes and
that's what's going to give you the
information you need to get changes and
improve the website and finally do
something about it Forrester Research
said that bringing on a full-time
analyst results in an roi between nine
hundred and twelve hundred percent
simply because of how much information
they can find and change and improve so
really the information is it worth
anything unless you take action and make
it happen thank you very much for having
me here is a real pleasure to be here
and it's been it's been great you can
find more information I do have a blog
out here it's not really so much a
personal blog as it is an education blog
geared towards educating marketing
managers and businesses and again thank
you so much for the opportunity to be
here
when you're dealing with folks who are
just starting to get into analyzing
their websites and they're thinking
about these page rates like pages and
hits and they're entrenched and they
just really open up that confusion what
is the first thing you tell someone to
look at to get them like get their mind
just off of reporting and analysis Wow
the first thing well it's more of AI
tell them what not to look at what I
tell them not to look at is their top 10
keywords that seems to be a report
that's in every analytics package is the
top 10 referring keywords and really
when you go beyond there and that's what
gets to the whole long tail effect and
the long tail keywords is that it
doesn't tell even close to the whole
story only 10 keywords which your top
referring keywords really tells a very
non accurate story and so what I tell
people's don't even look at those I mean
you want to look at your keywords in
groups of hundreds or something like
that just to get a feel for what are
people searching for because what's in
your top 10 is not even close to what's
actually on your site for data so it's
more of what not to look at and actually
people kind of feel good about that they
like to know that they can ignore
something it's pretty liberating yes
Wow um you know they come from really
all backgrounds uh I found some really
great analysts that have music
backgrounds I think it's because they
can see patterns and data and understand
how to apply it and pull out the
information I mean my background is in
journalism and I took a lot of marketing
and it just never made sense until i
started getting involved online and in
web analytics and all of a sudden
everything I learned in marketing just
wow now it makes sense so a lot of it I
think it's I I don't know I think its
genetic just like there you know
watching the Olympics there are some
people that have the genes to run I
don't run I don't like running I part of
me thinks that analytics it has some
sort of genetic feel to it that you can
just see the patterns and really grasp
them not to say that you can't do that
you can train yourself you can work at
it and you know it really but I think a
lot of it just sometimes there's just
that natural adaptation to the data
question about tools you mentioned that
to get from reporting to analyze
analysis you need to dig in and compare
things and so on do you think that
future tools will ever do that for
example instead of displaying top 10
keywords display the buckets and so on
um one tool is doing that right almost
off the dashboard and that is the visual
sciences where it is creating these
keyword buckets so to speak on the fly
and they're showing them relationally
you know those circle charts where you
click on a circle and then everything
moves around to show all the related
they're doing that so what they're doing
is looking and saying okay oh here we're
all the 42 keywords and so you've got
the number there and then you can see
that here are smaller circles and really
they're naturally just pulling that out
and so you click on forward and then
that circle breaks apart
you can see then relationally you know
what keywords then are the next biggest
clumps so to speak that was probably one
of the greatest examples I've seen the
only problem is it's not I think it's
close to a half a million dollars or
something like that for the for the
program so it's not you know on most
people's lists there but as I i would
love to see more of that coming in where
the the emphasis is not on the analyst
to go look at hundreds of lists of
keywords and try and pull out all those
homogeneous groups but to have something
that would just naturally look for the
common patterns and create a visual
display there I would love to see that
happen and I think that is on its way
you mentioned that asking the right
questions is a huge part of getting the
right data sometimes that's a really
difficult task on its own do you have
any like advice that you give your
clients on how to ask the right
questions or any stories from how
finally getting the right questions or
turned it around for them ah usually I
find that when you get in to start
segmenting uh and and what I tell people
who want to be analysts is you need five
things if you want to be an analyst the
first is dual monitors or triple
monitors depending upon how serious you
are on the second thing is a door door
no coffee no distractions the third is a
notepad because when you're getting into
the data and you're digging down within
a segment you're always going to have
other things come up that oh that's
something I need to examine more a lot
of good programs um I'm a big fan of the
Lyris product what used to be click
tracks because whenever I was digging
into one segment I would see information
off to the side there that led me to
really see another pattern and so you
got to write it down
stay focused on where you're at and then
go back to it good analytics products
allow you to see things that you may not
have been looking for but it shows it in
a pattern that helps you say well well
what about that and you start going down
a whole different path and it allows you
to get to answer questions you may not
have had and so that's that is really
vitally important I think in analytics
programs as they continue to be grown
and developed is the ability to go down
and really deeply slice but then all of
a sudden see oh that's cool yeah I'm
going to see more about that and click
through and see that saying is your
question at all um well yeah I mean
actually I'll go back to this slide here
and show you a little bit more about
what we found on the first paragraph
here the primary keyword is really what
we called our bucket term this was the
primary phrase that we were targeting
and what we found you know we just
looked at some basic data that they're
on the site almost three minutes they
converted at a rate of about two point
two percent now what we found here
though is when we looked at well where
are they entering the website and this
was one of those things that as we were
getting the initial data what we saw in
another chart nearby was people who
search for this term entered at these
pages so what we found is that about
half of the visitors with that key
phrase entered at the homepage and the
next about thirty-five percent entered
at a category page deeper in the site
now the homepage the people that entered
at the homepage only had a one point
eight percent conversion rate the people
that entered at the product page at a
four point three percent conversion rate
so right away it was one of those
moments where okay if people are
bypassing the homepage going right to
the product page we're doubling our
conversion rate so what we took from
that is we stopped really we took all
the optimization off
homepage we don't want people to enter
at the homepage because they're more
effective going right to the product
page and seeing what they want and in
doing so what we ended up doing is not
only do we increase the conversion rate
but also the people entering at the
category page that conversion rate went
up because we focused more attention on
getting people through the process there
so that was really about three or four
things that came out as we were watching
this segment to find out what was going
on where we what if they came in here
how many people came in at the product
page and then went back to the homepage
and we and we saw that very few were
doing that so it's one of those things
that just as we kept digging into it we
kept applying what another data point
what if what about people that did this
and like I said it just continues to
build that context and that
understanding of people they're pretty
driven for that key phrase they know
what they're looking for and really
they're almost self qualified found the
same thing here whenever we associate a
brand name with the keyword so the
bottom when there is whenever the brand
name was associated with the keyword
conversion rate was five point three
percent but also if they answered at the
product category page went up even
further so it just reinforced that whole
assumption that if they bypass the home
page and go or enter the site at the
product page they went up significantly
so it's it's really it's building these
associations that are just so critical
to understanding and that's I know
Avinash his mantra is this segment or
die so that's one of the things I'm
waiting to see from google analytics is
I'm going to see more segmentation
anyone else
