dude I think he runs one of the places
that I love best in California the other
one being the JPL mission control room
for deep space missions and he runs the
place where they collect all the signals
and we may find about those from he
stock so give him a hand map and okay
sure
Thank You Boris I'm sure that's the last
time you'll applaud by the way I don't
want you to think that the fact that my
laptop does not interface with your
system means anything with regard to the
kind of signal processing that we might
have to do to find aliens I mean it's no
reflection on that now the other thing I
might say is that I do not run the SETI
Institute although I would like to think
that I did but I am NOT the boss there
I'm merely one of the worker bees I'm an
astronomer anyhow what I'm going to talk
to you guys about today and also I hope
to entertain your questions on this
subject is why we think the aliens might
be out there how we're looking for them
and what it would mean to you the car
buyer if we were to find them so yeah
and then I'll try and leave five minutes
at the end for questions because I know
you'll want to grow me like a cheese
sandwich to ask all those questions you
know I'm deliberately avoiding
addressing like why are they invading
Milpitas which bores tells me they are
I'd first like to ask how many of you
think that the aliens might actually be
out there how many of you think that
there could be some cosmic coming yeah
well there's almost no point giving this
talk since you already believe this
anyhow how many of you think no probably
not
okay I want to talk to you guys later
all right can you still hear me if I
wander around because I thought I just
sort of wandered downstairs and out the
building well if you were to grab the
next 10 astronomers off the streets of
Mountain View not necessarily a good
idea but if you were to do that and ask
them do they think that the aliens are
out there I suspect most of them would
say yes not because we found them let's
simply because there's a lot of cosmic
real estate as you know this is one of
the Hubble Deep Field photos and you can
see here a lot of stuff it's mostly
galaxies actually they're a couple of
stars in this photo you know there's a
nearby star and there's another one up
there you can tell bum the diffraction
spikes but everything else in this photo
which by the way is a very small part of
the sky this is the part of the sky that
you would cover up with a pinhead held
up here okay so it's tiny bit of the sky
but everything else you see in this
photo is a galaxy like the Milky Way
right and the galaxies typically has a
few hundred billion stars so they're a
couple of hundred billion stars and
they're a couple hundred billion stars
and another couple of billion stars and
in fact every dot here these little dots
they're all galaxies too right it's just
that they're farther away now you can
see here on the order of maybe a
thousand galaxies if you were to take
photos like this all across the sky
something for which your tax dollars are
insufficient but if you were to do that
you would count up about a hundred
billion galaxies so now you got the
picture one hundred billion galaxies
each would say 100 billion stars that's
what 10 to the 22 stars in the visible
universe which by the way might be a
tiny fraction of the actual universe so
10 to the 22 that's more than I figured
more than all the grains of sand on all
the beaches of California that's a lot
of stars and so for the four or five of
you guys who think you know this is the
only grain of sand or anything
interesting is happening I have to say
that that's a certain audacity that
might serve you well here in Google but
nonetheless it is it is a very audacious
point of view so you know we figure you
know with all this real estate it would
be strange if we were the only game in
town all right
so how could we find extraterrestrial
life and when are we going to do it
because the bottom line is you may not
know this but the bottom line is that so
far we haven't found as much as a
microbe even a dead microbe from any
other world right you know 10 well it's
been 12 years ago now 13
years ago 12 years ago when there was
this big story about the Martian
meteorite actually was 1996 so 11 years
ago biggest science news story of the
year was this dead microbe from Mars
found in a rock that was picked up in
Antarctica that had come from Mars why
we know it came from Mars because on the
bottom of the meteorite there was a
bronze plaque that said made on Mars we
know it came from Mars that's not
controversial what was controversial was
whether what was found inside was
actually a dead Martian and the usual
assumption is it was not actually most
of the experts in the field find that
very contentious that that evidence so
we don't know of any life beyond Earth
right but I suspect that in the next 20
years we're going to learn differently
because there are three horses in the
race to find life beyond Earth and I
think that each of these horses has sort
of an equal chance of winning for
example we might find it nearby all
right we might find it on the planets
that are not too far away from us like
Mars or maybe one of the moons of
Jupiter we might sniff it out we're
trying to build telescopes that could
examine the atmospheres of other planets
and maybe find some telltale ingredients
in those atmospheres that would tell you
hey you know there's some biology on
that planet and then of course we might
find the intelligent variety of life
I'll tell you what intelligence means
later and you can judge whether your
co-workers qualify okay now as I say
each of these three approaches is being
pursued in each of them in my view
that's kind of an equal chance of
succeeding in the next twenty years okay
I might point out these are mostly being
done by NASA and of course NASA is
looking for stupid life
we here in Mountain View we look for the
intelligent variety okay so how they
doing it was just very quickly I mean
looking for life nearby that's all dead
obvious I won't go into this story
you've heard it before you'll probably
hear it again
we can go to Mars but not just Mars Mars
probably has liquid water if you just
drill a hole 100 feet deep a couple
hundred feet deep through the surface
but you know there are six other worlds
besides Mars in the earth in our solar
system that show some evidence for
liquid water right so seven in our solar
system now maybe all the rest are
sterile but there are at least three
moons of Jupiter that probably have more
water each than the Atlantic and Pacific
put together that water has been sitting
there for four billion years and maybe
there's just nothing in it but maybe
there is something in it okay so that's
one possibility we're going to go to
Mars in the next twenty years we may get
the money to actually bring rocks from
Mars back to earth where you can really
examine them carefully and maybe we'll
find life on Mars I think the chances of
this happening are pretty good okay so
that's one horse the other horse is to
sniff it out to do that you have to
build these big telescopes big phalanx
is of mirrors flying into space
actually fly them beyond Jupiter where
there's less dust because these things
work in the infrared and they might be
able to see planets around other stars
now this little cut up here shows you
what a star with a planet looks like to
our biggest telescopes on earth you
don't see the planet the reason you
don't see the plan is because it's
buried in the glare of That star and
it's very hard to get rid of that glare
that's an optical problem okay but if
you have an interferometer a bunch of
antennas in space then you might get a
picture like this okay so there you see
the planet and if you can see it if you
get a pixel of worth a planet light then
you can pass that light through a
spectrograph and perhaps make a very
crude analysis here's a very crude
spectrogram that might tell you hey
there's some oxygen in that atmosphere
or maybe some methane or carbon dioxide
or water vapor and you know the reason
that there's all this oxygen in the air
well less all the time but the reason
there's all this oxygen in the air is
because of the work of bacteria
cyanobacteria they breathe in carbon
dioxide they exhale oxygen that's where
all came from okay so if you were find
oxygen in somebody's atmosphere you'd
say hey you know they at least have
bacteria
might not really be a party planet but
there's life there okay all right I'm
Scout for doing this well there's some
dates up there but you can forget all
those because the current NASA
Administrator has put everything on hold
for lack of money yeah
does this anticipate finding planets
smaller than gas giants I'm glad you
asked that question I was actually going
to say hold all questions to the yeah
but let me just say that because there's
a story a science story that will break
tonight the embargo runs out at 7
o'clock that European astronomers have
found a planet around a star with the
sexy named Gliese 571 said it gives an
851 I can remember it 580 wanting Gliese
581 you can find this on the web already
because of course in Southeast Asia they
haven't been listening to the embargo
but in any case this planet is around a
dwarf star it's very close to the star
but the star on the other hand is fairly
dim so the average temperatures on this
planet are about the same as you would
find in Fremont which is considered
suitable for life okay
and the really important point is that
this planet is small it's about 50%
greater diameter than the earth okay so
we take an extra 50% of flying time to
go around it but that's not so much so
it's probably a rocky planet it could
have liquid oceans on the surface this
is the best candidate for life we found
beyond Earth it's suggesting that
planets the same size as Earth might be
very common in fact if you're interested
in this I'm gonna be talking about it on
the radio tonight if any of you listen
to coast-to-coast am from 10 o'clock
tonight on the white sheet radio okay um
that's skiing number two and this has
also got a timescale up on the order of
a few decades and I think there's a good
chance this might succeed and the third
way to find it and what I'm going to
talk about here in the remainder of this
soporific presentation is to find life
left by intelligent beings now what
would be the evidence for intelligent
life I mean you might you know you
obviously I'm going to talk about how
you might overhear transmissions but
there are other ways to find it maybe
they've built something you could find
right maybe they're artifacts for
example this this is one of the photos
from the Apollo missions at NASA never
released because they figured you
wouldn't be interested
but clearly if you were to find
something like this you would say hey
doggone it Bob that doesn't look so
natural to me right now we haven't
actually dug up the moon looking for
these sorts of thing because again
there's no money and in fact we haven't
even dug up the earth looking for this
although we have dug up parts of West
Virginia but it turns out that you know
coal miners are not terribly schooled in
alien artifacts so they probably just
throw them away but this is this is a
legitimate thing to do to look for
artifacts maybe not nearby maybe we
could find ring worlds or Dyson spheres
or some of these other sort of
gargantuan projects that advanced aliens
have built after all the you know the
earth is four and a half billion years
old but the Galit were sorry the
universe well the galaxies it's three
times that old okay so there's been
plenty of time for them to do this if
anybody out there wants to do it you
guys have all these solar cells out here
well maybe they've sort of you know sort
of encircled their entire star with
solar cells which gives them a lot more
energy for their gussto grabbing
lifestyle and we might be able to find
that from the wastes infrared radiation
that that would emit there have been
some searches for
this but we haven't found them so far
but it's a legitimate approach another
way to look for them is to maybe they're
flashing lights at us remember the old
cowboy movies they use they're shaving
mirrors these Cowboys always had shaving
mirrors it kind of amazed me but they
usually shaving mirrors to warn you you
know there are other Cowboys that the
Indians were coming over the ridge or
whatever well that makes sense we know
we never used to do this because of
considerations about the energy cost of
sending things on light beams but it
turns out it's a very practical way to
signal and in fact this is over in
Lafayette on the East Bay but there are
at least three experiments now at
Berkeley and Lick Observatory just down
here in San Jose and then Harvard and
Princeton have one to look for flashing
lights in the sky and the way they do
this is they just use these ordinary
telescopes these are kind of one meter
mirror telescopes not useful terribly
for for astronomy so you can use them
for this and you just put some detectors
on the back and then they're really just
that's the Harvard one photomultiplier
tubes this is this the way it works
you know like comes in from the
telescope and it goes to a
photomultiplier tube in fact it goes to
two photomultiplier tubes in fact it
actually goes to three photomultiplier
tubes that way you look for a
coincidence in the events in these three
tubes and you can be sure that that's
due to something coming in the telescope
and not due to radioactive decay events
in the photomultiplier tube or noise or
anything like that
anyhow all you do is you just look for
brief flashes of light and it turns out
that that makes sense because if you
were to take the biggest lasers we have
which are over in Livermore right use
for fusion experiments you flash those
things for a billionth of a second and
they're really bright right they've got
like 10 to the 12 joules or something
for a billionth of a second all right
now you aim that flash into a mirror
this big and you aim that mirror at a
star system 100 light-years away and
just do the calculation it's one
one-line calculation it turns out that
that flash will outshine our Sun right
at the distance of say 100 light-years
by a factor of a hundred or a thousand
in other words we can build lasers 50
years after inventing the laser we can
build lasers they can outshine the Sun
for a billionth of a second with a
mirror okay so if we can do that they
can do it so we should look for these
things which we do this is course Lick
Observatory taken
from an airplane flying out of San Jose
and this is the setup they had there
it's in this white box here there's a
very simple thing to build we ought to
have a lot more of these things he's
like five or ten thousand dollars worth
of parts put together in this case by
this undergraduate here so it can be
done but she's not a grad undergraduate
anymore she just retired okay now the
other way to do it is to do what Jodie
Foster did anybody see this movie yeah
okay so there's Jodie sitting down at
the VLA in New Mexico which by the way
has never been used for SETI but it's
photogenic and as is I suppose Matthew
McConaughey here who doesn't actually do
anything in the in the film but well
whenever you say that in mixed company
the women all say doesn't matter not
okay yeah this is all based on the SETI
Institute work this is a Mountain View
story in fact that we were even
consultants to the film which leads to
lots of good stories I'll tell you over
a beer sometime this is a this is one of
the antennas that was used in contact
this was just the crenelated topography
of lovely Puerto Rico here and you see
this thing here that's the Arecibo
telescope down to Puerto Rico anybody
been to this thing nobody next time you
go to San Juan next time Google sends
you to San Juan for reasons that are
obscure make sure you rent a car takes
an hour and 15 minutes to drive up to
this thing and take a look at it this
one looks like from the ground it's a
thousand feet across which makes it the
world's biggest antenna fact I figure it
will hold about four billion scoops of
baskin-robbins but not a good idea in
the tropics this thing I can see about a
third of the sky because the Earth
rotates and the receiver can be moved
around a little bit and it is this is
just one more example where bigger
really is better because it's very very
sensitive the only trouble of using this
telescope to try and find et is that
this telescope is in heavy demand by
people studying galaxies quasars and
things that are not quasars galaxies and
pulsars mostly okay so we've used that
but we'd have to build special receivers
now here are some of the receivers we
use because we don't know exactly where
on the dial et might be broadcasting
right we never got an email hey I'll be
in 1547 megahertz on that op you don't
know so we have to cover as much of the
dials we can so we've got these PC based
receivers each one of these has two
million channels each about one Hertz
wide so that two four six that's eight
million
they got lots of these boxes these are a
couple of our engineers and as you can
see they're proud and happy about having
designed these things now how do you
know I mean you all right so you turn
all this equipment you pointed at a
nearby star how do you know if you've
heard anything well that was easy enough
for Jody foster eyes you could put on a
pair of earphones he sat on the hood of
her car for about 20 seconds and then
she heard something that sounded like a
somebody shoved a grand piano out of a
10-story window well it doesn't happen
like this of course
in fact we told Warner Brothers it said
this is wrong we're back as if that was
news to them this is wrong because we're
monitoring 56 million channels at once
so you have to put 28 million pairs of
earphones on Jody
and they they des mirrored they said
that we're not gonna do it it'll crowd
this shot you mess up our coffee you're
sayin do that this is what it really
looks like of course this was done in
Puerto Rico and they're just a couple of
work stations here right and they're
listening to all in this case 56 million
channels once a second okay and they
don't get tired they don't go for coffee
breaks and in fact that carbon-based
life-form sitting there wouldn't
actually even have to sit there if all
this were reliable it's not reliable
unfortunates a one-off system so you you
know case you have to reboot it or fix
things or whatever but most of the time
you're just sitting there taking
self-portraits as this photo here okay
so that's how it really works now what
are we looking for people to think yeah
okay so you're looking for the value of
pi' or maybe the Fibonacci series you
know if you're Dan Brown fan or whatever
you know well that would be very
disappointing I mean I learned the value
pi in the seventh grade you finally hear
the aliens and they tell you something
you learned in the seventh grade that we
don't care what the message is in fact
we don't even have the capability in
most instances to find the message we're
looking for narrowband components in the
signal but the radio amateurs here would
call carrier waves and in fact this is
just a picture I took off the screen in
in Puerto Rico and you can see these
narrowband signals right here those are
the marks of a transmitter nature does
not make signals like that okay so it
looks pretty good there the Klingons and
whatever but they're not those are all
yes they're all transmitters but they're
all terrestrial transmitters right there
mostly communications satellites
wheeling Oh
her head or the radar down at the local
airbase or whatever again you have to
get rid of all that stuff it's very very
difficult ok that's a big problem ok
just for those who care about the
numbers let me just show you how much of
the sky we've actually looked at your
case you'll read in the popular
literature well these study guys they've
been busy at this for a long time and
they still haven't found anything and
maybe szostak well they never named me
but one of my colleagues helped spare
them the embarrassment ought to throw in
the proverbial bath linen because after
all you know they've been doing this so
long and they stopped and found anything
but the answer is we've actually barely
scratched the surface the number of star
systems we've looked at carefully is
like 750 right out of galaxy 100 couple
hundred billion stars right so it's very
very early days to get discouraged
except that you might say but it's taken
you decades just to do 750 stars you
know isn't this going to be too long a
project for you it'll take a few
millennia that at that rate and that's
true but I'll get back to that now we've
there a lot of ways we could improve
this search of course I like to consider
the problem from ETS point of view
here's a photo the galaxy made by a
space probe that you never heard about
and it could be that ETS just trying to
get in touch with us because they know
we're here and they find something
interesting about us
hi hello if you know if you listen to
late-night radio they'll tell you the
aliens haven't gotten in touch because
we're ruining the environment and all
these sorts of things as if they care
right I mean sort of like saying that IO
Wilson isn't going to study ants because
they get into wars with other ants I
mean it doesn't make any sense
but they could be responding because
they know we're here but the trouble is
these are the people that know we're
here right that pixel there nobody knows
we're here
we've been broadcasting into space for
what 50 60 years right so those early
episodes of I Love Lucy or Kukla Fran
and Ollie or whatever they're about 60
light years out okay now within 60
light-years you can work this out within
60 light years there may be a few
thousand stars no more and so the
chances that there's an et you know that
there's an advanced society within the
nearest couple of thousand stars I think
a pretty pretty slim so I think it's
safe to say that while the entire galaxy
may know that Earth has life
because of the oxygen in our atmosphere
they don't know that Homo sapiens exists
and this is an argument you can throw at
people who say you know I'm being
visited and occasionally abducted right
because why are they here now right they
don't know we're here by the way one
third of America believes that we are
being visited so presumably one third of
you do as well we can talk about that
after the talk right okay
so that's one way there might be getting
in touch but I don't think it's gonna
Keable maybe they're just broadcasting
everybody in the galaxy right you know
subscribe to our blog site or whatever
right with the trouble of that is it
takes a lot of power if you want to
cover the entire galaxy here's a number
10 to the 17 watts that's a lot of power
it's more than you're going to get from
these solar cells out here kind of the
17 watts is more than all the solar
energy in fact falling on the planet
right so that's a big PG&amp;amp;E bill if you
want to have a transmitter that
broadcast to the entire galaxy
simultaneously you have to be somewhat
more selective okay so I don't think
that they're doing that although who's
to say you know maybe power bills are
not a concern to ET the other
possibilities that they're doing what I
talked about earlier in this
presentation namely they have found
planets that are known to have life by
sniffing their atmospheres and maybe
they've got long long lists of these
worlds I mean who's to say but they
might if they do then they're gonna
target those guys and maybe their scheme
would be this they would say look I'll
just send each one of these planets that
I know has life I'll send them a a one
second paying maybe every two days right
maybe they got 500,000 or a million of
these things so they just ping each one
of these sequentially with a little
mirror and a PC right and if you saw
that flash in the sky once every two
days you would say you know there's
something special about that bill and
you would spend a lot of time looking in
that direction with a much more
sensitive setup to find the
omnidirectional broadcast that would
back it up so in other words that
suggests that you might be what you want
to do is have a SETI strategy where you
look for very short pulses you know
every couple hours every couple days who
knows what the interval is and if you
find those then you go back and you look
with your radio telescope
or the very faint signal that might be
being broadcast to the entire galaxy to
save their power bills we don't do this
I think it's a good strategy but we
haven't done its part the other
possibilities we might be able to
synchronize our transmitting and our
listening this is just to give you an
idea the flavour this suppose that that
dish up at the top those are the
Klingons right and at some point maybe a
supernova goes off in the galaxy damn
alright so all the Klingon telescopes
are looking at that supernova of course
but then one of the Klingons gets kind
of clever he thinks well you know he
waits a half a day until his planet is
rotated 180 degrees and then he
broadcasts in the anti supernova
direction you know hey look we got a
whole lot full of used cars here with
air-conditioned recondition area and you
might want to you know buy one now
here's Earth and at some point we see
this supernova in the sky and every
telescope in the world is aimed at that
supernova and sure enough you know
twelve or fifteen hours later we get
this message hi you may want to be
interested in buying one of our used
cars or whatever it is right okay so
this this kind of a scheme by
synchronizing up to some galactic event
tells you where to look
win the look we don't do this but it's a
good idea the trouble is there aren't
that many supernovae in our galaxy this
is another way to do it this is just the
way the earth would look from you know
some distance away when it gets in front
of the Sun this is just called a transit
but this is also another good clock this
is an event that the aliens might know
about some of them anyhow and they might
send a signal to reach us just as we're
transiting the Sun because that's you
know that's the part of the clock
everybody will agree is special right so
the advantage of that is they wouldn't
need very much power actually if they
just aimed at the entire Sun because
they don't know where the earth is it
would only take 30 watts and they could
send a signal we could pick up if they
actually knew where the earth was they
could do it with a transmitter whose
power is the same as a laser pointer
right so this makes sense and it's very
simple to do it means all we have to do
is look in the anti Sun Direction all
year just scanning the ecliptic
we don't do this either right the reason
we don't do all the things by the way is
not because we're stupid although you
know that might apply but the real point
is that there's no money right
SETI is privately funded in the in the
us and there's you know we just depend
on checks that people send us so there
isn't enough money to do these sorts of
things but but a lot of them are quite
simple and don't sound too stupid the
other way to do it is the brute force
market march of technology and this we
are doing this is up at Hat Creek which
is about a five and a half six hour
drive from where you're sitting you go
up to reading and that's always exciting
you go up to reading and you make a
right turn and you go into the Cascade
Mountains for about an hour and a
quarter and you'll get to a place called
Hat Creek and there we're building
eventually 350 of these antennas each of
them's about 20 feet across it's called
the Allen telescope array because Paul
Allen you've heard of Paul out Paul
Allen has given the SETI Institute
enough money to get this started
get the first 40 antennas built so this
is quite an interesting instrument
because it can be used 24/7 for this
kind of search it will enormous ly speed
up the search in fact this is what it
looked like eventually this was an
animation but we don't have that file on
the on this computer here but in case
with 350 antennas spread across the
desert you can go up there you go up
there this afternoon will be dark by the
time you get there but you can go up
there tomorrow go up there this weekend
and they'll be happy to show you around
right you can just walk around you can
kick the there are no tires so you can
kick the metal pylons of this thing it's
what it looks like the air there's a
photo I made about six months ago so you
see the couple of the antennas set up
there now the important point is this my
mom for example will occasionally call
me up she said you know you guys have
been doing this for a long time she
doesn't phrase it that way but she'll
say Seth when you're going to get a real
job
and I have to explain to my mom mom I
don't even want a real job but you know
she yeah we would want with it but the
facts are that it sounds like this is
just an endless task that this might
take you know centuries or millennia
before you've looked at enough stars to
have any decent chance of finding a
signal but that's wrong and here's why
this what I did plotted here was just
some index some metric of the speed of
these searches as a function of time all
right you can see they're getting faster
and those of you paid attention notice
that this is a semi-log plot right so
they're getting faster exponentially and
in fact they just follow Moore's law now
this is not you know you know bayens to
the local tradition everything follows
Moore's law it's because of course SETI
is basically digital electronics that's
what it really is in terms of the speed
anyhow so it's just following Moore's
law it's doubling in speed on average
every 18 months okay and that'll be true
for this new Allen telescope array too
at least for the first 15 20 years so I
just worked it out I mean this is always
dangerous but I worked out how far out
into the galaxy we will have looked at
every star with this new array assuming
we got it built by the year I know 2008
or something like that okay and you can
see of course we look farther and
farther out but the important point here
are these these numbers here these are
people's guesses as to how many
societies how many civilizations are out
there in the galaxy that are
broadcasting right now how many
societies are sending radio waves
through your bodies as you sit here
right and we don't know the answer to
that but here's some guesses Carl Sagan
you figure there were a million Carl
Sagan was kind of an optimistic sort of
guy if he's right we'll hit one of them
by 2014 right Isaac Asimov figured
670,000 Isaac Asimov was a very smart
guy he could estimate this to two
decimal places I don't know okay Frank
Drake who works at the SETI Institute of
course and started this whole field he
figures 10,000 right in and now even if
you take Frank's conservative estimate
you see that it still pays off in the
next two dozen years now the thing is if
you ask Frank and I've asked Frank Frank
where'd you get this number 10,000 and
Frank will say something like well you
know driving over on highway
17 this morning and I put my finger out
the window and I figured 10,000 right
nobody knows the bottom line is these
are all guesses but these are guesses
made by people who suggests that SETI is
worthwhile so if you take the entire
range of guesses even the most
conservative of these well it means that
this is not going to take centuries if
it's going to pay it pan out if it's
going to pay off at all it's going to do
so within the next two dozen years and
that's why I'm always willing to bet
anybody in the audience a cup of
Starbucks of course you get them free
but a cup of Starbucks that in the next
two dozen years will find et so either
we find et which will be give you
something to talk about at your next
cocktail party or you get a cup of
coffee alright let me just very briefly
people always ask what woody PB like we
don't know of course but fortunately
Hollywood does if you think about it the
only two kinds of aliens as far as
Hollywood is concerned they're like
Cowboys right did the white hats and the
black heads
and they're only two kinds of aliens
they're either the good ones are the bad
ones there aren't too many good ones
like little et here aren't too many good
ones because they don't make such
interesting storylines but nonetheless
now you know Lily tea comes all the way
from the Andromeda galaxy that's what
two million light years just to pick
some plants and play with the kids you
can tell that he's a good alien because
he's got those big blue eyes and the
short nose and the wrinkling forehead he
looks like a kid right he can also drink
beer even though he doesn't have the
same amino acids in his bike and I don't
all right that's a good alien DD sir
very some more good you anybody
recognize this as Close Encounters of
the Third Kind right so here are some
more aliens that have come to give
Richard Dreyfuss a joyride in their
spacecraft and again you can tell these
are good aliens because they look like
kids they've come
800 light-years or who knows what to do
this and they forgot to get dressed at
the last minute but that happens to none
of the parties I go to okay then then
there then there are the bad aliens
there's a lot more bad aliens and good
ones like these guys who are you know
just come here to trash the planet when
you think about what the bad aliens like
to do by the way they're only a couple
of things that they do like to do either
trash the plan and kill everybody or
abduct us for breeding experiments that
probably wouldn't work okay now
when you think about it those are
exactly the things that you have been
fearing now for 200,000 years at the
hands of your fellow humans right you
know 100 thousand years ago you're
sitting in there in them some Valley and
you're worried about some tribe on the
other side of the hill that might come
into your Valley and take all your land
depriving you of your food supply or
take all your women and deprive you of
your inheritance okay so we figure the
aliens have the same things on their
minds it doesn't make any sense but
there you go
okay here keep I know what film this is
nobody's old oh yeah this is the 54
version of war the worlds which I think
was slightly better but in case they
move the venue here to Los Angeles so
here the Martians destroying LA but of
course those of us here in Northern
California figure la had it coming um
more bad earrings this is kind of your
ISO standard alien these days right okay
all these gray guys are the big eyeballs
and and all this is is a projection of
what we think we are going to become
right because you know we're losing our
hair well we're losing our olfactory
sense our dentition these guys have
small noses small mouths but they do
have big eyes because in the future all
of us will be sitting around designing
websites so so that's all that is I mean
it does me the alien yeah yeah knees
aren't gonna look like that's terribly
anthropomorphic actually Oh a message
okay
did you I dare click it no I don't dear
click it ok what happened I did click
help is the owner of this computer so
here did he go back to work
anybody here know anything about
computers actually yeah Windows this is
not your fault
I know let's try another one
ok that's great
do you need a job ok uh yeah this is
what we always assume about the aliens
there they're kind of like us right
there the billions of them living on
this planet and and you know they they
maybe have lifetimes of a hundred years
or a thousand years or whatever and so
they're kind of like us we always assume
this right in fiction because we don't
know any better but it might be wrong I
mean this is our definition of
intelligence right you guys all have
three-pound brains I don't know how many
of you weighed your brains this morning
they're about three pounds they take on
the order of 25 watts which means that
your CPU if you want to call that takes
about 1/3 of all the energy you consume
so when you go to in and out Burger you
get a burger you know 1/3 of all those
calories are going just to keep your
brain warm whether you're playing
solitaire or doing something useful but
you know 1/3 it's very expensive
metabolically to have a big brain and as
you'll note when you look at the other
animals in the zoo very few of them do
so this is expensive and now this is a
plot you see every time you show a plot
you lose 10% of the audience so I have
12 of these this is just a plot
of how big your brain has been you know
for the last couple of million years
right here three million years ago your
brain was half a kilo so it's like one
pound but in a million years ago you
bring us two pounds and now your brain
is three pounds
hi now it took a million years to go
from two pounds of three pounds but it
was probably worth the trouble because
if you have a two-prong brain you're
four-state if you have a three pound
brain you get a job here okay
and I'll you probably don't hire too
many for our stakes so there you go it's
worth and you might figure on those
faces that doggone it
maybe et is just gone up this curve a
little bit farther maybe they have
five-pound brains or 10-pound brains
maybe we will have five-pound brains or
10 pound brains the nfl's did have
slightly bigger brains but they weren't
ten pounds we probably won't go to
five-pound brains I mean women are
having trouble giving birth to kids as
big as they are now they will go on
strike there's also the fact that your
head gets you know use your head gets
bigger you need you know you've got a
mechanical problem actually you look it
around I mean how big all our necks are
with just three pound brains get a 5 or
10 pound brain you know you're sitting
there in your car come down 101 you turn
your head to watch the guy who's passing
you and you'll twist your head off which
will be disconcerting to the people in
the backseat so maybe this is what
happens maybe the et will just have big
brains it'll be a big brain version of
us but it seems that that's less likely
then that will simply reengineer our own
biology this has become kind of a common
story these days although it wasn't 5 or
10 years ago and that is we're only here
to get the machine's going ok because
the fundamental point about the machines
is that they evolved much more quickly
yeah this is the kind of intelligence we
have today allow a whole bunch of
neurons this is what we're talking about
in the future here you see yes Gary
Kasparov having a bad day right
you remember in 1997 he takes on IBM's
deep blue and he wins but then the
engineers at IBM go back and I think
they stripped the software down this
offer actually got simpler but they had
more processing power came back with I
don't know what they call the deep blue
special edition resign and Kasparov
loses right now the funny thing about
all this it's not that you know machine
can beat Kasparov at chess the funny
thing is that Kasparov said at the time
that it was as if the machine had a kind
of alien intelligence it was just a game
playing machine and yet to him it came
across as something that was clever
which suggests that maybe you really
could think of make a thinking machine
now this is Kasparov some chess rating
as a function of time you see went up
for a while I don't know where there's
first point is I mean three months or I
don't know what he people but you can
see he got better at it for a while but
then he just sort of stopped getting
really much better at it and he's
incremental improvement right that's
human intelligence well this is Hans
Moravec Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh
and what he's plotted here you probably
seen the spot what he's plotted here is
the amount of compute power you can buy
per thousand dollars as a function of
time so for 1900 on you notice this is
exponential this plot runs out at about
1997 in 1997 a thousand dollars buys you
the compute power of a spider okay I if
you're an Iraq no file that may interest
you
if you just extrapolate to 2007 clearly
a thousand dollars will buy you the
compute power of a lizard which I don't
know it might be marginally more
interesting but the real point is this
by 2020 your desktop computer will have
the compute power of you right and a lot
more memory so at that point I don't
know what happens I for one intend to
just turn the keyboard around you know
you type whatever so
obviously it doesn't mean that they will
be smart we know that because I mean you
know you need the right software and you
could say we will never be able to make
a machine that can actually think a
machine that could you know teach you
English literature at Stanford or write
the Great American Novel or do physics
or things like that we we assume that's
true and yet if you ask these people
could you make an artificial kidney yeah
can you make an artificial heart yeah
what about an artificial one of those
things that fits between your ears no I
think that that's whistling in the dark
you may not the jury's out on this but
if you can do it the point is that the
improvement curve is one of these
Moore's Law kinds of curves the time
scale for improving machine intelligence
is extraordinarily short and within you
know one human lifetime you have one
machine that's better than all the
humans put together okay so my point is
only this that the real DT may not be a
little soft squishy grayguy are soft and
squishy at all there's so many
advantages to machine intelligence that
I think you can rule this out I don't
think that's what you're likely to hear
I think it's far more likely that you're
going to hear something quite different
and that's machine intelligence that is
really what rules the universe and
biological intelligence is just a very
short step to get it going this may
sound a bit discouraging to you and if
it does I recommend you adopt a
hedonistic lifestyle engine enjoy it now
I'm sure many of you already have okay
well finally you know suppose we hear
something what happens now most people
you know you meet them in the bars of
Mountain View not that there are any but
if you were to do that and you know it
they'll ask you so if you guys find a
signal what happens they already know
the answer to that some guys from inside
the beltway will come to Mountain View
and shut us down
right why because you couldn't handle
the news that is bizarre because one
third of you believe that the aliens are
already here
buzzing the countryside and occasionally
abducting your sister for experiments
that are inappropriate on a first date
okay and yet you're not riding in the
streets about that so if you picked up
the Merc news tomorrow and it said you
know scientists find a signal coming
from the nearby star system would you
say well that's it Marge I'm not going
to work today I'm just gonna ride in the
streets you might
but I doubt it I doubt you do that what
actually happens it's there's always
this bottle of champagne in the fridge
at the observatory that to say every
time you go to the observatory it's a
different bottle of champagne so it's
I've noticed that but yeah this is this
is actually a picture I made now 10
years ago this was in the summer of 1997
this is when we were over a book on
landings drive just across the street
from you who used to be neighbors here
case we would come over for lunch but
then you were called Silicon Graphics
right oh yeah this is this is our
building over there landings drive and
we had picked up a signal that for 16
hours look like the real deal this
picture was made at 3:00 in the morning
you can see they're just sitting around
but nobody would leave everybody was
glued to the monitors waiting for this
star system to write to rise we thought
we had found it and I was very nervous I
could not I could not sit down I was
going around taking pictures I could not
sit down because I thought this is gonna
ruin my whole week okay now the
interesting thing was at 9:00 in the
morning
nobody had called by the way from the
government no guys with narrow ties had
showed up even the mayor of Mountain
View whom I knew personally at that time
didn't bother to call up nobody cared
yes
oh he disciplined except bill broad one
of the science writers in the New York
Times did call at 9 o'clock and he said
well Seth what about that signal you're
following my first thought was how do
you even know but it didn't matter and I
said well look you know we've gotten
lots of signals before they've always
turned out to be interference I'll call
you back in three hours he said okay
three hours later we figured out what
this was this is the Soho research
satellite a European satellite once
again it's always the Europeans is
European satellite and it was you know
the signal from it was bouncing around
the steelwork of the antenna and getting
into our receivers so false alarm called
the New York Times and they said okay
fine that was it but if this really
happened you see would take us a week to
figure out whether it was real or not
and all that time while the New York
Times might be waiting for us to confirm
it the Weekly World News will not write
so if we actually find et you will read
about it first in the checkout line at
Albertson's that's my conclusion you've
already read
yes okay will we understand anything you
know we were able to figure out the
hieroglyphics but these were written as
it turns out
contrary to what again you might hear
late-night radio these are actually
written by humans they were called
Egyptians okay and in fact this is not
such a dead language or still people who
could speak this in AD 400 or so taking
this out took seanpauley on about what
30 years or something but he had to
given even less actually but he had the
advantage of you know for example the
rosetta stone that helped we won't have
any of that so I think that the bottom
line is that we might we might figure
out what they're saying if they're
making it easy for us but I think that
the chances of ever understanding what's
being transmitted to us are rather slim
I think it would be like giving the
output of one of your computer modems to
a Neanderthal right Indiana Thals
weren't that stupid the gentleman
already pointed out but they will never
get it they don't have the context to
ever get it right and I think that
that'll be the case we will get all
these bits everybody will download them
under their hard drives people try to be
like chomp only on figuring out and
after 300 years of trying and failing
maybe they'll start worshipping these
bits I mean I don't know what's gonna
happen and then you could say well okay
we got the message but we never figured
it out maybe you guys never should have
bothered with this well I don't know
about that
this is the frontispiece of a book by
Robert Hughes actually it was a New York
Times art critic but in kids he wrote
this book about Australia and this is a
woodcut from from the early 19th century
showing Captain Cook landing in Botany
Bay down there in Australia and the
locals as you can see have a welcoming
party happy to see him now the point is
that as Hughes wrote for 40,000 years
there had been a watch glass of crystal
of isolation sitting on top of Australia
and when Cooke sailed into Botany Bay
that morning in 1770 that watch crystal
broke that that watch glass shattered
and there was no putting it back
together what I'm trying to tell you
here today is that I think in the next
two dozen years you're going to see the
watch glass of isolation that is sat on
this planet for four-and-a-half billion
years
shatter as well okay thanks very much
okay I know you guys are in the real
world so you have real work to do but I
have a couple quick questions I'll be
happy to answer yeah the question is
there's 10,000 estimate from Frank Drake
is based on how long I mean what is the
the implied lifetime of a technological
society and this is really a reference
to what's called the Drake Equation
where L is the last term and Frank Drake
just thinks that all those terms before
L multiply to 1 in other words he
figures the average lifetime of a
technological society is 10,000 years
it's so far we've had maybe 50 or 100
years so maybe this is good news buddy
but it's a guess yeah
yeah yeah
the question is early on the SETI
program there were lots of signals that
were found but never repeated what
happened to those would what were they
it's true back in the old days what you
would do is you'd go to the telescopes
and you know these big computer tapes
you know recording the data and then you
would take them back home and you play
them back and you would always find
signals we pick up signals at the rate
of one every few seconds okay you find
these signals but you're no longer at
the the telescope so you can't verify
them until the next time you go back and
you never found them a second time it
could be you really had picked up BT but
et went on summer vacation right when
you went back they weren't there I mean
that could be but that's not science if
you can't find the signal over and over
again it's not there and I have to say
that ever since we developed the
capability to follow up on the signals
within minutes which is what we do now
there are no signals that go funny that
are no mysterious signals anymore so I
think those are probably all terrestrial
interference I think that's fairly safe
bet one more yeah yeah how far away
could we detect Earth with the kind of
equipment that we use for SETI yeah well
I mean it's you know this is this
equipment is not optimal but if even if
you were at the distance of the nearest
star Alpha Centauri you would have a
hard time with our equipment you
couldn't find anything except the
military radars you can find those there
maybe not so interesting to listen to
but those you could find you could find
our TV signals if you built you can work
this number out a couple of thousand
acres of rooftop Yogi's you know the
neighbors would complain but with that
sort of thing you could pick up the
carriers from our TV yeah okay oh one
last
yeah yeah yeah the question is are we
listening for leakage radiation just
stuff that accidentally leaks off their
planet like our TV does are deliberate
transmissions aimed our way and the
answer is obviously we don't know look
we've had radio for a hundred years
right if you'd asked Marconi 100 years
ago so what do you think your invention
will be used for in the year 2007 I'm
sure you would have had a lot of ideas
and they all would have been wrong okay
so to extrapolate what a society that
may have had radio for a hundred
thousand years is doing right pinging
nearby stars might be a high school
science fair project I mean you don't
really know and in a sense we don't even
care whether it's deliberately sent our
way or we just pick up by accident
something that leaked out of their solar
system we don't care at the moment it
seems more likely that you have a better
much better chance if they're
deliberately sending a signal our way
that's the assumption okay two things
one obviously we're we're next door to
you guys were like a mile and a half
away okay so if any of you are
interested in this you know how to find
me my name is Seth I'm the only guy with
that name it's almost SETI actually so
you know call me up and the second thing
is I'll be here for another couple of
minutes if you have any other questions
thanks for your attention
