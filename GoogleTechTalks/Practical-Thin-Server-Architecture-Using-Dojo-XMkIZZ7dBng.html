today I'm p artist and song from Sweden
like this guy Eric and I've never I do
here to talk about thin server
architecture about actually lowering
complexity and having more fun while
working or at least work so that way for
me and I'm going to bash a Google
product and be carried out in tar and
feathers within 30 minutes or so so k
the tomatoes ready I am working for a
local consultancy in Sweden called
napped house and have some international
customers but most of the people working
in the JavaScript scene is here actually
so it's been a wonderful week and I hope
to get back young some time but that's
not what I'm gonna talk about really
under see if i can get this system
working i'm also a lowly goa concrete
sorry no yokan crib and i do some small
things and I evangelize about Doyle
JavaScript library and a lot of
questions that people usually have when
I talk about things server architecture
has to do with well how do you solve
this problem Liz and so forth so I have
some examples on how to solve common
problems in Doyle and here's for some
theory and the obligatory comic and
actually I can do this tube very very
quickly it's all about actually putting
the client on the client and not having
any server side templating at all and
creating a classical client server
environment and I'll try to give very
good reason why this is a very good idea
indeed and why doing something else
increases lot of complexity this is my
view of a kind of classical mid-2000
2010 application that you use
server-side templating you have a lot of
web page building logic let's say four
point
inside the server and then you have
templating and a lot of complex
configuration files maybe not a lot but
still so we're kind of having an idea
about the design and the view and the
client and logic and subjecting that a
lot of knives and horror movies to
separate into tiny parcels from
fertilizing it and then you generate the
client and the view from a kind of a lot
of different templates and I would urge
people not to do this the reason for the
server-side templating and the classical
server-side web frameworks like tapestry
which I like very much and the other
server faces is not because people are
evil because they're really really smart
and this is the best solution to the
problem that was available at that time
the problems with these kind of
frameworks on the server side is of
course that it's the poor distribution
of processing you don't use a client
that's kind of obvious you can this is
actually cheap shot I was not certain if
I should have this or not but this kind
of argument against classical web 1.0
replications and nobody uses those
anymore so you even though you are using
a kind of the server based web framework
you're still a kind of packaging AIX
into the solution on shooting it out so
it kind of works but you get the actual
happening hidden from you by the
framework but this is what I'm trying to
aim at a difficult programming model and
you know if you have a a clause that
does two things at once that is a highly
couple for some reason and maybe change
some things to add some new things and
you don't have a very clear purpose of
that clause that's very bad and that's a
little bit what happens when you kind of
define the client on the server because
it isn't on the server so you can't
define what is going to have in the next
30 minutes or you have a parcel here in
a pool so that you can mix your domains
and also if you using javascript in is
you kind of hidden from you so you don't
see what happens and the ambition here
is to shield the developer from
complexity and what you get is a more
complexity so you can I'll complex it
upon this to she'll the developer from
something that it's actually quite easy
to do the classical client-server
application have a protocol in the
middle and we get a lot of XML files you
tried to force this kind of single
process model of something that is
actually a client server and that is a
problem yeah when it runs so what you
see some decoded yada yeah so are you
saying the same thing all over again do
you have any questions just holler the
mouth and I take them as you feel it so
this is also very bad thing you have a
lot of state management on the servers
even if you have some karate Xcode maybe
you have a table with a thousand items
and you're showing maybe the 20th the
view of that page of a thousand and the
server are cash in this state and it
will resources get used and so forth and
this is not very efficient for when you
have a lot of users outside offline I'm
a google fanboy so I had have a google
fanboy t-shirt and so did my Swedish
quick garrus is interesting and this is
actually it's kind of an edge case not
used really really much but when you
have to use it when a customer or a
project needs to make this done it is
very very hard to add this kind of
offline capabilities if you have a
monolithic kind of server-side web
framework because you don't feel know
where to put it or you have to make kind
of weird and even more complex situation
around this which is kind of
straightforward when you're working with
a separate server or a separate client
or both actually and then con something
that always pops up in my projects at
least probably not internal Google as
much but at some point you always get a
question that
we would like to export this to customer
a or we would like to integrate this
with another kind of internal project to
ASP or so forth or SI p sorry and when
you have again this monolithic kind of
ID of a web application and looking at
it from a single model point of view
which isn't then you are forced maybe to
reinvent the wheel and have another kind
of connection into your logic and of
course are you really spark and have
using really good tools really good this
server frameworks with maybe are not
related to the web then you might
contact to redo a lot of it but still
it's kind of a double-double diameter
I'm not very good at drawing stuff so
these very good pictures are from Chris
type of the side panel foundation and
now also by open IX foundation I don't
know if you'd only since it's really
good and this is essentially what you
seen before and what I'm talking about
unless you didn't get it the first
hundred times I said it that we're going
from this kind of classical model where
a lot of logic is being used in the
server to a more loose model where you
automatically get an interface for
exporting stuff for importing stuff you
have of course the security and the core
business logic on the service always but
the view is on the client to the client
is on the client disease yeah
reduced complexity or really advocating
separating the business logic from the
user interface generation yeah I'm
Congress is it that means the user
interface is balma browser or would it
be you know perfectly acceptable to have
a layer that's going to generate the
user interface on a server but that
actually is communicating back through a
clean interface to the actual business
project so the two pieces are separate I
get it the question was is it a mile
care thing if you can have the clean
separate of concerns that are clean UI
but it is on the server but still a very
clean separation from the business logic
and my answer that i think is still a
very bad idea because this user
interface layer is still not on the
user's computer is on the server so you
are I mean that doesn't mean it's
impossible people using it everyday and
i'm using it by myself in a lot of
projects i'm only saying would imply and
trying to argue in for that if you take
away this kind of server-side templating
it is clean now but it seems you're
mixing domains it tends to get complex
and it's easier for you to make errors
so that's why i think it's better yeah i
had a lot of conversations i wrote on my
blog a couple of or a years ago about
the end of the web server frameworks
part one and two and that was not very
well received at all actually and I can
understand that because it's kind of an
inflammatory and I kind to argue why we
shouldn't do this and the problem is
that everybody in the whole world are
using server based web frameworks so
it's not the right time to say it or
maybe it was and we had a lot of great
discussions and one person called
garnish Prasad working in Australia and
his team had a similar but very more far
more specific idea called Sophia
service-oriented fronting architecture
which is like my thin server
architecture but very very detailed it's
very good read actually for many of my
ardent but he is proposing that you're
supposed to consume so XML services any
kind of so environment and that's very
specific to to the Environmental Working
still a good read though
also Justin Meyer author of one dose of
JavaScript MVC has a similar kind of
model and Mario violent who is a hard
rocker working in Portugal also former
CEO the Ministry of Justice Portugal lot
of other people so I guess this is just
not only my idea I try to just put in
for it I don't care if you put it thin
thick light yellow or whatever service
tech true if you pull it anything at all
I just want people to try to try it out
and try to use it and make it as simple
as possible and not get peperonity
specific details nobody what you do put
the client in the client to let that too
that there's other products already
using this kind of approach in many many
years you have smart client tibco wave
maker these are actually i des for
generating web applications and the end
result of these ides are actually very
clean UI layer who commits who has
consumed services on the server side or
mashup systems and when I try to boil
down what I would like people to do in
as few rules as possible I wrote this
and then I realize that this is actually
just one rule put the client on the
client and four different views of it
and I would why I tried to write point
one is why did right part one which
leads much much simpler to code
something in JavaScript if you know
yells get very very well then doing it
in Java and that's my personal
experience I'm not the best program in
the world but having a dynamic language
to work with it's much quicker
especially for you I tossed in my
experience so if you can utilize
leverage that it's very very good and
then you should communicate to consume
services of course don't choose
server-side templating because that's
what it's all about and that boils down
the server to using your security and
business logic obviously since logic is
whatever you like as long as it's not
Jesus for interface so I hope it's kind
of easy to to understand the easy to get
mad at an easy to use a sword went back
and forth you can discuss or with me or
whoever and that leaves a very very
clean model which was my idea when I
write the first thing we don't have any
configuration files
that will generate the user interface we
just have business logic and some kind
of URLs that the client then connects
back to maybe have backwards i axe and
comment and so forth but at least one on
this kind of drawing is very very simple
of course it can be other complexities
but from this point you all produce I
work this it gives me much more time to
play with my kids or bring some beer or
whatever Rob than just bashing myself
over the head with a bat and trying to
force the system do something that it
can't really do so benefits I also
actually stolen this kind of layer from
Chris site because had a good blog on it
it's scalable obviously if you put stuff
away client you don't have to use cpu on
the server obviously and this is also
cheap shot to get AI acts of course you
get immediate use response but a lot of
a lot of I I haven't read through all
frameworks everything they do of course
but I see examples now and then when you
have some IX at some points but then you
kind of get this the whole page
generation again and it's easier for
yourself to control how your application
will work and look and get very smooth
flow on it if you do everything just on
one side of the client instead of forced
into this kind of weird framework but
the best is organized programming model
and what happens to the team where we
work like this since we have explicit
roles of client and server we don't need
to pretend or have the mock-ups or
proxies yeah as much cetera et cetera
the debugging is kind of fair we have
server devours those who are client
about logs in Firebug and we don't have
to have some kind of oddball routing
back and forth that shows logs where
they really aren't happening and that
means that we can have a synchronous
development and what I mean by that is
that I sit at my table and then I
generate a widget or some kind of user
flow or something like this I consume a
lot of data I drew on the tables or maps
thing and I've never been to the server
I guess it all by myself and work
completed synchronously and then I have
some kind idea of what I need what kind
of date I need and I write a local file
with this information that I pull into
my own client and what everything works
as good as I can make it then I go to
the server guy said could you please
give me this kind of format and this and
that and then we have this automatic
client protocol server and forced
separation extreme silos wonderful and
when they have a problem they work it
out and they know if they break the
protocol is pretty obvious that they are
broken it is not like oh god how could
that work because you see what you're
doing and all the other way around if I
break something ever read something the
wrong way or present something that's my
problem they can go on and continue it
there or product and that's been been
really good yeah client-side state
management I know which which page on a
table I mean I know what if the tree is
open or close to what buttons has should
be highlighted and so forth so this
server has no state whatsoever there's
no service state at all which makes a
server very very very simple to use and
of course offline applications is really
simple to implement since you have
reliant and also the interoperability
which I hinted at earlier that if you
have a clean restful interface or
something I came to that you don't have
to specify follow standards all the
times don't want to but you have a URLs
that can very well documented that you
can pull or push data to a from then you
can just go to the guy who asked you to
make on a portability project and saying
that it's just done it takes zero hours
that's cute is there everything is just
it's no we did it from scratch so you
get this for free if you use a clean
separation of concerns
and here is the tar and feathers part
and Google web toolkit Eastern example
is a wonderful solution I really like it
because it really cool and its enormous
amount of effort and a really weird idea
where got into that and similar products
and I considered a wonderful solution
for a program that doesn't exist but and
just because its like the fear of flying
or fear of music book in the film and
the fear of the client and we are very
free we must shielded from that because
it's it's you know it's dangerous people
out there you can't trust them and you
do this very complex solution and i
think that the easier thing is just do
it sell shoes by nike or something so
why don't we want to do this in the
client and i think that the reason for
people wanting to solve all the problems
server side is because they are used to
work as a server and the last time they
look at the client was around 2003 or
something like that the browser
incompatibilities and yadda yadda etc
etc a real horror story and then okay we
solve this server side we had templates
for it etc and then you have control of
everything at just one spot these this
leads to SI us to discuss a lot of extra
complexities that is not a parent at the
time of the creation so so i mean the
the the reason is to make coding web as
less complex and it were I mean the
using google web toolkit javaserver
faces tapestry four or five were echoed
wicked is it's really really effective
and really productive as compared to
doing everything yourself or juicing
weird their browser models and of
knowing where stuff is and I try to say
to people look for the keys where they
are instead of where there is light so
you get no find them that's kind of a
silly but anyway at nowadays we have a
client side is frameworks who are really
really good jquery Daurio etc etc we
wrap a lot of communication events w as
everybody else is a unit
event model you probably have as well so
regards a browser you have the same kind
of object and so forth we wrap 2d
graphics I think it or use alone in
doing that has nothing to do with IX at
all I just want to push it because
people don't see that it's really cool
and of course the fabric loss plans oh
and so forth so a lot of arguments that
were used in having everything control
in the server or not real applicable
anymore and what what happens then is
that we let the people that code the UI
does not have to be involved in some of
the more complex things on the server
and it's easy to get there if you put
everything on the server I have
templating so forth and vice versa this
the guy is sick today you have to do
this but I don't know much above script
but we cut it up somewhere and then get
some kind of bad hacking on the template
they could push out the client and if we
have a clean separation of concerns what
happens then is that we get ordinary
files there's a databases or build steps
or no stuff or projects so we do that
next week when we have time to you just
have text files that you edit and that's
it and front-end developers that's me
same thing I have text files JavaScript
text files and some CSS and HTML
snippets and they just no use them it's
local on my local drive no magic there
the back and developers can finally
start to do what they're supposed to be
doing so another problem instead of
counseling the yeah i know i'm having a
jumping on a dead horse on but anyway
then the front and goodness what I
really like is a synchronous development
that we can work we're the kind of a
simple text file again I just load it
and tweak it then mail it back and forth
or put it somewhere and we have a kind
of protocol that is more or less
hopefully okay and I think that you
understand what I'm not trying to say
now I just have some kind of scenarios
that gets sillier and sillier no and I
kind of angry with when you do a kind of
template you know you have templating
you have to take this beautiful sight in
HTML and CSS and
torture it into some mad scheme so and
you have to do this it takes a lot of
resources actually and another thing a
customer told me that we want to have
some kind of shorting for admissibility
face and we had have the cool curves for
dates and oh by the way we have to
change which quickly between day month
week year and also have the kind of
component that switch this for all the
charts simultaneously is that okay and
if you had done this on the server side
we just started out with it takes a lot
of resources to generate these images
and would hold the state anyway and now
with the door you as an example is
pulling the data once cash it and then I
massage it a bit and have different
kinds of views on it and it goes really
quickly now this herb doesn't know
anything because it doesn't have any
state or graphics or knowledge about
that and at least a late night scenario
which I actually I have a friend in
France who is very much much better than
me at the sign and CSS and HTML who
actually had some part of application
where PHP which was generated by xslt
which then in turn generated the client
application and this was an extreme
horror movie and I don't know why they
did that but apparently was very good
for some reason and this is also a shape
shop because people don't work this way
it shouldn't work this way there's a lot
of obvious solutions where you can use a
service like web framework and not
having to have this enormous ball of mud
but then again there are companies where
you have that and and if you were using
a client-server separation you would
have forced to be avoided a lot of these
issues without actually having to go
through them and think about so that's
the model and then people say okay but
shall we do all our client in JavaScript
that's that's mad and you see before if
you haven't coded loggia script or use
that a lot of frameworks you see one
HTML page with 2500 long pay
interspersed JavaScript own click events
and stuff like that and again that's not
the way it works anymore or it doesn't
have to you have the door for instance
is one of x2 also i think the duel kids
that have a very modular client model
where you have a component where clause
which can contain other clauses
hierarchically and you have a special
page for this is the clause this is the
snippet of HTML and you don't have to
see this at the page at all whatsoever
so you can work with the way idiots and
they communicate to the server strong
data model and this is really hard
because I let's see some code I mean if
you haven't coded I say dog is a good
example how to use this thing server
architecture but then I have to explain
to all your bits this is a little bit I
try to do as a quick as I can and then
if you don't care then don't ask if you
do is just holler and I try to take the
question if you can see this this is
very very simple example of how to make
a very bad doggy page you have a
configuration you set a variable that's
tell story to parse the page you don't
have to do this if you have a lot of
HTML you don't want to parse all the
tags and why would you want to do that
is because though you have a kind of
known w3c standardized model which is
evil no it's not it works quite cut okay
but it isn't really standardized that
you use this kind of property for Doyle
type on any element you want and then
the poster going through the page finds
this and then instantiate the kind of we
did you want and this works just as well
for your own custom widgets in the same
namespace you have as Ford or some
widgets to very easy to plug into and do
hierarchical idiots with just one div
actually and this is due to the Doyle
loader it's not alone in this but it's I
don't think many other frameworks have
this kind of loader resolving and
hierarchical look up system that or your
house for client videos hello
yeah and if you would like to utilize
leveraged oils with your system for your
own you can just put your own folder
next to those of Doyle it looks like
this will now unpack it and then you
have a kind of this is a cool or not so
cool he is small little weed it I did
called scaffold and we're going to look
at this main you have a script file this
is not all this of course and there's a
Doyle clause or kind of clothes you
declare your clothes and you say where
is the template stamp it for this one
and now you might be thinking k you have
a thousand different snippet two
different weed yet that means that a lot
of accesses to the server and the
application gets more sorry slow but you
have a build system and offline build
system and oh it can compress everything
into us one single file and then it can
snort it back man steady and here is
this HTML snippets and here you have
templating I really love templating
though you have a jungle template
language as well as this very simple
template language but these are client
site templates on the client's computer
working with the client side clause so
it's very very good coupling and you
have you know exchange for this dollar
name thing goes to the this nine inside
the class I just show you and how kind
of take back and then we use that in a
page and we use just the door type
equals and then you have this new widget
which is created kind of simple and this
is what it looks like you just wanted to
be able to very quickly put up a new
site for a friend without jumping
through hoops then I had just one widget
with a game of the names and URLs then
it built the system menu and I also want
to know where or Google going to build
the space elevator Japan is kind of
beating you to it right now you have the
resources you have the cool imagery the
space you know sci-fi theme you should
be doing a space elevator really cool me
waiting on and now it's time for what we
were actually talking about
namely the thin sort of texture but the
doorway and JavaScript MVC and Yahoo
user interface and x2 a lot of other
have these kind of ideas that have a
separation of concern in a data model
inside the page and an event bus chris
is also involved of course this and have
weighed yet and it goes to a kind of
store and the store has very general
kind of methods on it and so you can
start out without one store that these
local files then swap before another
store that maybe consumes XML files or
do some kind of rescue work on some kind
of service for something that and people
ask me what kind of stores do you have
what kind of stores the door get
with and it's a host of different
stories and I'm not going to go through
every one but a lot of stores I'm
actually asked everybody else is I'm
writing a book about though your poor
learning Doyle with about soon I think
very small book shameless plug but I
have to say that and here's the other
stores and this is from that book
actually I kind of stole my own material
and the most impacting store interesting
is all right now is it called JSON dress
store which reads and right Jason in a
very good rest interface to account
addressed server ribbon raves or
variable examples that I sneeze and we
have for kind of interface for kind of
AP is rewrite notification and identity
not all kind of bags the data needs
identity maybe just want the store that
holds a lot of things that don't all
right can't be overlapping and and this
must be a complex use and I say no it's
not sorry you have you instantiate this
store in the page and then you
instantiate the data grid which is the
table sortable table kind of complex
that's it when I get some that looks
like that and also will kind of dough
your markup things that you see here
everything that is the category markup
can be used instead programmatically so
you can just skip the market had a
normal HTML page and then just have a
your own JavaScript loaded like a query
does and create everything
programmatically it so we kind of either
way you want to do it
and this can get get fairly messy kinda
quick so either you want your own
programmatic file we want to create your
own widgets which gets loaded and here
is another kind of store example service
to work consumes read-only services and
yes I read story is written right to
some kind of dangers to her that's cool
it's actually as the cool picture I mean
I it's evident from what I've been
speaking about but I just want to do
that so how do you use this JSON rest or
supposed to be have a career as service
on some kind of server which are ready
to use internally you have either you
can just go to the URL as a here is my
real service you can configure it a bit
back and forth depending on how URLs are
generated by it or you can point it to a
simple method description file which is
my next slide actually who kind of
defines services both rest service and
others and is used in though you and
another couple of other things that I
thought oh right now and then when you
have the service you create a decent
rest or either using a target URL or a
file describing how it works and then
you just get value set value save and it
yeah it cash estate them you can have a
timeout you can flush it it also has a
schema that you can verify against the
server JSON schema which is also a new
standard coming up and this is what's an
SMD file looks like and it's really
simple since the JSON XML is a binary
format as well and this is not so it's
readable and here is the parameters that
you don't have to define if you don't
want to but if you define them according
to the ace on a schema that i'm going to
show later it will verify this de string
this an integrand so forth and the asian
schema wasn't support references to
other objects and circular references
and it is definable in itself so it's
really kind of cute it's really cool so
I recommend to check out the scheming
and
give me information if you have some
sort should say which I hadn't and they
said is going to end with an example of
the schema you have an object a JSON
object from the server looks like that
and here's how the schema would look
like it's kind of verbose for a
different type of basic objects if a
integer you have max and min value stuff
like that but this why I'm showing this
is because another kind of argument
against using this stay on the client
and not using XML is that you don't have
a scheme out then we cannot be certain i
started sector but now you actually have
a scheme and yeah and then i have a
shameless plug for something else that
is actually open source the trouble
people i now are making a product that
is using java on the back end let's
called wave maker and it generates using
Doyle 1 dot oh I think and generates
verified so you can stop in to tomcat
and it's a dragon drop ID kind of thing
and this component with Doyle shorting
integrated I just made it and it's not
really very public yet but you can mail
mail mail thank you so that's my carrot
or any immediate questions hate mail
arguments not as such no
okay so it seems like you're advocating
putting the doesn't you you are
advocating I am I and on the fly yes yes
and if I it sort of a recast my earlier
question running through your your
argument I see strong case for
separating the client from the server
top but it wasn't immediately obvious
what what the advantages of putting the
client on the client necessary okay and
one of the things I'm thinking about in
particular that you know in the absence
of something that's a like gears yeah
it's very difficult for one client page
to talk to another client painkiller
yeah I'm separate URLs you suddenly no
need to involve the server yeah I asked
for data to the fly yeah which means
that in some sense you're always forced
to put parts of the client on the server
so why not as much as I well I i read
that for certain things if you have a
specific kind of application you have to
talk between pages or my favorite
augment against thin server structure is
that you you want to you want to
bookmark the page and this is a single
page application talking about so you
don't just have one page and the only
solution for that it's actually to have
a kind of you can't obviously you have
to hope that the use your a smart and
see that this is the same URL it doesn't
really change or their hash mark
sometimes but doesn't change so you have
at every page some kind of button that
sees bookmark this page and then you get
a kind of a bookmark URL with the kind
of hash that generated for the current
state of the client and then you need
the server if you kind of pay copy and
paste that will mail at somebody who
paste it into the URL clicks on it then
the server will understand okay here's
the hash to state the client then it
will have to use server-side templating
were no it hasn't but that's a simple
solution to kind of seed the client
inside the page with that state and get
it so it's kind of circumspect but
that's I don't think that's putting the
client a loop on the server it's yet
it's it it's a helper function actually
for restoring state and the reason I
think that you still shouldn't put as
much of the client to the server as
possible I think I put I stated the
arguments that it gets much lower and it
gets more complex and it's easier that
people step on the toes in the project
and you have to convert HTML into
template language and and so forth and
you can't utilize leverage JavaScript
that's it I have a question does anybody
work with with spidering and search and
AdWords here no because people the other
thing that people are telling me okay
are you cute maybe if we end interwebs
but you know we're having a user-centric
application here we making tons of money
I'll to Google on Adwords and if we have
a single page application and we don't
have any internal routing exposed and we
will not be seeing we're not I can't
make that pick one page one who Paige
hundred anymore so what we do and i say
i had no idea maybe you should use just
service centigram for crying out loud
but i know that google has been a spy
during flash and i think that the next
logical step is to begin to have some
kind of stand there for how single page
client heavy applications are exposing
the routing so if you have maybe 20
pages which are just peace or the same
page which is show like cards like this
it feels like an old application only
quick then it must be exposed that in a
way that is provable so you don't have
one page with an elephant on it and say
I born in tustin page some cool but
links on it so it must be approvable in
some point so I'm looking to you guys to
solve this it was ok and then we're done
I so thanks for coming and if you want
you can mail me and also can any more
questions so that's cool check out away
okay great thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
