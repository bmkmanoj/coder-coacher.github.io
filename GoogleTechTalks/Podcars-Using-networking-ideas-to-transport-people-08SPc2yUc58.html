to this tactic my name is Jurgen and I
am very pleased to have been cast us on
here today to talk about pod cars please
give him a warm welcome thank you all so
I'm Bank Gustafson and i'm the CEO for a
very small start-up company in Sweden
called beam ways and I've come here to
show you a little bit about pod cars and
what they can do for transportation in
this new era when we have a few problems
and I think these are maybe the worst
problems we are facing and one of them
is the climate crisis where the course
or if not the largest source out d HD
which I think they are do it for sure
the hardest to replace and we'll also
have a problem with actually not having
enough oil for our cars very soon the
international watch board for this says
we have 15 years at current rates 15
years only and of course with a lot of
course we also have problems with
congestion in the streets and start to
do something about that because there's
no more land
so one thing that's been tried and tried
a lot here in California is to build
more roads for all this traffic and now
it's kind of full I think here and then
you go to elevated roads or dig tunnels
and you have the big dig in Boston
that's the most expensive infrastructure
project ever so I don't think people
like tunnels so much for the price
elevated it's also expensive of course
so and even if that wasn't true it goes
against our goals it increases the oil
use it increases the greenhouse gases
rather than the other way around so
that's not good next thing we could try
is to use something else than gas in the
cars and what have been done in two
countries in the world that Sweden and
the USA is to bet on ethanol and I think
that's a bit working less and less well
now we can see that the biomass will not
last very long or two very large
percentage of them vehicles and we see
already that they cut down the
rainforests and other types of valuable
biotopes to get land for for all of
these growing of corn or sugar cane or
whatever and this is all already been
shown to to lead to food shortages
although it's not the only reason for
food shortage at this point
and so the ethanol people say okay we go
for the cellulose because that's not
something you eat the problem with using
the cellulose is of course somewhere all
of the fertilizer stuff that's in the
ground goes and goes into the cellulose
so if you remove the cellulose from your
your grounds where you harvest this you
won't get many years before the sword is
arid and not useful and also erosion of
the land is about a hundred times higher
if you use the cellulosic part of in the
particular sugar cane case so does not
increase the mean speed is however the
problem with this in our big three
problems on top so I wouldn't say this
solves and a big part of our
transportation problems and the car
industry having realized this they
couldn't fool the government's anymore
they turn to the next step which would
be batteries or fuel cells and batteries
is coming along quicker than fuel cells
but it's still a few years away but the
problem is when you roll out large fleet
of lithium battery powered vehicles you
will find out that there's very little
lithium on the planet compared to what
you need I don't know why this is so a
little known anyhow there are other
battery chemistries likes sync oxygen
but not much effort is going into
developing those which also passes me
and fuel cell some call it hydrogen and
hydrogen is supposed to be the most
abundant power source the problem is
that is bound in water and you need to
split the water first and that takes a
lot of energy so in fact it's just a
very wasteful type of battery the only
advantage of this type of batteries you
can recharge it very quickly compared to
a normal battery because you just pour
more hydrogen in the time but the
problem with the hydrogen storage is
very high also because you have no good
ways of storing hydrogen you can cool it
to near zero k which takes a lot of
energy or you can compress it which
takes a lot of energy so all of these
inefficiencies add up to around thirty
percent efficiency from electricity to
the wheel so that's much worse than
batteries if batteries could be found
however all of these disadvantages cured
it would not increase the mean speed
because we still have the congestions in
all our streets and most traffic
planners think that we can solve this
just by adding transit and if any one of
you lives in some shoe say that you know
that there's a really nice tram line
there is only one problem Noah rides it
so they have actually sixty dollars per
passenger in subsidies from the city
sixty dollars and why don't people
travel in the trams because it stops at
all stations you get like 10 12 miles
per hour means bead and that's along the
line and you don't want to go along the
line you will go between two other
points so you have to to change to
another line if there is one and in in i
would say in the u.s. it's seldom that
you can find a reasonable route on
public transit and if even if you do you
have to do multiples
and to build more of these transit food
of course relieve the situation somewhat
but construction of a tram line is very
costly and very slow because you have to
dig up to treat you have to rear out all
the traffic you have a long planning
process to be able to do all this and
even if you do it doesn't even pay for
its own operation from the ticket fares
so the more people write it the more
losses for the city so anyway how our
main goals it doesn't increase the mean
speed in fact it decreases the mean
speed even for the drivers because you
take the way lanes from the streets to
allow the tram lines so no good at this
point traffic planners and others they
are a bit confused because they didn't
have any more tricks in the bag and what
we think in the very tiny pod car
communities that we have the key to
solving all these local or regional
transportation problems and what organ
pod course it's an attempt to unify the
advantages of transit with you
advantages of the car and the main
advantage is we take from transit is the
electricity power source and the vehicle
are is not owned by the person it's
owned by the operator and thus you can
share vehicles you need to build like a
tenth of the number of vehicles as you
would with course because they're used
by multiple persons during the same day
also of course it reduces the oil
dependency by reducing the number of car
trips that are necessary and as oil
prices go up of course more and more
pressure will come on other forms of
transportation and people don't want to
reduce their mean speed to the bike or
tram speed they want to go as fast as
you can go in the car so what we do to
achieve that is to take the individual
right part of the car and and the
possibility to go anywhere you want in a
network of roads and thus we increase
the mean speed compared to transit
because of no stops no change overs and
compared to car traffic because of no
congestion or at least a very controlled
type of congestion where you only have
to reduce bead somewhat not this
haphazardly occurring congestion
situations you have on the road
so what our podcast em-pod quarter and I
should mention that this was called PRT
for personal Rapid Transit for a large
number of years it's no new invention
it's been around since the sixties at
least on the conceptual and test track
level which we will see soon it has
small light vehicles so you don't have
to share your vehicle with any other
person unless you're traveling with more
people typically it can I be three or
four people maximum in these vehicles
and this means that the vehicle total
weight could be like 500 kilos for the
vehicle and 500 kilos for the passengers
we also enable everyone to go even if
you have a wheelchair or if you have a
kid in the trolley if you have a bike
you can get into these vehicles and to
the right you can see the first
rendition of the beam waist vehicle at
the top and then another vendor at the
bottom and you can see that there to buy
two seats in the top one and one sofa
with three seats in the bottom one and
these are the main configurations so how
could we reach some capacity we need to
go very often on track we need to go at
least every three seconds and if you say
this to a transit person they go through
the roof because there really anything
below one minute is impossible in
transit so then you have to nudge them
and say okay what about the freeway
there you go at 80 miles per hours on a
sunny day and you still have two seconds
between vehicles and these are automatic
there's no no cellular phone calls to
the driver during
that period so how can we achieve
automatic vehicles with short haired
ways and how can we achieve very little
land use of course we need to go up in
the air that's a prerequisite for this
to work because there you're not
competing with our other types of
vehicles which are not automatic and
you're not competing for the land and if
you remember previously all vehicles are
small it's a maximum white way to one
Tom meaning that you can make a guideway
here which can only support one Tom
vehicles this is very different from a
roadway where you have to support 60 tom
trucks plus some bonus for the overloads
you know they have and thanks to this we
can also have a rather long distance
between the posts and it's made of steel
I've seen someone trying to make it of
aluminum but I would doubt this should
work but typically it's deal and one
very important thing is that all the
stations are on an extra side racket as
you can see at the bottom of the lower
picture there this allows the other
vehicles to pause anyone who likes to
stop at a certain station and this is
how the line speed can kept be kept up
all of these concepts of course is
stolen from car traffic the difference
and the drawback compared to the car of
course is that you need to go to your
nearest guide way by foot or bike pit
possibly but typically you would have a
300-meter that's a thousand feet walk
that's just good for you
you can also add value to the system by
for instance using it for goods or waste
removal we call that virtual networks
because they wouldn't go onto the same
set of station as a separate set of
station another type of vehicle but it's
the same network of guide ways to
control all of this we need to have a
multi tyre control and operational
software and of course communication
hardware which is redundant and very
safe this is typically done in a way
that each vehicle has sensors for the
previous vehicles and tries to keep the
distance and of course we have on demand
traffic i didn't mention that but
typically there are all always vehicles
available and at the station when you
get there so you don't you just jump in
the first vehicle and you're off you
never wait which is not true because
typically you would wait twenty percent
of the times you would wait one minute
that's according to many different
simulation programs so that level of
waiting which is not very much so each
vehicle goes its own route to the
destination please look at the top
drawing there of the network there are
multiple paths to go and of course each
vehicle steers itself to where it wants
to go when the network grows this also
provides redundancy just in any other
computer network so if one of these gets
blocked by a vehicle you can always go
around this
not true of course for tiny network like
this one we offered for Santa Cruz but
as the network grows you get the
redundancy you would want to have
nevertheless you need to have very
reliable vehicles of course so what the
centralized control does is of course
all the things around it the ticketing
function the entertainment functions the
advertising functions but most of all it
does the centralized load balancing or
read you know at least so it tells their
vehicles there's a slight Q over here so
please go that way although it's a bit
longer accident prevention of course is
local you don't want to be relying on
being able to communicate with the
central control all the time is that's a
rather slow communication channel
comparatively and of course as I said
before rerouting so we have the basic
framework for pod cars but within this
there are so many ways of doing it and
most of them have been tried actually
you can have the vehicles on top of the
beams or under it you can have direct
single direction lines as in the top
drawing here or double direction lines
as it in the bottom drawing you can have
rotating electric motors or linear
melters if you have linear motors you
can have them in the car or in this in
the guideway and you cannot batteries
you can have a powerade have a fuel cell
actually if you're
in that way the steering and switching
of course is very critical because this
has been has to be very reliable as have
has to be inside each vehicle and there
are so many ways you can do this with
different kinds of wheels or extra
magnets as you suck you into one of the
walls and there's also the other variety
which they don't those guys don't even
want to call themselves pod cars
normally it's called dual mode which
means you can get off the guideway and
it's also a regular car at the same time
an electric car so this solves actually
the 300-meter walk problem but there are
drawbacks of course you need to have a
crashworthy vehicle which means it's
probably gone away one and a half ton
empty so the guide by weight is doubled
you need to have the high rail
reliability although this vehicle could
have could have been bumped into in the
street before
so what are the actual benefits and this
bunch is for for the passenger of course
the big benefit is that you get the core
like service level except for that
little walk you get a high mean speed
and if it's congestion in the streets
you get a higher means be done with a
car and accidents this country kills
40,000 each year on the streets and
maybe five would be killed in this type
of system because so many accidents are
driver related and in this case even if
it's vehicle-related we do have multiple
safety functions to avoid crashes and
you also get benefit economically by
sorry often reduced number of course per
household because the mundane commuting
can be done with the pod course and you
can use your SUV when you go actually
into the countryside
oh sorry I mentioned the walk you can't
have stuff in the pod car of course as
you can have all stuff lying around in
your trunk for years and the vehicle
size is well that's the same as the car
you have one size for the society
there's another set of advantages and
disadvantages one advantage for all of
us is the reduced emissions another
advantage for the cities that you can
remove the subsidized bus and tram
systems and save money and save street
space and in this case it's very obvious
that you would not have to subsidize the
operation of this because the operating
cost is very low so you can take that
from ticket revenue and this is very
important reduce the parking areas and
in the long term you could reduce the
number of lanes in in the roads possibly
but parking could go quite quickly when
you when you have pod course to certain
area and this is a great value for land
developers Landis is expensive and for
instance in San Jose half of the land is
devoted to the car the wheels can reduce
that by a little fraction that would be
lots of dollars and noise levels should
be of course much lower than for a
regular car and its control in a better
way
but the key point I think for
communities is this is a much cheaper
way to add more transportation capacity
than trying to build elevated roads or
tram lines or dig down tunnels or tear
down houses to build another Lane the
problem is that nevertheless it's a
large investment and technology has not
been proven and this is this seems to be
the made you one for communities and you
need a large network you need to be able
to go where you want to go within the
system there's no standard so far
everyone makes their own type of system
and communities want to have a diversity
of vendors with compatible products of
course that's going to be in the long
run and then we have the visual
intrusion of the guideways as a negative
in at least in central areas of the
citizen in the Europe this is a very big
issue in the u.s. it's not that big I
don't know why
so as I told you before the history this
goes back to the 60s and the first
actual systems were early 70s i'm going
to show you just for fun a few films
taking it in this period there around
one minute each this is no nothing
sorry
this is the Aerospace Corporation down
in Pasadena they made a test track and
this is a scale model and you can see
the level of technology they had at
their disposal at this time this is the
vehicle that's a one to ten scale model
as a wire rack boards full of primitive
digital circuits and that's the linear
motor down here power pickup and wheels
for suspension but despite this
primitive technology they could do nice
things with it and that was the switch
and the switches magnetics as I told you
before it sucks the vehicle to one side
by turning on one or the other magnet
there and they had somehow programmed is
probably hard coded in in the logic to
do certain maneuvers on the tracks like
this and this is as you can see a very
short headway they're almost touching
and I don't think that would have been
safety approved at that point and I'm
sure it should be safety approved today
but this project is really impressing
this was built in Germany in the late
70s and as you can see this test track
is still a test track but it's bit
larger it has six stations it has 24
vehicles and as you can see there are
different vehicle sizes and here is the
main trick of the system some vehicles
go under the beams some vehicles go on
top of the beams of course this give you
a dual direction system with just one
beam the problem is that the same
vehicles can't go in both directions so
actually have two disconnected systems
and I've not been able to figure out
what this actually means in terms of
capacity and performance so here's the
hanging type of system and of course
they had all the station stuff they had
a ticketing functions all that this was
this was read before deployment in
cities in 1978 they had the safety
approval and then the US government told
the German government Oh your euro you
must spend all of your research dollar
on or d marks on weaponry a military
research you're not allowed to do any
this was at the height of the Cold War
so they pulled the plug on this project
at this stage
well this is the only time a suspended
system has been approved for for traffic
with passengers now this one which is
the last one I'll show you of the old
ones this one is actually in operation
maybe one of you you have been at the
West Virginia University Morgantown
there they have this which they call the
PRT but there are eight seats in each
cabin so it theoretically it's called
the GRT group rapid transit so how they
do they do this when you get to the
station you select your destination then
you have to wait just to see if another
passenger comes around with the same
destination within a certain number of
minutes if not you're off and then it
goes directly to your destination you
never stop in intermediate stations so
this proves most of the pod car comes
cept the only thing it doesn't prove is
the possibility to go different
direction because it's a straight line
with five stations a lot of activity was
going on no I had another one this is
second generation so to speak this was
in around year 2000 in Chicago and oh
sorry oh very sorry
maybe you can do this better than I
don't know it's for this today
I always keep that it's not a film it's
on the YouTube of course we had other
systems we are the RMS in France which
was very advanced in 1973 they ran
vehicles with one decimeters basing it
was a laser guidance between the
vehicles they never got it through the
safety approval though there was some
other ones the CBS system which you can
see to the right was rather large test
track several station lots of vehicles
also got a no-go for that project so but
all the time small ventures have been
boiling beneath the surface and now it's
we think that this market can actually
take off and this as you can see there
are lots of vendors around there are
even more than these but these are the
most promising i think and ultra the top
one already has an order date delivering
vehicles right now to heathrow airport
in london we have a Dutch company which
have delivered to the schiphol airport
and we have a Swedish Korean company
which have a test track in epsilon
Sweden first guy Tran system jpod system
mr. megaraid st you and be my switch i
represent and we'll take a look at ultra
and vectors here find the mouse pointer
there it is this is the part of a
promotional film for ultra and you can
see it's animated but now it's for real
so what they do have is a test track in
Cardiff and then they are building a
real tracking him through right now this
is their vehicle
as you can see soon this is this is just
a small car it doesn't have a special
steel guideway it runs on a concrete or
tarmac the only thing that's new here
there's no driver and instead you have a
few lasers at the front which bounced
off those curbs sides there it's really
very simple system it's battery-powered
and the only advanced thing about it is
that they dock the battery or a
connector to the guideway at the station
so they charge whenever they're in the
station the charge batteries and still
it would be workable in in a lot of
situations but not in a big city because
this batteries would would not keep up
with the the load you would need to have
they would deplete during the day and
also we think @v ways that this truck is
very ugly and it's around 2.2 meters
wide for a single direction line
but it's workable
and here of course they you can see the
course standing at the red light there
are no red lights because it's automatic
control in a pod power system they've
been approved for passenger transit in
2003 with a four-second headway then we
come to the Swedish project which
actually got me interested in this field
I read about their starting to building
this test track that you see now and
this has a steel track it has a wheel
bite switch meaning that you have wheels
which move up or down or something to
make it go left to right and switches
and it has linear motors in the guideway
which we think is a real big drawback
here you can see the linear motors all
the way I cost a lot of money and cost a
lot of copper to produce all those
motors it's around 20 times as many
motors as if you would have them in the
cars but the good thing about linear
motors is that you don't need traction
on the wheels you can have a slip and
here you can see I think the switching
function that's a motor
now it comes later soon you will see the
switching wheels
there you are and now is folded down for
going this direction and goes outside
the rail layer it's reasonably safe
except if you if to stop in the middle
those wheels can be a bit problematic
this track is 1.3 meters wide so it's a
bit better than the ultra track then we
go to skype town which is a more
futuristic approach they have a
suspended design as you can see in the
top and there's very aerodynamic shape
of this vehicle and it sees only two in
this image there i also have a four
seater more regular pod but typically
they would want people to ride in two
seaters because of the reduced energy
use which is in turn because they want
to go really fast 100 miles per hour and
they have maglev no wheels they say but
her wheels anyway and they have a linear
motor I don't remember if it's in the
tracker in the pulpit they also
reinvented the magnetic switching from
aerospace corporation somehow to go left
to right without moving parts and your
neighbors with NASA Ames and hopefully
they will be able to build a test track
in the sames next year and their guide
way is only half meter wide which i
think is really good
so this is the system we are developing
right now in Sweden it's called the beam
waist it's also suspended design but we
stick to the wheels we think maglev is a
bit adding complexity to what's really
already complex problem could be a
future development but what we did here
is to allow the vehicle to tilt back and
forth which allows us to have very steep
grades or slopes and this in turn allows
us to have the stations at the ground
instead of up in the air which is the
normal case and specifications 50 kph
half metre wide track again and as you
can see normally double Direction tracks
so we save some on not having as many
poles and we gain a lot in capacity very
regular around rotating motor no linear
motor and that's because we get traction
inside much safer inside the beam then
if it would right on top or something
where it can rain or snow so actually
the wheels are inside the beam not under
the beam of course
so why did I say say that maybe
something is happening on the
marketplace because there are projects
that's been ordered to projects have
been ordered on three quotations that we
want to system what does it cost three
cities where of two are really close to
here some say Santa Cruz and there's a
small town in Britain and there are more
coming up sweden new york state and the
pictures are this is a section attract
from heathrow being being built as you
see and this is a rendition of how it
could look in Masdar in united arab
emirates where it actually is going
below ground because it's too hot for
them to have on top and that's that's it
is built right now so it's easier to go
below ground if you build the track
system at the same time to build the
rest of the city so i just wanted to
show you what could happen here at
Google this is the Google Earth image of
the Google campus and I added a little
track system here and I think you can
see that this is the main office here's
the crittenden and over here are other
buildings down here and there are 12
stations this is a really dense Network
normally wouldn't build it maybe this
dance but to get a more interesting
interesting layout i reduced the size of
the circus to 200 meters we're 12
stations 70 vehicles eight thousand
daily trips that's a guess I knew it was
eight thousand working here so maybe you
do a trip to
another house every other day or
something like that the mean trip length
the mean trip time two minutes to go
wherever you want to go one kilometer
fifteen percent of the weight if you
have 70 vehicles with more vehicles no
waiting actually so this looks neat but
is it possible from an economic
standpoint yes actually it is we have a
cost year of 50 million dollars to build
all this and if you amortize that loan
you took two to build it it's cost you
four million per year or something like
that operating costs just 1 million 4
million dollars per year but if you have
eight thousand trips a day each sale in
three min is the work time and you have
cost here I don't know if that's
realistic but if that's realistic you
say is six million dollars per year and
in total you say 1 million dollar per
year so actually it could be feasible I
would be a nice ride for you I think so
my conclusions are pod cars can be a
very important solution to urban traffic
and I try to show you to you at the
beginning that the other suggested
solutions that people come up with which
are more of the same basically they
don't really do the trick what we need
in the pod car industry right now is
examples we need to show that this works
we need somewhere politicians and city
planners can go and ride and see and
feel this works of course Google campus
would be a good place for such a
demonstrator reasonable size system
still profitable
and through some arrangement people
could ride as a day amount we hope
that's all thank you very much so are
any questions yes this is a replacement
for automobile only in urban
environments like what about commuting
from fonte the Google campus to San
Francisco the question was if this is
only a local facility and I like to see
it as local in the beginning going
further would need higher speeds and
high speed needs more advanced
technology so we need to crawl before we
can walk but it's certainly sing
thinkable and if we have the technology
now when you have a 10 billion dollar
bill gone through for building rail road
or was it anymore through California you
could build it much cheaper with this
type of technology and it would be a
much better ride because you can go
whenever you want but we're not there
yet yeah
you mean denial of service in the
networking sense I don't really know
what that means it's not sorry we just
summarizing the whole system by I know
flogging couple points on the okay yeah
that's possible it it's very easy to do
that actually just put your foot in the
door but the problem seems a bit
overstated because that's not happening
in metros or buses very much if you look
at it that way the psychological ways of
course someone will sabotage it sometime
but the thing you have and I think we
need here is to compromise on the
personal integrity bitten saya everyone
needs to have a ticket which can
identify you as the rider and also I
think we need to have camera
surveillance at least in the stations
yes
throw that down
the infrastructure and via
that scale
what this city
the question was regarding Causton if
there's a breakdown in two separate
parts and of course there is we say that
the guideway is around eight million per
mile and stations are around a million
dollars each and vehicles are third of a
million no sorry that was in kroner
forty fifty thousand dollars when it
comes to going to larger networks it's a
matter of how large is your city because
the usage comes when you cover a large
percentage of the places you want to go
so in a large city you need a large
network to get that percentage of trips
up but on the other hand if you have a
lot of congestion your helped by that
because people feel that it's really
more useful maybe they go shopping in
another mall because it has the Parker
connection but there's no general answer
but it does scale just like the road
network scales you could envision it as
each guideway here having one lane of
traffic at the three-second headway
level which are at right now but I think
we will get down to one second head ways
quite soon and that would be three lanes
of traffic for each guideway and also
with 300 meter walk distance if we allow
that amount of walking it would be very
much sparser than the road network of
course so it's like arterial roads in
your mind if you can have that level of
of distance between the guide ways and
often it gets profitable for cities a
very large cities I never did that
calculation actually okay do they're
essentially some kind of guidance system
that I can put in my existing car this
is like with a video small or no
modifications to existing roadways you
might be able to have you know automated
guides receive some of these things is
imparted the question was regarding an
IT s system which is intelligent
transport system which actually is
putting things in the car which prevents
you from crashing basically and this is
the only thing they do they don't
relieve you from congestion actually you
get more congestion because these tend
to be more conservative than a human
driver when it comes to distances
between vehicles so in San Diego they
did the test and capacity went down when
they install the IDS systems
yes because you move the liability from
the car driver to the manufacturer of
the system which means he's going to be
very conservative with headways so you
get up to the three-second headways
that's at least in Sweden recommended
for highways although never actually
used to give one or two seconds normally
and you had the question how big the
actual stations would be over their
footprint now that's a good question
regarding station size stations can be
dimensioned for the different size of
need at certain points for instance at
the rail station we need one large PRT
stationary even more than one but in a
local neighborhood you maybe need very
small station and typically the station
is just a side track and number core
positions after each other where people
can load and unload and this goes from
to up to 20 or so if you go about 20 you
lose it's a game of diminishing returns
okay one lorry you typical fair rate
that the user has to pay
the fares are actually controlled by the
operator and it's a matter of how much
the city is willing to pay or wants to
gain of course I think the main issue
could be if it's going to be a flat
bright system or if you pay for each
trip personally I think you should pay
for each trip because this is such a
high level of service you will get
enormous effects of having a flat rate
per month payment I mean that's what
we're going to in the telecommunication
business but the cost for each telephone
call is in reality very small in this
case you actually have to move a piece
of equipment every time so you need to
have a marginal cost in my mind to
recoup the the operational costs would
require you to have I don't have this
number in US currency it's going to be
at Fukien officially worth it it's going
to be forty cents per mile or something
to do just cover the operational and
then you can maybe want to recoup for
investment or maybe not okay
so if you have other questions come up
to me and otherwise we're going to lunch
now so anyone won't see on thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
