was invited to begin working on what can
really be done with nuclear explosives
to divert asteroids should we detect one
and the talks that you're going to see
here
I say talks because the nuclear part of
it was actually presented recently at a
conference in Washington DC on planetary
defense but that's was to a bunch of
folks that were well integrated into the
community so it didn't have the
introduction that you would give to a
more popular group and it's going to
focus on the use of nuclear explosives
to divert things now I can chat with you
or answer questions about some of the
other approaches but this one will focus
when we get to the part on how you would
divert them on the value of nuclear
explosives for this first off the broad
introduction says these things actually
hit the earth every very rarely you have
large craters this is one that's over a
couple hundred kilometers in diameter
definitely at the upper end of what we
see most of those fortunately are a long
long ways in the past one of them was
only 65 million years in the past that
left the crater about this big the
famous Chicxulub crater down in Mexico
and there's again lots of recognized
craters and many of them only recently
recognized there are things like this
central uplift in Texas that's right
here that was believed to be a volcanic
intrusion back when I used to drive
through there
they now drilled down below and said
well what's all this shock breccia and
no volcanic intrusion so they are
recognizing craters that didn't they
didn't know about before and again the
older ones unless they're very large
tend to be gone now there is a there are
also and was part of this conference we
were at programs for trying to detect
the bodies that in fact do pass near the
earth so that we can get out of the game
of playing statistics and saying well
one's going to hit us any million years
now that we don't like and try to
actually forecast a little
on our safety or lack thereof most of
the current projects were funded after
1998 when NASA set a goal of discovering
all the bodies that are one kilometer or
larger that are Earth crossing within to
try to detect 90% of them now those of
you who actually do you know looking for
things and trying to take them know that
it's very seldom that you can observe
100% of everything and so it will be
very hard to go much past 90 percent
right now they estimate given the
decrease in the discovery rate of these
large bodies that they're in fact about
70% of the way to discovering it and
that they will there will ultimately
prove to be in the neighborhood of a
thousand one kilometer or larger bodies
more recently however NASA sorry let me
back up here NASA decided that we in
fact we should do better than that
because while a one kilometer body is a
real mess when it hits as a simple 200
meter body would actually spoil your HOH
day on the west coast of the US and so
they said well maybe we should look for
smaller bodies
NASA's looking into how to do that right
now there they have three approaches
that they're studying one would be to
join with the pan-starrs effort of the
air force to look for faint things out
in space another would be to join with
the LSST
which is a project that in the National
Science Foundation is funding and it's
not fully funded yet but it would work
somewhat faster so they're looking at
either replicating these systems or
building their own and then of course
they also are looking at the
desirability of a infrared telescope
orbiting in the Venus area looking
outwards as a possibility it is the most
expensive possibility but that depends
on how people feel about what we should
be doing with NASA missions this is a
set of slides I borrowed from Don
Yeomans and it said you know back in
1800 this is what we knew about the
inner solar system and you have the
planets by 1900 we started to discover
that this region outside
of Mars and inside of Jupiter was
populated by smaller bodies which
originally were called planets and then
somewhere I think around eighteen fifty
or sixty they had a conference and
decided well we can't call them planets
they're too small some of them get up to
a few hundred kilometers across but you
know they aren't like the planets that
we know and people keep looking by 1950
the density is higher you're beginning
to see some red things there those are
the bodies that in fact have orbits that
don't keep themselves out here in the
asteroid belt but in fact come in and
cross the Earth's orbit and you know
people don't stop looking so by 1990
you've got this 1999
you've got more and then they started
looking hard and so today this is what
we have and you can see it's kind of
getting crowded they have now three
hundred and fifty thousand known bodies
there's about 4,500 objects that are
called any ohs near-earth objects and
these are objects that probably
originated in the asteroid belt but
after some discussion out there with
another body either you know peg getting
too near Jupiter or running into another
asteroid they lost energy and came in so
they orbit in the inner solar system
now those bodies that have that one
interaction will have very eccentric
orbits that bring them back out to the
asteroid belt and then they come in
again what happens frequently in the
inner solar system is they pass by a
planet like the earth or Venus they get
perturbed gravitationally and then they
have orbits that are more circular in
the inner solar system and what they
hope to find with this LSST scale
telescope or whatever NASA ultimately
decides to do is they'll come up with a
hundred thousand or more any OS instead
of 4,500 and over 220 thousand pho pho
is just a subset of any owe potentially
hazardous object and
the pH OS are ones that come within a
twentieth of an astronomical unit of the
earth an astronomical unit is a distance
from the Sun to the earth and so the
things that in fact their orbits not
only happen to cross the Earth's orbit
but they come within a twentieth of an
astronomical unit of the earth are
called potentially hazardous and so we
expect by 2020 to be up to something
like twenty thousand of these objects
instead of the eight hundred and some
that we are today and they when an
object is earth crossing it's really a
3d problem and most of the time the
orbit isn't actually intersecting the
Earth's orbit because it's tilted and so
it's only when the orbit as it processes
you get intersections as the orbit
precesses and climbs up part of it
climbs up and climbs down that you get
actual intersections and the pH OHS are
the ones that are near an intersection
and they're close enough to an
intersection that the time scale for a
gravitational perturbation to pull it
down and make it an intersecting orbit
is short and so those are the ones that
they figure we should keep an eye on
those and you can follow through the
dynamics of orbits and use that to give
yourself a way of estimating well if I
see a certain population of bodies and
they've got these range of
eccentricities and range of semi-major
axes and I look at that and can work out
for the precession rates well how much
time on average is a body spending as a
dangerous object where it might interact
and this is the way that they take they
go from the populations that they
observe either were these small
telescopes or in the future with larger
ones and say well what fraction of those
are going to impact and so if you have a
population of a thousand which is as I
say what they estimate the one kilometer
and above sized bodies are the answer is
why a couple of them hit you every
million years don't worry there are
currently no really really big you know
a kilometer-sized body hitting the earth
is going to be tremendously unpleasant
to some civilization a 10-kilometer
sized body your got you're beginning to
talk about the dinosaur killer scale
models and that is going to be
challenging to survive and there are no
ten kilometer sized objects in this
Ennio population at the moment the
survey as I say is incomplete with about
700 moderate asteroids known and they
expect it will be complete to the 90%
level sometime next year when you take
the things they're observing with the
telescope and put in the estimates of
well how frequently they'll impact you
get the numbers down here you also have
observations that tell you about the
smaller bodies that in fact are hitting
the earth there for you and the green
triangles here are infrasound
measurements of you know these are just
low-frequency pressure waves that rattle
around for long distances and the black
dots in fact are from the DoD satellites
that look down and within some time they
will let you know that there was a big
bright flash over this area don't worry
the signal was not the signal of a
nuclear explosive then they can hand it
to the asteroid people and say maybe
you're interested in that if you look at
these if you look at these black dots
you see well they're getting up to
things happening every some number of
years okay this is the one-year level
this is the ten-year level here and
you're getting up to over a ten kilotons
of energy that they have observed
dissipating so this is the impact rates
and I put it on a logarithmic timeline
logarithmic time lines are really great
for putting on things that go back to
the dinosaurs and start at short periods
so on this timeline this is the duration
of the conference we were just at this
is a congressional term and every
congressional term there is an eight to
ten every year there's over a kiloton
that event that happens in
the atmosphere and there's an eight to
ten kiloton won every congressional term
now the thing about eight to ten kiloton
ones unless that ten meter body was an
iron nickel which is only about a
twentieth of the number of meteorites
that we find unless that iron nickel was
on a missile a rock was iron nickel it
doesn't reach the surface and rocks
especially if the thing is unconsidered
so it's just a bunch of rocks that are
hanging together maybe you know loosely
bound but it comes apart in the upper
atmosphere and so these eight to ten
kiloton events are happening up at 30
kilometers now if one happened over San
Francisco people might hear something
and wonder where's the thunderstorm and
the big bright flash that occurred
outside but it's not going to be
devastating
there was a circumstance in these
studies a couple years back where a body
that was about 30 meters across was
discovered and it was discovered after
it had passed very close to the earth I
mean inside of the orbit of the moon
well inside of the orbit of the moon and
in fact there was a period when they
said God accident that could hit us and
the press went out and truck you know
spoke to the usual suspects about well
what would have happened if this 30
meter object hit us now you know a lot
of energy 10 megatons but you know it's
still at the 30 meter size thought to be
something that will be break up in the
atmosphere and not make it right to the
Earth's surface
you start making it to the Earth's
surface at the 50 meter range on average
they think as long as you're not iron
nickel okay iron nickel slot okay so
fortunately those are the most common
things and you know they they occur they
deposit their energy high up not a not a
severe problem we to have to go in the
dress things do make it to the Earth's
surface on occasion you'll all know
about Tunguska when I made this slide
Tunguska was thought to be about a 10
Megaton event it knocked down forests in
about two thousand square kilometers
and was probably unpleasant to be there
at the time the Tunguska event was at
the last conference downgraded by
detailed calculations that and looking
at the actual health of the forest more
correctly and they think all it was only
you know six or seven megatons not not
ten that makes them a little more common
than was estimated those things are
thought to be five hundred thousand two
thousand years that's the time scales
you have those on those clearly do have
an impact and as the humanity spreads
across the earth and fills it this type
of thing will become more problematic in
the future and you know this is just
showing what happens if you get a
thousand Megaton event up here and it
occurs sort of in central California and
I looked at the tin PSI level in the
forty calorie per square centimeter flux
level that's the inside of that circle
which includes la San Francisco
Sacramento and Carson City everything is
knocked down and the terrain effects
will she'll be on the other side of the
Sierra
I'm sure it's knocked down and burned
inside of that region but fortunately
again that's a relatively infrequent
thing getting out to the hundred
thousand year frequency range well we're
out there observing these guys and how
long do you have to observe them before
you know it's going to hit you and if
you look at the data on asteroids that
have been discovered recently and how
precisely they know things like the
semi-major axis so how precisely they
know the period you can start doing
estimates on how how much observation do
you need how many orbits do you need to
observe before you know its position
along its orbit to better than an earth
radius sometime in the future and it
turns out you need about ten orbits okay
so after about ten orbits which you know
for things that are in the inner solar
system so their scale of their periods
about a year so after about ten years if
gravity is the only thing
you can generally know where these guys
are going to that whether they're a
threat or not inside of ten years of
having detected them but unfortunately
gravity isn't the only thing going now
one of the things people have brought
out for asteroids is light and one
fellow even proposed painting an
asteroid white that was going to hit us
and you know some year in the future if
you paint it white the reflectivity is
different so there's the momentum from
sunlight bouncing off of it instead of
getting absorbed that momentum
difference makes it has an effect over
time but if you took the 250 tons of
paint that it would take to cover a one
kilometer asteroid you'd do much better
to just impact it on the asteroid then
actually paint the asteroid you know
maybe use a paintball gun but you'll do
more by abusing the paintball gun and
then you will by getting a light on it
okay
also it works nominally it's the type of
thing that can work in some centuries
for a small asteroid it doesn't work so
well for a large asteroid we can go into
the physics later if you like
just take my word for it now Nature
doesn't stop there there's the ark off
ski effect and that's a you know a way
to weed out people who actually look at
the field as opposed to don't look at it
because you know when you start naming
affects you oh yes we are crops the
effect it's an effect where that light
that comes in is absorbed by the
asteroid now the asteroid like the earth
is in a thermal balance so the light
that comes in and gets absorbed has to
get reradiating off and it's in balance
now if the asteroid almost all asteroids
are rotating and so if the asteroid is
rotating the Sun set Terminator if you
will on the asteroid is often hotter
than the sunrise Terminator how much
hotter depends on the direction of
rotation and the convey the material
properties of the surface if the surface
is iron nickel that is has good
conductivity and the energy that's
absorbed that the surface gets can gets
conducted deep in the material and the
temperature is not very different over
say a four hour rotate
period and so it rear ad eights the
light off evenly in all directions but
if the surface is sandy you know those
of you who've stood out on your
volleyball court in the middle of the
summer and you know got your shoes off
discover that the surface of the sand
can get quite warm it's poor conductor
and so if you have a surface that is you
know lots of small stuff and poor
conductor the sunset Terminator is
hotter than the sunrise Terminator this
gives you a rocket effect because the
momentum of the photons that you emit at
the sunset Terminator dominates and push
you preferentially in the direction that
matters that is set by well your surface
material properties and the rotation
properties of the asteroid and I was an
example of how this adds up
there's da 1950 which has was discovered
in 1950 had really was lost because a
lot of the things that people discovered
in 1950 you had a couple of old geezers
that went you know people my age who
went out to a telescope at that time and
you know had a two-week run at the
telescope spotted an asteroid picked it
up calculated its orbit I did my first
orbit in 1969 calculated its orbit and
then if they didn't get out to observe
it again in the next month's two years
their orbit did the initial orbit they
calculated may not be good enough to
retake it up so da 1950 was one of the
ones that was lost it was
serendipitously rediscovered as it
passed within a twentieth of an
astronomical unit of the earth in 2001
yes 2001 and when they do the orbit they
say the collision probability on
Saturday the 16th of March 28 80 is no
greater than a third of a percent okay
so that by the way is by far the worst
one that you've got out there that we
know about and at JPL they looked at all
sorts of uncertainties in their
calculation is one of the best studies
that I've found on the uncertainties and
so well how much does
to change things if you fiddle around
with the solar oblate this this is the
interior rotation speed of the Sun that
the general relativistic precession of
the orbit Pierre Hylian of Mercury's
orbit is based on and well it switches
it somewhere between depending on how
you play with it
two to six Earth radii the difference
between a hit and the miss by a lot okay
you add 61 asteroids to your calculation
it shifts it the other way by 230 Earth
radii you put in planetary mass
uncertainties when these guys coming out
he periodically passes not very close
but close to other point two planets and
there's always a gravitational tug and
the masses of the planets are not
certain precisely they're they're pretty
well known now that we put satellites
out around them but that adds greater
uncertainty radiation pressure just the
straight one I mentioned first time of
just the light bouncing off of it and
how efficient that is that's a that
changes the calculation by 1700 Earth
radii the Yarkovsky effect how much does
that change things anywhere between plus
eighteen hundred and minus eleven
thousand depending on how the surface
properties that we don't know without
going there okay so it's real real hard
to know where a body's going to be even
when you have really great observational
data I mean if it weren't for the
effects of light it would you know if it
weren't for the effects of light well
we'd be kind of close to saying this as
a real threatening body eight hundred
years out but you know with the light
it's it's sort of hopeless another body
that was picked out by the century
system that's running here what they're
doing is they're taking all of these
asteroids that you you saw and doing
orbits for them and they're looking for
potential impacts over the next hundred
years and they're limiting themselves to
the next hundred years because when you
get beyond that these non gravitational
effects start becoming dominant and even
the gravitational effects uncertainties
and masses become a problem okay and so
this is a list of today
it's listed in the JPL site as a 270
meter object more recent observations
suggest it's really closer to 350 but
you know I stuck with what JPL was
saying and at first when they saw it
they thought there was going to be a
possible collision in 2029 they were
able to look backwards at earlier
observations that they hadn't recognized
it in they said oh you know if we take
this orbit and go backwards here's a
field of view that we actually have an
earlier image from and we'll pick up
we'll pick it up there and they were
able to very quickly improve the orbit
and there they know it's not going to
hit in 2029 and that there is a remote
chance of you know one in 45,000 that it
will impact the earth on 2036
that means ninety-nine point nine nine
eight percent certain it won't which is
you know not going to worry too much
right now if you take the hundred and
twenty asteroids that they put in there
risk table and you add up the cumulative
probability of an impact in the next
hundred years it comes out to about 1%
but most of that is for bodies below
about 10 meters the bodies that they
don't normally discover except when they
whiz past the earth very close in okay
and also bodies that you probably
wouldn't do anything about even if you
knew it was going to hit except you know
tell people to look at the light show so
but so most of those bodies are small
that lead to that 1% if you consider
only the thirty eighth of the hundred
and twenty that are larger than 50
meters in diameter and large enough to
impact the ground with a cue may have a
cumulative probability of a fiftieth of
a percent in the next hundred years yeah
not not anything to worry about
tremendously but we're gonna have to
learn to communicate better about this
risk to because in 2020 you expect to
have twenty times more of these objects
so that says 20% chance in the next
hundred years you'll you'll say there's
a 20% chance this guy's going to hit and
you'll probably actually then gather
more data on him to know and even the
big ones are beginning to have a
you know there's beginning to be a
chance that you'll see something that
you begin to really worry about as a
threat okay so when we have identified
something that might be a threat in the
future the first thing is do no harm so
as we've described it it's easy in the
next millennium to know an object in the
like next millennium or so is not going
to be a threat you you look at its orbit
it doesn't pass anywhere near the earth
then the problem are those guys that
have orbits that are nearly intersecting
that can process in in a limited amount
of time and but when you look at those
guys because of all the uncertainty
caused by light effects principally but
also by uncertainties and planetary
masses it's difficult to know that a
body will impact more than a century or
a few a few decades really in the future
when the JPL people did their study they
limited themselves to fifty years they
said look inside of 50 years give us a
you know ten ten orbits or so and we'll
know it's going to hit or not but so
it's difficult to know something will
impact more than a century in event and
when you have bodies like Apophis which
are not uncommon
there the orbit is such that we won't
know or where we there's a chance we
will know it won't impact earlier than
seven years in advance but we will not
know it will impact until about seven
years in advance unless we fund a space
mission something like that to go out
put a transponder on it so we can
actually get more precision in the orbit
so mitigation technologies don't you
don't think about ones that work in this
centuries ballpark where you say oh well
da 1950 may be a problem eight hundred
years out you know if you go out and
start pushing da 1980 the chances are
you'd push it to one you know that it's
not going to impact chances are best
that it's not going to impact you start
changing it well maybe a change it to
something that does impact so do no harm
until you know that a thing is going to
impact okay now the options I'm going to
talk about today are the nuclear option
for diverting it as I said if you
afterwards wanted to ask questions about
some of the other proposals I'm happy
chat about him NASA just released the
report to Congress on what it would do
to detect and deflect any O's and
basically it or it said that look for
large asteroids the only thing we have
today that is mature technology that we
know would work would be nukes for
smaller bodies they think that impactors
where you just take a mass up and run it
into the body real hard and so for
smaller asteroids that can work they'll
place the gravity tractor which has
gotten gets a lot of press coverage they
place that as well a medium thing the
the nuclear and impactor was high
likelihood of working the nuclear the
gravity tractor was in the medium
category as something that could be
developed to a workable technology
anyway
there are two ways that have been
proposed to use nukes one is to just try
and tap it and the idea is when you're
some decades out the velocity change
that the that is the difference between
a body that hits you and a body that
misses you is in the cm/s range and so
you know if you can go out and you can
do something to just tap it enough to
change its speed by a centimeter or two
a second that's that's what you want to
do okay and you know you keep the body
together that way and good the
alternative is to blow the bejesus out
of it now that method
well intrinsically satisfying to an old
bomber has the problem that what it
creates is a debris field now if you
create that debris field well it was it
and deep impact eighteen days before if
you create the debris field
shortly before impact don't bother it's
a few affectless thing if you create it
however some years out so this op unit
operates decades out but if as in the
case of Apophis let's assume that we
don't have a space mission to put a
transponder on it
to know for sure that the small
probability of it hitting is the bad
case in that case we're not going to
know until seven years out it's not just
a little tap anymore that you need to do
however if you do this what we'll show
you is if you do this a few years out in
fact you created debris field now then
you have the choice do you want the
whole body to hit you or do you want a
hundred thousandth of the body to hit
you probably in things mostly that burn
up in the atmosphere so that's not the
desirable case you don't go volunteering
to put the earth in a place where you
don't move the earth so that you can
have this occur but it's something that
you can do if there's not another option
if 20 years out or 30 years out you
tapped it and it didn't work
and you can't you know they're their
launch windows for these things and so
an asteroid that is we discover 30 years
out and say we got to do something about
that you may only have four launch
windows when you can reach it in that 30
year period and so you got to do
something early and if that's something
that you do early isn't doesn't work you
the time gets short real fast okay so
whereas I heard David Morrison who we
actually invited to come here with us
but when he found he wanted to come at
first but when he heard the day he said
sorry I'm traveling that day I heard of
mine NPR recently saying in response to
well would you blow it up so no that's
bad because his stuff will still hit you
he's absolutely right but again I think
there's a real environmental improvement
to reduce the amount that hits you by a
factor of a hundred thousand so that's
what we're going to talk about how do
you nudge an asteroid well first of all
there's this tyrant Newton and he says
what you got to do is there's the action
reaction and so if you're going to
ablate off some material with a certain
velocity there's the mass of the
asteroid and how much speed however much
it's velocity changes and what it says
is well if you're going to heat that
surface to just a low temperature
one Evie gasps it's about 10,000 degrees
so you keep off you heat a hemisphere by
standing off and just heating it up and
blow off a part in 10 to the minus 5 or
pardon 10 to minus 4 depending on how
many centimeters a second you want to
change things well what do that says is
I've got the heat ten thousand to a
hundred thousand tons of material to a
gas okay that's a tiny fraction of the
mass of the asteroid and to that that's
what you need to do to change its speed
by one to ten centimeters a second and
the energy required to heat that
material then the energy I have to
couple in is somewhere between 10 and
100 kilotons of energy now it doesn't
matter if I'm doing this by a nuclear
explosive that I've hovered some
distance off of the surface or if I'm
doing it with a big laser that is
somewhere in space so it can actually
focus at this distance and trying to
heat the surface by way it Livermore
we have the largest laser in the world
the NIF and we can get this much energy
through at the ten kilotons in about six
thousand years it's not designed for
high fluence it's designed for really
intense pulses that so it's not a fair
limitation on lasers but lasers you know
you're talking pumping 10 to 100
kilotons through it people say particle
beams 10 to 100 kilotons do it people
talk about putting giant mirrors and
orbiting around the asteroid okay and so
you take the you take a mirror and you
keep the mirror hovering off the
asteroid at the right distance because
there are no close and stable orbits
because the asteroids tend to be unusual
in shape and so you're actively
controlling your mirror and pointing it
probably to a secondary that's much
closer in the secondary mirror and
reflecting onto a spot on a rotating
surface and trying to get that spot hot
enough before in spite of the rotation
that you caused it to outguess now you
know using free sunlight if you've got a
mirror that's say 70 80 meters across
and optically good it will work but you
need to have the mirror standing back
and the secondary in close to do the
steering pick
the rock that you evaporate and come off
goes out and coats the optics real quick
and so these things are all things
people think about but the real issue is
however you're going to move it you're
talking about this much energy okay up
go back one now at this point it's
illegal for me to say and Steve and Rob
what yield weapons we have in the
stockpile it's against the law will be
put in jail and never let out however
there is nothing to stop me from saying
the Russians have developed that this
was their Tsar bomb the hundred Megaton
one that they tested at the 5060 Megaton
level back in the sixties Edward Teller
sort of petting it at Chelyabinsk 70 and
this is the 1.4 Megaton starfish prime
event / Johnson Island so that the US
did and it suggests we know how to get
nukes into space and we know how to get
them up there and you make a tonnage
things okay that much I can say about
what we have in the stockpile if you
want to know more I cannot recommend
you're going to these proliferates sites
like the NRDC or American Federation of
scientists where they list a lot more
than we're allowed to say so Livermore
where we work is experienced in both
making craters and modeling craters and
this is a crater created by our V impact
I go out and do that in the South
Pacific every so often God went out just
before the asteroid meeting going out
again I think in June this is the Sedan
crater at this scale you don't see all
the car tires down at the bottom of it
where people had rolled them down just
to watch them try and spin them around
the another crater I have to speed up
here and a computation we're doing was
with a 2d code we have 3d codes this is
showing you a 3d astrophysics
calculation that I'm particularly happy
with because we solved a 30-year long
problem on CNO abundances and red giants
but 3d shape adds complexity that were
unnecessary for scoping calculations to
try and learn more about
what modeling should be and a sphere can
be run in two dimensions and so you get
better resolution to get the if you had
a hundred thousand zones in a 2d
calculation of the sphere to get the
same resolution you need 300 million
zones in a 3d calculation we are capable
of doing that but it's not the first
calculation you should do do it later
and so it kale was the code of choice in
this case and Steve over here was
running kale and Rob was running Stephen
just to give you a real quick thing
because we got to get through this fast
kales an arbitrary Lagrangian oi'll
Aryan code is 2d has lots of physics in
it this is some old calculation Steve
did of a NASA a Leonid meteorite
impacting a satellite skin get real high
temperatures when it impacts at 70
kilometers a second the generic
structure that we chose and this is part
of the greatest uncertainty and what
asteroids are like again asteroids are
almost none of them spiracle but we're
starting there we chose a kilometer
radius just because in the NASA study
when you get to about a kilometer
suddenly the threat pops up high because
they start saying well we know there's
going to be global effects there we
don't know in detail what the global
effects are but you're going to impact
more people and the idea is if you have
one of these events in a million years
that kills a billion people that's a
thousand people a year and so they knew
that somewhere up there where the global
effects start in and it's about a
kilometer life got real bad
and our model had it was really a sand
like material on the outer half of the
radius and a granite like density at the
inner half and we looked at two energy
deposition modes one where it was
deposited just ten meters below the
surface you know just just getting it
under the surface and you can do that
with earth penetrator approach you just
sort of run the thing into it at a few
thousand foot a second and especially on
things like this it'll bury itself that
deep and alternatively you stand off
about here and you irradiate the circuit
about here I guess and you were radiate
the surface and you heat a big patch on
it now we ran some of these I'll get to
that I guess and this is the zoning that
was used and radiation transport was
turned off because that really would be
critical the key issue if you were
standing off and irradiating the surface
and looking at the energy transport into
the surface we just said oh we've done
that type of thing before we'll put it
in about here and put in a certain
number of kilotons okay yeah the real
issue is we don't have we have strength
and fracture models for nevada alluvium
there's some beautiful work done for
limestone's from the midwest somewhere
where you know you get different
ferocity and shocks propagate quite
differently in a stone that's really
hard or has a really low porosity and we
don't know about asteroids and in fact
asteroids are probably different there's
probably some that are pretty hard that
da 1950 they're now thinking it's a
nickel iron but before we knew that we
knew it's density was at least about 2.8
or 2.9 which would make it pretty solid
rock okay so those are the things we
have to vary as to strength there is a
cut-off at about two hours where very
few asteroids are seen to be rotating
faster than two hours and that's an
interesting cutoff because below two
hours the gravity of a body will
typically hold it together and so the
fact that most of the bodies that you
see with two hour or longer periods just
don't exist as short period objects
suggest that most of the bodies you see
are held together with gravity it
doesn't mean they don't have some big
hunk and pieces in them but it means
they're mostly held together with
gravity this is a picture of it Sakawa
from the recent Japanese mission
Hayabusa that went out and looked at it
that's about 80 meters across that that
rock down there there are some bodies
including quite sizable ones that are
rotating so fast they have to have
material strength holding them together
so there's variation out there but on
average the bodies are likely to be
rubble piles
with some big pieces in them that don't
have a lot of material strengths so we
will do calculations with material
strengths in without it okay we're not
going to show all of them here because
they've only just finished some of them
and I didn't couldn't get them into the
talk in time the other question is which
direction you push I don't have time to
talk about that I see em cruising up but
generally everyone knows you push in the
direction of motion or against the
direction of motion to get the best
effect and the reason for that is when
you push along that direction you're
changing the period and so if you do it
one period out you get the effect of one
period change in its position if you do
it two periods out you get the effect of
two periods change in its direction so
the miss grows with time and if you do
it in the other direction you may do it
hard enough to get a Miss but it doesn't
grow with time you know either you did
it or you didn't and the miss will be
closed in the other directions there are
times when that's the right answer but
only very late in the game is that the
right answer okay where phase matters so
pushing at perihelion for an eccentric
orbit is much better than pushing at
aphelion and that's the ratio perihelion
push is preferred we go on from there
these are the orbits when we do these
calculations we have to propagate them
along orbits and say well how does the
debris-filled or evolve or if I nudge it
how does that nudge evolve with time so
that I miss or not what do I have to do
to stop it from hitting if I'm nudging
what how does the debris field evolve
with time if I have to break it up and
I'm flying through that debris field
what is it what am i likely to run into
statistically and we picked four orbits
the four orbits are the blue dots there
they lie amidst the Neos that we know
about two of the orbits had low angles
of inclination what you'll see on this
is the distribution is that things with
low angles of inclination or things that
are accidents waiting to happen the
things that have low angles of
inclination preferentially the orbits
are better aligned with the Earth's
orbit when they cross and so the length
over which in a
an impact maker is greater and so these
things get swept out faster basically
over time all of these bodies will
either impact one of the planets or get
gravitationally boosted out of the
system
most of them will impact one of the
planets with time it fortunately just
takes a long time okay we're going to
use Megaton class devices to nudge
things this shows you a picture of
bikini using a Google map or photo this
is the Castle Bravo event that was done
on a little island about here and it was
placed nine foot above water level and
set off it was 15 megatons and it
created a hole this size the one
kilometer asteroid that we're nominally
modeling is this size okay these are the
orbits as I say one through three cross
at a great angle orbit for that I picked
is a real bugger Internet's a bugger for
anything you want to pick it's the one
that I showed it first and what happens
is it's going around and it really comes
tangent to the Earth's orbit and serve
an oscillating orbit and so what happens
is in the wrong phase it gets into the
Earth's orbit and the earth overtakes it
so it's the least energetic hip but it's
also it's much like the shoemaker-levy
orbit was for Jupiter you know and it's
a hard one to if you have I discover
something on this path it's hard to
avoid four orbits one two three a prayer
helium
perturbations at perihelion of five
centimeters a second are adequate three
years in advance
barely if you go thirty years in advance
half a centimeter a second is all you
need so that's the reason that you know
you really want this timeline where you
say okay fifty years to go let's start
doing something because the amount that
you have to do is greatly reduced and
you need to only take this guy in
nudging and get a warder a centimeter a
second or half a centimeter in a second
in these cases to grow orbit for if you
do it three years in advance
and do in the t-direction it requires
three meters a second velocity change
well you know on an object that has an
escape velocity of 50 centimeters a
second you got to break it up to get
you're not going to get that kind of
change without breaking it up still
required half a meter a second in the
opposite direction
25 years out it still requires five
centimeters a second to cause a mess and
this doesn't show very well but it's
it's it's looking at the evolution of
the debris field with time and the scale
across here is three thousand Earth
radii so over a period of three years
you grow to a thing that's nearly 2,000
Earth radii along a debris field is
2,000 or 380 I long and 50 to 80 or 3di
across okay so it's got a volume that's
more than a million times the volume of
the earth when the Earth passes through
that it picks up some of that material
but the amount it picks up is in the
neighborhood of 10 to the minus fourth
or 10 to the minus fifth of the material
so again it last minute three years out
or so this is the type of thing you
would be forced towards okay model a and
here you see Rob's movie or is that
Steven Lee I don't remember one of those
guys going off and you see this crater
forming and the density going down after
20 seconds the granite area was here the
outer rubble area looked like that 77%
of the material had been thrown out you
know of the problem just it you know
when the burst went off material recoils
off the asteroid as the shock penetrates
into it and it went out at such a high
speed it just left the problem you know
we couldn't couldn't track it 92% of the
material still in the problem for those
of you who are aficionado zuv the virial
theorem if you look at the kinetic
energy to potential energy ratio the
core is 300 mentals 1,200 force a stable
body for a gas body you'd want a half
for it to hang together you
thing over one comes apart so this thing
is coming apart
not everything impacts in fact the body
was going along an orbit where is going
to hit and so if you speed it up a
little bit or slow it down enough it's
not going to hit so the only things that
actually hit are the pieces of this
material this is the thing being tumbled
around and about a twenty eight thousand
we did sort of seven hundred and fifty
thousand fragments in this on one of the
runs and this is twenty eight thousand
of them but it shows the general shape
but the stuff that's going like a bat
out of hell one way and is two meters a
second slow has a chance of impacting
the stuff that goes like a bat out of
hell the other way but and is sped up by
only two meters a second in the
direction of motion can impact the other
way but most of that material misses by
of order a hundred Earth radii this just
doesn't come close to the earth this is
looking at the stuff that's within two
meters a second and it's actually only a
strip across that that passes near the
earth and this is this green area where
the earth threatening material is in
this case the one question is this was
run without material strength and so
it's more fluid like there are all sorts
of calculations you can do between a
full-up rock and something that's fluid
like and what rob has just done one
where he put in more of an equation of
state that you would use for beach if
you hit it in the sense that it's got a
equation of state where the strength
increases as you put pressure on it
and then as the shock passes there is no
there is no tension term and so things
perfectly happily come apart as they
would in a powder but you know you
actually get some strength in that case
you actually have a line of a very thin
plane that goes through the asteroid but
I haven't gotten that one I'll gives
mode up yet and you know there are
calculations we can do they develop
strength
and do it for asteroid materials and in
fact just recently I found that there
was some work being done at Harvard on
that and we're gonna go looking at that
where they've grind up asteroids and
look at the equation of state better we
just grind up Nevada okay so with
respect to this method
you pick the these orbits depending on 1
through 4 range from 112 gigatons to 12
gigatonnes of impact energy so you can
do that or if you break it up you
receive somewhere around 10 to the minus
fifth of the material so 10 to the minus
fifth of the energy impacting or on
orbit for we could only get it down to
10 to the minus 3 so most of the bodies
you know yeah it was only when I broke
it up into relatively small pieces that
I actually started getting significant
numbers of impacts and so while there is
a chance from this this is not the
desired method of just nudging it and
trying to keep the whole thing together
most of the bodies will be small that
actually hit the earth alternative use a
bigger hammer use 10 megatons about 1/10
of a Tsar bomb and you drop things down
to 10 to the minus 6 and to the minus 4
for the bad orbit going further what
happens if there's a hard rock in the
center hard rock in the center is the
worst place the hard rock could be
because here we actually fractured the
rock and you can still see it in there
but it stayed together and it stayed on
a course that was going to hit the earth
so knowing the structure is desirable if
this hard rock had been up here it would
have missed and you'd have had almost
the same gates that we just had but you
know this isn't a panacea much better to
attack things early on I'm just saying
this is what you do if you can't do
anything else this was looking at the
thing in the middle and it was bad it
actually hit and the alternative here
would probably have been probably you
won't send just one
you know if you if you've only got one
launch window you might send two or
three and the first one goes to where
the thing is and the second one is
following behind and it goes to where
you don't want anything to be there is
the nudge and we put source the energy
into a range at a depth that was
appropriate for using Neutron output
Neutron output is more desirable than
x-ray output you know if you set up a
nuclear weapon off instead of space
there's almost no mass there and so most
of the energy that you kind of have
coming out comes out as radiation of one
form or another it comes out as x-rays
gamma rays neutrons and that's what goes
out and absorbs on the surface of the
asteroid heats it and ablates that
material off and when it ablates that
material off you get a push and here we
ablated off about thirty thousand tons
so in the right ballpark this was the
the speeds the purple here is stuff that
has the speed pieces that have a speed
that can escape this is escaping this is
escaping while this temporarily has a
speed that would allow it to escape when
you say it's got to push this out of the
way it won't have it doesn't have enough
energy to push that out of the way and
so it will this will just form big
crater on the thing and we got about
half a centimeter a second if we had not
spoiled off of the far end which is an
issue of the dissipation in the material
and so if we I'm hoping that when we run
the powder on this one I'll see that I
don't get as much small the powder
equation the state on this one hoping we
won't get as much fall we'd have gotten
one point eight centimeters a second in
either case that's enough to avoid an
impact if you deposit it more thinly as
you would do if you were having x-rays
it actually gave a stronger shock early
on all of this material escaped the body
was going 92 percent of the mass was
bound and was going to point one
centimeters a second that's an easy miss
twenty years out and you only have a
little bit of debris cloud around it and
again you only pick up a tiny fraction
of that you know let your degree
grow 30 years instead of three years
okay
so conclusions now because we're running
out we're out of time
conclusion now it's only natural
there'll be a global disaster any
million years now but a million years is
a long time here you see a skull of Homo
heidelbergensis which we call Los Alamos
man where I work and you know they
evolved the nuclear nudge is the
preferred approach Neutron output has
its advantages there are studies that
we're continuing to do to improve our
simulations there with less time
fragmentation shouldn't you know you
shouldn't get take the one-line answers
that people give about Oh fragmentation
is bad fragmentation is not the
preferred way but there are times when
you can say it's better than doing
nothing a lot better than doing nothing
also if you want to talk about myths
busted by a device doesn't have to be at
the center the New York Times wrote home
but there's radioactive debris and I
worked out if the radiation actually
spread quite widely that you have left
over from it but let's assume it spreads
only as the material of the device and
it been the three years later when you
sweep this material up your background
radiation goes up a hundredth of a
percent above background from it
temporarily so you know you do more
getting in the near plane there are
mature technology there's more we can do
to learn about them
we have active programs and will quit
thank you very much
and if there's well there the the
cognitive difference so we're talking
about here most of the methods for
nudging it actually oblate off some of
the material the alternative that NASA
proposes proposed was to say well if
they're small enough you instead of
taking a spacecraft that weighs about a
ton like a nuclear big nuclear package
would I take package that weighs about
10 tons and I launch that and I impact
it on the body and there's the momentum
that it hits and there's also because
it's got excess energy it will throw off
some of the body's mass and so there is
always something that comes off of it
the difference between the nudge was
we're trying to keep the bulk of the
body you know more than 90 percent
hopefully 99 percent more of the body as
a single object that is now moving at a
non intersecting orbit so does that
answer it I mean
well I mean that's what we were doing we
were we were taking we were taking in
one case trying to gently push on it
that's where the nuclear device was
standing off and just irradiating one
hemisphere so that you're trying to take
the bulk of the object and push it at a
speed just enough to stop it from
hitting us the alternative again if you
didn't have all of that time is you hit
it very hard the fragments go out in all
directions at high speeds some you
create a debris field and some fraction
of them the earth still picks up but you
know again your choice is quantitatively
different with 100 with the whole thing
or a small fraction yes well
you you you will generally know that
well first of all that that debris field
keeps orbiting or keeps expanding so
you're right you are taking one object
and you're converting it to hundreds of
thousands of objects now as I told you
early on there was the you know you saw
those objects in the inner solar system
most of those objects are going to stay
there until we hit them and you know in
a sense that's the choice between
hitting them as you know hitting them
today or hitting some tiny fraction of
them a thousand years in the future yeah
you can afterwards
look at the debris field and get some
idea of how many more orbits before the
to again pass near each other and what
you would hope is that in fact when in
fact when the earth first passes through
it a lot of the stuff that is near the
Earth's orbit is going to get
gravitationally perturbed so that it's
in quite different orbits afterwards so
that is an issue but that's an issue
also if you nudge it whatever you do
you're changing the orbit and it's just
not an orbit that's hitting immediately
then and you wait for you know your
great-great-great great-great
grandchildren to deal with it if they're
interested
there was another
that's droids oh well the conference
will be the conference that we were at
was very specifically on asteroids not
comets those are the you know you know
the dog rule about the guy on the stairs
who wasn't there and I wish you weren't
there
comets are those guys we can't do
anything about comets one of those has
our number on it we hope that the future
has better technology well
comets are qualitatively different
because they come from the outer solar
system and they come in only
occasionally and so unlike the any OS
which are in all the time and we're able
to get a census of them comets usually
it's very unusual that you discover one
say two years before it is going to hit
the earth and at that point if you
discover at that early which is very
unusual it's out at Jupiter's orbit so
ask how long it takes to get a
spacecraft out there I mean if you meet
it out beyond Mars orbit and it's on its
way into impact this what you probably
can't know because of all the
non-gravitational forces you just know
it's going to come uncomfortably close
if you can get out beyond Mars's orbit
do you have maybe
a worldwide pandemic is a bigger threat
than the asteroid now as I say the
asteroid is not a question it is a
certainty but is a certainty over some
very large time scale a worldwide
pandemic that may kill a billion people
is thought to be a possibility at a much
shorter time scale so interesting that
there from the homeland security point
of view there of course doing exercises
to say what would we do if someone got a
hold of a nuclear weapon and set it off
what happened would happen with a
chemical attack then they've got all
those listed and you know if you look at
them you can sort of assign
probabilities and we're not at the
bottom but we're certainly not at the
top yes
yes
and and I and I
no no yeah the the calculation that I
showed for the nudge the first one okay
had the exact effect effect in fact if
you looked at the title it said
celestial Newton's Cradle and a Newton's
Cradle is the thing you know you've got
the little metal balls and you let one
go and it goes bunk and a whole bunch of
them don't move one comes off the other
end a bunk okay and as I showed that is
in fact what happened at some level
you're right you're not with a nuclear
weapon what you're doing is you're
putting energy in an asymmetric fashion
on it okay picture a rifle with a bullet
in it okay when you do that the action
and reaction are the same when you set
off the bullet okay but the velocities
are quite different okay
and here we're trying to do a thing
where we make the side of the asteroid
towards us the bullet are the and it
comes off fast now as you said in a
fluid system if there's very little
dissipation and the shock can go through
and spoil the far end off and I showed
that and I said that without with that
spalling off okay my body was moving
half a centimeter a second faster what
remained because the spa the the
ablation was higher on one side than the
ultimates ball but that was with a very
non dissipative medium and with more
dissipation and that's where I said
looking at equation of state of asteroid
chondritic material would be desirable
because you can then get better idea of
how much dissipation you have and have a
move we did the harder hit and we got
two centimeters a second but you know
there we were beginning to lose six
percent of the mass you know only
keeping 93 94 percent of the body
together now that's still you know not
bad you know most of it you're
guaranteed is going to
and again a hundred thousand through a
millionth of the 6% now is what what may
interact with you later
so yes we do try to account for that and
that is that is a materials issue in the
thing okay and you yes I had a little
line on the bottom I was having to go
fast
that said degrades near-earth
environment I what I was forced to take
out there was a comment that I had in
about and I would buy stock and quezon
and the companies that we're going to
rep remake the satellites yeah again
it's it's it's not the thing that you
choose to do you if you discover the
things a rational amount of time ahead
you let it you you try and deal with it
there now I mean one of the other issues
that we just haven't talked about at all
is what do you do if there's a hundred
meter object and it's going to fall
someplace that isn't San Diego and where
do you start saying oh well we should do
something about that and especially we
had section at the conference you
wouldn't believe the liability you take
on if you say oh well that's going to
reach Costa Rica and we've got a lot of
retirees there let's protect Costa Rica
okay and when you do it you know if you
if you try gravity tractor in it well
gosh you see the track point moves
slowly across the earth and you know it
it gets to you know Ulaanbaatar and you
say well and you shouldn't we keep using
fuel and you know probably yes of course
but you know and if the if you do the
shattering case you have something that
you think is going to land in the
Pacific Ocean maybe create a tidal wave
and wash up on some Shores well if you
reduce it you may wind up with a big
piece land
in South America or in Europe and you
know how do you indemnify someone who's
trying to be a good Samaritan and
convert a major disaster into a lesser
one and those are all interesting issues
if it's rear-ending or hitting us
head-on you're talking about an orbit
the one that rear-ends us is one that
has an orbit that aphelion is well far
out and perihelion is in close and then
it's going faster than the earth and it
will overtake it the one that you saw
orbit for there had a perihelion in near
Venus and aphelion near the earth and so
it was going slow and we were overtaking
it neither of those are the really fast
cases okay and then in the case where we
were overtaking it it was 10 meters a
second was the impact velocity and in
one that we were that overtook us that
was in one of the other orbits but not
not exactly coming along the path it was
15 meters in second kilometers a second
sorry kilometers a second
three kilometers a second by the way is
where material takes on the kinetic
energy of high explosive so six
kilometers a second when a thing hits
it's got four times the energy of high
explosive and the 20 kilometers a second
would be a very typical one of anah that
was crossing 30 kilometers a second is
not unheard of to get you can get as
high as 70 kilometers a second the
Leonids when they pass the new earth
environment or crossing it at 70
kilometers a second and to do that you
need a body that is counter-rotating in
the solar system and the peak speed that
you can have at the Earth's orbit is 42
kilometers a second that's that's
something that has very eccentric orbit
and is that it's a
perihelion at the Earth's orbit so if
you have 42 kilometres a second this way
and the Earth's 30 kilometers a second
this way that's the absolute maximum you
can get but that's less very uncommon
and I don't know if any of the INEOS
have that type of orbit
well yeah except they don't call them
weapons then NASA doesn't do weapons
NASA is interested in bodies that impact
the asteroid the interest there is for
the reason that was just mentioned back
here that when that body is hitting you
are guaranteed to get at least the
momentum of the body added to the
asteroid okay now if the body's
approaching the asteroid as it very
likely would at 20 kilometers a second
it's not just depositing its energy its
depositing a lot of energy and so you
have the equivalent of an explosion at
the asteroid surface and that explosion
throws some material off this way
now how much depends a lot on the
porosity of the rock and a very porous
system kind of you know it's like a
catcher's mitt and the thing comes and
it goes and you don't get a lot of
explosions you busy it goes very deep
and you're busy sweeping up lots of
stuff that you know in the NASA report
it says that right now they they get at
the moment it would be for a big
asteroid very difficult to fly something
big enough that you would be comfortable
that it will do the job but on a small
thing you could do that I mean it would
caught it would be a more expensive
mission than the nuclear one because
again you'd be wanting a big massive
thing to run into it but with political
sensitivities you know some year
hopefully the Cold War is a distant
memory and people can think about
nuclear explosives as a tool that might
be usable as opposed to thinking about
them as these terrible weapons and
radiation and in that case you can come
up you know you you can make a choice
differently than we would today perhaps
but in that case if kinetic impactors
would do the job I'm absolutely sure
that you know if they found something
that was coming it was small enough that
they could get a kinetic impactor that
they were pretty sure would do the job
they would do that first and the idea
being only if it didn't work and light
time got short would you use a nuke
sweets that you're talking about the
kinetic impactors about the same level
as I said the typical number for the
kinetic the speed of approach would be
say 20 kilometers a second okay let's
make it twenty one because that divides
three divides into that okay so we got
seven okay and 7 squared is 49 and so
pound-for-pound if you've got one ton of
impactor it's 49 50 it's 50 tons of
explosive equivalent when you pack so
you launch 10 tons instead well now
you're talking about 500 tons half a
kiloton so you've got a choice I can
launch Tim tons of material at it or a
kiloton device I can't exactly say what
it weighs but I'll tell you it's a whole
lot less so you know yeah and that that
actually was in the NASA report as a
possibility also we're talking about
modeling and putting little tiny nukes a
bunch of them on the surface patterning
them to try and nudge it that way
as if it were a bunch of impactors but
you're doing it just with a lot carrying
a lot less mass I mean as long as space
travel cares about mass you know right
now mass is a real important thing if
you're going to lift it off the Earth's
surface it's expensive to get it into
orbit and then to get it out of orbit is
expensive as long as mass is an issue
nuclear energy carries about a million
times the energy as chemical so you know
if it's it's the issue is we only know
crude ways of using it now I would hope
a hundred years in the future we have
more sophisticated ways of using it okay
