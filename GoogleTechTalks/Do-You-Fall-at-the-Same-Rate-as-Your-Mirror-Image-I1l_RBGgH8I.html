parody why do we care about parity of
course what is parity okay why do we
care about about that question but to
motivate all this we want to talk about
I want to make sure that we're all on
the same foot in here we have I know we
have some physicists in the audience so
this talk is not really good for you
it's good for you know really smart
people who want to get some foot in on
what my what the standard cosmology is
and how that jibes with observations why
could we why could we make statements
like the universe is experiment at this
given rate you know what are the
observational do we have observational
wiggle room to to make any other
statement about about the the universe
as it stands today but then you know
part of this motivation is to show that
this modern our standard cosmology works
pretty well it really works well with
meeting the theory that I'm going to
talk about here works really well in the
face of the precision data that we have
but there are problems and these
problems are actually mainly theoretical
problems and then I'll talk about
something that you've all probably heard
a lot about cosmic inflation and how
cosmic inflation alleviates some of
these problems but our point to yet
another problem with cosmic inflation
and then I will bring in this original
question here why parity and then I'll
if hopefully it'll be time to talk about
all this I will talk about the baryon
asymmetry problem in a sense that's the
problem okay so what do we mean by this
barrier in the symmetry problem i'll
talk about introduce that idea and then
i'll provide a mechanism that will be
related to this question about why
parity and then i will end not with
necessarily a conclusion but with some
open-ended questions so first of all why
do you care about parity violation well
we have to go back to like 1956 before
1956 we knew from experimental data that
the week that the electromagnetic
interaction and the strong interaction
for example um basically had the
following feature if i studied a
physical system
givens in a given frame of reference in
this case if I study for example the
decay of a particle called the paion so
the paion is a particle that's made up
of two quarks it's a bouncy of two
quarks and this polygon has zero spin
and hence it doesn't it doesn't have a
preferred handedness so we talk about
the handles of a particle we're really
talking about throwing a football I feel
a football with my right hand and spins
and goes in the same direction to you
versus thrown it with my left hand and
this goes in the same direction this
quantity the product of the spin and its
momentum towards you is a quantity
called helicity so i can have left
handed hill icity and right-handed hill
icity and that's what we mean by having
this year so now the paion is a particle
that actually has no spin but when it
decays it produces two particles with a
spin so apart a pile decay into a heavy
version of the electron called the muon
and that has a given spin and the other
particle we produce is something called
a neutrino which is a charged particle
with spin as well and so because the
spin is conserved mean that it had zero
spin the product of the span of these
two particles that are left have to add
up to be zero okay and it turns out that
if i look at this arm particles that
have zero spin at decatur particles with
opposite spin the electromagnetic
interaction and the strong interaction
obey will produce particles of equal
spin all the time that's what we mean by
parody symmetry the handedness of the
system if I change it from a left-handed
system to its mirror image I will that
the probability of those particles
decane and one handedness is the same as
you can and the other hand is ok that's
what i mean by parity symmetry and so
all of the interactions with thought to
actually obey this basic symmetry of
nature all right um I'll give it to you
for any laser physicists here we you
understand that also an atomic system
this is the case as well these are what
we call selection rules now the year and
Liang realized that when they look
through the data there was no statement
about about the weak interaction ok this
is the interaction that's responsible
for something called beta 2 beta decay
and what they they realize was that
since there was no data they should not
assume that priority is violated and
they propose an experiment and the
result of that experiment done by Madame
mu at Columbia won them the Nobel Prize
so let me explain what's the experiment
is is so what we're looking at here
pointer I guess I don't you so what
we're looking at here is the following
Flynn we're looking at a neutron that's
made up of three quarks we it's made up
of an up quark and two down quarks in a
bound state and this Neutron will decay
into a proton and in doing so it
releases it emits the carry of that
force which is something called aw boson
it's like the photon of the weak
interaction and will also produce an
electron and an anti-neutrino so let's
look at this interaction here we have a
Down co-op that the up quark that
becomes a down quark so that's here once
that happens the neutron becomes a
proton and when the up court becomes a
Down quote it emits this photon is this
arm is W boson and then produces an
electron antineutrino this is a mistake
that should be a bar here for the anti
neutrino if I look at this if I do this
experiment and I look at these electrons
but being produced as pawns as a neutron
becomes a proton in this real
experiments really carbon 60 becoming
nickel 60 okay if i look at this process
and i look to see the mirror image of
this process it will now produce a
right-handed electron and a left-handed
arm antineutrino i never see this i only
see this i only see this result alright
so the mirror image of this interaction
here as a mirror image does not exist in
nature and at the time we didn't have
the theory for that and the triumph of
the standard model of glacier Weinberg
and Salam what's to figure out what that
theory is okay so everything you hear
about the higgs particle is that's all
part of the story how why is it that
nature does not have this so today we
find ourselves in a similar situation
that when i was a postdoc we realized
that we never did this is we never did
this test for gravity so we now have to
ask ourselves what are the experimental
situations that we find ourselves in and
ready or apply general relativity which
is cosmology to explain this and that's
sort of the motivational aspect of this
talk so for those of you who are string
theorists in its audience there are some
aspects of this talk that dust hinge on
string theory but it's not necessary
okay so I'm here to tell you that I'm a
friend of the string Phoenix but I'm
also a friend of other people and other
approaches as well all right you got to
be friendly to everybody hi my friends
out there in spring lane ok all right so
now I want to give a little I put
everything in the cosmological context
so let's move on so the thing I want us
to take away here is that cosmology is
nothing more than apply general
relativity and so I'm going to explain
that to you so the discovery of general
relativity basically says that we should
no longer think of space and time as
this empty stage that we move about it
is dynamical as we are dynamical we move
because we are able to be attracted to
objects gravitationally because space
does been so because it did the dynamics
of space this happens and this happens
because of something called the Einstein
field equations I guess I can't write it
out here more so the Einstein field
equation which is a set of field
equations like electromagnetism
electromagnetism tell us how the
electric and magnetic field bends it in
the presence of electric and magnetic
sources likewise matter and energy
sources like planets and stars and black
holes likewise there's a set of fields
fields that Ben and that feel is a field
of space and time sometimes we call that
the metric view ok so there are
consequences for this in cosmology
because we can apply the Einstein
equations to the entire space time of
our universe if we know them the
distribution of matter in the universe
itself so the big game in cosmology is
the first to all measure that and make a
couple of assumptions and now I want to
tell you what these assumptions are so
what is standard cosmology center
cosmology of these three pillows
two of these pillars are observational
and one is theoretical the first pillar
is a cosmological principle which
basically is a beefed-up version of the
Copernican principle we are not special
the UF every point in every point in the
universe looks the same every direction
in the universe looks the same that's
basically a symmetry principle the
second principle and so we now have
observational evidence of this principle
and we'll talk about that in a second is
it really the case at the universe
doesn't look the same at all vantage
point and then the second principle is
the hub of law which tells you that if i
look at galaxies for our way from us
galaxies further away from this move
faster than galaxies closer to us and
they themselves move at rates
proportional to their distance from each
other and if i combine these two ideas
these two principles and i use
einstein's field equations for the
dynamics of space and time which are 10
coupled nonlinear different differential
equations I find out that theory this
mother theory spits out one unique
solution our modulo the topology so
there's one unique solution for the
space-time of for these two these two
pillars and that's an expanding or
contracting homogeneous and isotropic
space-time so let's turn to this little
cartoon here imagine at the surface of
this balloon I tack on a coordinate
system at every point on the surface so
I have XYZ coordinate system and every
point of that surface and then someone
starts blowing up this balloon at a
constant rate so if I'm a galaxy here
and I look at this other galaxies and
this is the radius this thing that we
call a of T if aft starts growing at
some rate I will actually see even
though I I feel that I'm fixed in my own
coordinate system I will see another
galaxy move away for me and I will see
it another galaxy that's further away
from me move faster because of the
angular velocity right the angular the
tangential velocity are the point is
surface here and that what I've just
shown you there is nothing more than the
solution of the Einstein equations
that's called the hub what I've shown
you there is the fact that Einstein's
theory predicts actually that our
universe actually is this situation it's
a expand in four-dimensional space-time
or a three-dimensional surface embedded
in the four-dimensional space-time where
a of T is what we call a scale factor
and it's expanding and the natural
consequence of this is that we are fix
or we are Co move in with this expansion
and the natural consequence is that we
will see other objects moving away
faster at the further they are from us
so that was the first triumph of the
Einstein equation physicist immediately
jumped on the bandwagon started doing
more calculations they realized that
actually there's a thermo bathiya so the
universe is very hot and dense and
therefore the harder it got then all of
the matter will ionize all of the the
atoms including hydrogen will ionize and
the universe will find itself in a state
in fact if you do this calculation
300,000 years after after this initial
time ok that you should actually see the
decoupling or that started the formation
the universe cools and then I'll see at
some time as universe cools hydrogen are
which the ionization energy of hydrogen
an electron will bind to arm to the
proton it will it will scatter photons
and that photons right will actually be
an equilibrium with that situation and
that there should be a relic thermal
energy associated with that and so it
predicts something that we call a cosmic
microwave background radiation so
physicists were looking for this
background radiation as a consequence of
this experiment space time and little lo
and behold 1967 so before I tell you
about 1967 so the picture we should have
now is that with some early time I won't
talk about this T is equal to zero
that's another talk I could come back
and talk about that in the future if you
want me to but if what this theory does
predict is that a universe filled with
radiation will form hydrogen for the
first time and there'll be a relic
background radiation that we can look
for and this actually has a particular
spectrum and it's a perfect black body
spectrum two things to keep in mind and
as universe continued to cool some of
that stuff clusters and forms galaxies
so in 1967 this was measured the nobel
prize was given teeth and this was what
was measured we're like a chicken inside
of an egg we've cut the egg in half and
open it out and we're looking at at that
time 300,000 years and we see right
exactly this radiation and of course we
saw more things we saw deviations from
that average temperature hot and cold
spots correspond to traps and peaks in
the sea of these arm of this radiation
because it's not oh there's an average
temperature and then there are these
fluctuations today we're going to talk a
lot about that fluctuation this is the W
map satellite I was fortunate enough
last year to hang out with the w map
group at Princeton on sabbatical and got
intimate with this data a little bit
although I'm a theorist what we're
looking at here is a prediction that um
cosmic from inflation will talk about
inflation in a second so the rebbe the
red line is the power spectrum or
basically the Fourier transform of those
dots those undulations ok this is
wavelength so we're looking at the
relative sizes of these fluctuations and
we compare them to each other in the sky
and we are looking at how similar or
different they are from each other and
the prediction of inflation which we'll
talk about in a second and that the
black spots is the data okay so this is
the best fit to the data using four
parameters and this is something called
the power spectrum of the polarization
of the photons so this is kind of cute
you can actually associate these
fluctuations with acoustics so this is
literally an acoustic peak if you think
in terms of sound for those who are more
comfortable with sound if I play an
instrument the instrument resonates at
different frequencies but there's always
an acoustic peak associated with the
length of a flute for example i bought
my soprano sax here and it turns out
that the universe has that acoustic that
character is click sighs so from that
peak we can reduce the size of the
universe at that time coincidentally is
just an a note 50 octaves below
on middle C and this is the latest in
great it's a plank data satellite and we
are currently analyzing that data as we
speak we the community okay and what the
plank data is consistent with the
standard model that we have there are
some anomalies but that's not the
privacy to stalk today but it is
interesting so what did we learn from
this data we can look at this data and
we can see that on some where things
happen what we thought that was so
special about this turns out to be so I
always like to tell people you know if
you ever felt like you were never a
minority this is the time to feel like
you're minority because this is you all
right we are minority we share that in
common okay we're a minority in the
scheme of the universe this these these
these are these dark guys here are the
majority and we have no idea what this
is people say same various things
there's a Discover Magazine article that
came out dark energy this month and I
was quoted at the end with my own crazy
theory I regret it actually interviewing
with discover because now all my
colleagues think i'm even more of a
crackpot okay okay and so i won't talk
about these things today i'm going to
talk about actually i'm going to give
you the Minority Report okay so who
ordered that I mean who gave us this
kind of universe so my friend and
colleague show on Carrie will book a
paper called a preposterous universe
because it is preposterous we all saw
that we were the main stuff so as I said
we have the standard just we have the
standard picture of the universe that as
I said these three pillars predicts an
expanded universe with the features that
we see in this cosmic microwave
background radiation it predicts that
relic background radiation we went and
looked for it all right this was done by
gamma George Gamow and fred hoyle and
people like that way before the 60s and
we found it so we had a model that
explained the Hubble law but also
predict
did this cosmic microwave background
radiation but what it did not predict
what these fluctuations nobody what it
predicted weather smooth and featureless
universe that's expand but unfortunately
we are that those very wrinkles in the
universe that made the standard
cosmology a limited model we need to
explain observational ey these
fluctuations exists because those are
the things that grew into the structure
that we see today meaning galaxies
clusters of galaxies so on so forth but
there's actually a much more serious
problem so we can summarize at the
expansion history of the universe with
this arm Penrose diagram so Penrose
diagram is a way of it's a conformal map
okay that allows me to freeze out that
the time expansion and look at the
expanded universe as a forward set of
forward and backward light cones so in
other words this look at the following
week if I'm looking back at the past
it's like me shining light right on the
back because meaning the fastest
anything can travel is with these
photons these photons will disperse out
okay I'm just giving you an analogous
picture here and so there'll be a
limitation as to at the idea how far
those photons went back all right if
they're traveling the speed of light
they can only cover but a certain amount
of distance okay what is that distance
that distance is forearm is its velocity
which is the speed of light divided by
the time of flight all right I'm sorry
the velocity yeah the veloci the time
the time of flight is a distance divided
by the velocity okay so so in other
words there's a limitation as to how far
back we can see so when we look back at
this Cosmic Microwave Background ok
we're looking far back as like it that
the light could travel to us and we see
something very weird what do we see we
see that the temperature and in typical
points of the sky having the photons
have exactly the same temperature well
for those of you who took thermal
physics know that
for something to reach equilibrium you
must have scattered you must have
interaction but we know that interaction
are limited by causality okay you need
causality for me to bump into you but
we're talking about photons here so that
means at any other point in the back the
light cones is of maximum distances
photon could travel so this photon has
the same temperature as this one but
there's no way they could have been in
causal contact and this is actually an
internal inconsistency with the expand
in space-time so while it predicts is
one thing all right it has the seeds of
its own destruction and cosmologists
basically swept this under the rug okay
until Alan Guth came along Alan Guth is
actually one of my mentors and
coincidentally occupied the same office
when he was at slack and came up with
inflation so I had this idea I have to
like live up to his legacy and I never
did I just happened to work on his
theory more all right so the basic idea
of inflation is to solve this problem
this is what we call the horizon problem
okay how it is that these photons can
communicate with each other when they
didn't have time to do that they need to
do that because we see that they have
the same temperature so Alan Guth had a
really simple idea that assumes that the
expanded universe expanded at the same
rate at all times so Alan just said on
we can fix this problem let's start off
with a tiny peach patch of space-time
very tiny microscopically tiny ok I
don't know very tiny I mean sub you know
sub Fermi scale lesson 10 to the minus
15 centimeters little time piece of
space-time and let's assume that that
space-time had something with the same
property some form of energy with the
same property so the whole there's no
horizon prom day again this is an
assumption and let's assume that stuff
is so weird that it in dollars a
spacetime with negative pressure so at
some point boom this piece of space-time
expands exponentially and you know like
economists when you actually do
inflation you actually have
exponentially expanding functions as
well
so likewise the universe actually
becomes a very very expensive it's on
its way to a bubble okay actually we
have colleagues at work on bubble in
inflation so I'm looking forward to
writing a paper about that about
bursting the bubble if that happens then
what happens is that all these regions
actually become encapsulated and you
solve the horizon problem if you can
manage to set up a set of initial
conditions with the same properties we
got to figure out how to do that how to
order that okay do we have the physics
to do that if that's the case life is
good dandy but there is a bonus out of
this but before I'd say I want to go
talk a little bit more about inflation
what makes inflation happen what is this
stuff that will do it it turns out is
actually dark energy but before I
actually tell you what it is I want to
get something straight here so we like
to think about fields as things that are
the carriers of forces like the
electromagnetic field all right but as a
person that's trained in field theory
okay as a feel fierce we know we know
that the paradigms that everything is a
field okay when we write to standard
model down all these things a
presentation of fields it's just that
these fields are localized because they
have mass okay but there's one electron
field right which is different states of
the electron field and likewise so that
we must look at the paradigm of the
field nor the field paradigm so again if
we try to do inflation we are required
to use a field because that's all we're
left with but it cannot be these other
fields these other fields don't work
okay because these fields screen they
undergo and screen and a screen and they
like to cluster up we need something
that's homogeneous and isotropic
everywhere so it must be a field that
has no spin and we call these fields
scalar fields ok so there's simple field
theories like the electromagnetic field
have spent one and they have two
polarization states
I can never do it properly but so yeah
feel like this so you really think about
a feel so how does inflation work the
basic idea of inflation is that you have
a field the field has potential energy
just like the electromagnetic for you
can have potential energy and it's
something I potential energy it's like
sitting on top of a hill and that
potential energy could Trent just
redistribute itself in the kinetic
energy identity for the conservation of
energy but in inflation the fields are
very has a very interesting property
meaning the potential is very special
potential is very it's very some shallow
not shallow but what's the word for
great has a very low gradient they said
there's an easy word for that flap it's
very flat potential so that means the
feel rolls very slowly so feel well and
very slowly is like something that has
friction there's friction that's slowing
it down okay and it turns out that that
situation if I if I give you a scalar
field with the potential is flat and I
plug that into the Einstein equation you
have to believe me that the solution you
generate is this expand in this Sun
rapidly expanding space time you just
have to believe me that if you gave me
20 minutes of your free time I could
actually walk you through their
calculations are very simple calculation
okay so i hope that yeah that's right
this field takes values at every point
in space but it takes the same value and
then now the field evolves so the field
evolves differently then it's like this
potential is now not becoming flat
anymore so the fact that the potential
remains roughly flat it guarantees that
this people remain constant at different
points in space and that's exactly the
situation we want for inflation right so
we have to write you can actually set
this up as a markov chain believe it or
not no pun intended so if that was the
case cosmologists would not really care
i wouldn't cure but why I care it was I
remember when I was a
as soon and I went to the very first
cosmology conference in Morocco in 1993
I saw a young cosmology post are doing a
calculation for inflation where he was
calculating the perturbations so in
other words this feel is rolling down
but there are things called it's a
quantum field so their quantum
perturbations okay these quantum
perturbations are nothing more than
think of like a little oscillator the
field has is rolling down and then their
little oscillators that fluctuate
because of the uncertainty principle
it's a quantum mechanical system and so
these thing you can't run away from you
must deal with it it's a quite a few of
you so check this out if you actually
calculate this arm these fluctuations of
the of this field in this rapidly
exponentially expanding background you
get a spectrum of these oscillators
these fluctuations and these the
spectrum has a foul and property if
inflation begins at some time that I
give you because I'm God physicists okay
but we okay I don't mean to sound like
that I mean I'm not anybody wants to
kill inflation talk about this okay this
piece here but so inflation is a very
special situation in which the region
that sets causality which we call the
Hubble the horizon okay all of the
perturbations be the arm get generated
in this region of causal contact because
we're doing a local quantum field theory
nice but the rapid expansion takes these
fluctuations stretches it but also
amplifies it so it turns this quantum
thing into a large classical fluctuation
with energy so this gravitational energy
dumps itself into into these large
quantum fluctuation that becomes
classical and they get stretched out of
the horizon kind of magical okay
inflation ends and now we have an
ordinary evolving cosmology these modes
these fluctuations become frozen and
they come back into the horizon now as
classical perturbations and
they're nice and ready to source
structures and if i calculate this and i
calculate the spectrum that's the red
curve that i showed you so what
inflation does and solving the horizon
problem it provides a it provides a arm
a causal micro physical mechanism for
structure so we can now compute of
inflation do calculations and make
predictions up for the for these
fluctuations in the CMB and compare it
to the distribution of galaxies and
clusters of galaxies today and come back
to the drawing board and build better
theories so this is what it allows us to
do it allows us to do physics but there
are some caveats here and I won't get
into it now but we should not drink the
inflation kool-aid theoretically yet
it's a paradigm that is the winning
paradigm right now okay no doubt about
that but as a theorist I still worry
about this question here so I want to
leave it for the Google and geniuses
here maybe one of you can come and help
me out with this here is a problem you
see those like nice little fluctuations
that I calculated their quantum
mechanical I go get Peskin in shorter he
teaches me how to do these calculations
I do the calculation boom I get this
beautiful spectrum all right life is
good well not only these fluctuations
not only affect the spectrum of the
perturbation they affect the potential
the potential also gets quantum
corrected well those very same things
that do a nice job for the fluctuation
can spoil the condition of the flatness
of the potential so many models of
inflation suffer from this problem there
are some models that get around it we
can you know we can do a little dance
but keep that in mind that inflation is
not a perfect theory as yet so I want to
now move on to the second really the
second third of the talk what's the time
perfect I'm right on time so so okay
this is good so inflation as I said does
this night job sales and Ryan problem
gives us structure formation all right
let's do the dance I'm going to quit my
job at Dartmouth and come and hang out
you guys at Google now but unfortunately
I have to stay and continue working on
this stuff because it turns out that
these fluctuations that will generate do
an inflation if you look at the
formalism couples to something called a
gravitational potential remember this
inflation inflation field is the energy
that's driving the space-time the
space-time itself is a feel the in
photon fuel couples sort of
gravitational field a piece of this
gravitational field is a good
old-fashioned gravitational potential
you know the one that the Sun has on us
alright so the universe has a
gravitational potential and that's the
thing that's really sourcing right the
infall of matter into what have you but
you see if we're going to do that we got
to do it democratically we can't say
that the gravitational potential is this
guy chillin out here right and the in
photon field falls into it because of
the gravity of attraction the
gravitational field too must also
democratically undergo fluctuations you
can't do want to not do the other okay
anyway I'm not going to bring up any
analogies for relationships the metric
feel also undergoes the fluctuation and
the fluctuation of the metric feel is
something called a gravitational wave so
I want to talk a little bit about that
and just like how the info Tom feel gave
us a picture of what structure might
look like an early universe how the
primordial structures of form we want to
ask a question about what is a physical
role of these gravitational waves and
yes it will be connected to parity so
that's kind of where we go in here just
so that to reorient you that I don't
want to take you too far so what is a
gravitational wave what we're looking at
upstairs there is a wave this wave has
an amplitude and I'm calling this
amplitude H and its app
oscillate in this case as a function of
time and what this is a gravitational
wave right so it's it's the fluctuation
it's the it is the modulation of of
space-time itself okay and so if I look
at the second line down here I'm looking
at something a schematic of the LIGO
some Lego gravitational wave detector
which are two arms interferometer right
with with laser light going back and
forth be reflected and as a
gravitational wave passes through that
thing it's actually stretches the space
and therefore the arms will get
stretched and they'll get stretched in a
way that as a gravitational wave passes
through there's a compression in the in
in the horizontal direction and a rare
fraction in the vertical direction so it
does this and this right as you see here
so if your talk if you're a 12-person
you get tall as a gravitational wave
passes through but as it the
gravitational wave undergoes an
undulation aware a fraction it makes you
a little bit chubbier so that's what a
gravitational wave does to objects in
space time the space-time itself
stretches and compresses as a
gravitational wave passes through okay
and that intuition should be consistent
with with space-time as a field because
electromagnetic lectra magnetism is a as
a feel that propagates through space
time it needs space time to propagate
within but the metric is a space-time
itself so it supports its own
fluctuation so it must contract and
expand space itself so that's a
gravitational wave and what I'm showing
you here is a first equation that I'm
going to happen to have a few equations
now from here on but this equation is
quite illustrative what we're looking at
here is a wave equation actually if I
solve the Einstein equation for a
gravitational wave normally if I you see
that middle term there if I ignore that
term set it to zero in flat space a
gravitational wave will just be these
two terms which is nothing more than a
wave moving at a speed of light but you
see that middle term there you see that
you have a which is a scale factor in
expanding background a over
a DA dt divided by a is a constant
that's the Hubble parameter so then that
Hubble parameter is quite large during
inflation so what ends up happening if I
solve that wave equation what starts off
as an ordinary wave gets squeezed
meaning that the phase of this wave the
phase you'll all do I produce a
distribution of these waves at different
frequencies and they all get the same
phase this is a phenomenon called
quantum squeezing and this is exactly
how inflation surmises to to amplify and
stretch the gravitational waves this is
quite important because that means
inflation predicts a spectrum of
gravitational wave and that's what we're
going after now when we say the smoking
gun of inflation is to find
gravitational wave this is really a big
part of story that middle term is the
thing that's creating special phase
relationships between all of the
spectrum of all the gravitational waves
so another place that you can imagine
seeing gravitation wave is if i look at
binary systems of safe neutron stars in
this case this is a computer simulation
credit goes to like oh i believe so
leave and get corrected later on but
anyway what we're looking at here is
what how a gravitational wave changes
the space-time as a binary strongly
gravitating binary system goes around
each other so in order to see the
swirling motion but there's a problem
here as I told you if we ought to really
believe this picture of structure
formation and inflation we need to
understand not only the fluctuations of
the in photon field we also need to
understand the following problem the
universe is not just inflation and
gravitational waves the a versus us is
made up of electrons and protons and all
these nice things but one things we know
about our standard model of particle
physics is that there are equal amounts
of matter of
electrons and antielectrons the positron
so for every particle we know that
there's equal amounts of both in real
napkin so what do I mean by that if I
look really far back and I try to find
where this are the equal amounts of you
know what we are is we don't find it we
don't see any Matt we don't see any
antimatter in other words we don't see
anti galaxies okay so here's a problem
the galaxies are the structures that are
formed so why am I not seen anti
galaxies if the universe starts off in a
symmetric state and I believe the story
of inflation I have to confront the
Bison of matter of antimatter either
during inflation or something special
happens after inflation where I got rid
of all the antimatter and so when I was
at slac me in my my boss and my another
post doc mohammed shaikh javari thought
about his problem in the context of
inflation we said maybe there's
something special about inflation that
can do the job and maybe the gravity
waves are the hidden part of the story
so the story begins really in 1967 what
we're dealing with is the genesis of
leptons so remember electrons and
neutrinos and muons are all leptons so
once you if you can form leptons over
anti leptons you actually can produce
baryons much later on okay so this is
called lepto genesis and so in nineteen
the name of the game here is to not
explain the asymmetry that's not enough
you have to explain that number what is
the difference between leptons of anti
leptons divided by the density of
photons and galaxies so this number is a
universal number in every galaxy and
this number also so you can measure this
not just by looking at galaxies or you
can measure this number in the w map
data data and you get the same number so
the name of the game is to not explain
the asymmetry but take
playing the number and that's a number
right there so if you get anything up
you even if you have a mechanism to
explain the asymmetry your theory could
still be wrong unless you have to
explain this number so 1967 andrei
sakharov in a home prison that's the
legend as a picture of him right here he
came up with the three necessary
conditions to explain this arm leptin
this asymmetry so let me walk you
through this because it is actually very
important for the to understand the rest
of the talk so in our standard model the
statement that you have equal amounts of
matter over antimatter is really a
statement of the current so every bit of
marriage the electrons all the fields
actually have a current and the current
is really in particle accelerator that's
what you're looking at you're looking at
the current current interactions and
there's an equation for those currents
and the equation is that the rate of
change of the current is zero so the
vacuum another ground state of the
Standard Model of all the currents are
vanishing the rate of change so if I
start off with a situation like in the
early universe where the current is zero
because it's vacuum then the rate of
change of the current is going to remain
zero so i can i can never the standard
model doesn't have the physics to
produce more current or number density
of particles so you so that's really the
problem but the standard model has
another statement that you have an
equation for the anti current and that
is also 0 so the first thing you need to
do is to come up with new physics that
says that the change of the current is
not 0 you have to figure out how to
speak to the standard model or extend it
in a way that that is no longer the case
but that's not enough to produce a
matter it matter asymmetry you need to
also bias the amount of anti current
over anti current so if I produce more
current but we do small matter and
antimatter imagine I can do that if I'm
producing the same rate of matter and
antimatter they annihilate so
need to simultaneously do something
called CP violation which is notice of
where parodies in there I need to bias I
need to have something like the weak
interaction going on for the leptons
okay the interchange of charge of the
charge and the handedness of the system
has tobias one production channel of
matter over antimatter and why let us
happen in the other degrees of freedom
the photons and all these things the
radiation has to be out of equilibrium
with our production mechanism okay
because you learn from thermodynamics
that if a system is in equilibrium with
its environment it will equal a break
back to its time reversal right which is
matter becoming equal to antimatter so
this is the only page of equations
because this is actually what we're
doing in our model so the theory that
we're working with here is a theory of
gravity that encodes parity violation
naturally what I mean by this is that
this theory takes gravity which is
parody symmetric it doesn't care about a
left-handed system in the right-handed
system it treats them the same
mathematically and therefore its
predictions will be the same and what I
mean by that now is that gravitational
waves I'm going to produce left-handed
gravitational wave I throw a
gravitational wave and my left hand and
the right hand a gravitational wave it
will produce both of them at the same
amplitude but it turns out that I can do
something to general relativity that
biases that and this is done by great
mathematicians turn in Simon's so this
term here is a turn Simon's term and
this term seems to be very robust in any
most approaches to quantum gravity has
this term emitted string theory loop
quantum gravity so this seems to be a
natural extension to general relativity
and what I'm going to show you is that
if i solve for a gravity wave with this
theory something really cool happens do
an inflation and that's all I want to
say about their this theta thing here is
the info Tom field that's coupled into
this turn Simon's term think of this
turn Simon's term
as chopping off you on one hand and
throw on the football the other hand so
this is how the idea works what I'm now
going to say is we're now going to talk
about the possibility of producing
leptons over anti leptons and trying to
see if inflation can give us all three
sakharov conditions in one shot so
here's the basic idea if you guys get
this i'm going to be so happy I mean so
I'm going to try okay the basic idea is
a following inflation is driven by a
field called in photon this in photon
field takes the same value at every
place in space but that's the amplitude
of the field it's a field so the field
also has a phase and it turns out that
the phase of the in photon field is that
thing that couples to the turn Simon's
term so if this phase couples that means
that phase is going to affect other
waves that are produced in this case
gravitational waves so what happens is
that the info Tom field has the same
value it couples to gravity through this
current Simon's term and as a result the
in photon field which drives inflation
that means it's put in my system for out
of equilibrium because nothing can catch
up with that rate of expansion so you
gather not out of equilibrium very
naturally from just the environment of
inflation that same in photon field
sources gravitational waves but its
sources is it sources a gravitational
wave in a way that biases the production
of left handed over right-handed
gravitational waves by a biologist call
this circular dichroism or physicists
call it birefringence okay it is the
preference of one handedness of a wave
over another one in the amplitude so I
have to have to prove show you that that
is the case but it turns out that it
also does something really cool I
believe in page 199 of volume 2 of
Weinberg it turns out that the standard
model has something called a
gravitational anomaly that people didn't
pay attention to well people did pay
attention to they just can find it use
for it and that gravitational anomaly is
actually the statement that D of the
currents is not 0 but it's proportional
to the turn Simon's term itself so if i
have a non-vanishing turn Simon's term
do it inflation I will naturally get the
possibility of producing more lap times
after / anti leptons so what I'm saying
if you buy this story the in photon
field does all three things at the same
time all through the Sakharov condition
so let's see in detail if it works for
the rest of the talk the picture you
should have in your your mind is that
inflation is like this cup of coffee and
as you stir the coffee around one
direction over the other I can produce
gravity waves that's stir in one
direction over another direction and
that stirring can pop matter out of the
vacuum and it does it in a way that's
out of people that is out of equilibrium
he oughta vehicle well it's an a rapidly
expanding cup of coffee so if you want
to put starbucks out of business you do
inflation with coffee alright so this is
a statement remember I told you have D
mu of the j j SZ the lepton and anti
lepton number it's proportional to the
stern Simon's term so if this turns
Simon's term is non vanishing the
left-hand side is going to be non
vanishing but remember this term Simon's
term is related to our is a
gravitational curvature right so to
calculate that thing I have to solve a
modified wave equation for the gravity
wave now this is very important and it's
also a very beautiful equation it's the
left hand side if the right-hand side
was 0 I have the normal situation for
inflation for gravity waves that first
equation I showed you and so I'm going
to produce equal amounts of left and
right hand of gravity waves but because
of the presence of this current Simon's
term what happens is that the left hand
the the left hand of gravity wave is
soft by itself and the in photon field
so and notice here there's a minus sign
here so I'll get a wave with an
amplitude that's proportional to this
chern-simons term so i can get an
exponentially amplified sorry right hand
a gravity wave and at this
same time and exponentially damped left
hand a gravity wave and that is the
source of the left-right asymmetry that
is a statement of parity violation okay
left and right no longer evolved in the
power in the same way well that's nice
because if that is the case then I can I
find H 11 h right if i plug it in or
dual because our dual depends on h left
an age right i find that our duel is non
vanishing so the priority violation
immediately sauces a production of
leptons so i can actually calculate them
all right so the statement here is that
the solutions i get are exponentially
growing and damped gravitational waves
and it's parody violating because
priority takes left into right but in
this case because the amplitudes are
different it doesn't happen all right so
these are some colleagues that were all
right last slide so i can now calculate
this are i'll do it and plug it in and i
get this just now i get the answer and
guess what it only depends on two things
so there's very little fine tuning in
this model and what i find is that it
depends on hubble over m plonk which is
actually an observable measured in the
fluctuation spectrum of the w map and
plant data and then it depends also on
the value of the in photon field which
is something that we can measure by
measuring the ratio of the amplitude of
gravity waves over the power spectrum of
the scale of fluctuations of the in
photon field it also depends on you can
say well which if i produce a full
spectrum of different wavelengths of
gravity waves of left and right-handed
amounts which one's contribute the most
in a production of leptons so the
picture you should have your mind is
that I have these gravity waves they're
interacting with the leptons in a vacuum
and they popping them out during
inflation and they're popping them out
so quickly that it catches up with the
dilution of inflation actually presents
by expanded so if I calculate that
number and i plug in the value of hubbub
over and plunk and if the gravity waves
that contribute or tempted at roughly 10
to 12 Giga electron volts which is
perfectly fine
so it's a very high energy process I
could get the observed verily symmetry
so so what I present you here is a
theory that that seems to be quite
minimal if we believe in the standard
model of inflation and we believe in a
standard model and we believe that
gravity interacts with the standard
model the same you know traditional way
that we expect as a field theory then
this seems to do the job and what we've
done is we found a nice job for the
gravity waves it's not just hanging
around there nature made use of it so
can we test this idea so I should have
about five minutes left okay and the
answer is yes so two ways to test this
idea so some colleagues of mine and a
gravitational wave astronomy side are
looking to see the effects today of
these bio fringe and gravity wave and
these are some of my colleagues that
we've worked on this and the basic idea
is that when I look at a binary system
and I look at the distribution of
gravity waves that are that are that we
detect I won't see I'll see a bimodal
distribution I'll see two different
distributions for left and right gravity
waves if I look at a binary system what
happens when I look at binaries system
that produces gravity waves I can never
find one that's completely in line with
my line of sight it is always an
inclination angle that I'm going to
measure so something really cute happens
when you have parity violation and this
statement summarizes it in the same way
that we that we say that the curvature
of space-time bends light passing close
to strongly gravitating strongly
gravitating body we may say that the
effect of a gravitational parody
violating correction is to rotate the
apparent inclination angle of the binary
systems orbital angular momentum axis
either towards or away from us so it
changes the apparent inclination angle
as opposed to its true inclination angle
all right and the other way that we can
potentially test this is using this
cosmic microwave background radiation
and yes
exactly thanks a burrito it does you
have to also measure an optical
inclination angle and then compare the
deviation from the expected now the
other way that I think is much cool if
we can do this and it will will my
friend Brian heat in the Nobel Prize I'm
just going to be the fear is that just
hand it goes to Stockholm because he's
going to build the experiment so what
the cosmic microwave what inflation
predicts is this red curve for gravity
waves okay this is what we call a b-mode
polarization what any theory that has a
priority violating gravity waves
produces a different curve an order of
magnitude larger than the red curve I'm
sorry which is that black curve up there
so it produces a strongest signal a
signal that's more detectable and right
now my friend Brian Keaton he's good
buddies with um with jim simons jim
simons gave him like crap load of money
to build a satellite to actually look
for this effect because notice it's a
turn Simon's term so so thank you Jim
for funding brine maybe you can fund me
one day he said he's a great guy by the
way so and this is this assignment
survey telescope that my friend Brian
you should invite them out here to talk
about about that design very you know
cutting-edge balam allometry technology
detectors that are way beyond anything
available anywhere you might want to use
some of that tech I don't know what you
guys can do with detectives so here are
the stats on that and I want to conclude
so one of the biggest questions in
particle cosmology is a question of
barrier Genesis or left or Genesis it's
not sufficient to just talk about
structure formation without talking
about how matter one over antimatter
it's a real observational question and
what I present to you was a model that
requires very little new physics no
extra dimensions minimal fine tunings of
course you need to drink the kool-aid of
inflation
and it may be testable by measuring
anomalous parity violating power
Spectras of last slide I showed you and
like Oh or maybe one day Lisa if it
flies might be able to see these
waveforms in binary mergers like black
holes and black holes and neutron stars
and such and this is a great opportunity
to test a fundamental issue in the
closet using Cosmic Microwave Background
polarization and I want to end to make
my string theory friends happy because
the story actually started with a string
theory investigation looking at the
Strand Simon's term that it's possible
that if you find this effect we might be
closer to actually make and model
independent statements about string
theory or theories of quantum gravity
thanks for helping me out China's term
which depends of the incident field
wouldn't have its what is it has
vanished by then and only the apparent
and close to the Big Bang um that's
right so one thing there are two effects
that could happen one is that
propagating effect which is that you can
look at the gravitation wave traveling
to us from the CMB to us so it took it
you know was affected by this church
this field back then and it propagated
to us and it turns out as it propagates
that effect becomes stronger and another
one is a source effect that if the field
exists today it may sauce and you're
correct that their cosmological
constraints that tell us that this in
this field cannot exist and if it does
exist at the very most it's the dark
energy and we know that it has to be
like 10 to the minus 3 electron volts
your question
state that the gravity wave detection
experiments and it seems like those have
been going online for a while now it's
been any results coming out of that room
you know they're very optimistic I mean
I was just visiting my friend Nico
yoona's and neyo Cornish who are heavy
into that game and they're very
optimistic and a big you know they're
optimistic that they will detect a
gravity wave but the question is a
background noise like they have to
always figure out how to get rid of the
things that may appear to be a gravity
wave but because we already saw the
binary pulsar um you know we you know we
know that there should be a gravity wave
out there it's not a question of so I'm
I'm optimistic I'm obviously not privy
to the real technical technical
challenges that they are dealing with
because it's not my not my pay grade but
um with the part of my community that
deals with gravity we're very optimistic
certain you'd really detected a real
gravity wave as opposed to just some
truck passing by like you know this is
exactly the issue they want they have to
figure out what that's signal to noise
is so the question is how do you
characterize that so they this is arm
they have to understand what those four
grounds are and so a big name of the
game is to figure out what a fake signal
is and then model it to subtract it off
that I don't know I think advanced LIGO
and Lisa would be designed to do that
because if you had Lisa flying and ligo
then you can and you saw the same event
then you'll be able to you have two
different locations yes yes because
there's that's not it several the
scatterer the earth yes the answer is
yes yes well that's a good question so
the answer is arm that we should be able
to do that and that's why last year me
and David Spergel and my postdoc worked
on a new model of inflation that is not
based on a scale of fuel but it's based
on something that looks very similar to
quantum electrodynamics and in that case
inflation is actually driven by ordinary
fields in nature and so we're working
now that paper was recently published in
Jake app so you can look for that paper
it's called it's a model based on vector
fields so the photons the photon and
fermions are driving inflation and so
you could for example try to recreate
that situation at the Large Hadron
Collider of the internet the ilc and see
if you see something that smells like
inflation that that I mean that's a
forward-thinking idea but we did that to
show that as a proof of principle that
you can do inflation with ordinary fuels
in nature so part of that was to ask
this question that you're asking exists
what would be the oxidation yeah so
there is that's right there is you know
around every galaxy there are there's
gas so like hydrogen for example so you
would see a lot of like annihilation I'm
going on if there was an anti galaxy so
you would basically see huge flux of
photons so you know we can imagine that
um you know we do have anomalies in the
sky we have things that you know called
cosmic rays and yeah we have very
high-energy cosmic rays maybe it could
be that from that that is a result of
some huge amount of antimatter out there
it's not my pay grade but so for every
you know galaxy person have spoken to
tell me that there's no evidence of huge
anti galaxies out there but i tend to
keep an open mind about things i'm
ignorant about so far I've been able to
answer everybody's questions to scare me
this is google I'm just kiddin ya one
more of the talks said one of the matter
is a distinct minority move is factor of
ten ratio between Catherine antimatter
okay good I'm glad you brought that up
no we saw a factor of ten difference in
an ordinary left to the right symmetric
gravity waves cruces producer inflation
and left right a symmetric gravity waves
so that's a factor of ten but it's
interested in that that factor of ten
maybe the same factor of ten to give you
the barony symmetry so what we're
looking at is really d the arm the
gravity wave power spectrum you know the
distribution of the frequencies or the
gravity waves and what we see is that we
have higher power for larger wavelengths
of gravity waves if they are left right
asymmetric and lower power if they were
left right symmetric I don't have an
intuition for as to why that is the case
and but it's good to think about
yes apparently an almost perfect 73 why
is it a symmetry you know yes I mean is
well so what you know I'm curious if
physics is just a whole bunch of these
near cemeteries which are symmetries
that are slightly broken but they're
there parity is one of these things why
doesn't exist well first of all okay I
think what you mean by that is on in the
weak interaction parity of course is
maximally violated we never see the
other thing but that's right in terms of
all the forces combined the week is the
odd man out okay it's a one that
violates priority and the others if it
violates parody it's a site very weakly
or not at all and so to be honest with
you there is no good answer to that
question we don't know the answer to
that part of why I pursue this line of
research was to understand you know as a
to use gravity as a diagnostic
theoretically to understand that
question because in this case priority
is just weekly violated right it's in
between the talk I was really going to
give you guys was a partial answer to
your question was supposed to show that
actually gravity and the weak
interaction are really the same theory
and the parity violation is a
consequence of a parity symmetric theory
that includes gravity in a weak
interaction but that talk had um listen
I was a friend of mine warned me to not
give that talk here because um well it
was there were no words in the talk oh
very little words
magnetic introduction of the wicked
direction can be beautified into the
electroweak theory that's right the
electroweak theory with parity that's
right that's right so it's a very point
I knows your question so okay so the
electro weak interaction that's a very
good point the electroweak force
actually includes both electromagnetism
and and the weak interaction okay but
what happened is that the Higgs field
breaks that symmetry that's what the
Higgs does right it's like a magnet it
points in a given direction that's what
the Higgs feels like a magnet point in a
given direction and that aligns the weak
field now to to actually disassociate
itself from the electromagnetic field
right and the week view and actually the
way that is done is quite artificial if
you really look at the details and this
is called a Weinberg angle so what sets
the Weinberg angle to be what it is but
it's kind of an input that you you kind
of put that answer in into the dynamics
what we would like is actually see the
answer to your question is related to
this the origin of the parity violation
you guys know where the firewall is put
a wall of fire in fall into it that's so
you know there's this idea that you know
the Hawking radiation actually organizes
itself from the black hole emits walking
radiation into wall of fire for an
observer fall into the black hole i
would say that even if firewalls exist
so it doesn't exist is still a more
fundamental question of information laws
and so you know i don't i don't lose
sleep over firewalls unless I find
myself near one why did you ask that
question I understand song is I guess
you don't you don't think either way no
I mean I think that of its every other
question of do black holes only emit
Hawking radiation or does it absorb
Hawking radiation all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
