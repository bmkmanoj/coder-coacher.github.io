slides so what do you have control of
them so under agile retrospectives
making good teams great I'm Esther Derby
and I I've been doing retrospectives for
a long time I've been doing
retrospective since we used to call them
project retrospectives and we would do
them at the end of a you know year long
marathon project but you know it's not
necessarily the best time to incorporate
learning so since since we have been
working in smaller increments I've been
doing a lot of work with agile
retrospectives so Diana and I got
together and wrote this book to share
some of what we've learned about doing
doing retrospectives that are small and
compact and are looking at short period
of work so i will introduce diana now
this is diana larson she brings a great
wealth of experience working with teams
working with self-organizing teams I
first met Diana through a friend who
thought we would have some fun working
together and he hate turned out to be
right so we've been we've been having
fun working together ever since did you
want to yes yeah I would like to
introduce my friend and colleague Esther
Derby we have been working on
this that we worked on this book for a
couple of years and and during that time
we pair wrote we only wrote when we were
in the same room and we had one keyboard
so we tried to incorporate what we could
of agile practices and philosophies into
actually are producing of this book and
so it was a that was a really valuable
experience for us and every single time
we got together we would got together
for week-long increments at the end of
every iteration we had a retrospective
on what we had done during that time so
I have a zester said we're a colleague
introduced us and and his his idea was
that we would work well together because
he thought he thought we had very
complementary skills and Astor brings to
our our collaboration a much longer
background in in working win in software
development there was a time when she
called an assembler my it's been bits
was some time ago however she also had
the experience of moving so that one day
she was a coder and the next day she was
managing coders and which is an also an
interesting experience and from that
started working a lot with people who
were managing software projects and is
also the co-author of a book called
behind closed doors with Johanna Rothman
so wealth of experience and really
delighted to have her as my collaborator
so I should tell you that where I come
from if we say something interesting
it's not necessarily good ya like like
oh an interesting baby yeah all right so
um enough about us what about you guys
how many of you have led retrospectives
whew how many of you have been in a
retrospective more yeah so was it like
to be in the retrospective okay so five
is wonderful and one is not so great oh
okay got it living the range we got some
fours we got some threes well hopefully
we can give you some um I think there's
one other piece of data there ok what do
that with how many in here have never
LED or been in a retrospective and are
just here because you're curious Wow
okay okay thank you well I think I think
retrospectives are a critical thing to a
critical practice to bring to agile
projects because they are so tied to the
principle of inspect and adapt we
inspect and adapt our code when we do
demonstrations when we review our code
when we test our code we have lots of
ways to get feedback about how our code
is doing and inspecting it at that and
how our products are doing and
retrospectives are the way that we
inspect and adapt our methods are
engineering practices and our teamwork
so it fits right in with that feedback
cycle of looking at what you're doing
checking to see if it's if it's working
well for you if it's doing what you
needed to do or whether you need to make
some changes try some experiments try
doing things a different way so this is
an inspect and adapt cycle that happens
for your methods and your team work at
the end of every iteration now when we
were doing long retrospectives on long
projects we might we might spend I think
the longest when I did was four days
satsang kind of scary yeah well it was
it was a four-year project where they
had worked very very hard to create the
product that was going to save the
company and after four years they put it
into their test it was an embedded
system kind of thing they put it into
their test factory and not a belt
moved or a door opened or a valve change
so it was a big deal for that company I
tend to think if they had been doing
retrospectives earlier they wouldn't
have found themselves in that fix but
we're really going to focus on the
retrospectives that you you use to look
at your work after an iteration so how
long are your iterations here are you
doing one week to week iterations one or
two week generations okay maybe up to 30
days what's the longest iteration you
have here for weeks yeah so mostly to
two weeks I'm 40 km so we're going to
cover a flexible framework that you can
use for a very very short retrospective
the kind of hour hour and a half you may
spend at the end of iteration just
working with your team at the end of a
week-long iteration but you could also
expand it to use it on a much longer
chunk of work so so this is you there
are lots of books sitting around on the
on the seats of chairs and you'll find
this this particular graphic in those
books it illustrates that the idea that
this is an ongoing and linked process
with that just flows naturally at the
end of each iteration moves right into
the retrospective and the framework that
we are proposing and that we have found
works very very well for us and we're
getting a lot of feedback that says it
works well for other folks is enduring
that retrospective we go through five
sort of chunks of work that the group
needs to do in order to have a
successful retrospective and the first
one is to set the stage now we're going
to talk a little bit more about that
that's kind of getting everybody's head
in the room and doing the things that
help get the thing going and then
gathering some data very often we we
start making decisions about what we
want to change or not change about how
we're doing this without really looking
at the data first so the data gathering
phase is a really important one once we
once we have some
to look at data about facts that had
things that happened during the during
the iteration and how we responded to
those things that happen then we have
the opportunity to make meaning of it
generate some insights figure out what
does that mean for us that these things
happen and that we had these responses
or reactions this this happened as a
result of that what does that mean for
us and so we generate some insights then
once we once we've done that then we're
really prepared to say well so what do
we want to do the same or differently or
what else what new things do we want to
try in our next iteration so then we get
to decide what to do and and and
deciding oftentimes people jump to that
before they've really gathered any data
or made meaning of it and so we really
it's an important part of the
retrospective but it needs to come you
know needs to come after those other
phases and then once we have decided
well it's so here's the experiment we're
going to try in our next iteration then
it's time to say okay we're going to
close off this retrospective it's the
end of this one it's going to happens in
a clean kind of way we recap what we've
decided we do a retrospective on the
retrospective figure out how we might
improve that the next time around and
then we're done and then we move right
into planning the planning part of the
next iteration so it's a it's a smooth
continuum of flow of work right out of
the iteration iteration demo into the
retrospective planning back into the
iteration work so it just goes on and on
so speaking of on and on sometimes
people look at that and they think oh my
god this is going to take forever we
don't have time to spend that much time
but actually we find that you can do
these five stages or these five pieces
quickly I'm you can do this in an hour
easily sometimes I've done it in five
10 minutes depending on what the
situation was but we find that it's
really important to go through all of
those five stages and if you skip one
you tend to have either people are not
in the room with you or they're talking
from different you know everybody's
looking at a different set of data
everybody's not on the same page to use
that phrase or people may not have
decisions that everyone can support and
move forward with so it sounds like a
lot to do but it can be done quickly and
we find that if you if you skip one of
these you compromise the results so
we're going to talk a little bit about
each one of these stages so set the
stage is actually where you just kind of
set the container for the work you're
going to be doing so you have a goal on
how many of you are using a goal like
continuous improvement or decide you
know what well what went differently
some of you how many of you are using a
goal that's different than that of those
who are doing retrospectives no okay
that's a that's a reasonable goal to
start out with you know let's look at
what's working and what's not working we
find that after a while that gets really
boring and people can't think of
anything else they want to change so
then it's useful to switch the goal to
maybe looking at our teamwork looking at
how well we're applying our coding
standards looking at how well we're
refactoring looking at how well we're
doing the XP practices so that's all
part of the stage is deciding what what
the goal is for this particular
retrospective so you have a goal you
have a plan laid out you tell people
what the plan is because people like to
know how they're going to be spending
their time and often we do some kind of
check-in just so people can say a little
bit about what's going on for them and
and set it aside I find check-ins are
really helpful for people to unhook from
the stuff that's been going on for the
rest of their day and just get into the
room sometimes we do working agreements
at this at this point and this is one of
the exercises we often do as a precursor
to
working agreements which is helping
people focus on what ways they're the
ways they're going to interact together
that will help them achieve a really
good result out of the retrospective has
anyone ever been in a retrospective that
kind of turned into a you know downward
cycle of blame and fining yeah it can
happen if you don't pay attention to
this stuff so that that's another reason
to spend some time setting the stage
this is an exercise we do called focus
on focus off that I've kind of
abbreviated to fo fo now which ask looks
ask people to look at you know what
would what would it look like if we were
had an inquiring state of mind vs we
were being an advocacy what it what
would it look like if we were trying to
be in dialogue with the people on our
team rather than debating the people on
their team and use that as a precursor
to help people make some agreements for
the time of the retrospective they're
not forever they're not for the rest of
your life but just about how we're going
to work together during this
retrospective we're tag team and here so
so um so we have we have our goal we we
have some agreements about how we're
going to work together we've got
everybody's head spaces in the room now
now we're ready to think together and
that really is what begins to happen was
happening in data gathering and one of
the things that we've noticed a lot in
working with agile methods is a very
team focused kind of way of going about
developing software well you know most
of us are trained very well to think and
make decisions and gather data and
analyze and all those kinds of things as
an individual I mean that's mostly what
our academics prepare us for you know
sharing ideas with someone sometimes
it's called cheating in in the way we
are prepared but then we get into the
workplace in particularly in an agile
environment and we're expected to to be
a group and so this is where we start
using different kinds of meth
and tools to think together as a group
which is a different way of thinking for
most of us and and it's one of the
reasons I think that that teams often
struggle with doing processes like
retrospectives and planning because
they're not used to thinking together
and so gathering data is one of the
first things we do in this process of
really beginning to think together so as
we gather data we look back over the
course of the iteration or the release
or whatever period of time we're looking
at in the retrospective we go back we we
use various methods for this sometimes
we use a method called oops a timeline
where we ask people to actually put
events this was a group of folks who who
were doing a retrospective over a plant
a bigger piece of planning and three
iterations so so they went they thought
back through what had happened as they
did that process and put up the events
that they felt were important to them so
that we had some data we had a common
understanding of what this project had
been so far what the experience the work
had been so far very often we are all
working heads down we come to the end of
the iteration we have very different
pictures of what went on and so part of
the part of the job of the gathered data
phase is to make sure we're all talking
about the same the same stuff the same
iteration we all have a fuller picture
of what it actually was and so we we
gather data in in facts like the kinds
of events that might have occurred when
people came onto the project if they
came in later what different things that
might have happened and then this one
was added something called an emotional
seismograph which is folks went through
and said here's where my you know it's
what my energy was like over the course
of this of these iterations so we look
for some way of
feathering some data not only about
facts but about feelings but about how
we responded to the events that occur
can I jump in for just a second we very
rarely use the f-word when we do
retrospectives the feeling word so we
may say energy instead of how are you
feeling you know do you think I would
work well here if you went up to
somewhere and said how are you feeling
maybe maybe not yeah so so sometimes
sometimes this will be high energy low
energy sometimes we'll use a range of
for gathering that data about how
satisfied were you with what was going
on during this part of the iteration
there are lots of other ways of getting
that kind of data without using the F
word that up work that F word yeah any F
word yeah we want to keep in general
yeah so um so that's what we're looking
for in the gathered a two-phase to get a
picture of what really happened during
this iteration or this chunk of time we
have an agreed-upon idea now of what
we're really going to talk about as we
go into the next couple of phases we
found that you know two people can look
at the same event and see it very very
differently so that's why that is so
important after you've gathered some
data then it's really the time to step
back and do some analysis so this is the
part the part where you're trying to
figure out how did things get to be the
way they are you know what were the
underlying causes what were the patterns
what does this data tell us about how
we're using our methods how we're
working together I think in general in
u.s. culture and in engineering cultures
we really like this part you know we
really like getting in there and kind of
figuring stuff out and if we if we've
gathered our data then we are more like
the team is more likely to come to some
common and shared understandings rather
than
advocating for their own particular
interpretation of why things are the way
they are so this is the part where you
really dig in and you start looking into
what were the patterns you know what may
have been the underlying causes what are
the things that that are that are
keeping this practice is in place if we
if we've tried to change things and they
don't change so there's a lot of
analysis that goes on in in this part of
the retrospective to help you figure out
really why things are the way they are
and what would be a good thing for us
for us to do to change things so this is
a simple method that we use sometimes in
this in this part of the retrospective
this one is we call this the learning
matrix and we just divide a sheet of
paper in four things and at the top or
what went well and what didn't go so
well what we would want to do
differently which are questions that
show up in a lot of retrospectives
sometimes they're the only questions in
a retrospective and we find that when
retrospective start there they tend to
get fairly superficial insights but if
you've gone through the gathering some
data you tend to get a better level of
insight here on the bottom part of it
are you know ideas of things we could do
differently and that's a little bouquet
there there's someone you want to hand
up okay because they did something that
really helped the team this is a quick
way to to do the generating insights
phase a retrospective
so when we when we have a shared picture
of what went on during during our work
together when we've made some meaning
out of that we're ready then to say okay
what do we want to do with this what
direction does this does this send us in
what what really what concrete actions
do we want to take and those can come in
a number of different flavors it might
be things that we've been doing that we
don't ever want to do again we don't
want that outcome ever to happen again
and we've done some analysis about why
it happened and so we we really wanted
we want to shift that we want to do
something different in that arena it may
be that we want to or we want to adjust
it in some way we want to just refine it
may be that there's been something going
on during during the time that we've
been working together that has actually
contributed a lot to our success but
we're taking it for granted and so we
need to actually pay some attention to
it and ensure that it continues and I
was at to talking with someone earlier
this week about a project where they
were on where where they had been doing
some some some things that were really
helpful to them and over time they kind
of know they they got a little smug
about it and they just stopped paying
attention to some of those things and
they started noticing that their
productivity was degrading and when they
when they really they chose to have a
retrospective where they focused on that
that solely was their goal why are these
things not happening anymore that used
to happen that was the goal that they
chose and out of that they discovered we
weren't paying attention to these things
that were making it successful so we
want to look at a number of different
things and then make some choices about
what is it we want to do in the next
iteration that we think will help to
make things better around our goal
whatever our goal might be
we really suggest that teams don't take
on too much I me know if you really if
you've got a two week iteration some
teams have one week iterations you can't
have ten improvement plans you'd never
get any other work done right so you
need to pick them to one or two or maybe
three then that's a big stretch really
one or two things that as a group the
team thinks would really help them the
next time or just an experiment that
they want to try this is how some teams
begin to add in some of the XP
engineering practices they'll say well
you know based on based on some of the
things that happened this last time I
think if we gave you no more attention
to you know formally making sure that
we're we're pairing together and making
sure that we're all doing that on a
consistent basis because now it's kind
of catch as catch can and we think we do
better if more of us we're pairing so
that might be the piece that that you
take on the experiment that you try and
it's just an experiment and at the end
of the iteration have another
retrospective you have an opportunity to
assess how did that go so in deciding
what to do is where we make some choices
about what are we going to do in the
next iteration that we think it's going
to help and you know very often it's
just ideas go up and in this instance
we've done some just voting with dots
and this team is made some choices about
you know that they're going to go with
whichever ideas get the highest votes
and that's that's how they're going to
decide it's just kind of a majority
rules kind of thing or that energy rules
because I think these people all got
more than one
when they voted but so they but they
made a decision they made a group that
decision as a group that they were all
willing to support about what they're
going to do in the next iteration that
they think is going to continue to
improve how their work gets done I just
want to add one little subtlety about
prioritizing I have noticed that
depending on how you ask the question
you get very different results like if
you say what's most important for us to
do you may get one set of results people
will look at look at the list and say
well really this is most important and
then sometimes it doesn't get done right
but if you ask you know what's what will
have the biggest effect on us or what do
we have most energy for you tend to get
you tend to get an agreement on
something that people are going to have
a little more commitment to follow
through on so yeah patent app guys just
have to add that yeah on the final part
of retrospective is of a retrospective
is actually closing the retrospective
and I find that it's important and
helpful to do this decisively rather
than just kind of letting things dribble
away and go off into another meeting now
so you end it decisively I saying you
know we're at the end of our
retrospective I'd like to appreciate you
for all your hard work decide how you're
going to follow up do a retrospective on
the retrospective and close before I
before I go into this I want to say
something about what you do to follow up
a lot of people I've talked to people
who say that they you know they did some
retrospectives but nothing ever changed
you know we came up with all these great
ideas we had this plan and nothing ever
changed and when I ask some more
questions I usually find out that that's
because either they had no way to follow
up or even more
commonly they had a separate improvement
plan that lived over there somewhere and
when you have a separate improvement
plan it almost never gets incorporated
into the into the work of developing
software because you know people are
focusing on doing that so that piece of
follow-up about we're going to take our
plans into our iteration planning
meeting I think is a critical thing for
actually having retrospectives that get
some results so this is one one way that
we do a retrospective on a retrospective
and this is actually useful for any kind
of meeting you have or working session
in its measuring return on time invested
so you've invested an hour in this
retrospective did you get a high return
on the time you invested it was it a
break-even that for an hour you feel
like you got an you know an hour's worth
of insight or benefit out of it and on
zero is spice thing you know I really
like this is an hour of my life I'm not
going to get back and I felt like it was
wasted on so this is a way that you can
look at how about how much value people
are finding in your retrospectives and
get some ideas about how to change I
would follow this up by asking what
specifically would have made this a more
valuable meaning for you you know when I
do this kind of our oti gauge I'm
satisfied if people are a tattoo or
above you know to is break even you know
I invested an hour I got an hour worth
of benefit out of it that's fine that's
fine with me if someone got a zero well
then I'd want to know and sometimes it's
not about what you as a retrospective
leader did sometimes it it was that you
know I you know I I was so distracted by
some other stuff going on that I just
really couldn't participate so it may
not be a reflection on you it may just
be a reflection what's going on but
there are a number of ways that you can
look back at your retrospective and
figure out how to make them better right
I in the spirit of continuous
improvement it doesn't have to take long
that that goes quite quickly
so but you know we do so we do sorry
start doing retrospectives on a regular
basis we don't just wait to the end of
the project to do one big one at which
point it's too late to do anything about
that project anyway we decide we're
going to commit to doing them every
iteration every release and what will we
get from that we actually went out and
pulled some of our colleagues who work
inside big organizations and ask them
you know what kind of results are you
getting from from the retrospective you
are leading and from the retrospectives
you know other people in your
organization are leading that youth that
you've trained to in that process and
these are the things that they told us
and there are some some really big
companies whose names we unfortunately
are not free to mention who have
actually collected some data on these on
these dimensions but what they tell us
is they get improved productivity people
know what it is they want to do they
continue to make improvements and
changes they get into a continuous
improvement state of mind and things
continually get better in you know not
always in a smooth curve but over time
they see that when they're when they've
installed retrospectives as a regular
part of how the project gets done they
start seeing that that people are just
able to be more productive they may
understand how they fit in the team they
understand what the work is they
understand what they're going to do also
improves capability and that's because
in a retrospective you you begin the top
being that gathering data phase where
people are talking about how they have
different perspectives on what happened
during the iteration people begin to be
able to see things through different
eyes through not only their own
experience of the iteration but through
that
other folks too and that helps them
begin to take on some additional some
additional capabilities they can see the
world in a broader kind of way also as
of the result of some of the experiments
that teams choose to do it causes an
increase in capability on the team we've
had a number of teams who've you know as
you may have noticed in the the one
illustration teams who say you know we
want to we really want to focus on
sharing our learning if I read a book or
if I go to a training class I want to
make sure I come back and give a brown
bag to my team and make sure that you
know I i transmit that information that
also feeds into improving capability
improving quality all feedback loops
help to improve the quality of both
quality of work life and quality of
product increased capacity teams that
are doing retrospectives it's one of
those sort of counterintuitive kinds of
things that when they take time away
from the work to do a retrospective they
actually end up getting more work done
so their capacity increases and in
general because of these these regular
sort of timeouts to examine how is our
teamwork going how our methods going is
our processes working for us taking the
time to do that builds trust and morale
and the teams so what this is what we
got when we do regular retrospectives
may not get it out of the first one or
even out of the first two that you do
but when they become a regular part of
how a project is is accomplished then we
begin to see these kinds of benefits
so we talked a little bit of a few
minutes ago on the decide what to do
slide about actually getting results out
of a retrospective and one way to do
that is to make sure that the plans are
incorporated into the day-to-day work
plan so it's not some separate
improvement plan over here or separate
experiment plan over here it's just
we're going to do one thing in the next
iteration or maybe two things in the
next iteration to get better so that's a
key thing you can do but then you have
to support change we find that when
people are learning any new skill are
going through any change they need a few
you know a few things to help them along
they need reinforcements so they need to
have that goal in front of them to know
that you know this is this is why we're
going through the pain of making a
change this is why we're going through
the disruption of it they need empathy
to understand to acknowledge that change
can be difficult and change can be hard
so it's not the you know pull up your
socks and buck up and get with the
program it's just you know acknowledging
that change can be difficult people need
opportunities to learn and try out the
new things that they have decided
they're going to incorporate into the
way they're working so they need
opportunities to actually get the
information get the skills and then
practice because we all need to practice
in order to learn anything new I think
most of us recognize that if we're
learning a new sport we aren't going to
do it perfectly the first time but
somehow when we when we learn
intellectual things or skill things we
often feel like well you know we went to
class we should know how to do it you
know but in reality it takes practice so
to support people through change we need
to give them opportunities to practice
people need reminders because people
will fall back into their old habits so
if your team has agreed that you know on
this iteration we are really going to
become much more systematic about
refactoring you know people may need
some reminders
you know hey we agreed that we were
going to refactor so we can't let that
slide so little reminders to help people
build that new habit into their business
as usual kind of this is how we do
things around here you know one of the
techniques that we hear about a lot in
agile teams are big visible charts and
big visible charts can work very well as
both reinforcers and reminders of what
people have chosen to do in the next
iteration and sharing responsibility a
trap that I see a lot on retrospectives
is that the coach the agile coach or the
manager of the project manager will say
oh well that's my problem to solve and
oh I'll take care of that and oh that's
on my list and they suck up all the
responsibility for making all the
changes and either they get overwhelmed
and nothing gets done or they set up a
dynamic where the team doesn't believe
anymore that they can actually act on
their own behalf and make their own work
life better so I think it's really
important in retrospect is to make sure
that it's not just one person who takes
responsibility for change sometimes it's
you know the the most senior developer
that will take all the responsibility
but I think it's really critical that
that responsibility be shared okay now
what
Oh people often ask us what's the best
retrospective you've ever been in so
what's the best retrospective you've
ever been in your favorite retrospective
my favorite retrospective well I'm kind
of a large group geek I like I like
working with very large groups and so I
had the opportunity one time to do a
retrospective with 75 people in the room
and that was really fun it was really
fun and I was looking at a really big
project it actually had been a
two-and-a-half-year project that had 300
people on it so the 75 were sort of a
representative sample of all the
different functions and different folks
different areas that folks had job areas
that folks had done on the team and and
they chose to really focus on how to
replicate their success because they had
created a really marvelous product that
everybody thought was really cool by the
time they got to the end and so it was a
very fun retrospective what was one of
my high points how about you Esther well
you know I hate to choose just one I
know it's hard it's hard um-hmm and my
favorite today it might be a different
one tomorrow but my favorite one today
is one where the the developers had kind
of known all along that this project
wasn't going anywhere but management was
so intent on on believing that it was
going to work that they just they
couldn't listen for whatever reason and
by the time we got to the retrospective
that that group was the developers were
so angry that they were just they were
just spitting and they they were just
loaded for bear and wanted to go after
the managers so i sent the managers off
into another room to work on an activity
and i sat with the developers
and talk to them about what their
experience had been and and how it felt
to them and they went from being very
angry and very to seeing some really
really nasty things about those managers
that I cannot repeat in this room to
making just a very strong statement
about you know we we are professionals
we will do our best to give you reliable
information we will tell you about our
progress in these ways and we expect in
return that you'll listen to it so they
just made a really strong statement
about you know we we are competent
capable intelligent people this is how
we are going to contribute to the
success this is what we expect from you
and it was just a huge shift and they
went from being angry and beaten down to
saying you know we're not going to let
this happen again and and we can talk
about it in a way that's respectful of
us and respectful of other people so
that that's my favorite today so of
those of you who have either lead
retrospectives or participated in one or
more who has a high point that you would
like to share you need a microphone in
the middle of the room here
who has a high point
mm-hmm this group could use some work
hmm i have actually another high point
that that I really like is gradually
captive I'll give you another one you
can have several loads if you look it's
an actually in San anecdote that shows
up in the book where during a
retrospective we did a timeline and in
that one we gathered that sort of
response reaction data using sticky dots
we put sticky dots on the on the
different events and and I in that one I
asked them to put one color of dot on if
they thought this was something that
happened that really helped the team
during that period of time and another
color of dot if I thought it was
something that really you know was kind
of a crisis or didn't work so well for
the team and there was this one one card
that had like all all but one of the
dots on it were this was a great thing
and the one dot you know what said Donal
this was terrible and so I I just asked
you know will tell what's going on here
and it turned out that one of the one of
the people on the team a young woman on
the team had in at one of the daily
meetings had just blown up about
something that she gonna go deal with
the technology okay that oh that that
she had been dealing you know holding in
for some time and she thought that it
really was disruptive to the team that
she had finally said this thing that had
been just she'd been holding in and the
rest of the team thought it was great in
her and and watching the transformation
of what happened in that team as they
told her why that was so valuable to
them that she actually just said what
she thought finally and her hearing that
what she had to say on the team was was
valued and was worthwhile was a pretty
amazing moment and that it's in a
perfect illustration of why it's
important to gather data
yeah yeah all right so I think we're
going to the next one the next one yeah
Oh low points mmm-hmm in the desert of
the lupus in the desert stranded in your
wagon with nothing to pull it yeah
what's your low point Diana
um my low point is a time in a
retrospective when it was very similar
to what you were just you were talking
about earlier when I was in a
retrospective and his team had come up
with way too many process improvements
that they wanted to make and one person
on the team kept saying I want to take
care of that I want to take care of that
I want to take care of that and and I
kept asking are you sure that this is
the best way to do then there was no way
I could budge them and I want nor could
budge her who was taking on all this
stuff and I kept saying well what are
you going to take off your plate if
you're putting all these things up
nothing nothing was and so we walked out
of there and I had the feeling that
things weren't going to go the
improvements were not going to happen
and sure enough when I checked in about
six weeks later with my person that had
been my contact there and I said what's
you know what's going on and he said
well this woman had not much had
happened because this woman had burned
out and left the company and nobody had
been you know there wasn't any way for
people to pick up all those things that
she said she was going to do so that
felt pretty icky felt like they had done
a lot of work and didn't didn't get as
much value for it as I would have liked
to seen them got bit and they didn't
actually cup made a couple of
improvements out of it that were things
other people could do but all the whole
long list of things she had me into what
about the one where the where the
facilitator was the person leading the
retrospective yeah it was hard that was
when I was in yeah I was in a
retrospective someone else was leading
it and it was a brainstorming session
and as people called things out to be
recorded he was writing down what he
wanted to write
instead of what people were saying and
it was pretty frustrating i was in the
same retrospective as kind of
astonishing um they're not very
satisfying and nothing happened yeah so
the robots to hear your local let's do
it it's sellable I know but I just
wanted just before they get too excited
about their low point stories we want to
hear yours too but I'm noticing the time
so well here esters and then maybe we
can hear your low point stories later on
and give you some ideas on how someone
else the halogen you could address
address a situation so alright so my low
point um I was in a big retrospective
with you know I think there were 30
people who had worked on this inter this
iteration it was the end of a release so
it's like you know two months worth of
work and one of the things I sometimes
do in retrospectives is an activity
called appreciations where people just
take a minute to say something that
someone has done that really helped them
so people were doing that you know that
people think engineers won't like that
but my experiences they almost always do
so they'll start it a little slow but
then people started really liking and
they were saying how I appreciated that
you helped me find that bug and I
appreciated that you helped me learn how
to use this particular and the sponsor
of the retrospective stood up and said
the wrong people are being appreciated
in this robe and stormed out so one of
those moments you were say oh my
goodness what whatever do I do now so I
Bree I took a few deep breaths and I
said hmm what just happened and the
people in the room said oh she's like
that a lot and at all well this this
explains much about this organization so
again I gave them a task to do and he
said she'll be in the ladies room
sulking so I had to go off to the ladies
room
I have a chat yeah um I don't know what
it what I would have done if it had been
the men's room but I might have gone in
and had a chat I might have you know
just put a sign up on the door out of
order don't come in and you know it's
gone and had the chat um but so we had a
chat and then it surfaced a bunch of
other stuff that was going on with a
management team there which we then
worked on and things got a little better
but you know hey I lived and chances are
that you know sooner or later if you do
retrospectives you'll run into something
that's a little distressing and not
quite what you anticipated but you'll
live through it you know you live
through it you get over it yeah and you
have to tell story I didn't get great
stories to tell yeah so um so this has
been a pretty fast and high level
overview of what we think of is really
important things to think about when
you're thinking about having working it
in agile practices I mean I blogged on
this a little while back on I have a
feeling that if any team that was really
focused on continually improving their
their methods and their teamwork and
that hat was in an atmosphere a company
that supported learning and they did
regular retrospectives I think sooner or
later they'd sort of invent most of the
agile practices on their own but that's
just me so I think it's very central to
as Esther said earlier it's a part of
the inspect and adapt cycle you really
can't be agile doing agile methods hood
using these philosophies and practices
if you're not inspecting and adapting
all of it and and the retrospective is
the best tool i know for inspecting and
adapting methods and teamwork and
processes so you just want to give leave
you with a thought about what one thing
if you could just change
thing about your retrospective so that
you think you would just get a little
more value out of them what would that
one thing be would that one thing be
maybe it's a happy bunch don't try to do
a wholesale thing weren't thoughts start
doing them is a good one thank you Dave
yeah yeah but there might be others for
those those of you who are already doing
that it might be something that you want
a little increment you want to tweak so
you want to leave you with that thought
and thank you for your time yes the
light of that all you show up with it
and and we will be at the good we're
going to be at what are we going to be
at its room Turner over they are from
four to five and one hour so if you have
other questions or want you know some
generate some ideas about how you can
work with your retrospectives we'd be
happy to talk to you other people you
would have said yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
