educator I have been since 1998 which
means that I've done way way way too
many sexuality courses classes tons of
training I've had about well now going
on 10 years of peer-to-peer counseling
experience doing everything from
face-to-face counseling work in crisis
hotlines I speak to sex educators I
lecture sometimes it places like UC
Berkeley to cyber law students I am a
sex writer I have over 24 books in print
and also published digitally as well
about human sexuality and books that
I've edited about erotica
I am a blogger I blog for sites like
fleshpot calm which means that I've been
basically staring at porn for the past
three or four years of my life online so
I know the porn scape pretty well online
I'm also the sex columnist for the San
Francisco Chronicle among many many many
other things
and so I am Miss blue I am your
substitute teacher for today I'm here to
teach you all about abstinence because
you know what day it is Valentine's Day
right does everybody know what
abstinence is
I'm gonna take that as a no so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to start by
passing out some abstinence pledge card
just for all of you because knowledge is
power and Google you are worth the wait
plus it'll make you more productive so
what they say is starting today I name
pledge to abstain from sexual activity
until marriage as this is the only
proven way to protect myself from out of
what Jager giggling from out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and STDs I am worth the wait
and it's trademarked are so please I'll
answer that in a moment
actually you're jumping ahead in the
presentation so let me just make sure
that everybody gets one takes them pass
them down I don't know if I printed
enough actually well those of you who
don't get any please just cross your
legs for the duration and and maybe pray
that might help too because I hear that
prayer is very effective
there's just a couple and it looks like
I actually don't have enough here take
one and try and hit the back of the room
here I'm sorry everyone on this side
you're going to have to keep your legs
crossed ooh extra tight
maybe you can share your pledge cards
with a friend so today isn't just
Valentine's Day it is also the fifth
annual day of purity there we go the
15th day of purity so basically what
that means is that in schools across the
United States a large amount of schools
are also passing around pledge cards
let's pledge cards sponsored by this
organization among many other
organizations they're passing out pledge
cards and they're taking students and
this is in public schools like high
schools and middle schools and they're
having students sign these pledge cards
to pledge to be abstinent until marriage
and basically doing it all on public
funds on public time and in public
spaces and now if I do this I'm going to
show you this really quick this is a
list of schools that are participating
in the purity pledge today and this is
across the u.s.
yeah probably
see what surprises amuse all these
California ones
I mean well Chico I mean come on and
Sacramento well you know but still
Sacramento it's our capital but anyway
you can see that the list hello a little
laptop the list goes on and on and on
noted
all right so in most American public
schools that include a minute of sex
Edie
it focuses exclusively on reproduction
and it only shows students illustrations
abstinence has been taught on one level
or another in schools across the United
States for all of time but when George
Dobie took office
surprise surprise an abstinence-only or
in quotes abstinence only until marriage
which are actually important phrases in
this entire presentation and throughout
all the legislation this focus was
aggressively pushed as the primary
meaning the only way to give kids
information about sex like here's an
example of a poster and the way that
they're sort of pushing his stuff and
trying to make it look super cool and
this wasn't just George W this actually
started back in reagan's days and
Clinton although sometimes I kind of
madly want to cram that guy back into
office as hard as I can
he'd also approved eighty million a year
for abstinence education in public
schools which was just stuff tailing on
what Reagan did so now the Bush has
taken office about two hundred and eight
million is carved out of social services
exclusively for abstinence only
education not including the additional
congressional money for programs and
matching funds from private religious
organizations for States schools and
abstinence programs who want to play a
ball abstinence only education in public
schools is a billion dollar industry
right now it's amazing it's a big golden
carat of cash starts federally at about
$700,000 per state on state level and it
just builds on top of that also as it
turns out it's quite a racket for
private nonprofit
organizations something I want to
mention too is that in 2004 Bush very
quietly issued an anti condom
regulations into requirements for absent
abstinence program lessons not too many
people knew about that there was no
fanfare there wasn't any media about it
but it was strict anti condom so what is
what's in the regulations what's
required if you're going to teach
abstinence to schools across America I
was really curious yeah here's the
guidance the guidance requirements also
known as the A through H requirements
you'll hear me refer to those 1 1 or 2
more times I just want to read a couple
of excerpts for you which may answer
your question ma'am about those homos
required content excerpts curriculum
must not contain any material
inconsistent with any of the A through H
elements material must not promote
contraception and/or condom use as a pro
so as opposed to risk elimination a
curriculum must not promote or encourage
sexual activity outside of marriage a
curriculum must not promote or encourage
the use of any type of contraceptives
outside marriage or refer to abstinence
as a form of contraception this is the
correct way also in the additional
guidance regarding curriculum content
we've got the curriculum must have a
clear message regarding the importance
of student abstinence from sexual
activity until marriage and must
emphasize the best life outcomes are
more likely obtained if an individual
abstains until marriage throughout the
entire curriculum that her marriage must
be defined as only a legal union between
one man and one woman as a husband and
wife the word spouse refers to only a
person of the opposite sex who is a
husband or wife
I've been doing it wrong this whole time
no wonder I'm so hungry the curriculum
must teach the psychological and
physical benefits of sexual abstinence
until marriage for youth information on
contraceptives if included must be
age-appropriate and presented only as it
supports the abstinence message being
presented curriculum must not promote or
endorse distribute or demonstrate the
use of contraception or instruct
students on contraceptive usage the
following national allergies and
infectious diseases definitions for STDs
must be applied throughout the document
so could you imagine like trying to
teach kids absence ears like you get in
front of them right and you're like
you're like okay children we're here
today to talk about abstinence
abstinence from what's that can I say
sex in clinical terms ok reproduction
but I can't tell them what sex is ok
we're here to talk about sexual
reproduction students it's when a man in
it what I have to say and a woman I
can't okay I know I can't say a man
because then oh right they could think
it's a man and a man or just just one
man right right that that would be self
abuse ok and a man well if it was a man
and a man then they'd want benefits yeah
ok that's a that's friendship with
benefits ok so anyway you see what I'm
saying it's kind of like they can't
describe penetration they can't describe
condom usage what are they where does
this come from well that begs the
question mommy where does abstinence
come from but wait a minute hold on a
second here
let me go back if this laptop will let
me go back here we go the following NASA
National Institute of allergies and
infectious diseases definitions for STDs
must be applied throughout the document
wait a minute who the hell is that
and why why are they getting to define
STDs and and federally applied money as
according to STDs I weren't really
wondered when I saw that who the
National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases is and why isn't the
CDC being cited who is our our federal
policy maker in this area well it's a
research
grant program directed by
husband-and-wife team the husband being
Anthony SOG whose name I hope I'm saying
correctly a longtime advisor to George W
Bush Nyad is a grant research funding
org meaning the support research as
opposed to the CDC which is our federal
disease and immune immunology policy
organization who focuses on
disseminating accurate data and
implementation of prevention and safety
and the CDC is staffed by 14,000
employees in 40 countries and 170
different occupations niod basically
gets to set the rules by which all
abstinence-only funding is received and
how STD HIV AIDS all of that is defined
and the federal grant money they get is
in the billions literally it was twenty
nine billion dollars this year so again
why isn't the CDC being cited as the
definitive source of STDs I really don't
understand wrong that's not.you can see
where I was clicking at least in that
session so on the surface I found two
mentions of condoms in their
teeny-weenie STD HIV AIDS prevention
area sending that com'd condoms may
offer partial protection from HIV but
the emphasis is on the ABCs the ABCs of
prevention a standing for abstinence be
standing for be faithful at the last
hour of 2007 Bush gave and I had twenty
nine point two billion and at the same
time keep in mind that Congress in 2003
passed legislation requiring that at
least a third of my adds STD HIV AIDS
prevention funding must go to abstinence
only programs that's a lot of money
while Bush gave Nyad almost 30 big bills
he also removed 400 million from the
CDC's overall Oh 8 oh nine budget but
gave the CDC 27 million in HIV
prevention funding directed exclusively
toward abstinence only marriage programs
which is actually a really brilliant
maneuver on his part because basically
he says though I'm giving all of this
money to HIV and AIDS prevention but
it's basically just giving his buddies
money and making sure that he's pushing
his faith-based agenda kind of
interesting stuff
now I got twenty nine billion twenty
nine point two billion it's in there
it's in there uh yeah but it was on
their site in their dogs and I'm
actually gonna publish this with links
to all their PDFs their charts may or
may not be correct okay well then let's
just say it's twenty nine million then
twenty nine billion I read it off their
PDF maybe they're not keeping the record
straight their staff certainly has an
increase since their funding has gone up
that's for sure I don't know
29 billions 1% of the federal budget
okay well I'm gonna continue again I'm
gonna publish this with all the links to
the PDFs because all these sources are
cited with links that go directly to the
sites and if you want to write them and
let them know that their numbers are
incorrect on their sites please do and
I'll read you some of the letters that
I've gotten about citing online content
from people so anyway so bear with me
what I wanted to do is play a little
game of follow the money so that I could
at least try and figure out where this
money is being funneled how it's being
funneled and dig some governmental
strong-arm tactics and how they're
teaching getting getting the money from
the top down into the schools so there
are three primary spokes of abstinence
only education money right now number
one money spoke number one Title V which
is probably one of the better known ones
section 510 of the Social Security Act
welfare reform and it's Title V naught V
for Vendetta not V for violet but V is
in vaginal anal and oral disasters for
all and by the way in case you didn't
know there may be some explicit sex talk
throughout this entire presentation I'm
sorry you won't be seeing any
pornography but you may see a naked bit
here and there so keep that in mind
so the 1996 welfare reform law set aside
50 million a year beginning in fiscal
year 1998 for abstinence only education
grants to the states the funding was
added to an existing set-aside account
within the maternal and child health
Block Grant known as special projects of
regional and national significance
brands as with all MCH Block Grant
states had to provide three matching
dollars for every four federal dollars
they received this boosted total
potential funding for abstinence only to
eighty seven point five million annually
of course from the beginning tell
California took one look at this BS and
was like I don't think so we were the
first state to say no just say no we're
fine
circa 2007 grant announcement state that
each element of a through h muster
should be meaningfully represented in
all grantees federally funded abstinence
education curricula grants require
States to provide assurance that funded
programs in curricula do not promote
contraception and/or condom use in
addition in an effort to ensure that
funds would not be spent on
pre-adolescents the targeted population
was redefined as ándale essence and/or
adults this is weird
within the twelve through twenty nine
year old age range the newest age
definition also included other adults
such as parents or professionals that
desire training and how to support
decisions to delay sexual activity until
marriage focal populations under this
new definition included students at
local universities colleges or technical
schools single adults involved in local
community or community-based
organizations and single parents in
their 20s money spoke number two
community-based education under Title X
one of the Social Security Act in 2000
Congress created the special projects of
regional and after bill Aloha
brands also known later as CE CE BAE at
the behest of representative Ernest J
istick of he's a Republican from
Oklahoma are ok as in teens are not
having sex okay and other conservatives
in the House of Representatives under CB
AE grants have gone to public and
private community-based organizations
many of which are faith-based enter
crisis pregnancy centers organizations
who are established to convince pregnant
girls to carry their pregnancy to term
under its provisions grantees must
target adolescents adolescents ages 12
through 18 grantees cannot provide young
people with positive information about
contraception or safer sex practices
even in other settings and with non CBA
funds under the STD HIV terms of Nyad
again not the CDC this these terms are
essentially non-existent which is why
it's just driving me nuts as a sex
educator it's all under those terms and
so to avoid any confusion that this
particular grant warns that quote sex
education programs that premiere the use
of contraceptives are not eligible for
funding conservatives enthusiastically
embrace CBA as the preferred funding
vehicle
evidenced by its growth from 20 million
in fiscal year 2001 the program's first
year of funding 213 million in fiscal
year 2007 a 465 percent funding increase
is everybody feeling sexually frustrated
enough at this point because I'm feeling
pretty sexually frustrated about all
this funding spoke 3 the adolescent
family life under Title X X that's two
exes not three exes I know where your
mind is going already of the Public
Health Service Act created during the
first year of the Reagan administration
the adolescent Family Life Act a flaw
was signed into law without hearings or
floor votes in the United States
Congress and was codified under Title X
X again not three X's that everyone
keeps their clothes on of the Public
Health Service Act administered by the
office of population affairs Allah has
provided grants to nonprofit
organizations religious institutions and
states I'm sure you're tired of looking
at that you know according to Judith
Levine's really great book harmful to
minors in the first years of a flow
money went directly to fundamentalist
Christian organizations in between 87
and 91 teen aid then the biggest
publisher of abstinence only programs
received yearly grants amounting to
seven hundred and eighty four thousand
six hundred and eighty three dollars sex
respect or respect Inc got over 1.6
million in federal and state grants in
the 1980s allah funds currently support
fifty seven abstinence education and 32
care programs these three major funding
streams constitute the heart of federal
funding for abstinence only programs
it's not a totally current graph but you
kind of get the idea however Congress
has allocated additional funding through
a variety of channels for example in
both fiscal year oh four and fiscal euro
five senator Arlen Specter separately
earmarked over three million in federal
funding for abstinence only until
marriage programs in his state
conservative ideologically based
organizations such as the abstinence
Clearing House and the Medical Institute
for sexual health have also received
funds specially earmarked by Congress
and I just want to mention something
really quick I said it kind of fast and
you're probably tuning out right now I
wake you up in just a minute
the medical Institute for sexual health
it sounds so non it just sounds so
innocuous and it reminds me so much of
like porn company names you know like
when I worked for Good Vibrations like
the business name there was open
enterprises incorporated right you know
and it's just sort of like I just see
these commonalities in these these
business names that seem like almost
fictitious names but actually have to do
somehow was something that they're maybe
not really trying to tell you on the
surface I think that's really
interesting I think I need to make a
little you need to make a game out of
that on my website or something so this
relationship is all like a big
non-consenting friends-with-benefits
right except for when you peel back the
saran wrap that your brothers cousins
friend told you totally worked oh my god
really great as a condom you kind of see
exactly who's benefiting from all the
apps of abstinence education money and
all the abstinence education and no it's
not the kids and especially not the 14
and climbing states that have refused
this blackmail style federal funding to
push suspiciously privatized agendas in
public schools so basically at base
price states are being offered about 700
thousand each for their public school
systems if they teach abstinence only at
the 11th hour of 2007 abstinence
education quietly got a huge pile of
Bush approved money according to the LA
Weekly a third of all federal HIV
education money some 270 million more in
Bush's latest budget now goes to
abstinence only initiatives no Jewish or
Muslim groups have historically or
currently receive any funds perhaps
that's not in law but it seems to be in
practice and that is my opinion not
cited from a website so where do all
these big money numbers end up where
does the money trickle down across your
legs and hold on tight again oh and if
you're if you're having problems I can
help you actually brought some things to
show you that I think are going to be
really instructive so this is a female
version
and here you get in this first because
you were so helpful and then if anyone
wants to check out here's the male
version you can pass us around these are
their thank you this is courtesy of
madam s and these are the keys so Google
don't lose these cos you'll need these
when you get married it's really
important and this one requires actually
an allen key to get open which is in
here so don't lose the allen key and if
anyone wants I can show them how to open
it later but I'm sure sure we can this
can be this can be negotiated so much of
the money goes to anti-abortion groups
masquerading as women's health of crisis
pregnancy centers this is a good one it
goes to private organizations and
nonprofits who often seek more matching
funds from private supporters across the
United States
side note while I was looking at all of
these amazingly badly designed wonderful
websites for these organizations that
are going to schools and handing out
pledge cards and doing rallies and group
drives and stuff like that I found their
their pages where they were you know
seeking potential sources of funding and
so seeking you know thinking private
finding outside of government funding
you know it's got the usual lists of
like you know John and Jane Doe you know
and you know this you know like private
people making their private donations
but then there are also lists of
companies that are cited as potential
sources of of people who have
historically in the past in the present
or have expressed an interest in in
contributing money to these abstinence
groups he's like lower level abstinence
groups that are going to schools and the
biggest company I saw in one of the
lists was actually 8 off the course I
thought that was kind of interesting so
they think matching funds from private
supporters organizations receiving such
funds engage in religious propaganda and
I'm just gonna go ahead and say it you
have a question
it sounds like a interesting grammatical
what is is it it's good is it such I
don't know
Title V for vagina alright
organizations receiving such funds
engage in religious propaganda I just
said that a federal judge just found
that Louisiana's federally funded
governor's program on abstinence
illegally handed out Bibles staged
anti-abortion prayer rallies outside
women's clinics and had students perform
Bible based skits tada and this is Sodom
seriously but wait it gets better
in mid-2000 sentence mid-2007 some of
you might remember this scandal
Randall Tobias President Bush's
abstinence promoting condom discouraging
aids czar I want to be a czar of
something and Deputy Secretary of State
resigned after admitting he was a
customer of the famed DC madam when the
escort service was about to surrender
its records so well outlets like the
Washington Post report that the
government spends millions on abstinence
programs we have to wonder is that
anything that Tobias made as the former
head of Eli Lilly pharmaceuticals I
think there's a lot of connections here
anyway Tobias is an outcall John who
spent the last several years enacting
global and domestic policies about
abstinence an anti condom propaganda to
people whose lives depend on accurate
information do you think he used condoms
or did he shop at bareback and beyond
I'm thinking he did especially
considering his statements in 2004
during an hiv/aids report hiv/aids
report Tobias said the promoting
abstinence of monogamy are far more
effective than distributing condoms
preventing the spread of HIV statistics
showed that condoms really have not been
very effective Tobias said adding it's
been the principal prevention device for
the last twenty years and I think one
needs only to look at what's happening
with the infection rates in the world to
recognize that has not been working
Washington DC's main abstinence-only
program was recently kicked out of two
schools according to WTOP news
let's make it more interesting title the
suckling pig Ultra Teen Choice character
not condoms no I don't have anything
personal against them actually I do
was booted for any number of frightening
reasons but most likely because they
won't be making any field trips to the
castra anytime soon it seems that the
co-founder Richard Durbin is not a
friend of Dorothy but an active follower
of the unification Church that's the
Moonies for all of you who might not be
following along at home this happens to
be an abstinence only by the way is one
of the things that happens to unite a
whole lot of faiths under one big banner
except of course the Jewish and Muslim
faiths which haven't been included in
any of this so I wrote a column about
this a little while back and I mentioned
how Jamie Lynn Spears who you may know
is Britney Spears as little sister she's
16 and I'm sure she was like really
surprised when she was pregnant because
I mean I'm sure she followed all the
facts and everything that she learned in
her abstinence education and like her
mom told her and her sister told her and
that she believed it would all just
totally be fine and that it would all
work and stuff I mean she's a good girl
first fears or more sadly for a typical
American young woman when hormones rage
and the only answer you hear is just say
no you only have your friends to turn to
so after that Colin went up not I but
one of the head editors at the San
Francisco Chronicle got an email from
Richard Urban which was then forwarded
to editor to editor until it finally
made it to me and it says hi your column
by violet blue is not accurate regarding
the reference to ultra teen choice altra
is all in caps so he's screaming ultra
teen choice does not receive any
government funds it is wholly privately
funded furthermore the article in quotes
or shall we say hack job does not seem
to recognize the fact that abstinence
from sexual activity is the only 100%
sure way to avoid sexually transmitted
diseases emotional issues pregnancy and
a host of other issues the majority of
teens nationwide and almost half of
teens in Washington DC have never had
sexual intercourse according to the
youth risk behavior surveillance system
and what is the youth risk behavior
surveillance system I'm like do they tag
them they're like dude then they like
put a little tag on them
GPS moisture sensors heat sensors he
continues these youth wants support
encouragement and accurate information
and that is what they get with the ultra
Teen Choice Program as the major part of
our program is clubs for youth who wish
to stay sexually abstinent furthermore
miss blue seems to miss the fact that
perhaps Jamie Lynn Spears needed
encouragement and peer support not a
condom I henceforth disagree and I just
wanted to show you here's ultra teen
choices page where they adhere to the
federal guidelines for abstinence
funding Title V a through H so really
ultra is just a Kevin Federline style
backup dancer in this whole wing net
driven money funneling musical version
of Brokeback and Beyonce according to
the Boston Globe in late 2005 then
governor Mitt Romney you may remember
him announced that he would channel the
money directly into expanding abstinence
education programs in schools during the
remainder of his administration
Massachusetts funneled more than eight
hundred thousand dollars to healthy
futures a group that had been running
abstinence education programs in more
than three dozen middle schools eight
hundred thousand dollars is a lot of
money The Globe reports healthy futures
is a subsidiary subsidiary of a
Christian anti-abortion group called a
woman's concern but healthy futures
director Rebecca Ray said the curriculum
is not religious and does not tell
students want to think about abortion
I'm sure I'm sure they don't a women's
concern is ayer keroh wax clinic you may
or may not remember Kerouac is the anti
contraception wacko who headed the
Health and Human Services office of
population affairs which I mean that
could be a front for a porn company at
this point right
but he was forced to resign when his
practice of being was being investigated
for Medicaid fraud on its website
healthy futures boasts I don't know if
you can see that healthy futures boasts
about a 1.5 million grant in 2004 from
the US Department of Health and Human
Services healthy futures doesn't divulge
much about what it's actually telling
the kids and I've hotlinked some of
these too and I'm gonna make this
document public by the way four and this
document public with sources afterward -
if you guys want to go check this out
for yourselves they don't divulge much
about what it's actually telling the
kids but I did learn about on its
reports research reports and studies
page which is why I just brought up the
linking mostly that it has a lot of
broken links so it might be a sexually
frustrated on their side as I was the
studies that support abstinence and
discouraged economies but what really
caught my eye was one of the unbroken
links to a PDF file which states
according to a recent report sexually
active teens are more likely to be
depressed and attempt suicide on page
one it's proudly attributed to
right-wing conservative think-tank the
Heritage Foundation on page three it
states that the data is based on a
heritage study from 1995 to 1996 that's
pretty recent data Jamie Lynn Spears was
four years old so basically public funds
go to religious institutions for anti
sexuality programs public schools host
chastity events just keep that in mind
chastity pledges and rallies on school
premises during school hours which is
probably happening right now
chastity pledges and rallies on
textbooks are censored in Texas the
State Board of Education approved the
purchase of new health textbooks that
exclusively promote abstinence the
school board in Franklin County North
Carolina ordered three chapters
literally sliced out of a ninth grade
health textbook because the material did
not adhere to state law mandating
abstinence only programs the chapters
covered aids and sexually transmitted
infections marriage and parenting and
contraception in Lynchburg Virginia
school board members refused to approve
a high school science tech book textbook
unless an illustration of a vagina was
covered or cut out
crucial health programs were cancelled
sexuality education teachers are
disciplined for doing their jobs in
Belton Missouri a seventh grade health
teacher was suspended when a parent
complained that she had discussed
inappropriate sexual matters in class
the teacher had answered a student's
query about oral sex so where does
abstinence come from the stork of course
happy Valentine's Day so what's the net
effect here that we're talking about
what does it really mean to kids well
let me go back to federal level for a
minute this is uh this is part of the
handwritten questions from Ellen
Friedreich's is for years as a teenage
IV prevention coordinator in the South
Bronx via her website sex advice calm
she was doing some riding when she was
working as a teenage IV prevention
coordinator and she was working with
kids that were like thirteen-year-old
girls that were six months prêt six
months pregnant that had gotten pregnant
from the guy who sleeps in their doorway
and trying to teach them about HIV and
AIDS and how to put condoms on and
things like that and she would encourage
them to write down their questions and
give them to her and she ended up
writing at an amazing essay about it
that can be read on her website and I
also published it in my book best sex
writing 2005 but go read it on for free
on her site so in 2004 representative
Henry Waxman from California of course
released a report he actually had a
whole bunch of people research this
report and he released the report in
2004 about the state of abstinence only
programs the report found what we in the
field sex educators already know
abstinence education is a failure the
report finds that over 80% of the
abstinence only curricula used by over
two-thirds of spray ons grantees contain
false misleading or distorted
information specifically the report
finds abstinence only curricula contain
false information about the
effectiveness of contraceptives false
information about the risks of abortion
abstinence only curricula Blur religions
and religion and science and the
curricula treats stereotypes about girls
and boys a scientific fact it's all
broken down in the report and again I'll
link to the PDF but I got a couple of
juicy highlights for you
many abstinence-only curricula begin
with a detailed discussion of
differences between boys and girls some
of the differences are presented simply
as biological several of the curricula
presents stereotypes as scientific fact
ones that directly undermine girls
achievement they're mad they're actually
that's actually from kink.com where's
the chastity belt it needs to get this
way back this way
several quickly teach that girls care
less about achievement in their futures
than do boys one curriculum instructs
quote women gauged their happiness and
judge their successes by their
relationships
men's happiness and success hinge on
their accomplishments another curriculum
states in a chart of the top five women
and men's basic needs the curriculum
lists sexual fulfillment and physical
attractiveness as two of the top five
needs in the men's section affection
conversation honesty and openness and
family commitment are listed as women's
needs the same curriculum tells
participants while a man needs little or
no preparation for sex a woman often
needs hours of emotional and mental
preparation and you know I think I know
what they're talking about because when
I'm on porno tube and I'm like it's
buffering buffering
buffering three-minute clip come on it's
buffering it's just need a minute and a
half how many hours of my life have I
spent buffering according to the ACLU in
an attempt to demonstrate the
differences between men and women one
particular program weight training
that's w AIT instruct teachers to bring
to class frozen waffles and a bowl of
spaghetti noodles without sauce using
these as visual aids explain how
researchers found that men's brains are
more like the waffle and that their
design enables them to more easily
compartmentalize information women's
minds on the other hand are interrelated
due to increase brain connectors I like
the part without sauce
similarly the teachers manual for why no
abstinence and that's K and no W with n
Oh in screaming at you in caps suggest
that girls are responsible for boys
inability to control their sexual urges
this is what they're teaching kids in
school quote ones little form of
pressure can be the way in which a girl
acts toward her boyfriend
if the girlfriend is talked constantly
touching him and pressing against him or
wearing clothing which is tight or
revealing of her body this will cause
the guy to think more about her body
than her person and he may be incited
toward more sexual thoughts
I wish I had an answer for you oh he was
asking why why we have a war basically
the last bit of the report a numerous
instances the abstinence-only curricula
teach erroneous scientific information
one curriculum the weight training
incorrectly lists exposure to sweat and
tears as risk factors for HIV
transmission
according to the CDC HIV is only
transmits transmissible through blood
semen and vaginal secretions another
curriculum the wino states that 24
chromosomes from the mother and 24
chromosomes from the father joined to
create this new individual oops the
correct number is 23 so here we are
according to Planned Parenthood of
America the u.s. currently has the
highest rate of teen pregnancy in the
developed world an American adolescents
are contracting HIV faster than almost
any other demographic group Texas with
all those great abstinence only
textbooks has the highest rate of teen
births in the nation Angelina County's
rate is higher than the state average
according to a somewhat recent community
needs assessment because 2004 said last
year from which local figures are
publicly available but in 2004 88
Angelina County girls between the ages
of 13 and 17 had babies
Angelina County's population according
to the US Census Bureau is eighty two
thousand five hundred and twenty-four
that's basically one in every 50 local
girls who were or should have been
either in middle or high school in
contrast over the last decade the teen
pregnancy rate in California has dropped
more than 40 percent coincidence I think
not
in April 2007 Massachusetts declined the
yearly allotment of the US government's
seven thousand seven hundred thousand
per state grant for absence education in
public schools this was just after a
20-page Columbia University study
exposed the abstinence curriculum
statements about condom use are
medically inaccurate the American Civil
Liberties Union tired of
Department of Health and Human Services
ignoring their repeated warnings about
incorrect data sent the department a
letter threatening legal action the ACLU
is currently trying to get the DHHS to
stop disseminating incorrect information
because doing so violates federal law so
as I said earlier I've been working at
San Francisco at San Francisco sex
information for about five or six years
I think I lost count at four and we have
noticed an alarming rise over the past
about seven years I've been talking to
other educators about this in in the
type and nature of calls that we've been
getting and emails that we've been
getting from kids and basically it's
it's just it's kind of freaking us out
because we're getting more and more all
the time and the types of questions that
they're asking are are more and more
alarming all the time and it's actually
gotten to the point now where we're like
instead of doing the drinking and
hanging out that we should be doing
we're doing the drinking and hanging out
that we should be doing and talking
about what we should do about our
Facebook profile so I have a couple of
sample questions that we've gotten and
also from the boards if a guy is a
virgin can you get me pregnant what is
meant by penetration if a guy ejaculate
sneer my privates but not inside me can
I get pregnant can I get pregnant from
give it get oral sex is it true that you
can't get an STD if you have sex during
your period my friend told me that there
are some herbs you can take in the
morning after you've had sex that can
keep you from getting pregnant she
doesn't know what they are do you know
if there are any herbs that can do this
my boyfriend told me that a body that is
new to sex will reject sperm is this
true if you have sex for the first time
with a person infected infected with HIV
you can't get infected with HIV right it
takes more than one time to be in fact
to get infected doesn't it a friend told
me he has an STD we are both on the
wrestling team can I catch it from him
so another way the kids learn about sex
information besides abstinence and the
Internet is of course their friends and
the myths that get passed down through
the generations and
generations myths that have gotten to
the point that this is a good one I like
how it's crumpled and then they decided
to turn it any any way which are the
good condoms because I'm scared that's
what that one says it's got to the point
that or Snopes has an ear on its urban
legend reference pages they'll let a lot
of a very common still perpetuated urban
myths like if he pulls out you can't
catch anything also called pull out and
pray if you take it in the back door
you're still a virgin
a surprising amount of teens also
consider that abstinence my friend's
sister told me that well sex isn't real
sex if you shower or douche after you do
it you have nothing to worry about if
you do it standing up or if you jump up
and down afterward you won't get a baby
if some of these kids think this is true
you can't get pregnant from having sex
under water we get we get sex in hot tub
questions and this one is this one's
always freaked me out but it's been so
prevalent that it's ended up in a
variety of different places in the media
and in documentaries if you rinse your
vagina with coca-cola after you have sex
you're you're in the clear
so what do we do solutions and obstacles
right every reputable sexuality
organization in the US as well as
prominent health organizations including
the American Medical Association have
denounced abstinence only sexuality
programs Bush got at least 208 million
spent on abstinence only programs 208
million could buy twelve thousand six
hundred and twenty nine twenty two
copies of changing bodies changing lives
or copies of Our Bodies Ourselves
that is if we buy it on Amazon and we'll
have seven dollars and sixty six cents
left over to buy lunch with think about
it so everyone's either learning about
sex from pure chat and text messages
abstinence education reproductive health
videos or online mostly online pretty
much all teens that I've been talking to
and I have been talking to quite a few
in the past couple of weeks they're like
yeah I mean even the ones went to school
in California they're like yeah we got
the the one day of watching the
illustrated videos but we just learned
everything online you know it's like
yeah sex educators are wondering out
loud what to do about a problem that's
only a growing worse sex Tech was a
recent conference in San Francisco as a
reaction to abstinence education
describing itself as the inaugural STD
HIV prevention conference focusing on
youth and technology it is certainly a
ray of hope but you'll see that it
doesn't come without its caveats topics
topics at sex Tech included the
University of South Florida College of
Public Health their to their talk was
using technology to advance our
understanding of online sexual health
information seeking behaviors among
young people the Morehouse School of
Medicine presented how to build a
MySpace and Facebook page create a
podcast send items and text messages
Meghan limb of the brunette Institute
presented a randomized control trial of
the impact of email and text messages on
sexual health of young people others
talked about social media pop culture
and the power of hearsay sex education
many many difficulties were expressed
from participants about reaching teens
they're low on funds they're not tech
savvy but they're trying to figure out
how to reach youth with accurate
information and trying to learn and use
existing and emerging technologies which
of course as we know kids are like the
big early adopters anyway right
the sad truth was underscored simply in
the title of one presentation crossing
generational lines embracing technology
to reach youth and the issues I think
personally and this is all my opinion
but I think the issues were summed up
best in in one of the keynotes
where dr. Gilbert hurt PhD director of
the national sexuality Resource Center
says the fact is that youth sexuality
researchers educators educators and
technology experts just don't talk to
one another
fortunately that's why you all invited
me back here to Google so thank you very
much and then has everyone seen that the
abstinence video from the Midwest teen
sex show mid the Midwest teen sex show
is a video podcast that is it's not
necessarily informational but it's meant
to just sort of like get like parents
and kids talking about sex or at least
you know put a little bit of a resource
or get people started in the right
direction and let me see
can we is the audio going to come
through if I click on a video here
technical man behind the curtain okay
click the Wizard of Oz over here exactly
I can't have sex ed if you go visit that
it's when you go to the front page of my
site and you click if you're under 18 go
here it's a list of resources I can show
you there really quick
see and this is the kind of stuff that
I'm hoping people are going to start to
do but teen wire San Francisco sex
information go ask alice teen growth
some of these are sites put together by
teens for teens some are LGBT focused be
nice if more people we're we're doing
more stuff like that on their sites
and I think this kind of really says it
all
welcome to the second episode of the
Midwest teen sex show I'm Nicole and
today's topic is that's that's really
the topic so let's start with the pros
first of all no sexually transmitted
diseases you're not having sex you're
not getting a sexually transmitted
disease no matter what you might have
read about toilet seats and also oddly
enough makes you more desirable if you
decide you're not going to have sex more
people want to have sex with you finally
a major Pro of remaining abstinence is
there's no chance that you're going to
have children if you have no children
you don't have to sit through boring Cub
Scout meetings I've a son Joey cuts git
now let's talk about the cons of
abstinence
first of all it's really boring like all
the cool kids are having sex they're
gonna laugh at you if you're not it's
also highly unrealistic that you're
going to be able to save yourself for
marriage if you've decided you're going
to do that thing great and if you
actually succeed I feel bad for your
future spouse another con is that sex
takes practice you can't just read a
book to know how to do it
so how also you're gonna learn porn what
are some good reasons to not have sex
well there are some - exactly
one is that you're not ready you may
still have fears and questions about sex
and you gotta get that worked out before
you start doing it also somebody might
be pressuring you into having sex and
you know you can't just give in to that
and decide to have sex with somebody
because you think it'll keep them around
trust me it won't so what's a good age
to have sex well to quote Southpark 17
I'm absent because sex is gross and
unnatural I'm abstinent because my
parents vote abstinent I am abstinent
because I only have sex with guys I'm
accident because I lost my genitals and
a farm accident if you have any
questions email me at Nicole at Midwest
