that three researchers from FX pal are
joining us today um Dave Hilbert law
honda new and Daniel bill says to talk
about on some efforts towards organizing
and classifying multimedia information
which falls in line to Google's vision
um so anyway they will be around after
the talk if you'd like to join us for
lunch and Daniel is the first speaker
thanks for the introduction Monica good
morning everyone I'm Daniel bill sis and
together with LaRhonda new and David
Hilbert will talk about our work on
seamless capture and discovery for
corporate memory and before I begin let
me say a few words about FX pal so FX
palace stands for FX palo alto a
laboratory are obviously located in palo
alto we're research lab for fuji xerox
about 50 people total approximately 25
researchers do you work in a number of
different areas ranging from multimedia
to teleconferencing HCI to information
management and our job is basically to
be creative and come up with
intellectual property for for fuji xerox
then turn our ideas into prototypes and
evaluate them and deploy them and today
we're here to talk about our work on
information management or more
specifically corporate memory and
seamless information capture and
discovery and those are things and ideas
that people have really been thinking
about for a long long time as you all
know so let's go back in time and over
60 years ago in 1945 Avenue ver Bush
published a landmark article entitled as
we may think and the Atlantic Monthly
and sir it a really really interesting
piece of work he sort of envisioned this
mechanical device based on microfilm
that makes it really easy for for people
to store all the information that they
interact with basically books they read
or personal correspondence and then it's
device help people find information as
well but not only by searching but also
by associating and from
with other pieces of information and and
and linking and this was back then
really groundbreaking work it sort of
anticipated or inspired a lot of
technologies that we now take for
granted the internet hypertext Wikipedia
Microsoft's work on my life bits that
you might be familiar with is obviously
closely related to this work and and you
could argue of course that Google is
sort of an instantiation of the memory
extender or mimics idea as well so but
what we are interested in here is to
take these ideas into the corporate
space and try to come up with this
corporate mimic so I shared a device or
piece of software that everyone in
organization can use to to manage
corporate knowledge and so what do we
mean by corporate memory well to put it
in in George Schultz's words the former
US Secretary of State he just said well
corporate memory allows the company to
know what it knows and we always like
this really simple definition but of
course for for large organizations it's
a really big deal if you don't have
technology like that companies don't
operate as efficiently as they could
otherwise I'm so the idea here is we
really want people to reuse information
we want them to reuse solutions instead
of reinventing them we want people to
coordinate instead of replicate and so
it's it's a really really important
issue but it's a very difficult problem
to get right and what we did at FX
palace we try to focus on a number of
challenges that make this problem so
difficult well for one we focused on
information capture the problem here is
that people simply won't add information
to a corporate memory if there's no
immediate benefit I mean people don't do
extra work just for the purpose of
sharing information so what we need is
technology that sort of makes the
capture process a part of you know your
your everyday work routine so things
that you do anyway without adding adding
any extra overhead
we're also looking at information
discovery I mean of course keyword
search goes a long way but that's not
enough if people don't know about
content that's potentially available to
them they won't even search for the
right things and also you can't spend
all your time during the day searching
content especially not if if all of that
content is in all kinds of different
repositories throughout the organization
and we're also looking at the actual
content that we're storing on our
corporate memory so we think corporate
memory should be much more than just
documents alone so organizations have
people have all different areas of
expertise these people attend meetings
they give presentations and ideally we'd
like to be able to capture all of that
and make it part of our corporate memory
so now get getting back to the Memex
vision you could argue well corporate
intranets are sort of very simple
instantiation of the mimics idea but we
really want to move beyond just a
corporate intranet we don't want to work
with you know an intranet that is
basically just a dumping ground for a
lot of information where you collect a
lot of stuff that is basically
inaccessible to people because it's hard
to find so what we're all about is
helping organizations actually take
advantage of all the a the content that
it's that's available to them making use
of their intellectual capital and the
way we're doing that is without really
adding any extra work whatsoever by
integrating both capture and discovery
into everyday work practices so let's
try to make things much more concrete so
at FX pal we have a number of different
content repositories just like any other
organization we have information on our
intranet so basically our products such
as reports publications and inventions
we have a visitor guestbook where our
visitors can stop by sign in record a
little video tell people who there are
who they're visiting and so forth scan
their business cards we have a number of
community displays called a plasma
poster and the idea here is that people
can simply post web pages email web
pages to this poster so that other
employees can just walk by glance at it
and sort of see what people are
currently thinking about then we have a
more recent system and that's actually a
very interesting system called ue site
for completely automated meeting capture
and the idea here is that we use motion
tracking and audio tracking and
conference rooms to automatically record
video of of meetings and once we have
these videos we store them in our
multimedia database m-base but the point
of all of this is that yes we have a lot
of useful content but really as a
corporate memory it's not all that
useful in part because for example
there's there there was up until
recently no content-based way to access
these meetings so yes we had a lot of
video but what does that help you if you
just keep storing these video files and
people didn't have to go to know maybe
some some video browsing interface and
and and and try to to find information
that way which is something that usually
didn't happen overall people had to just
manually locate relevant information
throughout all of these different
repositories so the end result is that
people tended to basically ignore
content that was available so today we
want to talk about two new prototypes
that we have and one is for in seamless
information capture it's a system called
projector box that automatically
captures presentation slides and audio
and on the other end of the spectrum we
have a system for information discovery
called pal bhar that proactively
recommends content to users based on
what are currently working on so that's
what we'll talk today about today and in
the end i'll show you how all of these
different pieces come together as a
unified multimedia corporate memory so
from here we'll move on to seamless
information capture and david hilbert
will tell you more about our projector
box system
hey heider i'm david hilbert very
pleased to be here thanks for having us
so as Daniel mentioned projector box is
one of the components in our corporate
memory but it's also an independent
component that can be deployed on its
own basically to capture an index
presentations given an organization and
so i'll be talking about projector box
as an independent component and then
alors on to new who is the creator of
projector box will show you a demo and
then Daniel's going to show you how this
works as a piece of the overall
corporate memory as the index and
component for retrieving videos so you
know what projector box well
presentations are everywhere we're doing
one right now and we actually believe
that they're quite informative they're
they're actually we you know they
encapsulate the distillation of research
and analysis and a lot of knowledge work
but one of the problems is that a lot of
what goes on in a presentation
particularly what the speaker is saying
the discussion just never makes it into
the corporate intranet at all right and
so in some sense you know this
information is passing through
projectors all over an organization
every day and simply being lost and what
we want to do is be able to preserve
that information make it very easy to
retrieve and so one question that arises
immediately as wire archives so we're
given that there is just a plethora of
tools out there for capturing
presentations and to us the hypothesis
is that there's always some additional
cost or complexity or even the user
experience could be the problem if
someone just needs to start and stop the
recordings that may be enough to keep
presentations from being captured on a
regular basis I mean obviously in a
situation like this you've got people
manning video cameras and other things
but what we're looking at is a way to do
this really easily the user experience
should be don't even have to think about
it so we're focusing on creating useful
archives without any added burden on
anyone okay so what's projector box
basically smart appliance that
intercepts the video signal the vga
cable coming out of any presentation
device goes through the projector box on
its way to the projector a key feature
is that we apply image OCR to extract
the text from slide images and create an
index and then we just capture audio
using a microphone then we automatically
build a web archive for easily
retrieving content the slides the text
in the audio and we have some simple you
is for retrieving content skimming
content and then we have a web service
API that allows us to build other
services on top
that okay so this is an example of one
of our prototypes it's basically just a
small pc appliance it's got a video
capture card to splitter so all you need
to do in order to capture presentations
in a meeting room is plug in the power
plug in a microphone the vga cable from
the laptop goes in one end comes out the
other end it goes to the projector and
the key feature of course is that once
you've done that you don't have to do
anything else so no one has to start or
stop recordings projective axes
analyzing the video as it comes through
when it detects what looks like
presentation contact content it captures
it and it ignores all of the other
content and then again we have some sort
of novel interfaces for searching and
skimming the content which lawns going
to show you and the key other key
feature is that we want to do this with
no changed presentation practice so when
a visitor comes to our organization you
don't want to have to ask them to copy
their file somewhere or to install some
software on their laptop or do anything
else they just connect their RGB cable
and we capture so without further ado
hey good morning so let me show you a
demo of the website that people go to to
to retrieve presentations they have
basically two ways of finding
presentations they have the church box
and they have a browsing interface by by
days so if you know that the
presentation was captured on on the 21st
you can dive into that day directly and
you end up into the day view or you can
easily browse the slice that had been
automatically captured by p box and now
look at Renaissance office which is
right next door there's actually
connecting to and quickly skim the
content to get an overview of what so
what was captured I'm going to mute the
audio you can also quickly export things
if you want to watch the content offline
or if you want to share the content
using an using the central office which
is right next door there's actually
connecting
and to my just a few but well what
really actually does in this room so
this is very convenient interface for
getting a sense of what was capturing a
meeting in browsing very fast the second
way obviously is to use the search
engine that we have peter who recently
joined the organization had a meeting
and was curious about the printing
industry and if we had partners in his
domain so he went to pee box and looked
for this topic on p box and was quickly
able to find a relevant presentation
that was given a few months before he
came that talked exactly about this so
he went to the player mode and quickly
skim the presentation that was given
before he came realized that was very
relevant to what he was looking for and
went to the first slide and boom he got
the name of the person he should contact
so was very efficient way for him to to
get in touch with this person on the top
you can see also a histogram that shows
you that popularity of the topic you are
looking for across time which is a very
interesting way to realize how popular
and how far back in time this topic is
important in your organization another
service that we have a real time viewer
so if you are in a in a talk with your
laptop you can quickly go to this web
page to see the sites that have been
captured in real time go back to read
something that you may have missed do
some web search by selecting the worse
you can also if you're not very familiar
with English you can select in your
preferred language a translation
waterwalk translation to give you a
sense of what what's going on and help
you understand what people are saying so
before I come back to the presentation
I'd like to show you what kind of things
that people does in the background if
you select all images you see all images
that have been effectively captured and
great out are the ones that PBOC's
believes are not sides so you see it
does a pretty good job at classifying
images automatically and detecting sides
so the to detect slides we use a very
simple method which is leveraging the
OCR result we we have because we apply
OCR on each image and we just currently
use the average front height to say if
an image is a slider another slide to
present to classify the presentation
find the boundaries between presentation
we're using just time currently and what
we're looking into more elaborate ways
of doing that in terms of storage costs
it's very very minimal not just for
storage which is cheap you could argue
but also for bandwidth requirements so
when people go to the website they can
quickly get a sense of the content
without having a high and GSR connection
or anything like that
okay so in addition to developing this
technology we're really interested in
deploying it in the real world and
understanding what users are going to do
with it and try to find opportunities
for making this better suit the needs of
particularly corporate users but we're
also interested in educational use so
we've done a few deployments in both
corporate settings and educational
settings and I just wanted to tell you
just highlight you know a summary of
some of the results from our
laboratories use versus use at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey so in
summary it was written you know very
simple kind of model and it worked
pretty well across these two different
domains in both cases it was primarily
used for missing you know people miss
presentations so students really like
the fact that they could look at the
archive before asking the professor or
other students and then people in both
settings also reported paying more
attention during talks and taking less
notes because I felt confident they
could go back to the archive and
retrieve any details that they needed a
later time so the main difference was
that as you might guess in the
educational setting people were using
this as a study aid preparing for exams
and doing homework but in the corporate
setting seventy-five percent of our
users said that in addition to looking
at past presentations they used it as a
tool to stay aware of what was going on
in the organization sort of a corporate
awareness tool so we were very
interested in finding out what was
missing obviously we're focusing on
static slide content and audio and we're
not taking video of the room and we
wanted to know you know what what's
missing and so people in both settings
did mention that they missed not seeing
video clips embedded in presentations or
live demos so that's something that
we're working on now we focused on on
static presentation content we should
probably also capture video clips when
that makes sense the students actually
did miss whiteboard capture and that's
something that we're not going to focus
on because many people have worked on
that before and also because Fuji Xerox
is more interested in the corporate
market but interestingly most of the
students reported just not being very
interested in video they just felt they
didn't need to see the professor slides
and audio really suited their needs for
a study aid so this is an interesting
result and this may depend on who your
professor is and how interesting they
are but I don't know how much this
generalizes but that was interesting
result and then in both cases people
noted that it would be useful to be able
to retrieve content based on the audio
or what
set in the room and so that's something
we're going to work on and we know that
with our current situation we're not
doing close miking we're not going to
get great you know speech-to-text but
even if we can get just a little bit
more retrieval on things that appeared
in the speech that weren't in the slides
I think that would be very useful and so
it validated our design you know we
focused on searching and skimming which
is a little different than other people
who worked in this area and the
searching was in fact important the
corporate setting particularly where we
had years of data people really want to
be able search and find content in the
past and skimming was very important in
both settings people infrequently would
sort of playback slides sequentially
which is the model that most slide
viewers for these kinds of tools take
people really like the ability to skim
around look for you know passages that
were interesting for them or find
content those of particular interest and
then finally identified some new
directions for improving support for
corporate users so in particular
corporate users said that they wanted
support for you know finding personally
relevant information so instead of
having to search for things or to browse
for things you know how can we bring
that information to their attention and
finally privacy and access control and
security came up as well so I'm just
going to very briefly tell you about
some of these new directions and then
hand it back to Daniel so this is just
an early prototype where we were
exploring new interfaces for discovering
content so in addition to searching and
browsing we were trying to find out can
we highlight things that are either new
or interesting to employees so in the in
the top part of the interface we're
trying to identify presentations that
look like they were given by external
visitors so we're just looking at the
content of the presentation looking for
names and some content and saying these
look like they're external presentations
these might be of interest to you
because we're a small lab and we can see
each other's presentations a million
times so this was one way of getting at
you know what's what's interesting and
then we also played around with a tag
cloud interface for trying to highlight
what were the kind of novel topics this
month that maybe weren't so novel but
weren't so common in the past and so
this is early work we're going to
continue extending this this is just
another interface for exploring content
in P box so the idea is that you can
select different time frames like a year
or a month or a day and then get a sense
using this tag cloud again of what are
the hot topics during that that period
okay so in the in the
educational settings security privacy
were not an issue at all the students
and the lecturers knew they were being
recorded and wanted to be recorded but
in the corporate setting there are
issues here so one thing is that when
people walk into our conference room
they start presenting it's very easy for
us to forget to mention to them that
they're being recorded because this is
all happening so autonomously so we've
developed some intellectual property in
a couple of areas one of them is
actually doing an overlay in the
projection screen that would would
basically you know indicate that the
recording was happening and there are
ways that we could actually intercept
you know or detect mouse movements in
the video stream and provide a very
simple interface for turning the
recording on or off another thing that
we thought about is actually a physical
indicator and switch that would be built
into an RGB cable so when people are
actually connecting the laptop it's a
very immediate and tangible way to
indicate they're being recorded and
allow them to opt in or opt out so those
are a couple avenues we're looking at
access controls and other issue so at
fuji xerox it's a huge corporation
they've got a lot of meeting rooms and
the meeting rooms are shared by multiple
different groups and while the group's
would like to be able to archive the
content share it's sort of locally they
don't necessarily want everyone else in
the organization to see the content and
so we're trying to find ways to support
access control without breaking the user
experience which is just odd most
simplicity so we're looking at the use
of smart cards or biometrics to identify
the person who's presenting and then use
that as a way of setting up default
access control on the content allowing
them to then release the content after
the fact more widely if they want we're
also looking at alternative form factors
so the marketing and planning people
fuji xerox were really keen on a
personal version of this so our
colleagues research colleagues in japan
have already developed a version of pbox
that just runs on a USB drive and the
ideas that captures the content on the
drive and then when you plug the drive
in to a network connected computer it
can upload it to the server this also
shares the future with the smart cards
that we can associate these devices with
a person or a team and then we can
automatically do the access control at
least initially so in summary we feel
that useful information is passing
through projectors all the time and just
simply being lost in organizations and
we were trying to come up with a very
simple way of preserving this
information
making it easily retrievable both for
users in the one case and also for
services such as the real-time slide
enhancement and the corporate memory
which Daniels going to show you so many
people contributed so
okay from here let's move on to seamless
information discovery again as I said
earlier FX pal has many different
repositories content is available all
over the place David just talked about
our projector box archive that's
generated automatically I briefly
mentioned our UV sight system earlier
that automatically records video of
presentations and now the question is
well how can we help people discover
information in all of these different
repositories so to do that we have
seamless information discovery
technology a system called pal bhar and
the idea here is that the system tries
to automatically figure out what you're
currently doing based on say the current
web page you're looking at email message
that you're reading or writing and then
it tries to proactively recommend
content to you that you should be aware
of and the concept itself is not new you
might be familiar with systems like
Watson or the remembrance agent has been
around for a long time but there are a
number of user interfaces that I want to
show you that make this in addition to
some algorithmic bells and whistles that
we have quite unique and part of the
novelty also lies in the actual
integration of all those different
pieces of our corporate memory so as I
said the idea is instead of asking users
to manually enter queries and search for
things we're trying to let the system
figure out if there's content that you
might be interested in automatically so
this is what it looks like pal bhar is a
toolbar we currently support Firefox ie
and outlooks it works for both email and
web pages now the idea is that whenever
you go to a new web page the bar
extracts the entire text from that page
sends it down terrorists server now this
server will automatically convert the
text into a query and then it has a full
text index based on all of these
different repositories that I talked
about so it sends a query to to these
repository
raised we're getting matches back we're
looking then at the exact similarity
between the text and the matches were
we're getting and if they're above a
certain threshold these recommendations
will be sent up to the bar and then it's
up to the bar to render recommendations
and make them available to users and we
have a number of different interfaces
that i want to show you this is what the
original initial version looked like so
let's assume I'm a research scientist at
FX pal and I'm interested in in web
services so i just opened up my browser
went to a web services web page and of
course i'm using pal bhar this toolbar
up there what's happening is powder will
take a look at the page and if it finds
related information it will tell the
user through these recommendation
buttons here that correspond to
different categories of content that we
have and the idea is whenever something
interesting is available the system will
change the color of a button so that the
user knows ok I can just click on this
to basically get a menu that lists
documents that are closely related to
this web page as well as people that
have done work in this area so in this
case basically the authors of these
documents here and so this sort of
worked okay but as you can maybe guess
one thing that we immediately figured
out after and a user study that we did
was that well the nice thing is that pal
bhar really doesn't get in the way at
all the users don't find it distracting
and that's that little red bar on the
left side but the flip side of it is
that users typically forget that the bar
is there so it's just a little bit too
subtle in this case to actually be
useful so then we did some more work and
came up with an alternative interface so
in this case here in addition to
changing the color of buttons we can
automatically and proactively show these
recommendation windows that look like
this so they show up I'm automatically
for particularly relevant our
recommendations and you can now see a
little bit more content you can see the
title of
document that's recommended the name of
an author you get an initial indication
as to why this document was recommended
to you you can look at the query that
the server generated automatically you
can see how the query matches the
document that's being recommended and
you can also see how it matches the web
page that you're currently looking at if
you don't interact with these windows
they just disappear automatically after
a few seconds now again as you might
guess what we found out then is that yes
I mean it's sort of nice that people
don't forget that the bar is there but
the flip side again is that now they
find it just a little bit too
distracting so sometimes it gets in the
way and users don't want to interact
with these recommendations right away
while they're working on other things so
this led us to another interface that we
have and this one we call the
recommendation digest and here the idea
is that we sort of aggregate
recommendations over time
recommendations that you might not have
seen because you might not have clicked
on these these buttons but here the idea
is let's say if during a week of of
doing my regular work I went to let's
say five different pages that all talk
about music information retrieval and
the barkeeps recommending documents to
me that I might not have seen or looked
at the idea here is we can aggregate
these recommendations over time and then
make that information available as part
of these digests that people can either
request explicitly by clicking on the
digest button and request either a daily
or a weekly digest or and this is
actually the way most people use this at
FX pal you can subscribe to digests
through email and so then the system
sends out these these emails once a week
to our employees basically saying well
based on your browsing and email reading
activities during the week here are the
top 10 documents that you should be
aware of and this is sort of an
indication as to why they were
recommended to you you can go back to
the original pages that trigger these
recommendation
and it turns out this is actually the
main way by which people at our
organization access recommended content
now at this point I'd like to show you a
brief demo of the system and and now the
main point of this demo is to show you
how the the capture and the discovery
pieces of our system come together now
just a few slides ago I showed you a
recommendation window for a text
document now the point is that since
projector box captures presentations
automatically we can of course recommend
presentations and that's what you're
seeing in this interface here where we
basically have a recommendation window
but instead of just showing text we can
show slides people can then flip through
these slides and from there jump right
back into the recorded video of a
presentation and that's what I'm going
to show you in the demo so let's start
my browser so let's look at this first
scenario here let's again I assume I'm a
research scientist at FX pound and I'm
now interested in service grids and
let's say I'm going to this web page
here that talks about service grids so
what you see is that within a few
seconds pal bhar came up with this
recommendation window I can immediately
see that my colleague Masaoka toe
recently wrote a paper on service grits
I can see the query that the server
generated and how it matches the
recommendation and the web page that I'm
looking at now if I don't interact with
this window it should just automatically
disappear within a few seconds there it
goes let's look at the may be more
interesting scenario here where pal bhar
automatically recommends a recorded
presentation so in this scenario let's
assume again I'm a research scientist at
FX pal now i'm interested in
collaborative filtering so let's assume
i go to a web page that talks about
collaborative filtering and again within
just a few seconds pal bhar comes up and
tells me oh there was a recent research
presentation on this topic now directly
in this interface here I can look at
slides I can flip through
slides and whenever I come across
something that looks interesting I can
jump right back into automatically
recorded video so i can do that by just
clicking on this video link here then
our video player comes up and the point
here is that on the left side you can
see the original meeting go by the
recorded video on the right side you see
slides go by down here you see a
timeline of the presentation those blue
bars are slide transitions and those red
squares are relevant slides so in this
case the system actually knows where the
user came from and in this case it was
collaborative filtering so you can see
that when I click on these red squares
the system immediately takes me two
slides the talk about collaborative
filtering so the point is set with just
one or two mouse clicks I can jump right
into the most relevant parts of a
presentation and the really nice thing
about it is that there's really no work
that anyone had to do to accomplish this
the video was recorded automatically it
slides were recorded automatically and
then it was recommended to the user at
sort of the right point in time and this
really addresses an issue that we had
all the time at FX pal where people come
and go they give these presentations
maybe sometimes to only small groups of
people just like we do right now we're
giving a presentation to a small group
of people and once once we go home it's
unclear how that content will be used
right and that's an issue that we have
where this system really helps us take
advantage of speakers that come by give
a presentation and we can without any
any overhead or effort we use this
information let me say a few more words
about recommendation interfaces so of
course people are sometimes already used
to certain notification you eyes that
they might already use for for email
notification and so forth so one of the
things that we implemented recently is
an extension for actually technology
that we got from you guys for the google
desktop and the sidebar so let me bring
up the google sidebar here and
the idea is that we have this little
recommendation plugin that can render
recommendations and basically add it to
your sidebar and let's just look at the
exact same scenario again let's go to
this web page and obviously I can turn
off these big recommendation windows if
I don't like them but the point now is
that these recommendations are added to
the site of the screen and the real big
advantage is that people are now not
forced anymore to interact with these
recommendations right away so at any
point in time when you have a moment you
can just glance at them see if there's
something relevant there and you can
just click on it and that brings up
basically the same interface that it has
showed you to look at individual slides
and of course the other nice thing that
allows us that we can do now with them
the the sidebar is to hook into your
alert system for for rendering
notifications similar to email or or
news alerts all right let's briefly jump
back into the presentation in terms of
future work one thing we're really
interested right now it's email
integration of course no corporate
memory is complete without email there's
a lot of corporate knowledge buried
somewhere in an email but of course
that's a tricky issue because they're
obviously a lot of privacy concerns and
and it's hard to get right because our
whole philosophy is no overhead for the
user whatsoever so we'd like to stick to
that ideal as close as closely as
possible and maybe go from from say
seamless information captured to
painless information capture where we
have just very very little user
interactivity to make it real easy for
people to to share content with the
organization that might be
non-confidential in that context were
really interested in usable access
control we're also interested in
extending our corporate memory beyond
corporate boundaries can you take mobile
devices access to your corporate memory
or even use mobile devices to capture
content and bring it back into the
organization
we're currently implementing a new
enterprise knowledge portal and as part
of that we're looking at different ways
to visualize corporate memory
information through text mining and and
visualization techniques and with that
well actually one more thing that I
wanted to mention we're clearly
interested in more evaluation of the
system and you know one piece of this
evaluation that's critical for us
obviously is how to make money with this
technology and as part of that we've
recently deployed our corporate memory
system as a sealed support tool for our
colleagues in Japan so the idea is that
they get immediate access to related
sales proposals customer information
product information and so forth so in
summary this was a brief overview of our
corporate memory work the main ideas
that we support both sides of the
spectrum information capture and
information discovery without any user
overhead whatsoever and that really
takes us in our opinion really one step
closer to a real corporate mimics and
with that I just like to thank you
here's our contact information and I'd
also be happy to take any questions
thank you yes
you've observed the problem that people
don't want you looking for me
the troubles manual
search for n so you're basically trying
to take all of the actions out of users
with wondering if in a lot of these
cases where you've got two sites that
don't want to either side
a lot of mileage that we had five
getting each one part way
so in terms of getting the people who
are creating
citizen so tacky is a very simple way to
get
is there
what if it add that facility for that
I'm not sure if everything is sort of
feel relevant suppressor
how I thought I say you know no this
isn't about that it's actually help
yes I mean there there is a little bit
of interactivity and I think there are
those two approaches are also not
mutually exclusive I think it makes a
lot of sense to automate as much as
possible but if users feel like there is
some value in providing feedback we can
take that into account so right now you
know there are very simple things that
we that we support you can you can add
recommendations to a black list so that
the system doesn't ever show you that
information again of course we could we
could provide some form of relevance
feedback that we could you know factor
into the algorithm that's entirely
feasible we we don't do that right now
and as I said earlier especially for our
work on on email I think a little bit of
interactivity there as it's critical
where we really can do completely
seamless information capture sure add
one very brief comments so the projector
box work laron is very keen on actually
adding tagging and when we're not really
sure how and if people will use that or
not but that is something that we're
going to do so and I think that would
get it at least expect people to you
know maybe for their own content tagged
it in different ways to remember it's
there in book market and other things
and then maybe we'll discover new uses
for tagging but that's one thing we've
been thinking about this revision of the
future in terms of timing so I'm gonna
see a gorilla
luxury of your club and I imagine saying
no this is relevant to the food and I
just taken a couple of keywords in
be safe these are essentially
annotations on your other things so that
people would be
Pablo things this is relevant to
and
Jeff or whoever thinks that this is
relevant to something or another and so
you could build
we're already taking notes to bring why
not one after key stage
no that's a very very nice idea and
actually the work that led to projector
box started with a collaborative
note-taking tool where you know
basically people were sharing slide
images grabbing text from the images and
sharing that's collaboratively and so
it's variants in the spirit of what
where this work came from and I think
that this could be very useful direction
to take it
yes I mean so the whole system is pretty
customizable so you can basically you
know set it up to send you a query
wherever you want in our case we
currently don't do that proactively but
you can explicitly request information
from other repositories based on page
that you're looking at and you know the
nice thing of limiting the proactive
approach to our intranet is that
recommendations are typically pretty
focused on and related to what we're
actually working on rather than going
off to let's say Google and you know
grab content from the web anything else
