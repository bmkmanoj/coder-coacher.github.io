typical monk he's a man who cannot sit
still in one place so even while he was
a monk he went on to to get a degree in
physics and then he went under study
like neurosciences and psychology and
and stuff and eventually he got one of
those some PhD thingies that some of you
might have and then he like people a PhD
Steven ought to become a professor in
UCSB and then he decided he consists you
in UCSB so he went on to found his own
Institute and he decided to take
everything as ever learned in life to
try to advance the mind sciences and
when I heard about his work I figured
this I think they'll be interesting to
do Google's I my sciences my senses and
everything so I invited him to come
visit come eat with us and share talk
and before I bring Ellen what up just
reminder to all Googlers please do not
ask him any questions that contains
information there is Google confidential
thank you and with that Ellen
well it's quite a delight for me to be
with you today I've been I've known
about Google like the rest of us for a
long time delighted to be in the in the
matrix here and to share some of my
passions pertaining to understanding the
nature of the mind it's potentials a
nature of consciousness and as Meg
mentioned I've had a a rather diverse
background but I have been blessed with
extraordinary teachers in the Tibetan
tradition other Buddhist traditions but
also marvelous instructors in physics
philosophy of science at Amherst College
and then doing a very diverse PhD
program at Stanford University
whereas ostensibly in religious studies
but taking courses in philosophy of
physics and calculus psychology
philosophy of mind and trying to bring
all of these together to integrate them
my background being raised in the West
but then living for years in Europe and
quite a few years in Asia trying to
integrate to synthesize and so that
these various aspects of my own life as
a Buddhist monk for 14 years but also
physics student and so forth could be
all integrated and so that the various
aspects of my own last 56 years in the
planet would be all one of kind of one
integrated unit so no part was isolated
from the others and it actually took a
long time because I've had again been
exposed to so many diverse worldviews
ways of life and so on so what I'd like
to share with you this afternoon is a
vision of a possibility of a first
revolution in the mind sciences and this
very notion is based on assumption on an
assumption that certainly can be
contested probably everything can be but
the starting assumption here is that
among the Natural Sciences we had the
first great revolution in the natural
sciences starting with your Poorna kiss
building up momentum with Kepler Galileo
and coming to its fulfillment to its
fruition with Newton and so the first
great revolution we had in the natural
sciences was in physics and astronomy
and I would say from my own perspective
it started with Copernicus but within it
with Newton it came together he brought
it all together and that's when that
revolution stopped and then that we
simply had a lot of excellent science a
lot of excellent physics after that and
then we move over to another discipline
the life sciences are plugging along
plugging along and then 1859 d'art
comes out with this masterpiece and so
he started the first and the only great
revolution we've had in the life
sciences I say it started with Darwin it
started building along mentum in the
1870s with Gregor Mendel a Christian
monk with genetics of course and then it
was building momentum building momentum
keypoint one century after Darwin 1959
Crick and Watson DNA we finally found
now the mechanics how does this happen
the natural selection how can species
mutate Darwin didn't tell us Mendel gave
us a hint Crick and Watson pointed there
is the machinery and so following that
we've had this extraordinary growth a
spectacular growth in the study of
genetics and I would say that great
revolution starting in 1859 his cut has
come to a culmination it's over and it
was with the human genome project we've
mapped it something like 99% now well
done and now we of course the study of
biology of genetics will continue but it
was it was 140 years and interestingly
enough it's probably just a coincidence
but it was 140 years also from
Copernicus through Newton took a hundred
forty years for the for the revolution
to start and then go voila there it is
we've also had a second great revolution
in physics and it started with Max
Planck in 1900 it picked up momentum in
1905 in 1915 with a special and general
relativity theories from Einstein it was
truly a revolution and by revolution I
mean the to use the familiar phrase the
paradigm is shifted your fundamental
orientation towards the subject matter
has shifted and it will never be the
same from a geocentric to the
heliocentric from pre Darwin to post
Darwin nothing's the same you cannot
look at human existence you cannot look
at the planet in the same way anymore
it's fundamentally your axis has rotated
that second great revolution in physics
it's not over 106 years if we start in
1900 when Max Planck came out with a
notion of quantum it's not over there
are some core crucial fundamental issues
in quantum mechanics in particular have
not been solved the most important of
which I would say is a measurement
problem how is it you move from a
a mental of a and a mathematical
abstraction of a probability function
which is hardly physical is a pure
abstraction but prior to making a
measurement that's what you have you
have a probability function a
Schrodinger wave equation and then you
make a measurement and voila now
suddenly you have an electron that is
here it still doesn't have simultaneous
exact momentum and location but at least
it's a real electron photon what have
you but what is it about the active
measurement that moves you from a realm
of possibility to a realm of actuality
somehow the observer is involved but in
what way what does it take for a
measurement to take place what's
required do you need consciousness could
a robot do it we don't know the
measurement problem I think it was
identified about 1930 or so it's
unsolved it's big we don't know what is
the role of the observer in the natural
world that takes us from potential to
actuality but of course another major
unresolved question in this 20th century
physics is you have to extraordinarily
elegant profound powerful theories and
that is quantum mechanics on the one
hand and general relativity on the other
neither one's going away they're too
good but they're not integrated they're
not integrated that would be the grand
unified theory and nobody's come up with
it so that revolution is in progress the
second great revolution in physics but
now we go to we go to the mine sciences
and I'd like to get a little bit of
historical perspective here to point out
one element that I think is absolutely
an indispensable catalyst to bring about
a revolution in any field of science and
that is the development of extraordinary
sophisticated advanced methods of
empirical observation if you don't have
that the revolution is not going to take
place that'll be my premise you've got
to observe the phenomena you're really
interested in and you've got to observe
it beyond folk astronomy or folk
psychology or folk biology get
professional and so when I think of the
first great revolution in the physical
sciences I don't think of Copernicus he
was a brilliant mathematician he was not
a brilliant experimenter he was not a
brilliant observer he'd get up on the
roof of his monastery look at
starts with the best of him he didn't do
anything innovative there his
mathematical theory that was innovative
so they call that the Copernican
revolution Kepler himself was not a
great observer he got all his data from
Tico but I he who was a very powerful
observer very brilliant Danish
astronomer but Kepler like Copernicus
was a great mathematician it was Galileo
that brought in the full package Galileo
was the observer he was the engineer he
was the one that reinvented the
telescope which had actually had been
invented in Holland he tried to order
one somebody snipped it on the way you
know he googled and got got one on the
way and then they snip it in the mail
and so he was there bummed out he didn't
get his telescope because somebody's
snipped it you know and he said the heck
with it I'll make my own so he did he
made himself a 20 power 20 20 power
telescope and he did something
unprecedented the telescope was already
there but Galileo is the innovator and
he used it in unprecedented ways instead
of just googling or goggling looking at
the girls across the street in Holland
he directed it upwards and everywhere he
looked can you imagine how thrilling
this must have been that everything he
looked at he was discovering something
nobody had ever seen before he took this
telescope and directed the moons and he
sought craters for the first time in
humanity's history turned it to Jupiter
he saw the moons for the first time
turned it to the Sun he saw sunspots
turned to Venus he saw the phases of
Venus would Matt be thrilling that's
what was needed he too was mathematician
but he was an experimenter he was
rolling balls down a ramp to see whether
they went at constant velocity they're
accelerated he did actually drop objects
off the Tower of Pisa I've been there
and asked the people at the University
of Pisa he did it all and he also
brought it out into the world he didn't
write in Latin like so many of his
contemporaries he wrote in Italian he
brought it home he was the full package
he was the consummate first great
scientist that brought it all together
among the things he did which was
seminal which is indispensable for this
triggering of the first great revolution
in the physical sciences was his use of
the telescope he was making observations
like nobody had ever done before the
mathematics was there the observation
that was crucial otherwise what they
were doing with Copernicus
eccentric system was very cool
mathematic mathematical system but we
already have one thanks very much
and ours covers covers the data it
accounts for the appearances so did
yours so whatever it's a matter of
choice but it's not a matter of choice
when you start seeing the phases of
Venus it's not a matter of which one do
you like like you know do you like ice
cream or what you're like you're like
fudge brownies
by this rigorous observation of material
phenomena he was the one I think more
than anybody else that launched the true
revolution the first great revolution
and it was in the physical sciences in a
similar fashion Darwin spent about 25
years in very meticulous rigorous
careful observation of biological
phenomena of course in the Galapagos we
all know about that but no wasn't just
the Galapagos he was doing years of
study observing observing observing and
then in 1859 came up with this great
monumental work the origins of the
species that would not have happened had
he not been meticulously observing the
but not biological phenomena it wasn't
just staying home at his estate and
thinking really deeply about biology it
wasn't by doing really good physics it
was by observing biological phenomena
carefully and then drawing from that and
developing his spectacular theory of
evolution well then we get to 1890 we
get to the closing years of the 19th
century first decade of the 20th century
and a person I believe is of equal
stature William James I have to admit
he's one of my heroes so look out I
really love this guy because he was
brilliant he was an MD he was a
biologist he was a spectacular
philosopher he wrote the greatest
American treatise on religious
experience ever the varieties of
religious experience here's a
psychologist he started the first
neuroscience lab experimental psychology
lab in the United States at Harvard he
was a brilliant philosopher religious
studies scholar scientist MD biologist
psychologist and he was so Dogma free
that's what I love about this guy he
wasn't buying into any Dogma but he was
an empiricist in fact he started a
school of sight a philosophy called
radical empiricism William James came to
the mind and this is something that had
been postponed for 300 years
the time of Copernicus can you imagine
300 years of the development of science
a physics chemistry biology astronomy
geology etc etc 300 years before they
actually started the scientific study of
the mind that should throw you back for
a moment if you've not quite thought of
it in those terms this is bizarre the
mind is that with which you're doing all
the science it would be like somebody
giving what an instrument and say use
this instrument you'll discover a lot of
things and waiting 300 years before you
actually look at the instrument itself
that is weird but there are very good
reasons for it and today we have too
short a time to really explore them in
depth but of course for those first 300
years science the natural sciences
established a reputation a spectacular
reputation well-earned reputation for
studying objective quantifiable physical
phenomena objective quantifiable
physical phenomena so you can bring in
the full weight of mathematics the
technology which is there starting from
the telescope moving right through all
the extraordinary advances and
technology but mental phenomena emotions
thoughts mental images desires memories
expectations the whole array for visual
perception auditory mental perception
dreams these are not objective they're
subjective they're not quantifiable
they're qualitative they're not clearly
physical I mean the last time you had a
dream look at the contents of the dream
and ask what physical attributes to the
contents of your dream have the answers
none or your emotions your desires your
hopes and fears your feelings your
thoughts and mental images they don't
have any physical attributes at all you
observe them they don't they're not
physical at least they certainly don't
appear physical if they are physical
then they're really concealing something
and so William James was presenting
perhaps the greatest challenge in the
history of science with its 300 years of
spectacular success you are squeezed we
because he himself was a biologist and
MD we have gotten extremely good using
scientific method to explore the
objective quantifiable physical and now
can we take the same expertise the same
methodological rigor and apply it to
that which is by nature subjective
qualitative
and perhaps non-physical and he said
let's do it in a way the old-fashioned
way and that is let psychology be above
all the study of mental phenomena as we
experience them immediately and for that
like physics likes biology lettuce
catalyze a revolution in the mind
scientists let us start and do it the
old-fashioned way
carefully meticulously rigorously
observe the phenomena themselves he
proposed this I didn't do it they tried
it they namby-pamby around with it for
about 20-30 years and then they stopped
now William James wasn't the old what
the only person William James started
the first experimental psychology lab at
Harvard in 1879 and here was his kind of
mission statement in terms of
methodology he said introspective
observation is what we have to rely on
first and foremost and always the word
introspection actually that we shed no
quotation marks there take out that
middle quotation marks' he continues the
word introspection need hardly be
defined it means of course the looking
into our own minds and reporting what we
there discover in other words just as
Galileo was an empiricist and Darwin was
an empiricist when we finally get around
to the mind let's be equally empirical
and study the phenomena themselves now
in presenting this he did not at all
disparage or try to marginalize studying
the mind by way of behavior so the whole
behavioral science is inferring states
of consciousness mental processes and so
forth by way of behavior extremely
valuable he did not disparage that so
we're looking at the fruits the effects
of mental processes by studying
behavioral output excellent and then of
course they knew back then that the
brain is crucially important in
generating mental states process and so
forth so causally look at the mind
indirectly by looking at the neural
causes giving rise to mental phenomena
look at the mind indirectly by looking
at the behavioral output or effects of
mental phenomena but first and foremost
and always look at the mental phenomena
and that your science be based upon the
actual careful observation of the
phenomena
selves now in the same year that William
Jane started this first experimental
psychology lab at Harvard Wilhelm wundt
the German psychologist in Germany
started the same in the same year he
started his own experimental psychology
lab and he echoed a very similar theme
he said the service which it the
experimental method or what we call the
scientific method the surface which the
scientific method can yield consists
essentially in perfecting our inner
observation or rather as I believe in
making this really possible in any exact
sense that did anybody inter can
introspect a little bit are you happy
right now are sad interested or bored
agitated or calm you don't need to look
at your behavior you don't ask have to
go to an EEG or to an fMRI and ask you
know how am i doing it attempt what tell
me what tell me why but my brain scan
tells me to some level to some
rudimentary level right now you can have
some idea what's going on in your mind
are there a lot of thoughts arising are
you falling asleep and so forth so
emotional states cognitive states the
focus of your attention the scattered
mass of your attention but what both
William James and Bill hambone these two
giants on the two sides of the Atlantic
Ocean we're suggesting is take your folk
psychology your folk untrained
introspection and start refining it
honing it intensifying it make this a
sophisticated method in inquiry this is
the battlecry this is the great
challenge for the mind sciences didn't
happen didn't happen
1913 especially in America John Watson
at Johns Hopkins University William
James was just cooling off in the grave
and another movement came in it was
almost like a palace coup and John
Watson in 1913 said from now on the
scientific study of the mind is going to
avoid all psychological subjective terms
we will not use the term as belief an
emotion thought perception we're not
going to use any of those subjective
terms at all they have no place in
psychology this is bizarre we're gonna
have a science of the mind but by the
way we won't use any mental terminology
at all we're gonna treat the mind as if
it's a black box containing only
dispositions proclivities for behavior
we're gonna confine ourselves to
studying the non-line by way of behavior
in other words we're gonna flatten like
stamping on a tin can we're gonna
flatten the study of mental phenomena
treat em as if they don't exist and
reduce psychology to the study of
behavior it's back to the good
old-fashioned way of objective
quantifiable and physical rather than
picking up the gauntlet that William
James had thrown out and said it's time
to start something afresh attend to the
mental phenomena and John Watson said no
thanks
these were Radical behaviorists this is
going on from 1913 building a momentum
that 20s or 30s or 40s 50s 1953 forty
years later BF Skinner comes out and
says mental phenomena do not exist
there's no such thing as emotion mental
images thoughts desires hopes and fears
they don't exist at all in fact
consciousness is a word that refers to
nothing at all it's a superstition your
jaw should be dropping down to your
kneecaps at this point what and he said
well after all they can't exist they
don't have physical attributes what this
is the absolute trumping of Dogma over
experience because they've decided now
BF Skinner writing in 1953 the only
things that exist are physical the only
things that exist are physical and the
properties of the physical mental
phenomena clearly don't have any
physical attributes therefore they don't
exist appearances to the contrary well
tough luck on appearances and he kept on
saying that until 1974 he kept on saying
he never learned and he wasn't some
Yahoo at podunk State University he was
a full professor at Harvard University
and saying these things look like he's
brain dead I mean it really should
astound us it's such a highly
intelligent person I say with respect
can say such an a ridiculous thing it
compares to Descartes statement also
operating under the dogma now it's a
dogma of the Roman Catholic Church in
the 17th century when he equated
consciousness with a human immortal soul
only human beings have immortal souls
animals don't if you if you equated
consciousness with an immortal soul you
now in one step logic have to come to
the conclusion that animals are not
conscious
they don't have an immortal soul they
don't go to heaven or hell therefore
your dog has no consciousness which
means no feelings try to swallow that
one if you can
well even back then they saw what
Descartes we thought you a pretty smart
guy but what but which is more pardon me
but idiotic to say your dog has no
feelings or you have no feelings again
when I was studying this at Stanford
when I was studying philosophy of mind
we learned that actually the whole
school of behaviorism that dominated
American academic psychology for 50 or
60 years can be refuted with a joke I
mean it's tough when a whole system can
be refuted with a joke but it can be man
and a man and a woman make love the man
rolls over lights up a cigarette Li says
it was great for you how was it for me
that should pretty well do it for
behaviorism but we act we can ask how is
it that brilliant mind psychologist at
Harvard Berkeley Princeton Stanford
Chicago how could they settle over 50 or
six years on something so bizarre and so
radically anti empirical and I asked my
professor of philosophy of mind at
Stanford this you know the reputation of
this was a piece of cake it was it was
one page reputation any sophomore even
with a hangover could have written it
how come they didn't get it
these were smart people why didn't they
get it and in the professor of spam it
smiled at me with a whimsical grin and
said well after all it was a matter of
fashion well that's a nice way of saying
groupthink it's a nice way of thinking
or saying lemmings this introspection
fall by the wayside it was thrown out it
was thrown out the back window and they
didn't look back
and so this challenge of William James
and Vilhelm wouldn't bring introspection
and make it scientific has been ignored
and has been ignored to this day so I'm
finding a parallel here if we go back to
Galileo his telescope kind of trouble he
got himself into there was a medieval
theological resistance to Galileo's
empiricism to his using the telescope
and discovering things that violated the
principles of a literal reading of the
Bible and the metaphysical assertions of
Aristotle
because until gal
layo for the most part people interested
in the sky in the stars were astrologers
and they would do folk astronomy they
look up at the stars but what they are
really interested in is the terrestrial
correlates of celestial phenomena that
is should I get married tomorrow or next
month when shall I so my crops you know
when was my birthday a manga you know
and so working out your horoscope that's
what they were really interested in and
that's where the professionals were in
making growing up the horoscopes and
they left astronomy at pretty much a
folk level and when Galileo said look I
got a telescope I'm making some
fantastic discoveries here the most
conservative of the clerics the
churchmen of his time refused to look
through his telescope saying we don't
need to if you discover things through
your telescope that contradict what we
already know to be true from the Bible
and Aristotle what you're seeing is
false
it must be an aberration an artifact of
your lenses and after all it's merely an
illusion why should we bother we don't
need to because we already have the
Bible and Aristotle who are you Galileo
you think you're an Aristotle you think
you're God why should we listen to you
we've got the Bible in Aristotle what do
we need you for and your empirical
observations so they refused to use it
and they refuse to accept the
discoveries they grounded him they put
them under house arrest they said go to
your room and stay there for the rest of
your life you know like mom and dad
getting really irritated their teenage
kid but now we have Galilee we have
Galileo of the modern times we have
William Jane saying we have a no whole
new kettle of fish here we have a domain
of the natural world in other words this
is not a supernatural infusion from God
these are natural phenomena these mental
phenomena let's follow Galileo's Q and
follow and observe them carefully what
do we have in response from the
behaviorist from the cognitive
psychologists and the cognitive
neurophysiologist
which are really they are very prominent
these days what do we have here we have
a focus on the behavioral and neural
correlates of mental phenomena but
introspection as a sophisticated refined
mean of observation by a larger refusal
by enlarge insight departments
neuroscience departments if you
introduce hey how about really some
refined introspection let's say sorry
we're busy we're busy we're studying the
brain we're studying hippocampus we're
studying you know studying aspects of
psychology
we don't need it and if you if you claim
to have some discoveries from
introspection well whatever but we're
busy and after all introspection gives
rise to only the appearances of the mind
they're a loser after all so why should
we bother let's get back and study the
hardware and let's start a new
neuroscience lab but there's a certain
limitation in this orientation of
insisting that everything that is real
must be physical everything boils down
to physics and that is just to do a
waltz through history here
think about Copernicus think about the
batata Ptolemaic mathematicians who are
crunching the numbers coming up with one
epicycle one eccentric after another
great mathematicians really not that
great for observer observing celestial
phenomena and if you can imagine
confining understanding just to
mathematics you're sitting in a room and
you're a great mathematician there's
nothing in pure mathematics that defines
mass or energy it's not there not in
pure mathematics there's nothing that
defines the emergence of physical
phenomena in the universe there's
nothing in pure mathematics that
predicts that there ever would be a
universe and in pure mathematics there's
nothing that explains the emergence of
matter and energy when would it happen
when was the Big Bang when did you start
getting particles and so forth and so on
you have to step outside of mathematics
as Galileo did and combine the
mathematics with empirical observation
but now we shift over to the realm of
physics and imagine for the time being
that you only know physics that you
don't know anything about biology or
psychology confine your understanding
just to physics class and mechanics
electromagnetism thermodynamics the
whole range of physics
I would suggest there's you're going to
see the parallel here there's nothing in
physics per se that defines life if you
don't know anything about biology
there's nothing in physics that defines
life or alive and dead healthy and sick
these words don't mean anything in
physics that's where my scientific
training was those two words don't crop
up life and death healthy and sick
flourishing and so forth they don't crop
up there's nothing in physics that
defines life there's nothing in the laws
of physics class of mechanics and all
the way through that predicts that at
some point in the universe life would
emerge it's nothing there it happened
but physics didn't
would happen and once it has happened
physics on its own does not explain life
the shifter biology now we got
mathematics physics and biology but if
you confined your understanding to
biology alone with its physics and
mathematics behind it there's nothing in
biology that defines consciousness
consciousness is not defined in
biological terms there's nothing in
biology that predicts the emergence of
consciousness at what point in evolution
of life in the universe or on our planet
where we know it takes place at what
point did consciousness happen and why
is nothing in biology that predicts it
nothing biology that defines it and once
it's there biology does not explain
consciousness in living organisms and
now let's finally moved to psychology so
finally when the mind sciences and we're
studying attention and volition and
perception and memory and so forth but
in psychology alone there are people
throughout the planet in the United
States and everywhere else for millennia
who have been having religious
experiences call it spiritual call it
religious but a sense of the
transcendent something larger and so
forth this is happening it's been
happening a long time it's happening to
this day but there's nothing in
psychology per se that predicts that
this would ever happen that defines
religious experience in its own terms
rather than reducing it to something
very prosaic like hysteria form of
neurosis form of psychosis and so forth
in drawing it down to psychology you
miss what was there that was distinctive
distinctively spiritual or religious
psychology by itself does not define
predict or explain the emergence of
religious experience and yet there it is
it happens so this would be an argument
not against math physics or biology or
psychology but saying it's arguing for a
piss epistemic pluralism and that is
let's get off this this out of this rut
a thing thing everything can be
explained in terms of the more primitive
and recognize we need different
modalities of inquiry that everything
does not boil down to physics or to
biology in this physicalist worldview
which in many ways has so much going for
it I mean we know about what happened
during the nanoseconds after the Big
Bang that is
tacular we know about the inner the
nucleus of a top of an atom quarks with
charm and color and so forth that
spectacular we know about the
constitution of galactic clusters ten
billion light years away that is amazing
but what about consciousness that which
makes all of science possible it's the
blind spot I would call it
metaphorically the retinal blind spot in
the scientific vision where the optic
nerve cover touches the back of the
retina and you know what happens there
what we should have is we walking around
with two dark spots in our visual field
right we should have that because
there's no information coming in from
those spots but what is our cunning
brain do it covers over the area about
which you know nothing at all it covers
it over with the environment so if
you're looking at a brown wall it covers
in with brown if you're looking at a
purple wall that covers over with purple
it covers over that which you don't know
at all with that which is familiar and
gives you an illusion of knowledge
interesting well what what is there in
the retinal blind spot of the scientific
vision of reality I would suggest it's
consciousness we have no scientific
definition of consciousness that's a bad
start if consciousness is a natural
phenomenon for heaven's sake let's have
a definition how can you study it if you
don't even define what you're studying
that's a problem but for any empiricist
it's a crucial point that we have no
objective means of detecting
consciousness there's a word for a type
of technology that doesn't exist is
called a psycho meter it would be like a
Geiger counter that you point to a rock
and a plants into a an amoeba into a
baby during the first trimester and
during the last trimester and to an old
person who's got Alzheimer's and become
vegetative and so forth and you bring
out your little psycho motor it'll go
not the computer's not not conscious
conscious and then to the the insect
eating plants and the wrapped and the
cockroach etc and you would get it on a
like a Geiger counter oh it's it's a
it's a 10 cycles psychometrist or
something you know it's cycle
psychological units that's how conscious
it is it would be marvelous to have such
technology the only problem is we don't
have it that's why there's such an
enormous debate still about abortion no
person wants to kill babies these are
not evil people on either side of the
Vence but nobody's got a clue and that
that thing in the womb is conscious
so is it 12 days is it as the Muslims
say 120 days is that as the Roman
Catholic say at conception who's got a
clue empirically we don't have any
objective means of detecting the
presence or absence of consciousness in
anything mineral plant animal humans etc
that makes it tough to have a science of
consciousness what are the neural
correlates of consciousness that is
whenever we have a we have a conscious
being we can come your conscious I'm
going to be I bet my life on it you are
conscious and yet what are the neural
correlates what's invariably happening
when you are conscious what are the
neuro we don't know they're called the
NCC the neural correlates of
consciousness haven't been identified
yet let alone consciousness we don't
even know the neural correlates of
consciousness on here's a crucial one
what are the necessary and sufficient
causes of consciousness well we don't
have to speak about it in the abstract
let's say visual perception we know a
lot about the visual cortex it's if the
area of the brain that is really pretty
well mapped out we know in a human being
the visual cortex is necessary for us to
see color for visual perception to take
place so we know that visual cortex the
optic nerve the retina are necessary for
the generation of visual perception
human beings but do you need a visual
cortex if you're if you're developing
some artificial intelligence and you
want it to be conscious but you're not
going to give it a brain a gooshie brain
you wanted to work it out with silicon
chips so it is a visual cortex necessary
in an instrument of artificial
intelligence we don't know we don't know
what the sufficient causes are whether
it's sufficient just to have a visual
cortex and photons coming in we don't
know what the necessary or sufficient
causes are for visual perception let
alone any other kind of consciousness so
any assumptions about what happens to
consciousness at death are just
assumptions because you to know to speak
with confidence and knowledge
consciousness terminates at death you
would have had to identify the necessary
and sufficient causes and know at least
the sufficient causes and is it aren't
there but we don't know what they are so
frankly we don't know what happens to
consciousness at death and we finally
come to what David Chalmers a
philosopher of mine called the hard
problem and that is the chemicals
electricity inside the skull they're
really ordinary
they're just what chemists have been
studying for decades and decades and
there's no mystical neurons there's no
NIT mystical chemicals or electrons in
there it's really ordinary stuff so how
is it that neurons generate subjective
experience what is it about those
chemicals electricity then Abelson
generate subjective experience mental
states or even influence mental states
and although we know from the Paseo
effect that when you go to a doctor and
you'll receive a tablet and you believe
it will help the placebo effect is going
to kick in big-time just your belief
your expectation your desire and Trust
will have enormous impact on your body
your brain your immune system the
pharmaceutical industry knows this very
well how is that possible that you can
go from an idea of faith a belief and it
actually influences physical health we
don't know so when we add up all of that
ignorance it comes hard to say that we
actually have a science of consciousness
it falls in the retinal blind spot but
nevertheless we cover over that retinal
blind spot with the assumption with
assumptions or what I would call an
illusion of knowledge and John Searle
very distinguished philosopher of mind
expresses this illusion of knowledge
although he's expressing it as knowledge
when he writes there is a simple
solution to the mind-body problem isn't
that good relief it's a simple problem
and and here the news gets better this
solution has been available to any
educated person since serious work began
on the brain nearly a century ago and in
a sense we all know it to be true that
should be a relief and here it is mental
phenomena are caused by a neuro
physiological process in the brain of
course we know that you know knock out
your visual cortex you don't see any
longer knock out hippocampus other
things don't happen frontal cortex other
thing we know that but wait a minute a
catch mental phenomena are themselves
features of the brain mental phenomena
themselves are physical wait a minute
when did we learn that where is the
empirical evidence that showed
equivalence between mental phenomena and
neural events rather than neural events
taking on the role of cause causal
agents generating resultant mental
phenomena who demonstrated equivalence
the answer is nobody
but he's saying everybody knows it how
does everybody know something that
nobody knows and which there's no
empirical evidence at all of equivalence
well happily one of one of the foremost
people on the front lines of scientific
research into consciousness Crystal Cove
outstanding cognitive neuroscientist
he's the one leading the charge of
trying to find the neural correlates of
consciousness he unmasks this illusion
when he states the character of brain
States and a phenominal states by that
means he means mental phenomena desires
emotions and so forth mental phenomena
the character of brain states and mental
states appear to different to be
completely reducible to each other look
at brain states they don't have any
mental qualities at all
observe mental states phenomena
processes they don't have any physical
properties at all bring out all your
instruments of technology they do not
detect a single mental event so why on
earth are we waiting these when they
don't even have any overlapping
qualities and in fact neural events
being causal take generally about a
hundred milliseconds to generate the
resultant mental state they don't even
exist at the same time in point in time
so he's calling a spade a spade here you
know they're so different it now seems
unlikely that they can be reducible to
each other namely that mental phenomena
are nothing other than brain states he
said I suspect that the relationship is
more complex than traditionally
envisioned originally envisioned is
mental phenomena are just physical for
now it is best to keep an open mind on
this matter I love it when scientists
say that let's just acknowledge that
we're ignorant we don't know the nature
of mental events we don't know that
they're physical let's keep an open mind
but practically speaking what should we
do now and let's concentrate on
identifying the correlates of
consciousness in the brain so it's back
to business as usual it's not picking up
the gauntlet that William James threw
down it's going back to the safe
observing the quantifiable the physical
the objective as if you're going to
really fathom the nature of
consciousness by simply studying the
neural correlates they contribute to the
generation of consciousness he's a
really good neuroscientist so we can't
blame him
we're saying let's focus on the brain
but that doesn't mean all of us should
William James said please when you're
going to start listening to me it's
Daniel Boorstin and a very distinguished
historian American historian wrote an
excellent book called the discoverers
the history of mankind's discovery for
the last five thousand years in the
preface of this book makes us think of a
very important point he said throughout
human history illusions of knowledge
thinking we know something that we don't
really know at all but absolutely being
convinced of it
illusions of knowledge and not ignorance
that proven to be the principal
obstacles to discovery ignorance is
clean and it's honest I don't know can
we find out an illusion of knowledge is
I already know and we don't need to ask
physical phenomena riff is mental
phenomena are physical any more
questions that's an illusion of
knowledge as crystal macaque me
it's quite clear so what I'm proposing
here is I try to envision the first
revolution the Mayan Sciences we haven't
had one started in 1879 where was the
revolution what what point it was
nothing the same because our
understanding of the mind has radically
shifted like it did with Darwin with
respect to life Galileo with respect to
the planet Earth and its place in the
universe and so when I'm suggesting here
is we need a renaissance of empiricism
that the Imperial examination of
physical phenomena if we look back to
the time of Galileo the empirical
examination of physical phenomena
dispelled the illusions of knowledge of
medieval scholasticism with respect to
or regarding physical phenomena they
thought in the 16th century the 15th
century that knowledge of the universe
was pretty well complete they had the
Bible which is God's own word they had
Aristotle the philosopher Thomas Aquinas
fused these into one incomplete perfect
system except it was riddled with a
solutions of knowledge and Galileo
started tipping over that cart and it's
never been operated since it was Galileo
and then it was Newton and it was you
know one after another and they kept on
showing that what you thought was
complete is not only not complete but
it's radically flawed because you're
mistaking illusions of knowledge for
actual knowledge and I'm suggesting here
the empirical observation of mental
not just the behavioral and neural
correlates the phenomena themselves
picking up the challenge of William
James may dispel the illusions of
knowledge of modern physicalism
regarding mental phenomena physicalism
assumes it in system fatica lee there is
nothing in the universe apart from
physical phenomena and their emergent
properties who said why should the whole
of reality fit into a human conceptual
construct after all we are the ones who
define physical nature didn't define it
for us and the very notion of the
physical has shifted from the time of
Descartes through Galileo through Newton
through Maxwell through Max Planck
through Einstein through Stephen Hawking
it's a moving target
everything is reducible to physics great
which physics the physics of yes
yesterday or today or a hundred years
from now where's the moving target
stopped at what point can you physicists
say okay we got it under under under
wraps now we know what the physical are
and mental phenomena have to fit into
that box the day you state stated that
you've just stopped doing physics and
you've become a medieval scholastic we
now know what is physical and nature
happily fit into our conceptual
construct nature the whole of nature fit
into our box and we call it physical
that's not scientific that's dogmatic
and so perhaps the empirical observation
of mental phenomena may just dispel this
illusion of knowledge not from medieval
scholasticism but from modern
scholasticism now happily our
euro-american Australian NL our modern
because it's in Singapore it's in
Bangkok it's in Argentina it's in Brazil
it's not just the West now it's the
vision of modernity happily we are not
the only intelligent life in the
universe our euro-american civilisation
happily there have actually been other
civilizations on this planet that have
had the same statistically the same
scattering of geniuses as our
euro-american civilization but they
weren't us they weren't in the
Mediterranean Basin they didn't come out
of the Abrahamic religions of Judaism
Christianity and Islam they didn't come
out of the Greek heritage Plato and
Aristotle other civilizations like that
of China for 5000 years
India for who knows how many thousands
of years might they have come up with
anything that we haven't it's one of
those questions you don't often ask at
least not in academia I've been there
it's not one of the questions that comes
up which is assuming that we Trump
everybody but India classical India they
unlike Galileo unlike the founders of
our scientific revolution they were not
seeking a God's eye view of objective
reality they were not creating or
assuming an absolute demarcation a
bifurcation between subject and object
and trying to observe the purely
objective world from an absolutely
outside perspective God's own
perspective that just wasn't on the
agenda for the Indians for these
classical Indians truth seekers they
were seeking to understand the world of
experience not some objective world
independent of experience in sanskrit
called waka now if that's your agenda to
understand the world of experience not a
God's eye view of something that
transcends experience if that's what
your focus is in German philosophy by
the way it's called Laban svelte from
the phenomenological tradition of Kosovo
and Heidegger if what you're primarily
understand wishing to understand is the
world of experience then the study of
the mind has to be first foremost
central jury inquiry in the natural into
the natural world because the world of
experience doesn't even exist without
consciousness there is no world of
experience about somebody experiencing
and so for the Indians the study of the
mind was the first thing they tackled in
modern science it was kind of like the
last thing they said consciousness
itself was didn't even come up in
psychology for almost a hundred years
only in the last ten or fifteen years
has consciousness become a legitimate
object of inquiry for cognitive
scientists for psychologists when I
study cognitive psychology at Stanford
consciousness was not there wasn't even
in the index an introspection was
mentioned only in the preface when they
said we tried it didn't work and they
moved right on the Indians happily are
not part of our Mediterranean Basin box
they had their own areas and this is one
of them the Sanskrit term is Samadhi and
I'm proposing here that it's a type of
telescope of the mind these
revolutionary truth seekers and they
were revolutionary because they were
they were kicking away
from an old tired dusty religious system
called the black manic tradition heavily
institutionalized ritualistic dogmatic
closed-minded and they said enough
and these shramana czar these truth
seekers roughly maybe three thousand
years ago
they set out to understand the world of
experience with a primary emphasis on
mind and the first thing they discovered
is if you're going to try to observe
mental phenomena your observation of it
has to be introspective but your
attention is wobbling all over the place
right it was ADHD 3,000 years ago it's
you're either getting dopey and falling
asleep you know falling asleep at the
wheel or your mind scattered all over
the place how can you make rigorous is
saying observations mental phenomena if
your attention is wobbling all over the
place oscillating between dullness and
agitation so the first thing they did
and they were very good at it by the
time the Buddha came along 2,500 years
ago is they develop extraordinarily
effective techniques for refining and
focusing attention rather like a
telescope firmly mounted on a tripod
polished lenses large aperture so you
can make stable vivid observations now
not of stars because they weren't that
interested but they were fascinated to
study the mind and they developed it to
a telescope of the mind the like of
which we have never developed and modern
science six since William James has not
made any progress at all now that was
the the groundwork laid like the Dutch
lens Mac the lens makers who started off
before Galileo and there was his
historical individual Buddha Ultima and
I would say he was to India what Galileo
was for the West
he took a pre-existing technology but it
was a contemplatively of refining
attention and he applied it in
unprecedented ways instead of simply
going into a state of Samadhi
experiencing bliss and equanimity and
euphoria and so forth he stabilized the
mind and then he used it to explore
states of consciousness ordinary states
extraordinary States but rigorous
careful empirical observation of mental
states states of consciousness and made
extraordinary discoveries at least that
is the that is the claim not for us to
take as religion that would be boring
but to take his hypotheses they said to
discover this just like any good to
scientist you hear somebody over there
in Beijing made it
in their lab good can we replicate it
that's the first thing that comes up
somebody in Korea said they cloned
they've cloned a dog they've done this
in this good let's replicate a whoops
that was a phony so write them up get
back to work but this is what scientists
are doing all the time somebody makes a
claim replicate it and this is exactly
what the Buddha encouraged said this is
my discoveries but don't just take my
word for it see if you can replicate it
and here's the experimental procedure
refine your attention well here's the
overall framework first of all called a
way of cultivate a way of life your
whole way of behaving in the world that
is conducive to social flourishing so
that here at Google you can all get
along together happily harmoniously you
know how that happens it's called ethics
no ethics you're gonna be all you know
ripping each other's hair out without
ethics no harmony with ethics you've got
a chance but also are in relationship
with the environment at large with
Mountain View with the state of
California the planet Earth there is a
way that we can live in a harmony with
our natural environment without sucking
it dry and leaving the husks to our
children it's called ethics
environmental ethics and so that was the
foundation upon the basis of that
developing mental balance refining the
mind refining attention developing
exceptional levels of mental health and
well-being and with that basis then
becoming a true contempt that assist and
using a refined attention to explore
states of consciousness giving rise to a
sense of spiritual flourishing or some
would call liberation so I'm suggesting
something dramatic something
revolutionary here and you notice I said
nothing original at all it was William
James it was William Vaughn - it was
Buddha this thing this is the way to go
to understand the nature of mind don't
be satisfied by just studying the
physical correlates you're always going
to get that which is a round
consciousness but not the nature of
consciousness should we be skeptical of
that and the answer is yes said Richard
Feynman the great Nobel laureate in
physics said one of the ways of stopping
science would be only to do experiments
in the region where you know the law
play it safe you want to understand
consciousness stick to the brain you'll
get tenure you'll publish in peer review
journals go into respectin route and oh
you are on thin ice but he said
experimenter search most diligently and
with a great
effort in exactly those places where it
seems most likely that we can prove our
theories wrong there's a theory the mind
is just the brain the mind is just an
epiphenomena of the brain the mind
mental phenomena are physical maybe it's
true but the good skeptic not the one
that's skeptical of other people's view
is the person who's skeptical of his own
assumptions says let's put that one to
the test in other words he says in other
words we are trying to prove ourselves
wrong as quickly as possible
is only in that way can we find progress
now science is known for skepticism
religion is known for dogmatism but what
did the Buddha say here this great
Galileo of India he said in response to
a bunch of skeptics he said you are
skeptical about what you should be
skeptical about he said do not be led
right by reports or tradition or hearsay
do not be led by authority of religious
texts or by mere logic and inference all
by itself nor by considering appearances
just taking a casual look taking all
appearances at face value North by
delight and speculative opinions nor by
seeming possibilities nor by the idea
this is my teacher what he said must be
right but when you know for yourselves
that certain things are unwholesome
destructive and detrimental then reject
them and when you know for yourself that
certain things are wholesome and good
then accept them and follow them in
other words be a skeptic he encouraged
his own followers to be skeptical so
Occam's razor was used to great effect
coming out of the medieval era into the
Renaissance as Arkham said the principle
is it is vain to do with more receptions
what can be done with fewer assumptions
when I'm suggesting here is we have too
many assumptions in the scientific study
of the mind let us use our comes razor
to shave off the assumption the mental
for the physical phenomena mental
phenomena are physical it's just an
assumption
Christo of coke point that they don't
look physical why should they be and if
we shave off that assumption what have
we lost what less do we know and I would
suggest nothing we still know the
curtain will crawl that's we know just
about as much about the brain and
behavior as we did before
we've just shaved off an assumption
that's never been corroborated throw
that one out and now apply a fresh
method of inquiry of introspection to
actually observe mental phenomena and
what might we gain and the answer was we
don't know until we try it
as we draw this to a close we come back
to William James who suggested in terms
of this interface science religious and
religion and empiricism is that let
empiricism once become associated with
religion as hitherto through some
strange misunderstanding it has been
associated with irreligion and I believe
that a new era of religion as well as
philosophy will be ready to begin I
fully believe that such an empiricist 'm
is a more natural ally than dialectics
ever were or can be of the religious
life in other words introduced in
empiricism into religion as much as
science throw out dogmas both sides of
the fence and let's see what the
fireworks display final point here is i
suggested towards a first revolution in
the mine sciences I would suggest that
we haven't had one because there's been
too much dogma suppressing the empirical
study of mental phenomena themselves as
opposed to the physical correlates but
now there's a possibility is we have
access to Buddhism and Hinduism the Sufi
tradition psychology neuroscience we no
longer are isolated here at Google you
know this may be better than anybody
else you are on the globe your physical
plant happens to be in Mountain View but
it could be an Amazon right we are now
living in a globe where we can integrate
like never before
integrate these rigorous first-person
and third-person methodologies from the
contemplative the psychological the
neuroscientist in collaboration between
cognitive scientists the whole broad
range and contemplatives who have
exceptional mental skills and insights
resulting from rigorous sustained mental
training and observing and experimenting
with states of consciousness so there
would be a challenge to break down the
barriers to throw out dogma and
uncorroborated assumptions and open up a
new kind of a renaissance of empiricism
in the statment in the scientific study
of the mind that would be profoundly
contemplative and experiential and yet
rigorously scientific that could revelry
revolutionized the contemplative
traditions it could revolutionize
science and it could bring this
unfortunate rift between religion and
science creationism in the school
district that makes most of its gag and
so forth struck breaking down those
barriers and see about integrating east
and west ancient modern and caste
fresh light on the nature of the mind
and on human identity it's a possibility
that's my hope
so anybody has questions or observations
or debates anything is welcome yes came
back to the rift
and split in the Greek thought as one of
the original voices we out of resolving
this and then there's also of course and
over
that very moment in particular
this is that you trying to comment on
why white food is imperfect earlier this
is one way
it's just one way I was using that in a
short presentation I was saying here is
a good good sampling this was not
promoting Buddhism versus Hinduism or
the Muslim tradition or the Taoist
tradition not at all are saying this is
a good example from the very rich well
developed intellectually very
sophisticated contemplative tradition
but the Santa Barbara Institute which I
found it is not a Buddhist institution
it is an inter contemplatively drawing
from the wealth of East and West
contemplative traditions all from all
over the world interfacing these with
the best of science so it's not plugging
anyone tradition and it's certainly not
trying to validate Buddhism or any
particular school very much the contrary
these great contemplatively shion's have
been after universal truths and not just
trying to corroborate Buddhist ideas and
I'm not using that at all so I think
going back to Greek thought back to
Plato back to Pythagoras themselves that
to the notion of no Ito's which is a
type of mental perception by means of
which we can directly observe
non-essential mental phenomena that's a
Greek notion but we've forgotten it so I
don't want to leave anybody out that is
indigenous people east and west bring it
all together because the stakes are high
now we're dealing with something that is
central to everybody's existence and
that is consciousness so let's throw out
dogma of all sorts that Arianism biases
of all sorts and not leave anybody out
not leave out the contemplative not
leave out the neuroscientist for
heaven's sakes
not leave out anybody and really start
fusing and taking advantage of the
technology and transportation
I'm technology including transportation
that we have now so that we can really
draw from this wealth of wisdom and
insights and multiple methodologies this
epistemic pluralism I think is
absolutely a key yeah - two more
questions your honor
if you want approach consciousness in a
scientific way
absolutely
you need some idea of
very good so the question is if this is
going to be scientific and of course
science gained its laurels by studying
objective things that you can look at it
from a third-person perspective
quantifiable but measurable out there
right so if one lab does it another one
can corroborate it and it's pretty clear
and mental phenomena are subjective
there we are there as John Searle says
irreducibly ontological e first-person
right but I think a good analogy for
this the question deserves not a
two-minute answer it deserves
conferences and really detailed
investigations so we don't come up with
cheap answers cheap answers are easy but
if we take as an example mathematics now
mathematics is not scribbling things on
a board that's the outer display of it
but anybody who doesn't know mathematics
can memorize the equations and write
with the best of them with no
understanding at all mathematics when I
studied higher mathematics and mice my
training in physics it's really it's
subjective it's working through a proof
it's thinking and you may do something
out here on the board you may not but
the real juice of mathematics is
something that's taking taking place
internally and say well that but how can
mathematic mathematicians ever speak
with each other how can they know who's
great well they get a similar training
they go through an undergraduate they go
through graduate that goes postdoc and
after a while they know who gets the
Fields Medal it's not just that he wrote
things on the board it's through
dialogue and you say oh we speak a
similar language here everybody else
thinks words they can't understand we're
talking about but you and I have gone
through eight years of training in
mathematics and we know the elegant
proofs we know shoddy mathematics we
know the sharp stuff and so even though
it's largely internal they develop a
language a common training so they can
communicate amongst themselves in ways
that Outsiders cannot fathom now let's
imagine now this is hypothetical in a
way that it's all he's also historical
in another and that as I spend a lot of
time with Tibetans living with in
Tibetan culture and we have
contemplatives there who will go for
1020 thousand hours of training with a
common basis of ideas and training
contempt of Technology and so forth and
they develop a refined how do you say
professional language that they can
speak amongst each other with
themselves and they know what they're
talking about because like the
mathematicians is shared training
developing a shared vocabulary and then
amongst them and we know this is true in
the Tibetan tradition all the great
contemplatively great scholars they know
who the cream are it was dingo consider
mochi it was lingaraju
it was cholera muche these people the
peers no two outsider look like well a
really sweet monk really nice guy good
charisma but the professionals no it's
more than that this guy really has the
Skippy this man really knows what's
going on so I would not ask you to
accept that because I'm saying it but
I'm saying this issue has been grappled
with if we take a more prosaic example
wine connoisseurs and that is when I
drink I got my palate ruined when I was
18 because I got drunk on Red Mountain
wine whiskey and beer in the same time
and that told my tongue for life you
know so I can't tell any good good
vintage from another but I'm not with
people have had that training it's three
years formal training and then years of
getting experience so to wine
connoisseurs will come together and say
is what was it a 1948 or 49 and what
part of the vintage what you know what
part of France was was raised in so the
taste of wine is very subjective you
can't pick up the taste of wine with
some external technology it will tell
you all this is you know this is a $500
bottle as opposed to five dollar bottle
no technology will tell you that but
they train and then they use things like
bouquet and and so forth words I don't
even know what they're talking about but
they have a specialized vocabulary and
they know who the brilliant wine
connoisseurs are and who are just
mediocre and as a specialized vocabulary
that they know what they're talking
about and Outsiders like me I don't have
a clue so wine testing that's very
empirical the mathematical is very
internal if we try to draw inspiration
to those only by analogy then perhaps we
can get some idea but again that danger
there's all kinds of potholes here or
minefield and that is they're all being
brainwashed in the same way and that was
how introspection fell to its knees and
died is that different labs were simply
corroborating their own assumptions and

mentors that they weren't getting this
inter lab corroboration so it fell apart
but they gave up too soon and they
didn't go through a ten or twenty
thousand hours training not vilhelm
Vaughn's not Tichenor at Cornell
not James at Harvard this requires
training it if it's going to be
professional don't give him five hours
of training or a week of training how
about three years of training ten years
of training training the mind ten hours
