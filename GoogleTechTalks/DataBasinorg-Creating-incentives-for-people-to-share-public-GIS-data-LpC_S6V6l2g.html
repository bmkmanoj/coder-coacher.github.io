pleasure to introduce our guest speaker
today Josh an hour there's a lot of data
in the world but not all of it is
accessible and he's going to talk about
some solutions to that great thank you
very much Michael and thank you to
everybody who took some time today to
come hear me talk wanted to let you know
just a little bit of what's going to
happen during this talk I know a lot of
you are here to you were sold on this as
a conservation data talk which it will
be but we're going to talk about some
basic underlying technology stuff that
we've been doing and lay some groundwork
before we get to demo the new website
that will be unveiled here which is kind
of exciting I'm going to be joined by a
few of my colleagues Michael Higgins is
the CTO of riser labs and Tasha
commandant dr. Tasha commandant who is a
scientist conservation scientist with
the conservation biology Institute so
just jumping right in I wanted to give
you a quick background on who we are
ryzza labs as a pittsburgh-based company
with as everything in Pittsburgh related
technology deep Carnegie Mellon roots
our focus and mission is developing
software that helps communities unite
their data and the problem that we're
trying to address is that many people
who make decisions and communities and
nonprofit organizations and the
government sector don't have all the
data that they need in order it
accessible in one place for them to be
able to make better decisions and so
part of our mission also is preserving
open access to public data we're very
concerned about the erosion of of the
public the public data space and that's
one of the issues that we're really
trying to as a core mission of our
company to try to help with and we've
developed software specifically on top
of an architecture called the
information commons and i'm going to
take a little bit of time to talk about
the information commons it is a
peer-to-peer database system developed
by a company in pittsburgh our parent
company called Maya design and what's
interesting about it from my perspective
is that it's an autonomous system so
that every peer that operates in the
pure system is completely autonomous
it's not owned by doesn't have to be
owned by the same entity
and you have incredible amounts of
replication of data that take place so
any data object that goes into one peer
is automatically replicated out to end
number of other peers and so that allows
for the ability to preserve a lot of in
the open data space you know the public
domain basically so if a server goes
down it doesn't really matter you can
get the data somewhere else and we've
also been working quite hard on
distributed indexing algorithm so that
you can actually search across peers you
don't have have all the data in one peer
specifically to be able to find query
and find your information and it's an
open architecture it's not as open as we
might like in terms of documentation
we've been a little slow on that but if
you go to our website I'll provide a URL
at the end you can read some of the
papers that we publish about the
architecture itself and how it works so
you saw cloud on the screen and I knew
coming here you know that might lead to
a bunch of questions so everyone has a
cloud and I'm sure you know you've had
other people here talking about their
clouds and whatnot it's certainly cloudy
days these days on the internet and what
I want to do is just Ln a little bit of
how what we're doing is a little bit
different not necessarily better or
worse just different than than some of
the other cloud architectures that you
see so I took a risk by including Google
in this just in you know coming into
your camp and telling you what your
systems are about but this is just my my
impersonation of what it's what's going
on in the world so Amazon and IBM you
know that that Google the types of
clouds were talking about our there's
computing clouds obviously with node
network type stuff and also Amazon and
Google with storage and web services in
a cloud quote-unquote these systems are
to me seemed to be a low level
architecture about you know data isn't
necessarily shared across customers it
tends to be siloed so if i'll upload my
data you upload yours there's no
guarantee that those two data sets i can
query for example across both of those
data sets and get information and
frequently developers have to build
their own tools if you want to get
access to the information and the cloud
these clouds tend to be controlled by
one corporation at a time you're either
buying into the Amazon system or the
google system or anybody else's there's
other types of clouds out there to that
are more
cific in purpose so Flickr and YouTube
and things like that those are really
about aggregating information at a
higher level you know it's I want to
post my photos on you know some place or
a video or whatever and information is
automatically shared by default other
people can tag your data and comment on
them they can put them in their own
collections things like that but the
tools are a little bit more limited to
savvy programmers and once again the
cloud is controlled by one corporation
at a time it's very difficult to be able
to do queries across multiple types of
these systems that are out there other
than through web service type
architectures I have a question already
this is exciting that's right yeah the
control the control is really just
ownership of the system that you're
you're on not necessarily I'm not making
any claims about the ownership of the
data and and I really do want to be
clear I'm not coming in here saying
these are bad I'm just trying to outline
let you know to set up some
differentiation between what we're doing
as well when I do talk about the
information commons and sort of what
we're focused on and our goal out of
what we're doing we are specifically
focused on trying to help it's designed
specifically for the public interest in
mind and once again not that anyone
elses isn't but just that this is our
goal and it is a low level architecture
of data storage and I'll get to that in
a second by default all data is shared
it's actually quite hard not to share
your information across the different
nodes that you put in and that's on
purpose once again because it's a low
level architecture you need to build
your own tools to enable to get access
to it and each node can be independently
owned and operated basically there does
not have to be any common ownership
across the different nodes that you have
the base architecture that it's built on
is fairly commonplace in terms of its
just tuples its attributes a loop errors
that are bundled together with you you
IDs and and these are the currency
basically that could trade it around in
the peer network
that we've been developing and so I just
have a very simple example here of one
we call these you forums but basically
you know just attribute-value pairs the
values can be just about anything you
want including the new idea of another
attribute another you form of course and
so you can start linking them together
and that's for example how we deal with
indexing and other types of issues I
wanted to present this specifically just
to present a taste basically of the
lower underlying architecture of what
we're doing so you can get a feel sort
of where our roots are coming from but I
really do want to pretty quickly move on
into just understanding what we're what
we're doing with this architecture which
is I think just as interesting hopefully
so before I do move on though I just
want to acknowledge there when you're
trying to develop a distributed
peer-to-peer information storage system
there's lots of challenges that are
involved and we recognize these we've
addressed some of them and many others
are research ongoing research projects
that we and now some others folks are
starting to address okay so specifically
what we do as a company as Rosa as want
to spend a little bit of time talking
about this is that we help people get
their data into the commons we help them
set up nodes if they want our help doing
so and then we build tools that allow
people to get the data out of the
Commons in any number of different
formats that they want so starting up at
the top we provide a web services layer
basically where you can make queries
into the commons and get information out
into one of you know any number of
different formats that you want out and
that allows many of the nonprofit
organizations and some of our government
agencies that we're working with to
build their own websites right and to
build their own you know interfaces to
the commons we also support the ability
to get your data out into many sort of
standard application formats so k ml
which I just learned today was is now or
soon to be a standard which is very
exciting and esri shapefile format a lot
of the data we deal with is is place
based data so it's it's about we know
where things are in a community so
Geographic interoperability is quite
important but also getting your data out
many of the folks we deal with are
really at
eh they're not highly technical they
don't work with GIS systems at all they
use Excel or some other type of you know
package to data analysis and so we have
to support outputs into those formats
and of course you know we try to keep up
with all the different you know flavors
of RSS and different types of standards
like that that people need access to
what I'm going to be talking about today
is is this specific product that we have
I want to touch on another one that
we've been working on for several years
and it's a project a product called
community catalog it's a very very sort
of simple tool for communities to
collaboratively track assets in their
community and how it's used for example
there's a screenshot here from New
Jersey we're working with the United Way
of New Jersey to help keep track of all
the social service agencies and the
services that they provide throughout
the state so they can do specialized
searches to find their information we
have other folks using it for outdoor
recreation catalogues basically within
their communities and the idea is that
there are several thousand agencies that
are trapped there informations tracked
through that that New Jersey site for
example each one of those agencies can
come in and edit their own information
in a very simple easy way and they're
now then able to have all the
information available to human service
professionals throughout the state it's
something that is a very basic
application but it's it's one that at a
community level when you're dealing with
in the public sector these are the types
of tools that they feel that they don't
have a code access to where there's
consistency of their data across the
community because all the data is stored
in the information Commons no matter how
anyone access the access is the
information and regardless of which tool
they use to access the data they're
always getting the same piece of
information about like for example the
phone number or location of an agency
which is very very important in terms of
referrals what I'm what we're going to
focus on today though is a new product
that we've developed called community
insight and it's a bit more of an
advanced tool it's meant for people who
are experts in their domains who have
some large amount of data that they want
to analyze and understand better and
they may want to see not just their data
but other people's data as well in
context so it's a tool for sharing data
among those experts and we we expect
once it's made public that you know the
gym
public will access it as well and we
know that already that for example in
this in database in which is the site
i'll be talking about today we're
already starting to see scientists
starting to interact for example with
advocates in the conservation science
world in a way that they've not been
able to do before because of the
platform that they have access to so i'm
going to move on now and and talk about
the database in project but i just want
to give you a basic framework of where
we're at in terms of how we're trying to
deal with with this information commons
and get information out of it so the
database in project specifically is a
collaboration actually it started
several years ago the Wilberforce
foundation is a large conservation
science funding foundation based out of
Seattle they have I think 150 different
grantees that they fund every year and
they fund mostly on the science side of
things there they're not necessarily
they find a little bit on the advocacy
side as well but it's really about how
to use science in your advocacy that's
that's their area focus and one of the
problems that they had is that they kept
funding different data storage systems
and different analysis systems for each
of their organizations and it was
getting kind of ridiculous their
organizations weren't collaborating with
each other on their collecting data
overlapping data about similar areas you
know the common problems I think that we
tend to see a lot in the public sector
and the conservation biology Institute
who is a grantee of the Wilberforce
foundation was chosen to sort of work
with us too because they are an
organization and Tasha he'll be speaking
a little bit works for them they're an
organization that helps organizations
grassroots organizations interpret and
understand and the the context of the
science that's being collected and how
can be used in their advocacy work they
do that a lot through GIS applications a
lot of Ezra usage and things like that
but they also have a problem with
delivery of their end product you know
how they get maps to end users for
examples is an issue so the other
problems that we ran into when we
decided okay wouldn't it be great if all
150 of these organizations that
Wilberforce funds use the same system
and everybody just shared their data and
everybody's problems would be solved it
turns out it's you know as we all
probably realize is not that easy it's
very difficult for scientists and
advocates to communicate
one of the dirty little secrets in the
conservation world they tend to speak
completely passed each other we see this
i'm sure in our everyday lives when you
sometimes put engineers and designers
together or other types of people from
different disciplines they speak
different languages and for them there
were no really easy solutions for
publishing searching and visualizing of
the data that they wanted to do in a way
that they wanted to do and scientists
specifically have a concern that their
data would be misused and because of the
way the data had been stored and passed
around in the past basically in other
attempts that have been made they felt
that their data was being misused and
that was a big concern and so the
concept of incentivizing the technology
part of this isn't actually the huge
challenge is incentivizing people to
actually participate in a system like
this and so in as a design challenge for
us it was how do we correct this problem
how do we make build technology that
actually allows for these folks to be
incentivized in a positive way not just
a funder telling them to do something
but actually them wanting to participate
and really what we learned when we
started looking into the issue is that
most the prior solutions that had been
created in this space for the
conservation world specifically they
failed spectacularly millions of dollars
spent on projects and you know all done
nobody used them they turned into ghost
towns and so what I'm going to do is
spend a little time just talking you
through very quickly the process that we
went through expose you a little bit to
the process that we went through to get
to the point where we are now and it
really starts with understanding the
users we went out and interviewed dozens
of people in the conservation science
world both from the advocacy side and
the science side and we started you know
off with the premise that there were a
couple of key user bases there was these
advocates and and we we always create
personas or basically the Holly teal
doesn't actually exist and if she does I
apologize to her now but this person is
not named Paula till it's up here and
basically what we did is we created a
profile based on the aggregate
information that we started collecting
from many of the different people that
we talked to who were conservation
advocates and we looked into what do
they do on a daily basis what are their
motivations you know how is it that we
could get the hollies of the world to
start acting we created some user
scenarios some mock users from erickson
air
where we were just experimenting with
different ideas and we started coming up
with other folks other personas fred is
a staff scientist at a conservation
organization we did the same type of
thing with him and dr. Joe Smith was the
academic you know the one who's doing a
lot of the research that's in the ivory
tower that you know is publish or perish
etc and at this point we ran into a
problem which is that we weren't quite
sure how we could motivate an academic
like dr. Joe Smith to actually unload
some of the data that he had because he
was a treasure trove of information that
a lot of the advocates needed access to
and what happened is when we were
talking to users and this is something
that we really try to focus on in terms
of understanding how people use public
data when we actually started talking to
people about it we discovered a new
person a new persona and so we we gave
her the name dr. Helen riser and
basically it turned out that by
designing our system a little bit appeal
to her she's sort of a maverick academic
if you will somebody who actually likes
to publish and got into the study of
what she's doing in order to help
advocacy work happen so it's not that
just that she likes to publish but she
actually is okay about blogging about
her data for example she's probably the
type of academic that is using google
earth to display their data just as as
one example I have a question which is
fun oh so the question is why didn't dr.
Joe Smith want to share his data
basically publishing is just fine it's
sharing data before publication and even
sometimes after publication because of
the competition that exists in the
academic space um he this persona
specifically exists purely in the
academic space for publishing and grant
money and you know part of the game that
exists and the did subtle difference
between a Helen and a Joe basically is
helen is willing to let go a little bit
like she's willing to put some of her
data out there before it actually maybe
gets published or even peer-reviewed in
in publications she doesn't have tenure
and he does actually in the in the
interviews that we were doing with
people these are there is a breed of
academic that we've in the conservation
so for example she also belongs to the
Society for conservation by all
which is a real organization and and it
was actually through that organization
that we tended to find people like her
just as an example so we were able to
sort of uncover this this type of person
that to be honest none of us thought
existed when we first started we didn't
know that there was somebody other than
a you know the persona of this Joe Joe
fella so basically what we ended up
doing was trying to map all these
different motivations these competing
sometimes and motivations that we found
in this space and this what's
interesting is we've applied this in
several other areas and we found that
this is this is a general trend that's
true this blue space that's here is sort
of where the types of users that we're
building the system for this is who
we're targeting in the beginning with
the system we hope to get them as users
and we've got hell in here and Fred and
what we what we did is we graphed them
on axes so the the x-axis on that side
is low scientific knowledge and over
here is higher scientific knowledge and
then on the y-axis the higher up you go
the more quote unquote objective people
are and I have to put scary quotes
around that just because you know
there's lots of versions of objective
but specifically in the case of
conservation advocacy towards the bottom
on the y-axis our holly has an agenda
right she's out to prove that something
should be stopped that something should
be saved that you know something's going
to happen and she has to convince people
out that direction that to take some
form of action if it's a reporter she
wants an article written about it if
it's the public you know she wants them
to write a letter if it's a lawyer as to
help her in court while she's suing
somebody there's any number of different
sort of motivators and in order to gain
their credibility and once again we
learned this by talking to lots of
holly's she needs to be able to have
access to the information the knowledge
that's in these folks heads ok so I've
now sort of talked about our exploration
in a fairly academic and sort of you
know consultant II kind of a kind of way
in terms of what we did for a client
what I'd like to do is actually
introduce dr. Tasha comment at this
point to talk she's going to help lead
us through most of the rest of the
demonstration I'll drive the computer a
little bit because she's actually at
when I first met Tasha I actually said
to her at the time
you're a Fred and she didn't really
quite get what I was talking about but
now hopefully she does and I wanted just
for you to talk a little bit about
Xavier experiences thanks Josh um yeah
what I want to do really is to try to
move this out of the the personas and
move it into kind of the real problem
again that the conservation field is
facing which is is this inability to get
easy access to information to make
evidence-based decisions essentially so
I fit in between the Fred and Helen
thing and one thing I wanted to add to
your question was I think the Helens of
the world are thinking about applied
problems and so they're realizing that
you need to share information in order
to solve real-world problems whereas
much of the rest of the sort of older
more ivory tower is about solving basic
research questions so I'd like to move
straight into the demo and show how this
site is helping us share information
better connect with other people you
know build links between holly's and
Fred's of the world so let's move right
into the demo sorry ok fred is a staff
scientist at a conservation organization
so for example I've been working for the
past four years at the chief science
team at the Nature Conservancy so I fall
into the Fred Fred group I decided to
leave academics and move towards you
know solving more applied conservation
problems so that's why fred is in the
the staff science role and then Holly is
the campaign manager at a nonprofit
organization that may have a very
specific issue that they're working on
or a specific geography for example okay
so be we're going to get to them in two
seconds just one quick thing just so you
understand where we are in this process
we just finished the software and and to
our client basically a week or so ago so
it's in a private testing phase right
now 10 to 15 users right now will soon
be at 50 to 150 users in May and that's
a point at which if folks in the
audience here are interested perhaps in
joining us in testing the software it's
Tasha's decision decide but I think you
could probably ask her nicely and she
might be interested in that and then
we'll have a public release in July the
idea is to get this out to the public as
quickly as possible but we need to make
sure that the feedback that we're
getting from people you know we're
meeting the actual design need that we
set out in the first place and one of
the comments I just want when we showed
this to some folks at a science
conference last week or two whenever it
was one of the comments we got oh it's
like Flickr for data which for us
actually was kind of interesting as a
reaction it's not exactly that but you
know if that's the you know what what
people thought of it you know kind of
cool okay so I'm going to flip over now
to the web and we will go into a live
demonstration mode and Natasha take it
away okay we've built take the tour
function at the beginning where it'll
it'll kind of lead you through how you
can find the data that you're looking
for so you can search by specific
geographies you can search by keywords
and then then you're able to access
these datasets and visualize them in new
ways so there's many like art my
organization the conservation biology
Institute you know we've recognized this
problem and we've been aggregated data
on websites for a while we have one
called the boreal Information Center for
about forests and Canada but you go on
the website and all you can do is
download stuff so for the for the
Hollies the you know campaign managers
of the world they don't necessarily know
what to do with those type of files and
what and they don't know how to connect
with the people who generated that data
so these tools basically allow you to
map and graph and chart in new ways that
are very intuitive and user-friendly
like myself for example i'm not a GIS
analyst so i often just kind of i'm not
able to use spatial components in the
types of analyses that i'm doing but now
i have a tool where i can easily
visualize just very quickly one of the
key components of how we get people to
participate especially folks who have
data or the holders of data is this
concept of trust basically permanently
attaching you know we call it
tattooing the data basically so that
metadata never gets separated from the
data itself and so that you can always
know when you're looking at a
visualization that somebody's created
where what are the source data sets who
created those source data sites how do I
contact them things like that those are
things that we've learned from talking
to the folks are just exceptionally
important okay so that's the tour
everyone can go look at that if you go
to databases org if you're in the crowd
right now just hold off for a second
while we do the demo and then will you
have to let you at it so I've gone on
and built a series of examples that
hopefully will take you from you're just
looking at raw data sets that are out
there too then looking at analyses so I
think this is another added innovation
feature that scientific organizations
like conservation biology Institute will
spend a lot of time you know building
criteria to help us prioritize certain
areas for conservation actions so we'll
go through a whole series of analyses
but there's not an easy way to
communicate with different groups on
that type of analysis so there's added
value in these data set so I'm going to
walk through an example here where this
is the Tongass National Forest up in
Alaska and we had some data that came
from between pre-1960 roads that were
built for logging so there's a series
I'm going to go through that show that
the development of roads during each
decade there should be they're coming
they're coming okay so you can see I've
built a time sequence of road
development just to visually show the
impact of you know humans on the
landscape just to be clear what Tasha
did she created these maps from scratch
taking the data sets that other people
loaded onto the system and then created
these snapshots of them and and put them
together in a slideshow and a slideshow
has a unique identity and can be shared
around the internet so that you know
somebody could link to it and this is a
live version of that map basically that
you can see the presentation as Tasha
intended to appear and so then people's
analyses can actually stay in the system
too because often other solutions where
you pull the data
and do an analysis on your desktop it's
not adding value to the community at
large so now we're now we're here in the
1990s and you can see the the
development of roads and then lastly i
overlay it on top of that you know the
clear cuts that a lot came along with
those type of road so I think this can
tell it can you know you can use this to
tell a compelling story to your
Congressman you can say look during your
lifetime this has been the change on the
landscape in this area so the next
example is it's a more you you can use
this to build much more complicated
visualizations where your your for the
first time able to take data from a
bunch of different people and graph it
all on one map so here I've laid over or
Jeff our colleague actually built this
one he laid over the oil mines that are
shown here in these red squares and
overlaid that with important fish
bearing streams sea bird nesting
habitats and then in green you can see
two different types of protected lands
the darker green being the highly
protected lands and then kind of going
towards a lower level of protection but
so you can see you can start to bring in
multiple types of data to tell the story
that you're that you're even and the
idea is these this slideshow is just a
quick overview of the data like what I
did was just clicked into it basically
so I can see what Jeff intended when he
created the snapshot that Tasha then
took and put into her slide show to sort
of communicate and we can see the data
sets you know that we're used it in the
visualization styles and all the rest
you you will note of course I hope it's
apparent everyone here we should have
mentioned in the beginning but we are
using the google api to to build these
maps and all these tools we've obviously
added some of our own mojo to it but the
base functionality that we have here um
is coming out of the google api so thank
you to everyone who here that's been
working on it
and one feature that's really amazing
from my perspective is you know if I
find a snapshot where someone's already
interpreted did a problem or generated
an analysis when I when I click on that
I can basically I can't modify their
view of the world but I can save it as
and what gets pulled up with it is all
the data sets so i don't have to then go
search and try to recreate what they've
done and this is our colleagues having
fun alright comments so another option
another feature is this comment and you
can draw an area around if if I know
that you know actually this protected
area actually is in the wrong spot I can
make a comment to someone so it's a way
people can communicate its taking visual
commenting to you know that something
that exists in some systems like Flickr
or whatever you know where you can just
draw a box around things this is
allowing experts or non-experts to
annotate their own visualizations or
other people's anyone who comes to this
snapshot is able to add a visual comment
and we keep track obviously of who does
it and when and we also have other other
forms of commenting that can take place
including ratings and just one quick
comment in terms of the trust issue
these are the types of features that
people tend to like if it for example if
I'm a scientist and I generated one of
these data sets I can see that somebody
created a snapshot using my data set
because of the way that we've built the
system I can go to the snapshot that was
created as a result that's their public
sort of assertion about my data in
comparison to others and maybe I can
draw a little box and say you know what
you missed something here this is this
isn't what I attended or this is what I
intended
is that there are essentially if
somebody else has if there's some of
these visualization are Jeff's
visualization I have I can either
snapshot it which is the visualization
exactly as it is now or I can
essentially do some sort of a live link
to it yes so that changes is
visualization i can say ah but in april
15 actually visualizations are snapshots
in time so Jeff actually can't change
this snap this exact snapshot with a
unique identifier that you know that is
unique what what he can do or what
anyone can come along and do is if I go
to the Action menu up here which is just
a little user interface thing that we
wrote I can go in and click Edit
visualization what that does is it
creates an exact it creates a copy of
Jeff's visualization it close up the
data and it pulls up all the data and I
basically start my visualization session
which will show you in a second exactly
where Jeff left off but what happens is
that when if I make a subsequent product
at about a snapshot of it thats notched
that snapshot will have attached to it
that it's based on this snapshot from
Jeff so once again you have citation
basically built into the system which
once again we're getting some pretty
positive feedback from folks that you
know for once if I put my data out there
I actually get credit for it but that's
one of the big pieces of feedback we're
starting to here already yeah
yes and I'll give a qualified yes that
by the time this goes public I mean it's
a future we're in the process of working
on as we speak but the idea is to have
versioning of of a snapshot the fact
that he will never be able to change his
old snapshot that if that will always
exist but if he went to it and we're
still working out the UI tweaks on this
but basically there will be some sort of
indicator that you're not looking at the
newest version of the snapshot you may
also do that with data sets themselves
because data sets are also immutable in
sort of our world and well in in this
systems world I should actually say we
don't allow changes of data set so that
once again if you've created a
visualization based on somebody's upload
of a data set it can't get changed for
out from under you oh I apologize yes so
the question was asking about yeah
correcting data what if Jeff wanted to
correct this visualization and create a
new version of it basically how would it
then get propagated out to to other
folks ok so we're going to show you one
of the other features so much of it is
around visualizing geographic
information mapping so we also have a
feature where you can you can you can
chart things as well and so you can
interchangeably go from a map to a chart
if that if the data format is comparable
doesn't this is a data set actually that
came in ESRI shapefile format and and
you know we're just allowing people to
flip it from the map visualization to a
chart just so they can see and what
we're showing here is population size is
very basic by state and then you have
there's a added features where you can
adjust the size if you add on another
variable if you want to say well how big
our farms in iowa vs the size in
california so there's some some complex
features in it it's added dimensions the
visualization basically so for example
you can use color and size of the dots
and we're just getting started with the
charting side of it but that allow you
to to you can visualize other dimensions
attributes within the data set and you
can also do this with multiple data sets
but they need to share attribute names
across them and and the mapping across
those is something that further down the
road we look
so that you can actually take two
completely different datasets that may
be about the same thing and describe the
data in different ways and actually link
them together complex visualizations
based on multiple data sets is a big
challenge obviously there's a lot of
issues around identity and all kinds of
other issues that we've we've been
dealing with but we just want to show
you an example of the charting side of
things as well this is an example from
your neighborhood exam it's an analysis
that the conservation biology Institute
did for save the redwoods and so this is
mapping out redwoods by basin and it's
an example as I was mentioning earlier
about showing an analysis so there were
nine different criteria that went into
deciding whether this region was a high
value redwood area is their old growth
there are their roads through it what's
the proximity liked to the roads cross
streams so we set out you know we're
going to do an analysis we're going to
base our priorities on you know this
criteria and so now we have a way to
communicate visually about different
types of priority setting schemes so
basically the darker red ones are high
value redwood conservation areas just a
couple of quick just I'm doing like the
UI notes and I apologize while Tosh is
talking about science which is which is
great but just so you realize we can go
in and I can you know click on this data
set and it'll bring me to the concept in
the information Commons about this data
set and and how we're visualizing it
this is all of the metadata from we as
first past the conservation science
commute identified to us at the fgdc
metadata standard was very important to
them and please don't it's federal
geospatial data something or other I was
for about the last c is for but it's
it's a it's a great it's a standard for
metadata and basically we support all
the attributes of it that so they can be
displayed if there are variables
associated with it and it allows for
scientists people to understand the
history you know you can go in here and
read about everything actually the toxin
actually go in and look at the report
since we suck the
URL in report so it's a sample of the
data typing and things like that realize
that all the all the things that the
snapshots and the datasets and people as
well we could click through and go you
know learn about this guy Brendan ward
and click through Tim you can rate
people you can comment on data sets you
can always just you know once again it's
part of this trying to distribute out
trust so that people can start you know
some of the way they would on rating
products online you can go and you know
start making assertions about the
objects that you find in the system so
the types of questions you can then
because often different conservation
organizations set priorities in
different ways so you could actually use
this tool to look at how you know the
nature conservancy use this area versus
another so there's it's it's the first
time you can really visualize different
types of priority setting schemes and
then you can ask questions bringing in
different data sets so what I wanted to
look at then was okay well if this is
our high priority in darker red here for
redwood habitat well is that area
protected or not already so then I can
go in and search on California protected
area database and so what I've done in
order for that to happen is is Tasha now
is taking somebody else's visualization
actually technically that one was hers
but and taking it a step further I'm
logged in as myself actually it's just
important just to understand you know
that we're all sharing these bits of
information back and forth so we've gone
as Josh to this data set the snapshot
and we can now edit the visuals would
make a copy of it and make some new
query that that we'd like to have and
you were just asking for the California
pad so I'm going to add in another data
set by doing a quick search for it
within the system this is the the first
data set happens to be the one that we
want this is a data set that was put in
by the conservation biology Institute
based on data Tasha correct from the
USGS yes and so now I have the ability
to set up and build the map that I want
to see so I can choose any attribute
from the
system and so we're going to pick one
called gap cat thank you which is it's a
ranking system between you know most
highly protected you know wilderness
area to private lands where people can
do whatever they choose so there's kind
of four main categories so we're going
to look at you know categories below
three which essentially have some level
of protection and what I'm gonna do is
make it you know I can choose how I want
it to look part of the storytelling
aspect of this for a novice user who's
not a map generators they want we heard
this a lot we want the map to look
pretty right I want it to look the way I
want it to look to reflect my you know
sort of opinions so I'm just going to
randomly pick some colors here for the
outline and I'll set the opacity so what
it's going to do just to be clear when
when i click ok I've set up a query of
the system that's looking through an
entire data set that is the California
protected areas database it's going to
only return the shapes that have a gap
cat which is just an attribute in the
system less than less than three and so
I'll run the query by refreshing the map
and so it's just now Tasha can expect
okay so um if like if you also have the
ability to then click on and off between
so if you want to compare so there were
some high-value areas in darker red so
and then if you overlay on the map again
you can see that some of the main focus
already areas of protection overlay
those important habitat areas so there's
all kinds of ways you can bring in
different types of questions that you
might have and it's it's a very flexible
user-friendly tool especially you know i
can i can say that not having been a GIS
analyst in the past it's a it's a whole
new realm that i can go into and then
the last one we wanted to do was a an
example for climate change so which
search would you like climate and that
one on top the the current vegetation
distribution by the way just for the
more expert users one of the one of the
things that we threw in here was the
ability to just immediately download
this the results here this data set as
either an ESRI shapefile or it directly
into KML so if I was to download into
KML right now it would open up Google
Earth and we would see it or if I was to
do as a shapefile would open up ESRI are
you or whatever and and and would allow
me to you know get the data that way
other data formats like that are coming
soon we're just you know we keep adding
more but these are the two most
requested ones but what we're going to
do is visualize it on it within the tool
itself okay so choose class the classes
characteristics so we just broke it down
into really coarse vegetation categories
like forest shrubland savannah desert
just very basic kind of easy to
understand so the light pink is forested
regions currently this is just an
existing vegetation map Savannah's
deserts you can see down near Arizona it
includes there seven different classes
that this shows just the current
current map so yes yeah we have that
right on the very top of the the list
yes I mean right now you can click on it
and i'll say class one but that doesn't
mean anything you have to go into the
metadata where we put class 1 equals for
us plus 2 so yes you're very keenly
pointed out one of these sort of wires
sticking out of that you don't know at
this point yes which is fine we fully
agree right right there um let's see
well sir right so if we if I'm clicking
around on the map right so I'm clicking
on the purple the big purple shape right
and the it's displaying the attribute
that I've told it to display the which
is class we're actually looking at this
was this is something that we in some
user testing that we've done with little
confusing to some folks but I think
we're going to end up putting it back in
where we display all the attributes of
the thing that you're clicking on and
that's just there's also an added thing
that if we're viewing multiple data sets
at the same time right now right now
what it the default behavior is like a
core sample that happens so it'll show
you the values of all the things that
you've clicked on we haven't only be
displaying 1 plus the bay style of
course but that's that's the decision
that was made right now and that's
really this is why the user testing
phase is happening and why we're really
serious about it it's not just you know
we need to see how people are gonna
interact with this and you know what
features they want so if we want to use
this as a tool for talking to people
about the impacts of climate change how
vegetation may shift so what we can do
is if you add a data set and search for
climate again this this one yes don't
add that one so what this is is we went
on and got data off of the global
climate change models and this is the
predicted consequences of doubling of
co2 that would happen by between like
2077 and
90 is it clean 99 yes class did you want
a value of it or just all unique okay
autumn palette on the bottom so what
this did is overlay what the vegetation
would look like with this projected
climate scenario so if you click you
know click between the two layers you
can see you can see the shift so
Savannah lands are going to move down
into where we have some forested regions
we're going to completely lose the
desert section in the southwest so yes
go ahead go ahead rapid data from
another data set also rack what I really
love to do for example you know right
boys I'd like to do let's make
differences show me let's let's pretend
this is a temperature mapping these are
temperatures now temperatures I'd like
to say temperature in this data set for
this point minus the inset thing this
isn't that is the type of feature and
and there's a few others i actually
thought you might be going in a slightly
different oh the question is what what
you would like to see what the
questioner would like to see is show me
create new shapes is correct i want to
paraphrase what you've just said but
show me new shapes based on the change
or the delta between the first data set
and the second data set so show me what
the differences are as either new shapes
or new type of data that gets generated
is that sure i want to be able to
operate rather than just blocking the
data sets on top of each other i'd like
to be able
operations that actually use the data
yes yes and that's one of the feet I'm
sorry a database join yes and so there's
a couple of answers there's a couple of
answers to your question right now we
definitely thought about that and what
we what we decided is that this tool
right now as we built it it is we call
it affectionately GIS light it's
certainly doing a lot more than most GIS
web-based tools can do in terms of you
know pulling out shapes and just you
know doing some query analysis stuff
that we've done along single data set
lines and queries across multiple data
sets is a feature that right now the
answer that Tasha would give if she was
talking to one of the grantees of
wearable farce talking about it is
that's something you'd need to go into
ESRI or some other you know GIS software
for it certainly as a feature that that
we're keeping our ears to the ground on
on what we'd like to do there's other
features along data joining which is the
other comment that was sort of made
about you know how you can take the
results of one data set and for example
use them to you know the concept of
another like show me this data by state
or something like that those are also
areas of research that we're pretty
actively we're very interested in and we
have some ideas for you know solution
space other questions background
yes so the question is yeah thank you so
the question is if somebody does take
this out these data sets if they use the
action button and get it you know
download into ESRI and they do some
analysis based on it I mean they want to
upload it back into the system do we
provide that type of functionality the
answer is yes right now we do we have an
entire section of the site that's the
import tool basically which I'll just
jump into and just show you a little bit
of the idea here is that you can import
any file that's sitting on your your
desktop that that you want and it's at
right now we're supporting specific
formats and and we will be expanding
those formats quite quite a bit over
time but in the beginning right now
we're supporting shaped ESRI shapefile
output geo Tiff's and csv as import
formats to michael i'll say we're kml i
hope is soon on the heels but the idea
is that i can just browse you know to my
desktop or anywhere find a data set
amphibian habitats which I just happen
to have sitting around and its output
you know output from from ESRI is in
shape file format and i'll hit submit
and what it's doing is going and
checking the data and we've actually
worked on a bunch of sort of
user-friendly aspects along here if the
data set that i imported was in the
wrong format or was in some something
that it didn't understand it would
actually try to give some feedback to
the user to say here's how you can
correct this and go back you know try
again basically we don't understand it
but what it did is it automatically took
the xml file that was in the shapefile
the zip file that i just uploaded that
was in the fgdc format and it
pre-populated this data basically
through this process so as we walk
through this this phased process of
importing data you'll see that a lot of
it has already been filled out for me
one of the nice features that for ESRI
and some of the other GIS packages is
they they do attach that XML file as
part of their output which is the
that contains all that f GD c compliant
sort of data so we can go through this
whole process and I won't take up all of
our time right now but and just upload
the data and have it you know go into
the system and part of this process that
and I you'll have to forgive me I'm
sometimes more the sales guy than the
engineer that has actually built it is
either there or suit very soon we'll be
there is to point to the data set that
it's a derivative of but it's up to the
user to do that because we have no
control what they do to that data once
it's outside of you know our system and
we have and so you can basically say
this is based on and point to you do
that same search that we were doing
before and say it's based on this data
that that was in the system you we
couldn't figure out a better way right
now to enforce that because there's no
way to know if it's a new data set that
they're uploading or something that's
you know that's based on something that
we already know about under all
circumstances so I think that just in
terms of timing and respecting
everybody's time it's great because
we've been taking we thought we'd leave
questions the end but we've been getting
them during which is great so what I'd
like to do I think Tasha was that about
it on the demo yeah side of things it's
just to jump very quickly and just sort
of finish up our talk and then we can
take lots more questions if you want
we're here for the duration as until
somebody kicks us out so you know let us
know I just wanted to just as a sort of
wrap up a conclusion of what we've been
talking about you know I don't need to
read sentences to you that are up on the
screen but basically we're really
passionate about public data we are
really passionate not just about the
data itself and the tools that people
use to visualize them but about the the
concept of that data remaining in the
public domain and out and available so
they can be used for to generate better
decisions you know that people can use
it for decision-making or you know
whatever purposes they have and the
information commons we believe is an
architecture that helps us do that it is
built into the DNA of this architecture
that information is public and shared
and out there it helps to prevent some
of the erosion of the public demanded
that we've been seeing and you know this
database insight is the first example of
one of our tools you know on this
community in sight tool that is being
used for the conservation science
community that is really
getting into some pretty deep and large
amounts of data that that are
interesting to a specific community and
we're testing out a lot of things I mean
some of the suggestions we've had here
today and I hope people will continue go
to the database and website send us your
feedback of other features you might
want to see because this is going to
help us develop better tools that will
help people the conservation community
we've already had lots of inquiries from
other communities and economic
development and just many many different
areas of public policy trying you don't
want to use this type of tool that have
lots of distributed shared data sets it
wouldn't be fair if it's ok if
everyone's okay with this we're also
looking for help and I say we and I'm
actually speaking more for the
nonprofit's that we work with but
basically the major categories will let
you read them but basically getting data
into the information comments you know
you at Google obviously and some of the
other folks who may be hearing this talk
are sitting on lots and lots of data and
we would love to see some of that data
flow in a way that is of use to these
organizations that we work with they
need help with the data they need
funding to work with the data and
understand it and also we need help
spreading the word we're a pretty small
company out of Pittsburgh and you know
would love to you work with google maps
for example since we're using your tools
to spread the word about innovative and
cool ways that people can do that and we
do have and we don't have to discuss
them here but a lot of our programmers
and folks have a lot of requests and
features that we'd love to see that we
think would help some of our the folks
who work with both on the map side of
things as well as the charting API that
Google has so that is in fact the end
and I'm more than happy to take any
questions that people have I just want
to thank you all very much for coming
out here today giving us this
opportunity yes
thank you do you have any plans to
somehow connect with already existing
conservation databases like nature serve
or Berkeley natural history museums or
others because they may be less inclined
because they already have a system to
import into yours so I'm wondering if
there's any kind of cross database
joining that could happen where people
could at least search for if they're on
the map and they want you know amphibian
species or something that they can just
kind of tap that also and bring that in
or at least know that it's there so the
there's several answers to that question
yes we've been talking to lots of
different organizations and Tasha you
can talk about the politics side of it
from a technical sort of aspect of
things in order for the data to flow and
be searchable you know we allow geo
extent type searching we allow keyword
searching and different types of
indexing that we do have the data we
need the data to sort of be we need to
get our hands on it a little bit you
know and so we can index across it for
example but we have in actually in the
social services realm we've actually
done a lot of integration with you know
oracle database you know people have
their data stores in oracle or there's
even one that we're working with in
foxpro you know so you know getting out
into other people's data spaces and
trying to help index that data in a way
that our system is you know can make use
of it and I think that intosh can talk
about the politics out of it from the
via from the conservation perspective
but I really feel that a lot of the
systems that have been built in the past
where there are huge data stores if you
talk to the folks who are you know
managing those and and maybe you know
trying to promulgate their usage they're
finding that just having a data store
isn't really enough for this community
specifically and we're finding this a
lot in the public sector there's a lot
of large piles of data sitting out there
and alone and interesting database
structures around them which is which is
great that makes our job a lot easier if
people have done that but the usage in
them and how people actually would use
that information on a broader scale than
perhaps the data was originally intended
for for the one purpose that they've
built that system for that's the
challenge and we're trying to once again
work within the public sector to make it
easy for people to be able to
access to you know this type of system
Tasha I do want to reference you it I
don't know if you have been other
comments on that front we're working
with nature serve I mean it's a little
it's a little tricky when you have you
know groups with business models that
you know they want you to pay for the
information so we have we're very new in
the development of our partner
engagement strategy but absolutely and
because we're starting with a group of
the Wilberforce grantees we're going to
really try to populate really quickly
with the west and all the data we can
get in a really rich geography and a lot
of data sets that really have this added
value on them like there's an analysis
been done and so any ideas other ideas
you might have a would like to talk with
you further about that I have an inverse
version of that question have you
thought about exposing your maps as map
'let's so that other people could mash
them up I'm looking over to Mike because
map lit is specifically a term I've got
her but the idea of any way that we I
mean not just as a general question
there will soon be a P is for example
you know so that people can directly
query into into database in any way that
we can get the data out of the Commons
into whatever visualization format or
system you want is a very good thing
it's part of the model it's exactly what
we want to be so if there are like yes
or the intent is and you know not not
all this is entirely built but the
intent is that on a lot of the the
structures that you see in the site you
can make collections of data sets and
things like that you can expose all that
stuff as RSS feeds right so you can
follow along with that if you want to
those when we were going through the
slideshow with the you know where you
had taken snapshots and kind of embedded
them in the slideshow that embedding
thing is going to be the progenitor of
the feature which is hey I want to embed
you know the clip someplace else right
you know and do that kind of thing right
um you know I think there's going to be
some details to work out about how
exactly it all fits together but yes we
are enthusiastically and
of people doing that so that's the short
answer any other questions mind at the
end so i can see when people are
starting to upload and import their data
that you're going to have a lot of
replicate data right now i get well in
my previous job I got my data from the
u.s. Forest Service the California
Department of Forestry about a dozen of
California or forest or some kind of
vegetation databases and I ended up with
four different parks boundaries all
different and so my question for you is
sometimes people want to be able to
compare sometimes they don't it just
confuses the issue and so I'm wondering
how you're going to address that and
also how you're going to deal with
replica dado if the Park Service wants
to put there's borders in but in
California Department doesn't or does
and then you have to so I'm just
wondering how you're going to address
that so from a policy side of things and
maybe Mike I don't know if you want to
take the technical answer to it but from
the policy side of it the information
Commons as a platform part of the part
of the concept is that you need to allow
conflicting data it's very important
there is no overall agenda there is no
right data you know it's it's right in
the eyes of the beholder basically that
said where we are actively in the
process of working with experts in the
field to sort of publish in an open
marketplace you know which is in the
commons assertions about what is correct
and what isn't and you can decide
whether you believe that or want to you
know subscribe to it or not and a deeper
technical level we've been doing a lot
of work around things like shape fusion
so that you know if you get a park that
you then all sudden get you know along
one boundary because you've got a data
file that is a river you know that
border you know there's one border of
that park as a definition and that order
happens to be higher resolution than the
rest of the shape that you have because
the data model the object model way we
store things we can actually replace you
know create a definitive shape that is
the park as a concept and then start
publishing assertions against it
that is obviously fairly high level or
low level i'm not sure which but you
know it's a pretty complicated operation
to have and for this project we decided
not to tackle it at a first pass but it
is absolutely areas of research that
we've done a bunch of research on and
there's still a ways to go i mean
there's no definitive answer to your
question obviously Mike I don't know if
if I didn't know Kate enough job is this
on yeah yeah so just from a from a
technical perspective I think the the
nearer term answer is to to provide some
simple kind of data fusion data joining
operations that other people were
talking about that lets you kind of you
know merge some things obviously with
geospatial stuff that's more complex and
I think the geospatial fusion is
probably longer term as Josh said we
have some previous research on that but
honestly one of the reasons it doesn't
appear yet in the site is because it
needs I think some more work before it's
it's really ready right that said it's
pretty cool so you know we'd love to do
it and we're enthusiastic about it I
think um if in the nearer term what were
what we're going to try to do is make it
make it easy for people to sort of sort
and filter and and create reputations
around different data sets different
data objects different you know
publishers of data and stuff like that
right yeah popularity that sort of thing
um so hopefully that will let people do
a little bit of the the sorting and the
finding on their own organically but
it's one of those things that kind of um
you know it's a chicken and egg problem
right until we've got enough of the
community built to sort of make that
happen there's you you kind of need to
seed it a bit so that's part of what
Tasha and CBS it's worth noting that for
the software that we build anyways Rosa
every node basically so you know a
community and like database in as an
example of a community in sight
installation if there is others for
example an economic development one that
somebody else does or you know and other
nodes start coming online they have the
ability to share information across
those nodes seamlessly and that's where
you really start running in
the issues of wanting to be able to know
what okay what is the definitive
definite you know what is the definition
of this you know boundary of this area
and so we know we're we're tumbling
quickly towards those issues and and
hopefully we'll be able to address them
soon other questions that's great so
just a quick comment about the earlier
discussion about you know the professor
versus the staff scientist I think and
why the postdoc was a new persona for
you I think the thing that was left out
of that conversation is just where their
career or their level of comfort with
technology Falls and where the
technology is going and how it's changed
over the years and you'll have you know
brilliant professors who use Excel for
everything and then you'll have postdocs
who were starting to say well I know
about these web two point O applications
and we can get it out there and the
professors are in support of that they
just don't know about it or not how to
raise it are uncomfortable with it or
whatever and so I think there's that
which kind of leads into my question how
when you have these different players
these different types of people
importing data how are you going and I
saw that form in there but there's
there's gonna be more to that more to it
how to standardized or how to write I
mean there's going to be ways what
you're going to have to have the data
standardized in some way so that it fits
in with your system the way it's built
and so I'm wondering besides just the
the upload and so I'm wondering how you
know you're gonna deal with that I guess
and also yeah I guess that's I guess
that's my whole question thank you Mike
Tom Tyga well as far as you know I I
feel like maybe there's something
working behind your question that I
didn't quite get I mean yeah
right ok so the technical expertise yeah
so I think right now the so that the the
added part of the question was what if
my mom wants to upload data into the
system right and yeah the import part of
the system is scarier than the rest of
the system and it uses like there's
lingo like wgs84 and fgdc and lots of
fields and stuff like that that are kind
of you know a little bit of a pain you
know um one thing that you can do is you
can upload very sort of simple structure
data like CSV files one of the little
features that fell on the floor that I'd
like to put back in is you know just
putting a farm field where you can cut
and paste something that you copied out
of Excel or whatever in there and it
would parse it out for you right this
appears in some other systems like you
know if you go look at many eyes or
swivel or whatever you know other people
have done things like this I think yeah
that import the import process right now
is very geared to the taste quite
frankly of our partners over here right
because right now they're shouldering
the heavy lifting of getting the kind of
snowball rolling but I don't think we
will have really succeeded until we can
capture a broader spectrum of people who
you know who can do more of that and can
do that sort of lighter weight more
casual uploading um I think this also
oddly enough gets back again to the
question of data joining and data fusion
right so if you're going to upload
something from a CSV file it's not going
to intrinsically have a lot of
geospatial interest to it right but if
you can put a column in the CSV file
that's you know state names or you know
some reference to some other data set
right then you can do that sort of
fusion in and you can you can kind of
attach those you know to another data
set right so how do you want to manage
that while still preserving the autonomy
and independence of the data sets
there's some questions there right I I
would just like to add we also recognize
I mean I came from before I joined a
conservation biology Institute a big NGO
that really does care about sharing data
but no one has time and so you know as
coming in saying oh you should spend
your your valuable time uploading data
to our you know this system we
recognize that that's just never going
to make it to the top of their priority
list so that's why we're really trying
to develop you know funding strategies
and stuff so that we're actually coming
to them and saying okay look we'll
common if you just give us the
information will actually you know be
added value for you that's the data SWAT
team thing yeah thanks everybody for
coming I think we're gonna cut questions
off but please feel free to come up
afterwards and join us for discussion
well thank you all very much in Megan
