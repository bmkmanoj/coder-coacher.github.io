talk we're very pleased to have Deborah
Estrin and her colleagues Jeff / Dana
cuff mark Hanson Jerry King William
Kaiser Michael Hamilton Fabian wag my
star all from UCLA faculty are members
of UCLA SNF Center for embedded
networked sensing which Debra is
founding director of and the Center for
Research on media and performance there
our presentation today is on urban
sensing social networking and the third
thing how sensors and data will dominate
tomorrow's global network please join me
in welcoming Debra estrin and colleagues
from UCLA thank you it's a pleasure to
be here so as we've been finding over
the last several years embedded
networked sensing is revealing the
previously unobservable in many science
applications if you look at the top left
to lower left you'll see a figure of
each of the four science applications
that dominate most of our work to date
seismology terrestrial ecology
environmental sciences in marine biology
and when we look back over these past
several years we've really made our
greatest strides by using multi scale
data and models as a context for our
Institute observations and in network
processing and mobility to achieve
scalability from a perspective of
Communications Energy latency coverage
mobility is really as we've discovered
the only way that we achieved n sensing
by moving sensors through an environment
as opposed to just placing them
statically and in network processing is
essential because by processing data
near the source we not only make the
system last a lot longer instead of
wasting energy on unnecessary
communications but we make the system
far more reactive and interactive so
that elements of the system human and
automated in electronic can actually
adapt to the varying physical inputs
that the system is experiencing so this
brings us to today's topic of
personal social and urban sensing
applications that we anticipate will
exploit the installed based base of
image and acoustic sensors that we all
carry around in our pockets or on our
belts in other words the cell phone
handset but we see it going well beyond
today's largely intentional
conversations and postings that are
enabled by sites like Flickr and life
blog etc to a growth of automated
programmable and adaptive collection of
acoustic and image profiles profiles of
our personal social and urban spaces and
we believe that this will unleash the
power of what is really a very widely
deployed but we believe underutilized
embedded networked sensing capacity so
as I as a sensor network person when I
see a cell phone what I see is a
wireless sensor and I was told not to
use a certain pun yes but invince on or
even though he's not here I mean if you
will this sort of underutilized capacity
you could think of as being sensi at
phone now somebody laughed because i was
told that nobody would get the pun if
they didn't see it in writing see see
you left Teddy at home sensi at phone
anyway what's interesting is that we
really see a lot of overlapping themes
between the science applications that we
have been addressing over the last
several years and this new space of
personal urban and social applications
and one of the most important ones of
those overlapping themes is the crucial
importance of processing the data close
to the sensor source and in this case in
the case of personal urban and social
sensing applications it's critical to do
this sensing and processing the
processing close to the sensor source in
order to address the varied but
persistent needs of individuals to
selectively share these direct
observations of their lives in their
spaces so whereas in embedded networked
sensing for science applications we did
in network processing for scalability
longevity latency in these applications
we need in network processing on node
sing and programmable and adaptive
processing to address those needs for
selective sharing we also see the
persistence of our other themes mobility
in order to achieve coverage of the city
and the challenge of mobility that it
represents for verifiable location
tagging and we continue to see the
absolute importance of viewing and
analyzing these Institute measurements
and observations in the context of
multiscale of multiscale data so as we
found in embedded networked sensing for
the sciences there are many interesting
technical themes and there's a strong
need for designing the software that
runs in these systems really across the
platforms across the embedded platform
that you carry around with you as well
as in the backend servers that support
them so it appears that from the
existing from the existing embedded
networked sensing approaches that a mesh
of our work that has been done in the
context of the sciences really applies
in the context of these applications as
well we see the need for multiscale
sensing an actuation to support ubiquity
in network processing for privacy
analysis and visualization to enable
discovery and that we see emerging a
data-centric architecture that has some
strong analogies to that that has
emerged in the in the sensor network
space so what we'd like to do through
this talk is largely focus on these
personal urban and social applications
but before we do that we want to take a
few minutes to before we launch into the
urban space to look at how science
applications have really been
transformed by this combination of
embedded sensing and GIS integration and
mapping tools I don't know how probably
all of you saw the issue of nature
magazine that came out a few weeks ago
in which Declan Butler did this whole
series on how Google Earth has started
to transform scientific investigation
and so we'll start with Sean launching
into that the power of that integration
that we hope to carry over into this
urban space and then Jeff Burke will
take over and escort us into the city hi
my name is Sean asked am a graduate
student at UC Riverside switch over to
this laptop so give me one sec
so I'm hoping that most of you guys
aren't sick of flying around the world
yet because I a little more to do that
today I work at the James Reserve which
is a part of the University of
California natural reserve system it's
near idyllwild in the San Jacinto
Mountains near Palm Springs and at the
James reserve we have a number of sensor
platforms everything from microclimate
weather stations webcams we have robots
running on high-tension cables taking
transect measurements and all trying to
show you a few of those systems today
and maybe some basic scientific
questions we can answer with these
systems one of the main advantages of
google earth for us is that we can
really customize a lot of our data
visualization to certain audiences we
have K through 12 education we have
birders who enjoy looking at nest boxes
and roosting birds bird feeders and of
course the biologists are using most of
the sensors at the reserve
so fly around a little bit before I
start showing you about the nestbox
system
so we have a system of nest box bird
boxes at the reserve which feature
webcams and sensor measurements one of
the basic questions we're looking at
james observe is why do certain birds
pick certain nest boxes to roost in to
lay eggs in and rear their young and
we're interested in looking across the
board at a lot of different locations to
kind of figure out what's going on what
type of micro climate variations are
leading birds to choose one place over
another so here you can see where it's
snowing like crazy down there right now
so unfortunately most of our stuff is
white blanketed in snow but this bird
box I believe last night had a bird
roosting in it you can see there we can
use google earth to interface more
information about these webcams and also
looking at the sensor measurements you
can see here's a trend line for
temperature over the last 24 hours and
even below zero let's take a look at
that
this is a Java output that we use to
visualize data streams some of the other
interfaces that are connected to Google
Earth include the ability to look at
measurements side by side with a
sequence time sequence of images for
example here to nest boxes over the
period of about a month and you can see
the temperature and humidity
measurements progressing and I think
there's some interesting bird pictures
here that's encouraging or maybe not
well we'll come back to that later um
this is a viola green swallow here at
the bottom and it's not no luck today
sorry about that so anyway so we're
hoping to look at kind of the whole
picture here and see a lot of different
nest boxes at the same time start
answering scientific questions another
question we're looking at is dealing
with water quality and an algal and
bacterial blooms and bodies of water
this is the name o Sandro baduk system
which is monitoring the lake that we
have at the reserve these are buoys that
take measurement values on fluorometry
which is a measure of of chlorophyll in
the water we also have a number of
overlays that are some of which are
generated dynamically here's like a
model of water temperature at the lake
there's a fluorometry measurement we
also have this autonomous robot that
skates around on the lake and takes
measurements all on the transect one
last system to show you really quick
before I pass it off is the cold air
drainage transect characteristic of a
lot of mountain valleys kind of late at
night you'll have a big dumping of
hole there in the middle of the night
this is interesting and important to
look at because a lot of the plants
animals that live in the valley are
really sensitive to minor variations and
climate change and will choose you know
where they live depending on some of
these conditions so here we have a
couple of our transsex we've integrated
some GIS information to this you some
contour lines a little bit for a sec
this is a measure of a slope aspect
which is the direction particular face
of the hill is pointing red being north
and you know moss grows on the north
side of trees in part because there's
less sunshine which kind of influences a
lot of these climate conditions one of
the things that we're doing is taking
all of these point data from these
transects and doing a kind of a spatial
interpolation called the Cregan model
and what that allows us to do is kind of
generate let's go here kind of like a
pseudo animation of how temperature is
changing through time and as Google
Earth improves and maybe has some more
native support for animations you would
be able to look at this cold air
drainage and the temperature flowing
through the valley sort of an animated
animated real-time and one last thing to
show you kind of leading into our urban
sensing applications would be the system
of webcams that we have at the reserve
we have a number of web cams you can
view right in the Google interface and
take a look at what's going on and we
also have an audio feed
that I'll see if I can play in the
background and with this users can have
a quick snapshot of all the webcams that
are on site and quickly take a look at
what's going on unfortunately like I
said for the most part we've been
covered in snow but you can hear you
some birds in the background hopefully
sorry I'm I'm Way over time so I'm going
to pass it back to Deborah a variety of
different ways we have solar panels we
have diesel generator we're off the
power grid so whatever we don't generate
from the Sun we have to burn in diesel
so we had the transition worked out this
at the end I think Shawn would probably
zoom back into a city after looking at
those webcams my name is Jeff Burke I'm
from the center for research in
engineering media and performance which
is in the school of engineering in the
school of theater film and TV at UCLA
and we've been involved in this sort of
inner intersection between art and
technology and now I think at the end
vivillon will talk a little bit about
our engagement with communities but for
about the last seven or eight years and
we've always been interested in sensing
because it implicates people's bodies
and positions and movements in space
with control over media and gets us away
from the keyboard and the mouse as an
interface to media and an interface to
information and so as as sins has made
this interesting transition to from
sensing and natural environments for
scientific purposes to looking at urban
environments for the purposes of
facilitating the communities that are
already there for enabling social
science study and urban planning and
we've been making a sort of similar
transition ourselves that is from
looking at individual artworks in
particular artworks to looking at
platforms that serve groups of people
interested in either expressing
something sharing information or sharing
data basically participating in using
sensing to express or show information
about their environments and so what I'd
like to do is just provide a really
brief transition from what you've seen
about sins and sensing in the scientific
domain to the next four speakers who are
going to talk about sensing in the urban
domain in the domain of communities in
the public sphere and and really that
there's a transition that's going to
happen and is happening from people
capturing moments on their cell phones
and storing moments and uploading
moments to really creating ways of
capturing the rhythms of their lives of
sampling their lives whether it's
photographic or acoustic or these other
types of sensors that that sends is
already using either from mobile
handsets or from devices placed in
environments that we're already moving
through and so in a sense we're
returning back to the physical world a
little bit and the domain experts are
the people who are going to be using
these sensors to sense things about
their lives about their cities about
their communities and Jerry and Mark and
Dana will mention epiphany beta foes the
idea of encountering something for the
first time understanding something for
the first time out of the data that are
coming from these sensing systems and
then I think you'll see a little bit of
a different presentation from fabiana
and also what I'm talking about is a
sort of articulated data flow picking a
way of sensing a city or a way of
looking at a particular community to
expose something that we already know a
little bit about to say this is a rhythm
that I recognized in my life or in my
community and I'm going to actually
construct a way of sensing of learning
more about that and then presenting it
and so I wanted to give just three
spheres of data sharing and in three
simple sort of mundane examples that
hopefully you'll get the more fun
examples in the next the next couple of
talks but so when we say personal social
and urban sensing we're really talking
about different types of data flow for
example in the personal a data stream or
data that I'm I have a lot of stake in
and I'm not necessarily going to share
except with people that I trust a lot so
for example personal health monitoring
this idea that i may have sensors as an
outpatient on my body sharing things
with my healthcare provider in enabling
them to provide better service to me
this is a choice that I make privacy
wise about something that I want to
enable for my health care provider this
is an example of sort of personal data
sharing where the the data centric
architecture that the Debra mentioned at
the beginning would be enabling still
resolution control over how much and
when I share that data but it's
something that's negotiated between me
and somebody that I trust the second is
this social scale of data sharing
typically built around this
idea that I already have an existing
social contract with a group of people
maybe just based on where I live so one
example of that kind of application is
rather than sharing images or tagging
images and posting them to the web and
sharing them based on either group of
people we already know or some shared
set of keywords this idea that a network
that would have intrinsic ability to
verify location and time of when this
data is collected would enable us
actually to share data based on how much
time we spend in particular locations
for example so if I if you think about
Eric Paulus at Intel research uses this
example of familiar strangers in urban
environments where there are people that
I run into in the city when I go on
public transportation day after day that
are comfortable you know that comfort me
knowing that they're there they're
people that I have a connection with but
don't enter my social sphere because of
this continual rhythm of presence where
they're in the same place this idea of a
network that can verify again verify
location and time of when this data is
collected enables this kind of new type
of anonymity but verified anonymity that
says this is somebody that spends a lot
of time in this place therefore maybe
they have some stake in providing
information about it the third is an
example of a much more anonymous and may
be familiar and actually a lot closer to
the scientific application of this data
sharing on an urban ore city scale so
for example Los Angeles is about to do a
giant renovation of a downtown area the
Grand Avenue project and one thing that
that USC did was a center at USC decided
we want to involve the community in
planning for this project or a certain
portion of this project and so they
created tools to allow people to submit
their ideas about this architecture
right and but one of the things that
that community of people didn't have was
design expertise or data they didn't
really have access to information about
data about the city that would enable
them to participate in that design
exercise and sort of an interesting and
engaged way so you could imagine that
for example noise level map mapping
which sounds very mundane but actually
is very connected to quality of life and
people's perception of quality of life
this kind of enabling those type of cyst
offers this idea of a participatory
urban planning tool I think will come
into what the next the next talk is
about where I have anonymous data or I
enable the capture of anonymous data and
then use that to understand the city
that I live in and use that data to
participate in the urban planning
process so these are very quick examples
just to explain what we mean by personal
social and urban sensing and so then the
question is that the third thing and
I've let let the Macintosh muck with my
fonts so I'm sorry for the underscores
and things a little bit just giving over
time so one of the things that you'll
notice about the next series of talks is
they aren't work applications and they
aren't leisure applications so the
typical application of say designing for
efficiency what's the fastest way what's
the best way for us to deliver
entertainment per unit time how do we
enable people to do tasks quickly may
not fit in these type of applications
there closer to social networking there
closer to discovery based applications
that have less to do with the tasks that
I want to complete then my identity then
the place that I am then what I value
and what I feel responsible for and so I
hope that as you go through and listen
to these next set of talks you keep in
mind that what we're trying to figure
out or what are the design frameworks
for these applications if it's not
efficiency and if it's if it's not how
many tasks can I do what will it be and
so I hope that's something that
contextualizes the next set of
presentations for you
so yeah there will be three of us who
are talking which will make it a little
unusual but we'll move in and out i'm
gerry kong i'm at the law school mark
hansen from statistics and danica from
architecture and urban planning our talk
is about common sense let's start
excavators participatory sensing second
is data Commons and third building
places one the first point is to just
show you in which ways people will use
sensors and actually collect new kinds
of data in unexpected ways the second
point is to suggest that these data can
be put into a common pool and there are
important both design and legal
incentive questions that have to be
answered to make sure that the data
Commons flourishes and third is what we
do with the natural data Commons what do
we build on top of it so at the
experiments that we've been doing with a
bottom-up or participatory sensing has
primarily been about lifestyle
individuals the kind of connections
between individuals for atmospheric
effect the next generation of that
peer-to-peer sensing is going to be
about the public sphere about groups of
people about the urban condition and
potentially engage more responsive sets
of sensors and processors and actuators
um so building on some of the science
work that you saw previously in one here
one question that we get oh for the love
of all right nice so one of the
questions we get a fair bit is yeah the
extent to which they're kind of maybe
ground this conversation a little bit
part of what we're talking about here is
people getting involved in that that
sensing or that data collection process
so not have it sort of orchestrated by
necessarily by a James Reserve or by a
science organization but people getting
involved in their own sort of data
collection and you can kind of see the
the will of the people of you wit if you
will to participate in these kinds of
things in in
the in the sense that current
participatory science applications have
a lot of uptake so things like the
Cornell's backyard bird count project
where people are encouraged to report on
the number of different kinds of birds
they see in their backyard or the USGS
is did you feel it site so every time
you see or every time there's an
earthquake you type in and give them
your zip code and as well as a sense of
how strong the earthquake was so people
are and these sort of things get lots
and lots of uptake people are very
willing to share and very willing to
participate the interesting thing for us
I suppose is that people are now I mean
these data are connected to places so
its data connected to a place it's a
rallying point if you will it's a
community building up around around data
the participation though like a lot like
the science applications you saw earlier
the participation is somewhat limited in
the sense that you're only allowed to
upload certain kinds of data the kinds
of visualizations and the computations
that you can do very much frame the
kinds of conclusions you can make about
the data and so organization and access
in a way frames the quest or the
questions that you can ask about her to
determine for you and finally in the
case of either the cornell cornell
university or the usgs there's a central
authority that's saying that these data
are trustworthy or they're doing a
little bit of filtering to make sure
that data aren't sort of bad quality and
their privacy guarantee so that you're
uploading information and they're not
going to broadcast information about you
I would just add to that that it's
fundamentally changing this notion of
distributed information that we now can
locate that and in fact inherently have
that located spatially that for the
longest time we talked about the
internet removing space from something
like community that we have community
without propinquity whereas now though
we might not be next to that community
we know where it is so not only is the
environment rich with information but we
both get gather information and send it
from specific places and documented from
those
so we go from those sort of top-down
science applications that have a lot of
uptake that people are very willing to
participate in to perhaps something
that's a little more bottom up and we
can take inspiration for that kind of
thing from blogs or video logs that that
are having people sort of contribute
data and effect a kind of localized
reporting if you will but it's done in a
very ad hoc kind of emergent way there's
not I mean there's a channel that's
formed to go besides that there's not a
central organization saying give me this
kind of data in this kind of form and so
what you're starting to see are so then
one effect that you're probably all
familiar well if you have to all be
familiar with it are these kind of blogs
and video logs and that sort of Webbie
kind of data that are getting shared and
uploaded and linked but we're also
seeing actual sensor type data of the
sort that maybe is a little closer to to
what the science applications we're
talking about sort of finding its way
into expressive expressive works the
shot the webcam up in the upper right
corner is from a piece by Natalie Jeremy
genco called fade to black which is
basically a set of webcams that are
installed on the top of buildings in
various cities they're facing up and the
idea is that over time the junk in the
air for each of the cities will settle
on these webcams and eventually they
will fade to black but that you could
have a look at this network and get a
sense of what air quality might be like
in the city at that time now it's it's
not calibrated it's not anything like
you know it's not science per se but
you're sharing data in a way and giving
a view of your community this is another
project that has that same feel it was
from a design class that I taught last
spring what in which a couple of
architects went around in a series of
places in Los Angeles and took pointed a
camera at the sky and took six compass
points pictures those are the pictures
on them on the bottom just at the night
sky and then created an intensity map if
you will of the light coming off of Los
Angeles at various parts of the of the
city and what you get is up is a almost
a skyline where the the heights of the
the yellow blob mass represents the
intensity of light in that purty
neighborhoods you see the port glowing
brightly but downtown because we have a
somewhat anemic downtown isn't very
bright at night at all so since I don't
think it takes a lot of work for us to
persuade to you that participatory
sensing with new sensors in a district
avait will actually happen now we have
to turn to the question of how it is
that we select start to collect and join
all these data together and raises both
user interface and later on more legal
liability questions so let's first talk
about user interface and how we design
that infrastructure right so so when you
think about people sharing data now and
not necessarily just sort of web pages
or images or what have you but data
you're sort of moving from well we're
thinking what where do we look to to get
inspiration to help people share that
data or make use of it and so one source
of inspiration from us do you think that
adding sensor data to kind of a
reporting of your life well that takes
you from a blog or video log to maybe a
sensor log which we just call a slog
where people would be contributing data
and having a more rich perhaps view of
their of their of their lives and then
the question is because these sort of
urban applications necessarily involve
sense making in a city or in a place
that that sensing in the city is giving
you well you're you're learning
something about the inhabitants right
people are caught in pictures people are
caught in cameras and and what does in
some cases you want to think about the
confidentiality or questions of
confidentiality come up when people
start sharing data like that so we've
been thinking a little bit about what
the network what what the network can do
to help anonymous or pseudonymous
sharing of information and then we have
to think about what the interfaces might
look like should an interface to data
look a bit like you know a video logger
a souped-up newsreader where you have
subscribed to people's data feeds and
now you want to see what that sort of
main window looks like if it's not video
or is it mapping so here is our sort of
version of the Google Earth application
where we did a little bit of walking
with a just scanning for wireless
networks and plotted out the names of
the various networks that we found on a
bit of
well my neighborhood so it's fountain
our suites are between fountain and
santa monica and you can see lots of
things like if you get your own network
and get away and and you stealin my
you sort of as labels of these so
there's an awareness of our personal
space and are you know you have to guess
which one's marks airport yeah yeah okay
anyway where are we so you know i think
google celebrates and being a company in
which engineering and good engineering
actually drives things but sooner or
later the law gets involved and we
recognize that there are important
incentive questions on whether or not a
data Commons gets created we're familiar
with the Creative Commons conversation
let me talk about at least three
different things privacy property and
tort law and maybe focus on unexpected
connections between law and whether or
not a data Commons will be created the
privacy issues are at least abstractly
well understood and the general question
that has to be asked is will privacy
fears prevent a data Commons from being
collected in the first place I have a
you know the icon there is total
information awareness you might think oh
that's a government project a defunct
government project why is that relevant
to the kind of commercial marketplace
contents we're talking about the
public-private distinction between
government collection and processing of
data and private has more or less
collapsed as you know governments when
they need to will either take it or
subpoena it and so the bright fire wall
that you might actually think exists
between those lines don't exist in
actuality and so the question becomes
whether in network at the node
collection processing ex-ante embedding
of privacy imperatives they are better
and secure than ex post litigation after
the fact privacy is a well-understood
space and we could talk more about in QA
people are interested let's think a
little bit more about property and this
is always in the IP context and one
could ask will lack of property rights
prevent a data Commons that is certainly
the story that is told with intellectual
property in the form of copyright but
copyright laws don't apply to underlying
facts it's only the creative expressions
that you could actually copyright so the
underlying data are not in fact
protected this is what's prompting a lot
of people to call for what people say
our tsui generous database writes like
if you actually collect a lot of data
it's not copyrightable because I did all
this work I should be protected and you
can't access
so people have made the claim that you
must create new property laws to protect
data you can make the argument just the
office will the very existence of
property rights destroy a data Commons
this is consistent with a Creative
Commons model of how we should actually
share information and although people
are familiar with the idea of it took
tragedy of the Commons you should know
that there's a lot of intellectual work
about the tragedy of the anti Commons
the idea is that if you create too many
property rights then in order to
actually get something done create
something create a new invention and or
creative work you need to clear too many
property licenses upstream that were
necessary to produce your invention and
because the transaction costs are too
high you never actually end up creating
anything this is in the conversation for
example patenting expressed sequence tax
tags on DNA streams so what we do about
property and whether we require property
rights or whether we fight against the
concept of property rights will have a
huge impact on whether a flourishing
data Commons is in fact created the
final thing which i think is really the
probably the most interesting at least
from a legal perspective are questions
about liability and whether or not the
possibility of liability could spoil a
nascent or flourishing data Commons
there's lots of ways where you could be
held liable our glee maybe it's
defamation so false statement of fact
that undermines something about a
person's reputation or persons
possessions it could be negligent
uploading of data if you report
something from your sensor that there's
toxics here and it turns out to be in
fact inaccurate and somebody's property
values go down they will want to sue you
what result now most the time they won't
be able to sue you because either they
don't know who you are and more
important you'll be judgment-proof so
who do you go after you go after deep
pocket intermediaries enter Google or
anyone else who might be providing the
actual servers or infrastructure this is
where there are really interesting
unexpected legal reinforcements of the
data Commons that I want to just mention
just briefly there are two things one
arising from the porn Wars section 230
immunity and one arising from political
speech wars that end up substantially
immunizing firms like Google
in actually producing and creating a
data Commons so section 230 immunity
basically says the following was passed
in the 96 Act it was part of the
Communications Decency Act where people
like Ashcroft and the people who form
were really interested in shutting down
pornography it basically says this no
provider or user of an interactive
computer service shall be considered the
publisher or speaker of content provided
by another information content provider
what does that mean long story short if
you're just providing the platform and
somebody else uploads the data even if
you cut it and visualize it and show it
in different ways even annotate it you
will not be considered the author of
that content so even if it's defamatory
you as the intermediary the person who
supports the data Commons won't be held
liable this is not only for defamation
it's also been applied for things as
disturbing as child pornography in terms
of civil tort actions against firms like
America Online or ebay and other kinds
of things so this immunity that was
purchased in section 230 back in the
nineteen ninety-six app to deal with
child to deal pornography has had these
unexpected consequences for protecting
firms like Google America Online and
eBay which we could leverage for the
good the other thing is and the picture
at the very bottom is an actual aerial
shot of Barbra Streisand's house the
California Coastal project was a
nonprofit research project that flew
across the coastline and took pictures
to see what the state of the coastline
looked like Barbra Streisand was deeply
offended thought her privacy was invaded
and sued California like many states had
passed an anti-slapp statute it's
basically to help the little guys who
are protesting big firms like McDonald's
and saying that look if McDonald's sues
you to shut you up and you're trying to
engage in a public conversation then we
will quickly decide whether there's any
merit and if McDonald's loses then they
have to pay your attorneys fees right
it's to protect public conversation
engagement from frivolous litigation
that happens very early they use this
statute and section 230 immunity to win
the case against Barbra Streisand
there's no privacy interest here
moreover Streisand had to cut a hundred
seventy seven thousand dollars in a turn
v's that switches everything little
things like whether or not you have to
pay attorneys fees alters the relative
power between big players and little
players in the prospect of producing a
data Commons so what I want to emphasize
is unintended consequences no one who
passed this statute section 230 no one
who passed anti-slapp statutes thought
that in the end it might help promote
what we're calling the data Commons but
without question they'll be incredibly
critically important elements in
producing a data Commons for firms like
Google so finally we're at the third
stage and we're almost done we want to
try to figure out what goes from here if
people will collect the data if because
of the law and the underlying incentives
personal and political and social people
will contribute to a Commons that
flourishes what will be built on top of
that Commons if its foundation to a
house if it's architecture to a city
what will people build and who will
choose what will people go so if there's
this sense of the conceptual level of
the Commons that it's an ethereal
construct of the multitude of the
community we also know that what
actually gets shaped in that Commons
depends on what the platform or the
infrastructure is that gets built
underneath it and that infrastructure is
going to be policy oriented it'll be
legal and it will certainly be
technological the analogy to an urban
infrastructure is apparent I mean if you
look at say Paris in the 19th century
the effort that it took to rework paris
by Houseman when they needed to open up
the streets to prevent citizen
revolution and to keep military
connections alive was massive and the
destructive destruction to the city was
tremendous the end result may be the
spectacular diagonal slaws cut through
the city but certainly you'd want to
start with a better idea of where you
were going to end if you could similarly
the problems of setting up inadequate
infrastructure was made most apparent to
us in Katrina most recently where
tremendous kinds of devastation happened
because of the inadequate levee system
that same kind of metaphor operates if
we think about it on how we establish
the groundwork for a data Commons and
marks on top of that so this is again a
crowd that knows as well that if we take
an example for example from medical
healthcare I've been teaching a grad
seminar this year that looks at
different organizations and how they
make use of data data and data
processing and I can't with in Los
Angeles we have a nice example of UC
Medical Center which is about half
paperless the Veterans Administration
which is one hundred percent paperless
and then poor cedars-sinai who tried to
mount an electronic medical record and
the whole thing came crumbling down and
the architecture or the comparison here
with an architecture of the city is that
as you all know well sort of organic
database management systems that sort of
you know kind of come up in a sort of a
random way need to be knitted together
and sometimes that communication are
trying to build bring the backend
together can be very difficult which
will prevent you from being able to do
the kinds of things in the context of
health care for example that you assume
could be done like at a hospital be able
to say call up for me all the patients
who have pneumonia and let's look at the
kinds of treatments they received those
sorts of operations are actually very
difficult in while loose UCLA Medical
Center for example because of the way
the fragmented way in which the database
systems have ever risen some of the
kinds of infrastructure that could be
established within the public sphere and
we would say all of this is public even
though some of its consumer driven and
some of its citizen driven some of that
infrastructure is set up by the market
and in part this is a way to for us to
think through well why not just let this
stuff happen naturally why not just let
it emerged from the thousand different
bloggers sloggers and who's ever out
there so that they figure out how to use
Google Earth in a way that locates more
information spatially for example and we
see that happening in the market driven
attitudes about say shopping where a
shopper profiling more customized
information highly customized
information could be sent to particular
kinds of shoppers with
interest that would serve the people
selling the products similarly though
you could imagine something that's like
political shopping that's more citizen
driven where you went into a mall and
you could actually find out if the
clothing you were buying had use child
labor or if a store sold a fur was
engaged in animal rights practices or
whether they use recycled products so I
think there that it's only to say that
there are ways in which a kind of
citizen driven system might also have
filters within it that am I shutting us
off just about to might have some
filters within it that would allow us to
gather information collectively that
might not have a market-driven interest
what if for example we wanted to know
where the majority of accidents happened
in the city could we have our cell
phones program such that every time
squealing brakes were hurt or horns
honked that it would actually send a
charge and blip into a larger data and
that so that we could a great that
information and understand which were
the dangerous intersections in a
particular City one of the reasons I
think it's interesting for us to have
this cross-disciplinary collaboration is
because the ability to cross between say
design and statistics and law and
engineering has yielded some very
provocative results these are some that
are primarily designed driven may junoon
an architect out of boston set up this
white noise white light project at the
athens olympics where as you moved
through a field of light sensors they
moved along with you on rods that were
illuminated at the tip so you could see
traces of people moving through space
though the application in this case is
purely aesthetic you could also imagine
it having some kind of record or memory
of activities in space that might be
useful um the weirdest one here is that
upside-down plastic bag thing which is
actually a giant sculpture in a town
called deutschen hem Netherlands which
is a giant mood ring and as people
answer emotion questions on the internet
that sculpture records them so that when
you drive into town at night you know if
people in that city or angry or loving
or jealous or happy I think one of the
most beautiful ones is the Bloor
building in at the Swiss Expo in which
an entire building was made of fog and
you were to get a raincoat that was
actually called a brain coat which would
be coated with information from you that
you wanted to share with others as you
moved through the space so i might say
you know professor UCLA interested in
design looking for friends with children
under the age of six and my red light
would light up as i passed someone else
who had a similar answer on their
raincoat but clearly conceptual projects
on the other hand allowing us to set new
kinds of community so we wanted to end
with if we sort of given you a sense
that there is kind of a will on the part
of the the generals that's that looks
dangerous to people to share data that
sensors are making are going to make
that kind of a will make that a richer
kind of sharing and then eventually
what's going to happen that the data
Commons starts to exist is people will
start to query that will start to look
for patterns will start to search for
things if you will and will start to
sort of make up stories about their
about their about their environments we
contrast this kind of on the Left we
have two projects that I worked on that
are sort of responding to what you might
think of as collimated news sources the
one on the top is a an installation that
was designed for a news organization in
Manhattan and the one that the bottom
actually uses a feed from google news
that if Marissa Mayer she's not here but
that we set up so that this is a project
on the outside of the new Moscone Center
expansion and we're getting a feed from
google news and reprocessing it and
telling a story from official news
sources but what happens when people
have the ability to kind of create or
make sense of their own their own
environments without having to depend on
the news to tell them what's going on or
the EPA to tell them what's the
edition of their backyard but now you
can put sensors out and and and give and
give a make your own kind of view of it
so then the issue becomes you know what
is interesting in the data who asks the
questions how are the results presented
yeah I we're basically done if google
says do no evil and if it's insipid but
now true larry lessig statement that
says code is law and what you do is
build code then you have to make sure
that you recognize the data Commons you
helped to create will have implications
on what's going to be built on top you
have to think beforehand about how it is
you're going to create a future that you
want your children to live in
hello everyone my name is Fabian bag mr.
I'm a professor in the school of theater
from on TV I actually come from a
completely different part of the
universe than most of my colleagues are
in that leading south campus on or in
disciplines like architecture with with
a different set of parameters standards
are measurements of quality and success
and where I come from which is the world
of the Arts basically I'm just an artist
who has become very interesting with
with computers let's see if i can get
this machine first i think i went to
sleep while you waited I was a joke okay
mmm and when I'm going to be talking to
you about this is a very exciting new
project that we are getting involved
with a UCLA and with the school of
engineering in which we together with a
number of community organizations
throughout Los Angeles are the
California State Parks and segments of
the city of Los Angeles are starting to
think of what can a cultural Civic
computing system be like before and how
should be constructed so that my topping
it has to do a lot with what what are
the possibilities for such a thing as
Civic Civic computing systems and I
don't know if somebody's going to come
up on top with the trajector destroy
couple things
that yeah I see my screen Oh bro father
there we go all right not too bad oh ok
one of the one of the principal concerns
that philosophers of techno okay that's
me now this is somebody switching i use
15-day know okay i will talk about me on
the screen talking to you on the screen
talking to me on the screen all right
somebody can help me I'll get that much
data that we great oh no no one there
one more time I am from Argentina and
I've suffered operation before I know
what's going on here all right let's try
again now that's right
Oh
sorry well huh this isn't were lost or
something I just tested it a second ago
try something else okay we'll try this
one
I'm uh there yeah okay i was about to
start well now we went to throw this
this stuff ah I'm was there again this
wasn't the presentation I was going to
show you what it'll do alright so as
most of you know one of the key concerns
of philosophers of Technology
sociologists of Technology thinkers in
general has to do with the issues of
cultural specificity in relationship to
technological development basically how
do specific cultures express themselves
through technology and how they maintain
the capacity to develop culturally
specific models of identity in the
context of sophisticated technologies
that they cannot produce what happens
when basically just about sixty percent
of all forms of expression around are
generated by technology the hardware or
software which is producing a center of
humanity which happens to be right here
uh I think there's a lot of reason and
justification to be concerned about what
happens when we started bringing
computers down to school scene in the
middle of Nicaragua the middle of Africa
or Asia and teach him to use Photoshop
and stuff like that oh now that is
actually a lot of experience in terms of
previous technologies that three
thousands of years of evolution managed
to maintain enough specificity both
material specificity in the evolution of
the technology and expressive
specificity what's wrong with the
technology that this problem was didn't
seem to be quite quite that important
for example talk about weaving a simple
idea requires technology you go across
the world just about every advanced
culture and even every basic culture has
applied some level of weaving thinking
and weaving technology to expressing
themselves to clothing themselves to
communicating with others and the
technology tends to change a lot even
though the basic premise is the same
and from that those those material
changes what you get is incredible
variety and and consistency and
continuity of culture identity as
expressing both and this was most
important in the machine and then in the
expression you see a lot of people tend
to think that all you need to do is give
computers to people and they will
express themselves not quite the case in
general because what you need is I mean
is the very material specificity of the
technology that somehow needs to reflect
the natural processes of a culture it is
you know what what you can do culturally
with any specific machine he's
definitely embedded in the specificity
of the machine itself another good
example is filmmaking people tend to
forget about this when a decent came up
with this original camera here at the
same time the rumors did something
similar in France and yet because of
probably some cultural assumptions on
the part of the inventors but also some
material limitations the invasions were
radically different while the Edison's
camera was a very big camera that
basically require the building of this
building called the Black Maria at the
time which was basically the first to
deliver build so he had no choice by the
sale of choices he had made in the
invention of of the technology but to
have a static camera bring actors and
shoot them in front of the camera there
you have the birth of the studio system
on the other hand the Lumineers had a
completely different approach they would
have wanted that what they wanted to do
was going around the world and so here
you have their experience and so they
came up with a small camera that was
camera and developer and projector at
the same time and so they went around
the world is in this slide right the
little image right here are taking
images i think is not difficult for film
theories and film historians to trace
from those inventions two very different
schools of expression two very different
forms of culture expressing themselves
through technology program now we come
to the point of so what do we do with
computers I mean there isn't anybody in
Bolivia about to start to invent a
different type of computer and there
isn't anybody in Africa
to do the same and yet of course the
computers are going to get better
there's a lot of work being done in
terms of alternative forms of computing
I mean one of the key aspects of the
computing that we tend to talk about is
this thing about personal computing
right this vision that emerged probably
in the early 60s and it continues
through today and a lot of people trying
to find alternative visions or an
alternative models for that oh you guys
are Google up for example have been
doing a lot of work in terms of social
social computing social computing offers
and some very interesting possibilities
ah you know the creation of share
content users and tarrant ologies
semantic communities and yet somehow you
know is still are within the within the
context of the world within the context
of just language the possibility that
social computing opens 444 users on the
other hand you have community computing
ladies different idea is to put a bunch
of computers in a community center
somewhere and train people to be able to
use them again user-centered design user
empowerment tends to be you know there's
some great projects in philadelphia and
chicago all around ah nindiya they doing
a lot of work like this ah the tends to
be a little they go a little farther
they start putting with machines because
together they there so there's a lot of
either retro engineering or repurposing
of technology and yet I still think it's
not it doesn't go quite deep enough as
to promote the evolution of cultural
identity in the context of computing
then you have a IDs emerging of India
especially in Pakistan right now unfuck
computing the idea is that what you do
is you try to create interfaces that
somehow are reflective of the modes in
which people express themselves move
around the city so body language and
language in general become a lot more
important again a lot of cultural
reflexivity in the content still I you
know my feeling is our starting point
for the project that I'm just about to
tell you about is that if you really
want to have a community
engage a community that is not your
white middle-class Northern California
or even Los Angeles Community do you
engage computing at the level of
empowerment community development and
their possibility to be in control and
change of the wrong world where you need
to go is where we call participative
design there's a lot of traditions of
systems collective design especially
coming off of out of a Scandinavian
Norway and places like that and okay
those are not there sorry weather oh and
so what would we have a set of
opportunities emerging right now as
computers moving to irvine space okay
definitely ah this is happening I think
there's a tremendous need both in
academic environments community
environments and social environments
start thinking about what is the
alternative to the current model of
engineer center design us to get a
community's modding ball again our idea
is that if you're going to set up
computing centers in urban space in
communities you have to involve the
community in the design process it's not
just about bringing the technology in a
wake up a great opportunity right now I
need five more minutes I need five more
minutes ah Los Angeles is going through
an incredible a process of change there
is a lot of that i log about the sort of
what they called the greening of the
river or the revitalization of the Los
Angeles River and it's a great
opportunity to talk about the
relationship between urban systems
computing systems culture and community
dialogue in terms of how do we want
computers to actually work in real space
in terms of some of the things Jeff was
talking about tangible you know one of
the problems of sanchez had
traditionally it's a lack of physicality
in a way a sort of a difficulty in terms
of growing roots into physical space a
difficult to in terms of even knowing
the history to Los Angeles so I let me
close this second
you know what I'm let me just jump ahead
i know you got it out of you
already were so one of the key things
happen in terms of the changes in Los
Angeles is a creation of the new Los
Angeles state historic park which is the
space of 32 acres five blocks from
downtown Los Angeles that was the first
train station of Los Angeles first
Southern Pacific station of the third
she lives that's a place where portola
cam on goose with this mission coming up
in terms of finding places for
dimensions through this field is where
the Santa Madre which was the original
water system for Los Angeles was built
very important probably most important
historical I said acid of Southern
California we have a enter into an
agreement with state parks in terms of
use in this particular space because of
his history and how much the communities
involved in designing it in terms of
creating a what we call cultural a civic
computing system 40 ah it's actually a
probably going to be these are some
historical images of things that went on
exactly on that field again if you look
just carefully this is a los angeles
river in about eighteen seventy four and
this right here is this filled with Tom
Tunney's right here and this is this
gigantic feel that basically where remap
and engineering is going to be able to
work together in terms of creating a
wireless city broad computing system is
fantastic space is really incredible and
I wanted to show you that one more image
out of here so you get a sense of the
potential of the space I don't think
there is any sort of wireless irvine
computing opportunities such as this in
the country right now there you go there
you see they they feel with downtown in
the back there you go this is in the
middle you see the green field again
it's 32 acres chinatown right all right
on one side lincoln heights on the other
so I know Canyon on the other all of
this community so the idea is again to
engage these communities in a long-term
process of dialogue about the role of
computing in terms of the development of
their own identity developing tools for
community empowerment and get them in
the driving seat in terms of
technology set up like that's about it
now you've heard just about everything
from UCLA and we wanted to leave you
with a few minutes for questions and we
finished actually in an hour think so we
there any questions left for the folks
that are here we'd love to answer them
or world
it's a good question whatever i'm not
sure if I I know the answer I know there
are senior country that's Nora not so
much of you it's not an urban sensing
with the country office trousers for
precision agriculture technological lots
of remote sensing so that I think is a
country it's Australia for urban sensing
I'm not sure clearly there's lots of the
use of cell phones and also handed
social networking poison in Japan
tolerance has already referred to in
terms of embedded sensing your
countrymen on City I know that New
Jersey Institute of Technology is doing
stuff on campus that is getting in it
but as far as like an entire city that
has that sort of thing I know tends to
be more smaller locations or in this
case scientific applications that are
smaller in scale in the city is
sorry okay other questions or any okay
okay so thank you very much and I think
everybody's gonna be here if there are
one-on-one questions really love to most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
