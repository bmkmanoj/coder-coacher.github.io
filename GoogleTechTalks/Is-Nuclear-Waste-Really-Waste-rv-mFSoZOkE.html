the energy from thorium website and is a
passionate proponent of using thorium to
cure the words world to energy ills he
was at NASA and the US Army for several
years and now is that as a student PhD
student elect in nuclear engineering
teaching courses there and is working is
the chief nuclear technologist at
Teledyne Brown engineering and he's here
at Google exploring ways to improve the
environment with nuclear energy he's
done a little bunch of analysis recently
on the composition of nuclear waste or
the nuclear resource of spent reactor
fuel and he's going to tell you about
his simulations about What's in waste
how it changes versus time and how there
might be some value to be collected
there Kirk Sorensen thank you thank you
everybody I hope I earned that my name
is Kirk Sorensen like I was saying I'm
here from telling eyebrown Engineering
in Huntsville Alabama and we're very
interested in nuclear energy and its
possibilities for the future we've been
involved in nuclear work for a number of
years and also with the u.s. space
program and we see this as a growth
opportunity and so I have been spending
a number of weeks and months trying to
learn a lot more about well what the
heck is the heck is in spent nuclear
fuel or nuclear waste is that sometimes
called what the heck goes on in a
nuclear reactor when a fission takes
place you have a heavy nuclei uranium
typically and you hit it with a neutron
and it splits into two fission products
so one's kind of bigger and ones kind of
smaller and also several additional
neutrons come off and enable you to
continue the reaction there what's
really significant about this is a
kilogram of fissile material or at least
as much energy is like 13,000 barrels of
oil so this is you know if you remember
nothing else this is why we care this is
why nuclear energy matters is because
it's a very very energy dense way
about producing energy so when you talk
to people about nuclear energy a lot of
times I said okay what about the waste
is that a real problem and you know
what's involved so this is really
getting back to this process why do we
have waste well the reason why nuclear
waste is generated and why it's
radioactive is because the fissile
material has a particular Neutron and
proton balance that keeps it semi-stable
this is why this stuff's been around for
billions and billions of years it's
because it's pretty close to being
stable it's not it's radioactive but
it's pretty close and then if you go and
take this stuff that's at such-and-such
a balance of protons and neutrons about
one point five three to one point five
six and you split it in half all of a
sudden you got two pieces and they
retain that Neutron proton balance but
it's all wrong for how big they are they
want stable Neutron proton ratios of
about 1.25 to 1.46
so with that guys I got too many
neutrons they inherit too many neutrons
from their birth from from when they get
started
and they will go ahead and they will
change this they'll change this
situation by a very simple process
radioactive decay specifically beta
decay and beta decay is how nature takes
care of this imbalance of neutrons and
protons nature will go and turn neutrons
into protons and it will do it by it's a
simple way to think about it I'm sure
this is wrong but yes you can
essentially think about him say you bust
a neutron into two pieces you bust it
into a proton and electron and charge is
conserved and you know nature's happy
the beta particle which is an electronic
gets kicked out of the nucleus and the
proton stays put now if you recall the
electron doesn't hardly weigh anything a
proton on the other hand weighs about
the same amount of neutrons so what beta
decay does is it changes the chemical
composition of a material without
changing its mass so once a fission
product is born it pretty much stays
that whatever mass it is it doesn't it
doesn't change but what it will do is
it'll undergo changes in in its
chemistry it'll undergo changes in what
it which element it is it'll go from
being cesium to being oh shoot no I have
to think what's the next thing on the
periodic table barium or something so
essentially beta decay changes one
element and do their without changing
its mass so the next thing I wondered
about was well okay what do we make out
of nuclear fission if we go and we fish
in a bunch of fissile material and we go
what comes out what do we see and you
kind of see this double hump
distribution this is I'm showing this on
a on a normal plot and then here it is
again on a log plot you kind of see this
double hump distribution and where this
comes from is you got a big piece and
you got a little piece and you think
that vision would split things right in
half but it doesn't it did for whatever
reason again beyond me this is how
things come out and so if you look at on
the periodic table people say okay well
fission makes everything in the periodic
table and and so I got curious and I
wouldn't started looking at that does it
really do that well turns out no it
doesn't really it creates a lot of stuff
on the periodic table but it's a finite
number it creates about about 35
different elements are created through
fission and at different amounts so I
then got really curious about what was
in fission what was being made so I
wrote a simulation and this is the part
I really kind of want to show you guys
and probably spend most of this talk
talking about I'm gonna go about I'm
gonna shoot for going about 20 minutes
no longer so we can have questions
because Chris told me yesterday that
people stopped watching Tech Talk videos
after 10 minutes so I figure 20 were in
one standard deviation we better not
push our luck beyond that okay so I took
a typical light water reactor typical
uranium fuel and I took my computer code
and I burned it I burned it for a
typical amount of time in nuclear terms
this was a thirty nine thousand megawatt
day burn and that's probably a little
bit on the high end of what you'd
normally get out of fields this is kind
of higher performance fuel you know this
is taking advantage of the latest
technologies and then you go and you
essentially drop all this stuff in the
computer and you say okay what's there
now let me talk just really quickly
about radioactivity on what
radioactivity means this is a word that
actually has a rigorous definition
activity is defined as the number of
disintegrations per second so how many
times is something disintegrating let's
say you have two samples and each of
them are disintegrating they're having a
thousand disintegrations a second a
thousand decays both of them have the
same level of radioactivity okay now
what else is really interesting is
because different materials have a
natural what's called a decay constant
have different decay constants
radioactivity and the amount of mass you
have are interchangeable concepts so if
I say I have a sample that
one curie of activity you know exactly
how many grams of whatever it is you've
got as long as you know what the sample
is but those two numbers can be very
different so if I have a sample of
iodine-131 and I have one Curie of IDA
131 and I have one Curie of uranium 238
I go Wow both of these have the same
level of radioactivity but you're gonna
find out that that sample of iodine 131
is like like a microgram and that sample
of uranium 238 is probably like the size
of my car or something like that
so I mean it's just you get very very
different amounts of material so that's
kind of level one the activity
how fast are think how radioactive is
something how fast is something
radioactively decay another rule of
thumb is to remember that and this is
going to sound really obvious but if you
have a nuclei and it's radioactive that
means all of its radioactive there was
there's no fraction of it that's not
radioactive and there's some fraction is
all of it is radioactive and and it will
all decay away because it will decay
into something else it will never become
you'll never have stable uranium 238
because you're in today it will decay
into something else so that kind of
helps us understand if we've got a
sample of something it's going to go
away over time things decay over time
and the more radioactive they are the
faster they decay and the more dangerous
they are the most dangerous
radionuclides are the ones that have the
shortest half-lives
okay that's nothing to to remember - the
longer the half-life the less active it
is typically the less dangerous it is
okay so we show up at our reactor in
this simulation and we come at you know
one day after shutting it down and what
I'm going to take you through is about
30,000 years of decay of this nuclear
material so we're not gonna do anything
- it's gonna watch it we're just gonna
imagine we can just follow for 30,000
years and we're gonna see through we're
gonna see roughly four eras in this in
this fuel the first era is gonna be ran
out lots and lots of radioactivity right
off the bat and then we're going to go
through a period of about ten or twenty
years of moderate radioactivity and then
we're going to drop to a period of lower
radioactivity and then finally all the
fission products are based going to be
gone and then we're going to go into an
era or it's just dominated by that stuff
that didn't burn
the first time okay so I'm gonna try to
start running the simulation and we're
gonna have to follow this the circle
sizes is dictated by the total
radioactivity in this sample and this is
a this is a mega Curie's per metric ton
of uranium so we're gonna follow this
from one day and and this is a log scale
on the bottom as you might imagine so
we're gonna follow it and the first
thing we see is okay most of the
radioactivity is neptunium 239 what's
that well that's that's uranium that's
about to become plutonium which is
potentially future fuel neptunium 239
only has a two-day half-life so it's
going away pretty quick so by about Oh a
month into things we've already moved
out of that first era into the second
era and our radioactivity has fallen by
about a level of four from where we
started so then we start moving into
this area where we see a number of
different fission products and there's
so many it's kind of hard to tell what
the heck is going on so we keep running
the simulation more and more and this
list is going to get smaller and smaller
and smaller
now we're going out to about Oh a year
and now we've got a more manageable set
of stuff to look at one of the things we
see is we see plutonium plutonium 241
which is not an isotope we normally
think a lot about that's actually a more
rare form of plutonium we see promethium
prasadam 'i'm cerium cesium and Berrien
now these two turned out to be related
cesium decays into barium so that's and
keep your eye on those guys because
they're gonna turn out to be important
and then look for another one right here
strontium and yttrium that's another one
that will try to be important but you
can see they're not really the big ones
at a year we've got a lot of other stuff
so let's take it forward a little
further in the future let's take it out
to about oh ten years okay so now we've
dropped to less than a mega Curie we're
about half a mega Curie now and we can
see that as a fraction of our total
radioactivity the plutonium is a whole
lot larger now really you can see
strontium and yttrium are a big chunk
and cesium and barium are another big
chump so I'll take it out a little bit
further I'll take it out to about 20
years now years is a time frame where we
have lots of spent nuclear fuel that's
20 years old that's been sitting in
book fuel pools or dry cast for 20 years
and this is essentially from a radio
from a radioactivity standpoint this is
what it looks like it's a first order
you can say it's really basically got
three main things in it it's got
strontium and you trium and you can
ignore the nutrient because it comes
from strontium so it's got striae 90
it's got cesium 137 and barium 137 M
comes from cesium 137 so that one too
and then the third thing you've got is
the stuff that didn't burn in the
reactor the americium in the plutonium
and you can see the plutonium really
dominates that scenario so then let's
take it out even further further beyond
this and I'm just gonna sort of hit play
and let it go for a minute okay now it's
really moving in a log scale so now
we're taking it out to about a hundred
years okay now most strontium and cesium
have 30-year half-life so at a hundred
years we've gone through three
half-lives of them and now we're down to
about 1/100 the rate no I'm sorry about
one one thousandth the radioactivity we
started with and let's keep following it
further and further into time and we see
strontium and cesium decaying away to by
about three hundred years they're gonna
be essentially going entirely and why
three hundred years well good rule of
thumb is ten half-lives and it's gone so
if you got a 30-year half-life on
strontium and cesium ten to those it's
300 years and then it's gone so by the
time we get to three or 400 years you
can see that the radioactivity problem
essentially is entirely the stuff that
didn't burn everything that did burn is
is pretty much gone and it's the stuff
that didn't burn and then we can let the
sim run out through a couple of thousand
years and it's just shifts between
plutonium and americium without a got a
terribly big difference so here we go
thousands of years I will stop it real
quick at ten thousand years and the
significance of ten thousand years is
the Yucca Mountain repository was
intended for for a ten thousand year
operation or I'm sorry for a ten
thousand year I so when you got ten
thousand years well you got a bunch of
plutonium basically so the reason I
think that's something to know is
plutonium is fuel you know we can burn
it up in reactors and we can make energy
from it putting in a waste stream is is
a good way to the kind
lose track of it over time because all
of these protecting radioisotopes will
burn away okay so and then you take it
out even further and further and further
in the future and and you essentially
end up with a with a mass of plutonium
okay so that's radioactivity and let me
go kind of reset the whole thing again
the next aspect to think about is decay
heat and that's when you have an
activity when you have a disintegration
you release a certain amount of heat and
not all of these guys release the same
amount of heat some release a lot more
than others so in this simulation I've
set it up so that you can go and and you
can switch everything to decay heat
instead of to uh radioactivity and you
can look at how things change and one of
the things that changes you know it's
some broad changes but not super
different so we know that there's a
certain amount of energy that comes from
the decay of radionuclides but then we
want to worry about what's the danger
you know people are scared of radiation
and I think okay what is it about spent
nuclear fuel that could harm me well
there are three kinds of nuclear decay
there's alpha beta and gamma decay and
of those three gamma is by far and away
the most penetrating part of decay
that's really what you have to design
shielding and and cast and so much for
is is gamma decay because gammas
particles will get out of the nuclear
material and you stop with a bunch of
concrete is essentially what we do so I
went and I took activity x decay heat
times the fraction of the material that
was being released as gammas and I found
something that really really surprised
me so let me reset the simulation here
and and show you what I found that it
surprised me so much I'll set it to
gamma power and I'll take it out about
oh about 15 years now here's what I
found that surprised me so much is that
from about five to fifteen years almost
all of this gamma energy is coming off
from two radionuclides one of them is
cesium 134 and the other one
barium-137 em barium-137 em comes from
caesium-137 so if you went into spent
nuclear fuel and you extracted only one
thing one one element cesium so what are
their instead I'm taking this out you
would remove most of the gamma energy
from the spent nuclear fuel and that was
a big surprise to me because I've never
read that before in the literature or
anywhere else I don't maybe I've made a
mistake you know my code is open and you
can certainly go and see if I made a
calculation on there but it seems to
imply to me that we could address spent
nuclear fuel in a very different way
from what we were doing now and
potentially reduce the risk
substantially by taking exactly one
thing out of the spent nuclear fuel and
that is a caesium so kind of an
intriguing result ok so I've showed you
that and I want to jump back and talk
about some of the things that are in
spent nuclear fuel we have a variety of
things now what I showed you is all the
things that were radioactive but most of
the things that show up in spent nuclear
fuel are not radioactive because they're
stabilizing very quickly and there's
essentially uh about six categories in
spent nuclear fuel that I thought were
interesting worth looking at one of them
is high value rapidly stabilizing
fission products and the two of these
that are that are really of interest or
xenon in the edenian of xenon it's a
noble gas and we use it at NASA we use
it in ion engines and you can use it
light bulbs and you can use an
energy-efficient windows well this is
the number one fission product that
comes out of fission and also it's the
very first one to stabilize it
stabilizes in just a few months so you
could go and extract all the xenon from
spent nuclear fuel and it is completely
non radioactive and it would have you
know a fairly substantial amount of mass
this is not this is not you know super
expensive stuff but it's not super cheap
either so this would be kind of the
low-hanging fruit of something that you
could economically recover from spent
nuclear fuels is xenon gas it is not
radioactive at all after a few months it
is completely stabilized it's got a
typical value about $1,200 per kilogram
and so a metric ton of uranium could
have about seventy seven hundred dollars
worth of xenon in us the next most
common fission product is neodymium now
I would
wager to say a number of you have
already this morning had neodymium in
your ears raise your hand if you know
what I'm talking about okay if you've
had little earbud earphones and you're
in your ears today you've had neodymium
in your ears today so this is this is a
great thing because in the 80s we
discovered how to make super-strong
magnets from the edenia so this is the
number two thing that comes out of spent
nuclear fuel and the other great thing
about it is it stabilizes really quickly
to its longest live half-alive only has
an ellipse long as the radio nuclei only
has an 11-day half-life and so wait a
few months and this stuff is is not
radioactive at all so I think it's
interesting that the first two things
out of spent nuclear fuel will have
potential economic value okay then
there's another category of stuff we
might be able to get and these are
high-value medium stabilizing fission
products they have that take about 10 to
15 years to reach a level of no
radioactivity ruthenium rhodium and
palladium all of these are our potential
catalysts and they have much higher
valuations than then neodymium or xenon
ruthenium is worth about $6,300 a
kilogram and rhodium is worth $90,000 a
kilogram and that number fluctuates but
but these are very valuable materials
there's so much ease in catalysts and
other things palladium is also very
valuable although we do have one really
really long-lived radionuclides
palladium but it's got a half-life of
six and a half million years which means
it's radioactivity levels are
exceptionally low we may be able to just
go ahead and live with that and use
palladium I mean it's a very weak beta
emitter and it's really doesn't pose any
radiological risk so so even the
palladium may be able to be recovered at
economic value okay
now ironically some of the most valuable
things in spent nuclear fuel if it could
be reprocessed quickly are the things
that are really radioactive and don't
hang around very long one of them is
molybdenum-99 and that is used in
medical treatments it's used to create
technetium-99 which people ingest and it
gives off gamma ray signature it's very
close to an x-ray so people are able to
use this for diagnostic procedures I was
talking to an elderly crowd a couple of
months ago and I said raise your hand if
you've drunk Tech 99m and I would say
about half the people in the room raised
their hand and said yeah I've drunk it
you know so this is something that we
used to save lives all the time another
one is
1:31 which is used to iodine will bio
concentrate in the thyroid in fact it
represents probably the major hazard in
an inadvertent radiological release from
an accident but it's also used for
medical treatments it doesn't last very
long it has an eight-day half-life so if
you want it you got to get it and use it
pretty quickly
so if we could process spent nuclear
fuel quickly we could actually obtain
some of these materials then there's
also medium lifetime products like
strontium and cesium which have enough
radioactivity to last for a while but
because of that you know I'm thinking
like a NASA guy we could use these for
radioisotope heat sources for deep-space
probes we can also use cesium 134 130
said member that strong gamma power I
talked about we could use that to
irradiate food and to destroy pathogens
food irradiation is a process that does
not induce radiation in food it does not
lead to residual risk but what it will
do is it will destroy some very
difficult pathogens and and enable us to
look at the people who are killed by
e.coli each year so I think it's on the
order of several thousand people die
each year from Ecoline that's something
that we can stop with widespread use of
food irradiation so even these very
radioactive radioisotopes may be
valuable and then there's also the
uranium and the transionic comas okay
I'm running out of time so I'm gonna
jump right to the good stuff okay how
does this all add up and what I did is a
benchmarks I said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission will charge you a dollar per
megawatt hour for every megawatt hour of
electricity you make from nuclear power
so if you've got a nuclear power plant
and you're making electricity you're
paying $1 in a tax and they use that
money the thought was you're gonna use
it to build Yucca Mountain all Yucca
Mountain been canceled so we got twenty
five billion dollars sitting this fund
so I got curious I thought could we make
enough money from the fission products
to pay back that dollar that we're
spending on the waste fund so I I kind
of wrapped and stacked these different
things xenon the Adeem iam I took the
the price per kilogram I took how many
kilograms we could expect from a ton of
uranium and then I hit it with a value
coefficient cuz some of these really
have very very low value and so then I
extracted a value and these are not an
order but you can see some of these have
rather high valuations the number one on
the list was palladium and and I wasn't
sure if I should use a value Co fish
the one there not because of the
Palladium 107 rhodium was also very high
ruthenium so when you go and say which
ones are worth some money those are the
three that rise to the top of the list
so then I assess it as a percentage of
the nuclear waste fee
okay did this does this get to the point
where it would potentially pay back the
money you paid in the fee the answer was
no so if you went and summed all the
fission products you really didn't get
there you got to about mmm you know
maybe a third of the waste fee then if
you drop down and you looked at saying
okay I was going to recover the uranium
which is most of the spent nuclear fuel
that got you to about a quarter of the
fee but the really interesting one in my
mind was the plutonium if you could
recover the plutonium and burn it up for
energy and I just assessed you know
assuming the plutonium was going to be
completely fissioned and the the
electricity was gonna be sold at
such-and-such a kilowatt hour how much
money would I make and you could see
that of all the ones to go and recover
it was the plutonium was the one that
had the best chance of making money in
the future by being burned up in a
reactor for electricity so what I took
from all this was is nuclear waste
really waste well I would say no I don't
think it's waste I think there's a lot
of very useful things in it and I think
in a culture that values the idea of
reduce reuse recycle it behooves us to
look carefully these is there enough
value in the stuff that's in there now
in the way we do nuclear now to recover
the money pay the spent fuel fee it does
not appear that there is enough value
there but there is non-trivial amounts
of value about maybe 40% of your of your
feet on the other hand if you recover
unburned fuel and you go burn it there
is a substantial amount of value in that
so the upshot from all this would seem
to be let's go and take the spent
nuclear fuel and let's go burn up the
stuff that's gonna last for a long time
if we don't burn it and make money
selling the electricity from it so I
hope that's a take away thank you very
much
yes sir
nice presentation thank you I have a
question about the not the price but the
cost of reprocessing purification
there's a there's a presumption that
these these values are vey they're based
on on on pure material and like for
example to put it neodymium-iron-boron
magnets in my ear I want to make sure
that it doesn't have any trace
radioactive elements that are going to
radiate my brain come on so that seems a
logical desire yeah so the cost of
reprocessing boiling nitric acid is just
the beginning then there's a whole
series separation steps that have to
occur have you looked at the the cost of
separating these elements into pure
enough forms that they can be safely
used well that's a very good question
and it's definitely one that underpins
the whole thing here that I wonder about
I mean I don't know it's beyond the
scope of this rather cursory examination
but I I hear what you're saying and in
order to go and extract all 35 fission
products and along with the five or six
your annex and transer annex you're
looking ideally right about at forty
separation steps so if you had a perfect
separation it would be a process that
had 40 separation processes in it that's
probably too many so we can say that is
probably make sense so the next layer is
you go okay what is in the valuation
scheme that may be worth recovering and
that's why I broke some of these out the
easiest one of all to get out and the
one you have the best chance to get the
highest purity is II know because it
will come out of the spent fuel as a gas
it'll come out with Krypton and those
two can be distilled cryogenically from
one another with a high separation
factor so xenon to answer that part of
question has an excellent prospect
neodymium I'm not a lanthanides chemist
and I don't pretend to be I know that
there is some challenges getting that
but neodymium would most likely be
compounded with praseodymium if you look
at neodymium on Wikipedia you find out
that those two took a long time to set
president actually also stabilizes very
quickly so that's kind of on that one so
we're even if you had some residual
president it's probably not going to
represent a real problem for you but you
know all of them into the kind I don't
know and and it all this is a this is a
valuation of which to go and measure
against your processing scheme go okay
by ever processing scheme to cost fifty
nine dollars a kilogram am I gonna make
money doing this mmm maybe not fiber
processing scheme that will do for a
hundred ollars kilogram may be a whole
different story so I think what you've
asked is really the going in question to
the next layer of analysis which is to
say I'm go ahead Chris and it's very
unlikely that you're gonna use boiling
nitric acid you know that was a
technique for extracting plutonium for
making bombs it wasn't designed for this
you'd probably use some kind of electro
separation but yeah nitric acid is
definitely what a lot of people have the
basis of the pure X and the other
aqueous processes yeah whether use today
but what we use today has sort of
dubious economics and and certainly for
fission product recovery it's very
dubious so any other questions okay so
your chart showed the radioactivity of
plutonium dominated after I don't know
fifty years or something yeah yeah it
was four or five orders of magnitude
less than the start so I take it the
embody embodied energy in that plutonium
is different from the radioactive
radioactivity yes yes yeah the the
embodied energy in the plutonium through
fission is is the real value in fact I
mean you didn't even see you rhenium 235
on that and there's still a substantial
amount of uranium 235 and the fuel but
it's radioactivity is so incredibly low
that even after thirty thousand years it
still isn't even show up on our chart
did you do any pie charts that showed
the embodied energy that you could get
out of reprocessing the fuel to use as a
nuclear fuel I didn't do that because I
was primarily interested in the fission
products I knew they have no they have
no additional energy to give me as
through fission although the decay heat
which is a chart that was sort of the
number two I did was to show the decay
heat if you were pulling out like
strontium 90 and cesium you may be
probably not so much season but more
strontium 90 that may be interesting to
you as a radio nuclei for decay heat
purposes and there is a you know modest
amount of decay heating that you could
get especially if you needed a
long-lived heat source in a very remote
environment like we look at for space
probes it could be a really good source
for that so but yeah the most of the the
energy that's in the plutonium through
fission is not being manifested in the
activity so could you give give us a
sense of what the masses of the I guess
the two main things are uranium and
plutonium that can still be used as
nuclear fuel let me throw up a chart I
should have meant understand this this
chart shows composition rather than
radioactivity and you start out with
with fuel that is essentially unburned
at the beginning and you see that it's
about three percent enriched that's all
uranium about three percent u-235 the
rest of it uranium 238 and this shows
the process as that fuel burns up over
about three years in the reactor and
then gives you a snapshot so that bar on
the very end is is essentially
equivalent to the beginning of the
simulation that I showed and let me what
you see is you see the rhenium 235
burning up and you see those fission
products generated and then you see some
plutonium generated from uranium 238 and
then some of that plutonium is also
burning up through fission as well and
it's creating also some of those fission
products and then you see xenon
zirconium the anemia molybdenum you see
those those main fission process oh this
is by mass this is not by radioactivity
by the time you get done your uranium
235 is back at about natural levels of
concentration about 0.7% and you have
roughly 1% of plutonium 239 240 241 the
trans the the so-called transuranics so
that's enough that's not enough to keep
this kind of reactor going but you could
introduce that into another reactor that
would consume that plutonium and I
really think in the long run the thing
to do is to is to burn up that plutonium
and and some of you know my interest in
thorium I think we should burn it up and
make you 233 and run thorium reactors
off it but leaving it in the ground for
a long period of time is it's kind of
just dumb on a number of fronts for I
think it has a long-lived radioactivity
it's radioactivity it's going up very
slowly the other thing too is it has
economic value you know it's it's not a
good thing to leave around so Dan go
ahead there really are three big reasons
why
we haven't pursued reprocessing in this
country at least on the commercial side
one is obviously the security-related
issues extracting this these fissile
materials and all the non-proliferation
aspects of that that be useful for you
to to comment on the second is that for
a long time and I think looking ahead
the economics don't really justify it
the issue with the future of nuclear
power in this country is not the cost of
fuel it's the capital cost of new
reactors all the projections for the
cost of uranium fuel don't have it as a
major factor in the stumbling block that
that exists today for new nuclear
reactors so being able to pull fuel out
of this doesn't seem from an economic
perspective to be all that compelling
then of course there are the
environmental and of our mental side of
this reprocessing as you know well
produces a lot of waste that themselves
then have to be dealt with and have
caused a number of issues that we've had
to to address in least on the nuclear
weapon side of them well let me let me
tackle can I tackle those three make
sure make sure I got these right number
one was was the cost of reprocessing
number number one there are okay I'm
sorry proliferation of reprocessing
number two was the cost of fuel number
three was the cost of reprocessing did
it I'm sorry you're right cost director
okay yeah good point good point okay and
would I be accurate in stating when you
say reprocessing you're talking about
conventional Purex you know nitric acid
aqueous base for processing yeah that's
traditionally what we've used when I say
reprocessing up here I'm literally
talking in the utter abstract I'm
talking about a process where we just
separate things now then you go like
what you asked to the next level go okay
how do you actually do this you know
where the costs involved as Chris is
mentioned I am much more interested in
salt based approaches to reprocessing
because the first thing that they do is
they don't inflate the waste stream like
aqueous based reprocessing approach does
the other thing they let you do is they
let you handle very very radioactive
fuel in a form where it's impervious the
salts are impervious to radiation damage
whereas the aqueous based processes
yet to be very careful with your
solvents like tribe federal fuse PHA and
kerosene as far as not having too much
radioactivity in the fuel
okay so Rath about let's talk about
let's talk about proliferation and
plutonium is really the the question
mark there because our nuclear process
now makes plutonium and for various
reasons we do not separate out the
plutonium and we say okay we're leaving
the spent fuel where it's self
protecting well one of my real surprises
here was to do the analysis and find out
that guess what there's one thing in the
in the fuel that's essentially doing all
that and that's the cesium so as long as
plutonium is chemically separable from
spent nuclear fuel I don't really think
that our approach today is particularly
safer or better than any other approach
because nations around the world pursue
reprocessing kind of irrespective of
what we do so I guess I just I look at
this I say okay how can we go and get a
basic physics e that is much less
susceptible to proliferation in the
first place and that's why I think we
want to get off the plutonium I think
the plutonium is stuff that is a whole
lot more suited for proliferation
purposes in the uranium 233 your aim 233
has a natural built-in barrier against
proliferation the contamination of
uranium 232 so I'm in favor of saying
you know let's move from the kind of
world we have now to the world where the
fission is based on uranium 233 and
thorium that would kill two things we
would get rid of the plutonium inventory
and we would also eliminate the need for
enrichment which are the two main paths
to proliferation purposes would that
would you agree with that you've you've
jumped over a big step which is you're
going to be pulling plutonium out of
vast amounts of nuclear space yeah which
is in and of itself a serious concern I
guess I see that as an inevitable step
that we have to take if we leave it in
the spent fuel indefinitely the fission
products will decay away and you'll have
you'll have essentially plutonium mines
so I kind of see it if we don't do a
plutonium separation step at some point
how can we really address this in the
long run address the existence of the
plutonium in the inventory I mean we
have this amount in our spent fuel now
and it's like do we leave it or do we
get rid
but to get rid of it we need to take it
out and burn it up so that I guess
that's do you at the us decision for
decades has been you don't separate it
on the civilian side and you find an
adequate place to put it underground
geologically dan I just I think in the
long run that's not a good strategy
because eventually we reach a point
where you've got plutonium that doesn't
have any fission product protection
around it and you just go get it so I
think I think we gotta go past that I
mean just my opinion
so the second one was one that that I
think was a really important which he
talked about the capital costs you know
these fuel costs they're really not
significant I had my students do an
exercise a few weeks ago and you realize
the fuel costs even today as poorly as
we use nuclear fuel it's still not very
much it's it's the calculation it was
about one seventh of the cost of the
energy you were going to make so if we
recover this and burn it up it we really
saved a lot of money on probably the
bigger deal is reducing the capital cost
of nuclear reactors how do we do that
well I got a few ideas one of them is is
go to a low-pressure system a system
doesn't require a nine inch thick steel
and big containments and steam turbines
and all that kind of stuff and that's
another talk if you want to watch one of
my older ones you go to a system it has
a lot higher levels of inherent safety
you take on capital costs because
capital costs fundamentally are the
thing the barrier between between here
and in a nuclear future and and Dan is
absolutely right that is the number one
problem and it has to be tackled and
that's why I think in some ways our
nuclear Renaissance now is if it happens
is it's you know I want to see us get
rid of carbon production from fossil
fuels I don't think it's going to happen
with our nuclear technologies now but I
think it can happen with nuclear
technology in general if a better
nuclear technology is employed and even
better if we can use the spent nuclear
fuel as the bridge to getting to that
nuclear future if we can destroy these
long-lived waste products while at the
same time generating material it will
help us get to that I'm the third point
you made was was it cost or sick or the
environmental question okay
the environmental question and that had
to do I think a lot with the aqueous for
processing steps what they tend to do
and I didn't get into it here is they
will inflate the waste stream and
they're designed to extract very high
purity uranium and plutonium primarily
the Purex process is and
else essentially goes into an inflated
waste stream and then it has to be
vitrified it it's a whole lot bigger and
so you start out you go you know if it's
not worth it to pull the uranium
plutonium out then it's really not worth
it to go inflate this waste stream by a
factor of a hundred and then try to turn
around and vitrify in glass and so again
this has to get right back to you want
to look at a reprocessing scheme that
does not inflate the waste stream that's
where I think this the the salt based
reprocessing schemes have the potential
to do that very effectively through
fluorination but it's very different
what we've done before so it's gonna
require research and development okay
any other questions just a question so
in the spent fuel all these isotopes are
mixed together and you're calculating
the decay period and the the what
they've fission into over time does that
is that different whether the chemicals
are in isolation or all mixed together
in other words do they influence oh okay
okay let me back up to what you said you
said as they decay and fission when I
start that simulation we're assuming
fission is over so fission is done and
this is strictly radioactive decay so
nothing else happens and the answer to
your question is it makes absolutely no
difference whatsoever if they are
separated from one another or they're
all together because to a radionuclide
it lives in its own little world it
doesn't see anything doesn't care about
anything there's nothing you can do to
affect radioactive decay rates it's kind
of interesting hg wells actually wrote a
book 100 years ago called the world set
freeware was all based on the idea that
you could change radioactive decay rates
we have never ever figured out how to do
that and there's a little prospect we
will ever figure out how to do it
because it's so fundamental to the
properties of a radio nuclear so it
doesn't matter if we separate them or
have them together everything will
proceed the same so going back to your
simulations have you correlated these
with actual reactors well the code that
was used to run the simulation is called
origin and that's pretty much an
industry standard code to model the
depletion and decay of spent nuclear
fuel so essentially all mike my java
code is just a graphical front-end to
this big stream of data that comes out
of this industry standard code so
they're pretty much using the same code
to get the data i'm just trying to make
it into a prettier
yeah the origin has been validated
against against spent nuclear fuel
extensively you know and then
essentially what I showed you is just a
graphical front-end to this origin code
any other questions all right thank you
so much for your time hope you had a
great time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
