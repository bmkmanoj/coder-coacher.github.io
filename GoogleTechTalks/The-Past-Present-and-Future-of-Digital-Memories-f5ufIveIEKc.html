early in up both our careers yeah and so
he's his interests have been in
collaborative systems and multimedia and
impersonal information management and
currently he's very interested in
digital tools to help us remember and to
share our memories and that's what he's
going to talk to us about today so am
too particularly he has recently been
elected to the chi Academy which is the
set of people who've had distinguished
careers in human-computer interaction in
the cell Steve yeah thanks very much and
if people have questions either outcome
microphone or there's a microphone there
because it's being you know videotape
plus there are people remotely so please
remember to use the mic for any
questions you have okay and I am
actually happy to take questions at any
point so if the logistics get a bit hard
I'll just repeat the question all right
um okay I want to talk about a quite
pervasive vision about what our futures
are going to be like and just to make
some rhetorical points i'm actually
going to slightly misrepresent the main
protagonist but i'm doing that in good
faith because I'm basically trying to
explore some of the consequences of this
particular the vision that they're
proposing so there's been a lot of
interest in a set of papers coming out
of Microsoft by Gordon Bellingham Jamal
who are basically arguing for this so
called my life bits vision and the idea
is quite simple what they're saying is
what would happen if we could save
records of every single piece of
information we touched and every event
that we experienced what we'd have in
consequence is a complete and accurate
digital record of everything it we ever
did or felt or experienced and what
they're doing is they're drawing a
strong contrast with our org
memories and you don't have to reflect
very hard probably all of you had at
least one incident so far today where
you've forgotten something or not done
something so this is highly prevalent
that we get these behaviors which show
that our own wet where memories are
fallible and so this vision is quite
enticing in contrast to that and I'm
going to run through this because it's
kind of standard stuff basically this is
the bigger faster smaller cheaper set of
slides right so it basically says this
is all changing it's getting easier to
store this stuff it's getting cheaper to
store it and move on to just some
back-of-the-envelope calculations about
how plausible all this would be so we
can just do some back-of-the-envelope
calculations which look at how much
speech we consume and how much text we
consume and basically you know if you
think about the storage this is pitiful
right compared with what we've got on a
laptop now is it's about six gig right
that's just speech and text from
television and stuff we read and if you
want to get a bit fancier and you think
about make making kind of style
statements about walking around with
video cameras on your head like these
cyborgs at MIT do then you're still not
looking this is not prohibitive right
this is perfectly possible that we can
imagine video if you videotaped an
entire life that's the speech video this
is this is completely plausible that you
know in a few years time that won't be
prohibitive as an amount of information
that we carry around in store you've
only got to reflect back on those mall
or Moore's Law type curves you got to
think about you know how much you know
you can get a six gig memory stick for
next to nothing now and that would be
prohibited even five years ago and this
is basically what Gordon bells doing
Gordon's the Alpha user and he's just
storing his whole life and it's
interesting actually and I'll come back
to this point Gordon needs two
assistants to help him store his life
right because it's quite effortful to do
all this
but he's not the only person whose
interest in this type of vision there's
a set of very interesting papers come
out of Microsoft they've built a desktop
search tool as far as I understand it
the first cross map across format
desktop search tool there's some
infrastructure tools from MIT those are
kind of generic capture technologies in
in the mobile domain you can tag life
events by location this is very old work
you know it's 10 or 12 years old you can
tag events by visual characteristics you
all know the Microsoft send scam this is
this it's basically a digital camera
that you wear around your neck but it's
actually triggered by your behaviors so
if I was to turn in this room then what
would happen is that the lighting which
is sensed by the camera would change so
a picture would be taken if I was leave
the room you know same thing a picture
would be taken if I was to change my
posture another picture will be taken so
basically what this is doing is laying
down a series of image oriented and
time-stamped events for everything that
you do and there's also people the MIT
people have built ubiquitous speech
caption we have some tools that we've
developed in this domain and then more
specifically there are certain fora like
for example at lectures or meetings
where people have built dedicated tools
which are intended to extract meaningful
events from ubiquitous recording so this
type of technology is for interesting
example interested in extracting action
items from meetings automatically or
decisions from meetings and if people
are interesting that I can talk to them
about that because it's much harder than
it looks okay so that's that's the kind
of background and the press in
particular seems to have gone completely
bonkers about this so they're saying
things like human kind strategy has been
to rely less and less on actually
em bring more and more on being able to
find something when we need it the
Gospels Gutenberg and Google and Here I
am today have all been steps along the
way so your history basically this is
what it's going to be in the future so
what I want to do in this talk is
basically trying to examine some of the
repercussions of this type of technology
and what what might actually happen if
we had these types of archives so the
rest of the talk what I want to do is I
want to talk about some of the problems
with the vision as stated and then I'll
talk about some of the work that we've
been doing recently which is trying to
develop different design principles what
I call computer mediated memory I don't
like the term digital memories for
reasons that will become obvious later
in particular one to make the argument
that these are prosthesis which sit
alongside our organic memory and have to
work with it right and I'll present some
arguments and and systems and data which
which support that perspective then I'll
talk about various systems that we've
been building which are developed
according to these types of principles
and conclude with some future challenges
okay so what I want to start off by
talking about is some experiments that
we've done over the last few years which
have looks at various problems
associated with these types of archives
and the first thing I want to talk about
is that in some sense this type of
archive is invisible to people and I'll
explain what I mean in a minute I'll
also say that talk about some studies
we've done on having people try and find
old pictures which show that they're
considerably less successful then they
might have anticipated at finding
pictures and then it's pretty Rick
Boardman's not here because I could have
taught him about some of the things that
we do when we're trying to organize our
own pim type stuff which are kind of
counterproductive in various ways okay
so I'll talk about some a study that
we've just done which is looking so one
of the things that we're interested in
when we're trying to think about the
design digital mementos was what what in
general
is a good memento right forget about the
digital for a minute what about for an
ordinary person what's a kind of really
major significant object so what we did
was we got a bunch of people who were
they had they were families with
relatively young children because we
thought well these are people are
actually they're sort of they
self-described curators of their
children's lives right so what they're
trying to do is they're trying to build
up an archive of stuff that they can
hand on to their kids right so this is
but you know it's very it's self-aware
when they're doing this so what we did
was we got them to do the equivalent of
a kind of pim tour you know the pim tour
is where you say here's a desktop here's
the users desktop now you have the use
of walk you through it oh these my files
are organized like this you know these
are on my emails or all right so what we
did was we had them do a home tour and
we have them pick around 10 object and
talk about why they pick those objects
and why those objects had mnemonic
significance okay guess how many digital
objects people picked non we're going to
non that's not quite right it's a little
bit low and in but any advances on nom
three okay that's too high the answer is
one okay less than one percent right
sirs so it's one out of about 160
objects that were chosen so this we
found very surprising I say this I mean
you're not surprised I guess I are
primed you for that expectation but we
found this rather surprising because
what we saw when people walking through
these houses is we saw them walking past
computers we saw them walking past racks
of CDs and we saw them you know you know
they've got they've got all their
digital stuff organized in a particular
place they've gotten the machines all
over the house but they're not talking
about digital stuff right
absolutely absolutely so we asked about
all the pictures is that a printout of
something that had been digital and the
answer was most the pictures were things
that were taken that ranelagh now the
next thing to think about is is this
some kind of recency problem right that
the the significant mementos are things
from a long time back so what we did was
we looked at the average age of their
digital archive and we compared it with
the age of the objects that were
selected and rather surprisingly the
physical mementos they pick tend to be
relatively recent so they're kind of
mean age or modal a is around two years
that stuff and that may be because their
parents of young children's they've got
a lot of stuff in there about you know
if you like what we call memories in
progress the other thing is you can say
oh well you know in some sense you know
it's atomic it's in the computer and
it's sort of you know hard to get out
well I guess that's kind of our point in
a sense but what we did see this is a
memory box down here these are very
common right a lot of the things that
people talk about ask these kind of
collections that they've stashed away in
in a kind of secret place and what
people would do in this case is they
might actually say oh hang on and they
walk across one room and they go into
the back of a cupboard pull out a drawer
and they pull this thing out right okay
and so I think that's a fair comparison
in if you're thinking about digital
stuff in terms of its you know that is
clearly not on the surface and viewable
like some of these things I mean you
know you walk into people's living rooms
or whatever and they you say okay and
we'll give me some you know to it let's
talk about mementos and they say well
there's that and that you know so these
are things in full and plain sight but
you know at least I can't remember what
proportion of every you know I said say
most people have got one of these but
these are things that they actually have
to actively you know think about and
retrieve done
photo albums right I don't okay so the
question is how many have we got any oh
we have one okay so okay so so how many
of those things were photo albums of
photo books the proportion I can't
answer that but I can answer in terms of
proportion of photos that was small
compared with what we expected so we
thought the kind of quintessential
memento is the photograph right you know
the wedding photograph though you know
christening photograph the kids you know
whatever some and and what we found was
that photographs I think we're about
twenty percent overall but they weren't
the most popular type of item and most
people had some kind of album but anyway
so so the most striking thing in terms
of the types of objects chosen was that
lots of these things were kind of
strange slightly strange physical
objects right so there's one guy he was
talking about these are shells by the
way I should have explained that every
time this family goes on holiday in the
summer they go down to the beach they
collect a bunch of shells and this these
are labeled by year other examples of
these these kind of interesting objects
were things like 11 guy had his his
father recently died before the kids
were born and so what he done was he got
various object that his dad's and the
kids were using them right like a bunch
of keys that they were using stepladder
another person had you know they she
went and she produced this coffee mug
which is completely unusable because it
was sort of held together by you know
various gluings right and she just saw
this monks 20 years old right so these
are things like you know you actually
need the person there to subjectively
interpret them before you can see they
have any meaning so they're not it's not
just something you can kind of walk up
to and see the point of so photos sorry
I'm digressing a little but photos are
not the most frequent thing that was
picked okay so so that that's things
right and the point about that that
study is that things
digital things weren't selected I mean
we actually designed this study because
what we expected was a good proportion
of things that were pick we're going to
be digital and what we want to do is to
compare the physical and the digital and
we we've since done another study where
we've had them explicitly talk about
their digital memories which if people
are interested I can talk about at the
end okay so let's talk about pictures
now since we had a question about
pictures okay so most of the stuff
that's been done on digital pictures has
been on relatively recent pictures so
there's been some very interesting work
done a lot of it in the UK actually
looking at people retrieving talking
about sharing digital pictures we did
same kind of target population because
we know they're motivated to collect
this stuff and talk about it and we
basically have this kind of set up
interview where we ask them about their
digital archives and you know they come
out with these statements like you know
this is the most important thing in our
house you know the house is burning down
you know we take this out straight away
and then what we did was we talked them
about things that had happened in their
life that were kind of noteworthy or
event worthy because these are things
that people tend to take a picture of
but at this point we said to them we
were really interested in seeing images
of those types of events we haven't told
them the point of the study before now
can we go to your computer and can you
find a picture any picture not just the
best pitch at any picture of a of that
event right so these are named events
for these people they're salient events
for these people so we might say okay
then you know I don't whether you had
some you know fantastic bike ride that
you're really proud of in the last three
years and you talk about that and we'd
say okay them will find me a picture of
the Cross Ohio bike race or whatever it
the great Ohio bike races yeah okay and
Robin also asked some pictures of my
kids there's a UN unpacking his
Christmas stuff right but he's not
bigger than that now okay so we might
say to them find a picture of your first
your child's first day at school okay
next bit of audience participation how
many did they get right
what proportion of correct pictures what
proportion pictures did they find 40
good okay any advance on 40 new you go
for naught you've heard it before have
you it foresees a bit low and it oh well
okay well we will just go with it right
so it's about 61 percent and there these
people it's interesting they're
absolutely guttered right so you get
these kind of reactions these people
they spent all this time taking all
these do all this time invested in
taking all these kind of memories and
they find that they can't retrieve these
things so what we did was we probed a
little bit more to try and find out the
reasons for this and then what you find
is that basically the practice of
digital picture taking has just
completely transformed in the last 10
years and in a sense people's
organizational methods have not caught
up with it because we can't do search on
this stuff right well maybe you're going
to tell me we really can but it would be
rather surprised if somebody wants dummy
you can do search on this kind of stuff
so what's happened is people have
shifted from you know you think about
the old days of the physical roles you
know it's three to five rolls a year
kind of thing all right so I'm whether
that's 36 are so so that's the kind of
numbers we're looking at these people
and it's it's quite hard to get an
accurate estimate for reasons I'll go
into in a minute but you know we're
talking about you know around five
thousand pictures on average which I
felt was low right you know what I know
people who've got 20,000 digital
pictures so one of the promises you've
just got too much stuff the other
problem is that it's extremely poorly
organized right so here's a typical sat
night you're probably all going to tell
me that you're really organized with
your pictures right that's normally what
people do well I'll tell you what
happens with these users is they're just
about to go away somewhere on holiday on
vacation right and they suddenly
remember the cameras full so what they
do is they pull the stick out you know
and let's hope it's not an eight gig
stick
all right they pull the stick out and
they put it in the computer while
they're still packing and they said okay
whatever the whatever the computer wants
to call that folder that's what it's
going to be right and it may have and of
course we don't take one sticks worth at
an event what happens is that there was
a mixed event inside a particular folder
so you get you get this kind of bizarre
and whether you can read this but here's
an example of one of our users but you
get this mixture of visa these are kind
of computer define indices right so that
those are date and then we've got
semantics in here family and friends
we've got particular events London to
Brighton as a bike race big theme here
Robin and then we've got kind of mixed
ones which are placed Chatsworth an
event okay so so and the other problem
is that people falsely believed that
because it's it was their stuff and I've
actually had a discussion with my wife
in the last two days about this
particular who asserted quite
confidently and I proved her wrong
unusually the that she would be able to
find anything right and and that the
thing is that we are used to dealing
with much smaller collections paper
collections that you know where it's an
order of magnitude smaller and people
just believe falsely that they will be
able to find this because it's their
stuff and they remember the event in
some sense right but the you know the
reality is that that's not what happens
and here's that you've probably read
this you know so so these people were in
it you know we actually had to debrief
them in this expert we had to sort of
say to them it's okay you can't for
honestly I mean you can't find your
stuff but we've talked about 15 other
people in that in exactly the same
situation right
okay so so so then let just then the
other thing is that we sometimes do
things with this so this is more kind of
work oriented information but you see
the same kind of pattern we sometimes
engage in behave organizational
behaviour which turn out to be
counterproductive so you know you
probably all know this kind of stuff
right people don't use web bookmarks but
they still like to make a lot and they
like to organize them a lot but if you
look at the most frequent way that
people get back to stuff right ignoring
the bag right well we know backs a
problem with post data but we won't get
into this right but the most frequent
way to retrieve stuff is not fire
bookmarks right there are other ways
that people used to do that but people
are still kind of religiously
constructing quite arcane structures
around bookmarks so I don't know how you
actually do the cost-benefit analysis
here right I think that's an interesting
question for you know research is to say
well if it's really really important and
I invested this amount of time and it
you know is is that time worth spending
I don't know exactly how that analysis
should go but certainly is the case that
a lot of the things we do don't seem to
be productive and I've done work in the
past which has looked at folder
organizations in email and what you find
is that you know and other people
replicated this within the last few
years that you know basically a
significant proportion of your folders
aren't really doing anything functional
for you right because you really want a
folder to contain some reasonable number
let's say 1015 unaware the exact number
is but certainly not to because you know
one level it just contain one all you've
done is given you what yourself one
extra thing to remember right when
you're actually trying to file stuff
okay and what we found was more folders
mail more fail folders so the determine
psychology is meta cognition and that
what this means is that we engage in
effort we don't understand if you like
how our tools are working so we engage
in efforts that in this case aren't
necessarily that productive okay
let's talk a little bit about desktop
search so sue do net dumais and ed
cultural have written a couple of papers
where they're basically whether
basically starting to argue that PIM
personal information management is a
problem which is just going to disappear
right because we'll be able to search
for stuff so we've just done a study
with around seven hundred users where
we've looked at four different desktop
search engines and the question we've
been asking is how often do people use
desktop search to find stuff okay any
estimates 10 all right yep any advance
on 10 have you done the study okay yeah
okay so it's right so it's it's it's
it's four to 16 this is compared with
navigation the difference between that
is people are using shortcuts and and
stuff like that and putting stuff on the
desktop but what we found was which I
found very surprised especially for the
apple stuff is that we've got Sherlock
and spotlight and I know how much our
Apple investors in improving the search
engine we've got no difference in the
percentage of searches based on that
what we saw was with google desktop we
saw so we did a longitudinal study where
we had users people using it for a year
what we saw was initial increased around
six months it went up to about if I'm
remembering correctly went up to about
sixteen percent and then it dropped in
the latter half of the year it so it's
come down to about eight or nine percent
there and that's comparable with the
windows dog right which is you know as
we know i mean it's it's slow and it
doesn't do cross format search and this
is the reason right when you actually
talk to users so what we are what we did
was we did a series of interviews with
looking at the instances of we're sorry
trying to analyze the cases where search
was used its people navigate when they
can remember where stuff is
most of the stuff people are trying to
find is relatively recent rights listen
this isn't to say that search is you
know a total waste of time it's just it
has its place but it is not if you like
the universal solution to pin because
what people are doing in the pim context
is their browsing for information okay
so to sum up the kind of negative part
of the talk right it seems like from a
variety of sources that we've been you
know a realistic allotment there it is
okay so attempts to just create an
archive are not necessarily a solution
because we can see these different
problems here the archives invisible is
inaccessible people sometimes engage in
counterproductive organization and
search is not the total solution right I
mean as I say it has it has a part to
play in there but it's not it's not I
mean particularly if you think about
technology like pictures it's not going
to solve those unfortunate people's
search for pictures okay so what are now
wants to do is I want to talk about some
systems that we've been building a
Sheffield and I want to make I want to
think a little bit more about the kind
of design principles that we could start
using for designing memory repositories
complete computer mediated memory
repositories that people might actually
systematically use and I want to talk
about two approaches to this the first
I've already alluded to is we should
think about how these things sit
alongside ordinary human memory so we
just think not about replacing which
seems to be the view that's a loss of
these implicitly a lot of these visions
espouse we should think about trying to
extend or sit alongside the second thing
we need to think about is if we're
collecting a lot of these types of
events in some kind of event stream we
need to think about methods that we can
actually use for privileges and choosing
and highlighting certain records because
what you see in the physical realm is a
lot of this stuff that's really valuable
to people is they've actually repeatedly
kind of iterated around and pros and
select
third and the chosen things from among
the you know countless things you
encounter on a daily basis that they're
actually selecting and privileged in
particular things okay so I want to talk
about a study that we did which was
looking at this notion that these types
of organic memories are just substitutes
for what goes on inside our head and one
of the assumptions behind a lot of this
stuff is well you know you've got this
perfect repository that's something
you're always going to use well you know
you sort of think about it for a few
seconds and somebody says to you well
where do you live you don't say hmm just
get on the PDA to answer that one or you
know I'll just get the Sat Nav out and
you know work out exactly where I do
live right so it's clear that we have
organic memories and there are many
occasions it's more efficient to use
them of course there are other occasions
as we all know from the catalyst yellow
sticky experience the lots of times when
we actually forget stuff and we do have
to use these time these types of devices
so what this study was trying to do was
to look at what the trade-offs are for
people when people actually choose to
use their organic memories and when they
choose to use these prosthesis and we
asked questions which are things like
what are the benefits of using a
prosthetic computer mediated memory
compared with organic memory perceptions
I mean so one of the things that we
haven't seen discussed is people's
impressions of how good their own memory
right because you know we all know this
situation where you know if you're in a
couple you know couples do this behavior
say well don't ask me ask that person
about that that there the memory person
for that kind of thing right so people
have an idea about the quality of their
own memories in relation to memory
source and they will use their will
exploit those sources appropriately the
last thing we're looking at was the
device characteristics and asking how
does use of the prosthesis depend on the
properties of that memory prosthesis so
what we did was a kind of lab type study
our great thank you
sorry don't even see this damn thing
okay no I don't ok so we give people
memory problems and we look and see
whether or not they use their own heads
this old-fashioned prosthetic device
called pen and paper you've probably
heard of it dictaphone which is a
verbatim recording of a conversation for
example an advice what we built called
Chitty chatty chatty chatty works like
your notebook there except it's
recording speech if you point to one of
your notes it'll retrieve the speech
that's associated with that note so it's
just time aligned speech so if you have
the experience which we all have which
is what did that know me then you can
just basically click on the note until
begin playing back the speech so I'm not
going to show you a demo there but so
what we're interested in is various kind
of global properties of the devices and
how that affects people's retrieval
performance and whether or not they
choose to use these devices so what we
can say about organic memory is it may
not be very efficient sorry it may not
be very accurate but it's pretty quick
in general compared with looking for
something in a dictaphone for example so
dictaphone is accurate but it's bringing
efficient to get information out of it
pen and paper is quite sufficient to
scan it may not be accurate because you
might miss elements of the conversation
and if people are interested in
note-taking strategies and I can talk
about a lot more about what people do
using these types of devices the device
we built the Chitty chatty we hoped was
both accurate because it's got the
verbatim record behind the notes but
it's also pretty efficient because you
can scan you notes quite quickly click
on a note and retrieve the underlying
speech ok so i won't go through the
exact the total designing the experiment
but here are some of it so basically
what we find is as you might expect that
if you give people a memory prosthesis
they do better with that than with their
own memory all right and that's their
impressions this is their real behavior
ok but here's a thing
right if people use those types of
devices they're less efficient right
what we can discuss that people are
interested in that but anyway so you've
got something that's better but it's
more time consuming to use and then so
then we look and see how those things
trade off this is the Chitty chatty
right so this is something that's both
efficient and accurate and people are
more likely to use that than something
that's just accurate or something that's
just efficient right and it doesn't look
like it I'm not sure what happened to
the error bars but actually what was
interesting was that people are more
likely to use pen and paper which is
inaccurate than something that's
accurate right so efficiency is trading
off with accuracy here all right so
we've kind of thing about design
properties of devices then we have to
think about these types of
characteristics okay one more thing the
other thing we ask people while we ask
people for their confidence that they
would be able to remember stuff unaided
all right so we asked them about the
quality their organic memory for a
particular so we showed them a question
we're asking them about something we
told them then we said do you think
you'll be able to remember that unaided
and then we they gave us a response to
that and then we look to what device
they use what it turns out is that your
user device is related to your
confidence and this is fairly obvious
but I've not seen it said anywhere in
this literature right so if you're if
you are very confident you're not going
to use a an organic memory you're not
going to use a prosthetic memory device
right if you think you can remember you
don't use such a device okay so to sum
up these types of studies you can't
assume as these people have done that
the memory of a prosthetic device will
always be used it's it's use is going to
be affected by how good the user thinks
their memory for that information will
be unaided and then various properties
of the device including for example it's
efficiently and its accuracy and also
another thing which haven't had time to
talk about is you know obviously we ran
these studies at different intervals as
the persons are
own memory decays they're more likely to
use the device in various ways all right
it also accounts for why you sometimes
can't understand your notes after a
month but I I can solve that one for you
right back so anyway said the point
about these types of studies are that
you can build these interesting devices
but they show you can work out some of
the properties that the devices ought to
have right if they're going to be used
and some of the significant
characteristics that they should have
okay so I want to talk now a little bit
more about how we might start thinking
of abstracting event significant events
from this stream of things that we're
recording using these two two types of
technologies the these types of
technologies and I want to I want to
talk about a theory of memory advocated
by John Anderson and the basic argument
here is it's not like we've got a box in
our head that's got you know short-term
memory and long-term memory the argument
he was making was that memory is
functional right so it's a biological
argument it says we remember the things
that relate to the distributional
properties of events in our environment
so let's say it in a different way the
most likely predictor of the New York
Times headline tomorrow is the New York
Times headline today so that's say
events in the world cluster things that
have just happened are more likely to
happen again plus things so things that
are very frequent are more likely to
happen again and things they're very
recent are more likely to happen again
and those are properties of the
environment and they come out as being
things like properties of memory as well
so we're trying to use this type of
information in our systems to try and
please select particular events that are
likely to be significant to people so
let's talk about how we might actually
do this type of adaptive selection on
all these things that people are
experiencing so you can start thinking
about having attention based accounts
for pre-selecting events so we can pick
events and privilege events
when those are things that people orient
to all right so we're logging a lot of
behavior about people one way to think
about that note taking application is
the person has attended two parts of the
speech stream we know which parts the
speech stream they've attended to and so
privileged those by taking notes so we
can see that those are parts of speech
stream that we want to remember there's
a kind of naive theory of photography as
well right so what you say is I'm going
to the wedding out of all the things I'm
experiencing today this is likely to be
something that I'm going to remember
I'll attend to it I'll take some
pictures we want to use those as indices
about things that I want to retrieve in
the future and we can do the same thing
about attention after the event so we
can say if you repeatedly access
information about something then that's
something as well that you want to
privilege right because the fact is
you've kept on looking at it so that's
something that we should make to be more
important the other thing which I
probably won't have time to talk about
is that we can actually do analysis of
event structure regardlessly uses
behavior in terms of its likelihood and
frequency just using IR type methods so
we can basically say we can convert you
know in these recording situations we
can come for example convert the speech
into text and then we can profile that
just in terms of things like I our
metrics to look at which we're very
important which were frequent terms
which are infrequent in the rest of the
language right so we can do similar
things to mantic lee 22 privilege
particular events automatically okay so
so here are some systems that you know
I've mentioned two systems what I'm
running a series of experiments with my
students in Sheffield where students get
devices which are like digital notebooks
they listen to the lecture I record the
lecture it's a podcast but we built
indices into that lecture based on user
behaviors so in this kind of context if
I had my druthers you too would have a
digital device to be writing you notes
those notes would become public and
people use those as an index back into
whatever it is that I've said the other
thing we do is we give them a method to
take pictures so again you know I don't
know whether you've noticed this this
seems very prevalent in conferences now
right people standing up taking a
picture instead of taking notes of a
slide by the way it's not as good as
taking notes I have evidence for that
people take it picture but that's an
index into you know that event or that
memory so what we do is we give them
these types of devices and so astute
here some digital notes what you can do
as you could with the Chitty chatty is
just click on a particular note if you
can't and then you'll be able to hear
what I said about a particular topic
after the event so we've run some course
evaluations I'm not going to go through
the details real but what we can show is
that students who are trying to retrieve
course materials and quizzes do better
if they have these types of tools then
when they have you know just the slides
just the standard course handout
material this is to scare the students
basically this shows the what they
always say it oh now ever since recorded
do we need to come to lectures and the
answer is yes you do you won't do as
well but anyway so for those of you who
are listening to this after the event
you're not going to do as well okay so
what we're looking at now is trying to
extend this the obvious extension this
type of thing is to social indexing
right so you think about this type of
setting the problem with note-taking is
that you try and do two tasks at once
right you're trying to think about what
is he saying with that strange accent
and at the same time should I write a
note of that so one of the ways that you
can counteract this is you can actually
have social indices which is multiple
people are taking notes at the same time
and we can combine these types of notes
what we're doing is we're looking at
trying to use social information at
retrieval so here's some example of
here's an example of social information
retrieval here's a lecture and what we
do is every time somebody retrieve
somebody access accesses a part of the
lecture using one of those indices
you click on an index you get the speech
every time some of the access is one of
those we make it bigger alright so what
you're doing what this is popularity
basically so what we're doing is with
popularizing different parts of the
lecture using this type of information
and we can do the same thing using both
color and bolding on the notes as well
so it would be though bits of your notes
that you access most frequently get
bolder okay so here are some results
just collect this within the last couple
of weeks so we give people choices they
can use a social versions of the system
that have these kind of social feedback
incorporated versus the a social number
a good term for it but basically these
are individual notes there's no social
information in there what uses this is a
much more popular system to use and also
what we looked at was kind of within a
particular lecture if somebody comes in
and they're doing a retrieval are they
more likely to pick something that's
already been picked I is social index
versus something that hasn't already
been picked by somebody and the answer
is that in general you see repeated
clicks are starting to account for about
60 people that tend to pick something
that somebody else has already picked
okay um I'm just I'll just very quickly
talk about this stuff we've been doing
some sorry gone
more more want to use those one did you
measure whether they do better with it
ain't getting better information or they
just kind of ever getting the same
information may or not be Yeah right so
so that's that's I can't answer your
question about the social stuff but one
of the things that we've done I'm just
trying to remember the results right now
because it's pretty fresh so one of the
things that we did was we correlated
people's access behaviors with their end
of term performance and I'm just I'm
just trying to remember what what came
out I think I think there was no
relation between using this system and
end of class performance but I mean the
fact we didn't get a relation is not you
know it there a variety of factors that
could explain that for example you know
you could get a mixture so we've in in
previous with pilots I found that the
students who are using this
statistically the most were students who
were they were second language speakers
right and so when we talked in the math
to the event what they said is you talk
too quickly I think this stuff's great I
access it after the event and irie
listen to the lectures they tend to be
the students who didn't do that well on
the course so I original thought was you
know you use this a lot you're getting
at repeated access to the material but
it's not clear that that's that's
completely the case so we actually found
an inverse correlation I can't I mean I
can look that up for you but I don't
know the answer but it's not it's not
entirely straightforward because I think
there are different patterns of use I
mean the other thing is is that it's not
everett this isn't a tool that everybody
wants so if you actually look at you
know it's a kind of standard power loss
thing right there's a bunch of students
who won't use it's all and then there's
another bunch of students who are using
it just all the time so so you know this
up there's a lot of things to explore in
that space I'm sorry I can't answer your
question fantastically well there
okay so let me just talk about the the
meeting stuff but this is general too
ubiquitous speech so so what we do with
meeting conversations is that we take
speech we transcribe it to text and then
we just use stupid ir tf-idf on that to
profile the terms and the utterances in
the document all right so what we do
basically is we is we privilege the
terms which are very frequent in that
particular meeting which are infrequent
in the rest of the corpus right and we
do the same we say basically that an
utterance is just the import the some of
the important scores of all the words in
of the words that occur in that
utterance so we can build some reason we
can build them in speech and we can
build him in text right we've been doing
a variety of experiments so this is this
is the speech data so what we can do
with the speech is people say meetings
are really boring which may be the case
right so what we can say to people is
now we've got an importance profile on a
particular meeting you can listen to
that meeting you can listen to ten
percent the most important ten percent
of that meeting because we're just using
tf-idf to do that and we can do various
bizarre things like we can drop words
all right so we can say okay you know
any stop word is just out right or else
we can drop utterances and we can do
mixtures of these various things like we
can we had a version of the algorithm
which is a hybrid where basically what
we do is we'd find the most important
utterances and then we'd speed up
through the less important utterances
but anyway the results are pretty
encouraging so what we can show is that
that if you ask people to find the most
important bits of the meeting subject to
some external criterion then we can show
them more efficient if you drop the less
important utterances and furthermore
interestingly if you drop the less
important words from within an utterance
and this is it I mean if people are
interested I'll play your clips what's
quite striking is you're actually able
to work out pretty well what's gone on
in the meeting
if all these words are dropped because
basically what you're just doing is
getting key words and our argument or
analogy is something like when you read
text you're scanning it you're not right
you know i mean the the results which
the analyses of i gaze you know when you
put these you know you do the the eye
gaze detection shows exactly the same
thing people don't dwell on stop words
people don't dwell on function words the
drawing content words and so the what
this stuff is doing in speeches is it is
equivalent to that okay so I'm going to
just finish up here so want to argue is
that we should stop thinking about this
kind of view that we want to capture
everything it's just not enough to store
everything there are various problems
which are associated with digital
archives then some sense a lot of the
materials are kind of invisible that
kind of hard to access and they're also
hard to organize and then we should also
think about how to fit these types of
technologies alongside what people are
good at already so we should instead of
thinking that these technologies are
going to replace human memory they're
going to be in instances where organic
memory is poor so we all know people are
bad at remembering intentions plans or
whatever let's start thinking about
technologies for that instead of things
that we're good at let's start thinking
about populations who have problems with
memory and start targeting them instead
of thinking this is going to be a
generic solution the other thing to
think about is matter memory which is
the person's impression of how good
their own memory is because that affects
how much these tools are used then I
talked briefly about different methods
of doing selection on all this stuff we
can we can select off user actions
either before the event or after the
event and then we can privilege parts of
the event stream using that type of
information and we can also do things
based on intrinsic semantics which is
just the distribution of those events in
relation to what else we know about the
distribution of those events in the
world okay so I'll just finish up our
focus mainly on retrieval but there's a
bunch of other types of memory
experiences you could think about you
know what will be a good technology
for trying to learn from your past or
reminisce about it and then we also need
to think about you know different types
of processes so I think I alluded to
this when I was talking about the
mementos study that you know in a sense
you couldn't tell from the properties of
the various objects mementos that were
people people were picking you can tell
precisely why those were so significant
to them so you had to think about the
symbolic characteristics of those types
of objects so just thinking about how
these relate two episodes in a person's
lie and also we need to think about
different types of models for these
things so we need to think about the
trade-offs the costs of creating these
types of records you know obviously
they're cheap and the social setting
then in the individual setting retrieval
costs what we saw was if some things
something may be accurate but if it's
cumbersome to use nobody's going to use
that as a retrieval tool and also you
know which you guys all know about right
do I trust you know the fact that what
we saw with the what I'm concerned about
somewhat with these kind of lecture
queuing is I mean are the weaker
students going to come in you know two
weeks before the class exam and say oh
well I'm not going to pay any attention
to that so I'm just going to look at
those big images in there all right so
you get you know an overfitting which is
based on you know kind of mob psychology
about what was good in that particular
course ok so I'll finish that first one
say thanks to Steve we have a little bit
of time for questions so if people can
either raise your hands and I'll come to
you or there's a mic in the middle other
questions we might even have questions
ah yes it was their question coming from
New York no no
these are so Steve one of the things
that that I've been working on the past
couple years is this whole sense making
model and and there's a lot of analogies
here between for example the costs of
encoding and the retrieval costs and all
that stuff and and the standard
sense-making thing so is this the list
of costs that you've considered or view
I don't think we've we've talked about
cast in quite a loose way so far I would
not consider this to be a full and
complete list of costings but I am very
interested in in the sense-making
approach and I think trying to formalize
some of this I think is very important
so no this is just kind of back of the
envelope thoughts but and what thoughts
you've got about well well one of the
things you brought up was the how
accurate your perception is of the
recalled information and I think that's
actually a really important one and
along this this encoding cost that line
there's also something we've noticed
which is we've been calling it the dread
cost how much you'd read the perspective
activity of encoding it right and and so
there are interesting costs and sort of
meta costs like that the worry of
thinking about how much you're going to
be responsible for these notes are in
the social case how much you might
reveal about yourself or how much you
know on a lot of kinds of things so
there are lots of interlocking seems to
me kinds of costs and issues that
involve here and so I'm particular
interested in your thoughts about the
social interactions in your experience
with in with an office so I would say
that this this is this is relatively
recent so so you know there's some older
stuff on you know Penn sharing and
distributed which to my mind was not
particularly successful so I think our
stuff is looking to be more successful
because there are actually there's a
greater you need a greater number of
participants I think to start leveraging
set of social value we haven't actually
done I think you need to do some kind of
pose
talk analysis of you know sit people
down and look and have them discuss
their beliefs about the quality of those
types of indices I mean I will tell you
that there are bizarre selection
criteria used by students for picking
some of these images so you know so I
could some of it this was this was kind
of a setup slide for the whole of the
lecture right so in information terms
that you know that's a good thing to
pick this is a person this is a person
who was close to the person who was
taking the images right so you know so
you say well okay that's contextual
information for that person but you
don't know what I don't know why
socially a lot of people are accessing
that particular image you know maybe
it's so so you you may have you have may
have multiple reasons for you know
certainly in terms of the boosting the
retrieval side for particular indices to
be selected which may not be
informational so so i think it's i think
it's it's problematic we haven't done
that we haven't actually done the
research on this end to say what the
selection criteria are is yet but I
think I you know I think it's a really
interesting space so it's not I think
everybody's in that space right
so I I'm interested in how people shop
or do sort of complex information
searches and use you know the web or the
physical world as a place to gather
information and what role their own
memory or notes or other things play in
terms of helping them find the
information they need or keep it or make
decisions and so one thing I think I
guess I'm interested basically in what
you might be able to contribute to that
at one thing I noticed is that this
example is a endpoint that you've
defined like the task is to do well in
this class and can you can you sort of
maintain your your information in order
your memory in order to do well in the
class and shopping it's kind of like you
you decide whether you've done a good
job or whether you know with with it I
think one thing the other thing that's
interesting about it is that that you do
something and then I think sometimes you
you distance yourself from the
information and something happens in
your head you distance yourself from the
external information something happens
in your head and then you go back to the
external information and then you have a
different relationship to it so I guess
I'm just of interested in what you might
have to say about these external
triggers supporting tasks that you that
you sort of when you define what that
what success means for that task yeah
yeah so most of our stuff as you
certainly the experimental stuff we we
use externally defined criteria the the
users in the picture study they don't
have any clue whether or not we had to
just take their word for it so so but
let me just pre associate to the
shopping did you I mean one thing that's
that's really striking this isn't this
isn't kind of news too is you know web
search is remarkably remarkably bad at
allowing you to stir store intermediate
results of things that you're doing all
right so you know history list point 0 2
percent of usage right according to and
you know
I was alluding to the back you know like
backs a mess now you know tabbing 'he's
a mess now so so there's no there
doesn't seem to be very good support at
all but just you know trying to collect
the results in more that you know so you
look at the titles of things you've
saved in the history list their garbage
there's no structure in there so what
you want and this is not at all trivial
as you know is you want some kind of
abstraction over those set of use of
behaviors to allow at least partial
support there but you know some of the
processes that people have gone through
you know maybe using dwell time or
something like that to kind of boost and
you know can't we do a better job of
kind of labeling things but so so I
think that's one part of the story the
other part of the story as far as the
user actions our concern is it seems
very curious curiously hard for people
to say about something that they found
as part of a kind of interim search or
gathering activity it seems really hard
fun to say this could be useful right
seems really hot and part part of the
problem is that they're worried about
the bookmarks problem right so if you
talk to people in that situation they
say oh but I didn't want to save that
because look at this mess right so it
seems like what you want is is you want
something that's kind of semi-automated
that can kind of at least capture you
know oh and where do you want to allow
them to index cheaply as well manually
but throw that so that so that they're
not as worried about this this
accumulation of stuff although you know
because they're not looking at bookmarks
it it doesn't matter it's a bizarre
worry so I I think that's part it as far
as the reflection is concerned I think
this you know bears a little on the
sense-making I don't know really what to
to think about that and I mean there's
there's a reminders perspective for
shopping which i think is under weather
you look to this sellin the this these
old style studies with active badges
that with an age is going
one of the things that I found really
striking about that is if you want to
kind of remind people to get so the
problem with sort of saying to people
you know have you gone to the shops yet
is then you know they're not on their
way to their shops right either they are
in which case you wasting their time or
else they're not ready to go to the shop
so you need to know too much about
people to be able to remind them about
that situation but I think spatial
information might actually be quite
useful there because what that selling
study showed was that people have the
most thoughts about things that they
ought to do when they're on the stairs
right they're moving it so you could you
might be able to use micro you know I
don't know you can't use GPS for this
right but you might be able to use micro
information about thinking about when
you want i'm not sure whether you were
thinking about prompting or think about
reflection but i think this there's
something that you can do in that space
which is based on when people are likely
to be busy or not but you can't do it on
the computer I don't think cause I think
it's just a you know unless you're
really good at task recognition which
nobody is right so okay so I'm a great
fan advocate and follow a guess of
synergy versus substitution I love the
idea that we can augment and empower
versus or place on that note I've always
been curious about this thing of trans
active memory when you were speaking
earlier and just the phenomenon like
your brain literally mapping information
to source outside of yourself so when we
lose a cell phone or when we break up as
a couple that like it it feels traumatic
and actually the brain shows physical
trauma so I see search is something that
contributes to trans active memory IC
digital devices that contribute to trans
active memory and I've also been curious
about whether or not we live in a
generation where we're learning not to
remember things because of the phenomena
of trans active memory so at a friend
who who SAT with his grandfather on his
deathbed and
and his father was his grandfather's
Irish and said you need to know the
story of your family and his generation
just could recite things and just were
able to remember so many things and our
generation we it's difficult for us to
remember phone numbers and so I'm just
curious about your perspective on that
idea of us and digital devices synergy
versus substitution the idea of
something like that versus what we can
do to counter or work with transactive
memory so that it's not something that
debilitates us so this is an old right
so Plato I think was the first person to
be concerned in this way because he's
janna with you so he he basically dist
writing because writing would stop the
tradition of storytelling because the
tradition of story tell you to that
community in the storytelling is so you
write those down right people just
aren't going to remember them but I
think you're it's it's a what the
optimistic view of this is been in a
sense with freeing people up from you
know maybe some of the more mundane
aspects you know you could you want you
don't want to say hey great im a
champion phone number remember right
nobody is you know I guess they're CMU
students would would be you know they
get a kick out of doing that right but
you know they have right that's it isn't
who is it Erickson would just have all
these students who are just yeah right
Phil chase right but but that's not
something that we kind of want to
specialize in because but but we have to
think about how to work with these
devices to be able to do that so I think
we move from saying I can remember that
but to a way that you can actually trace
a route to that information the thing
that I don't like about these these kind
of pure capture models is is that the
information just seems to now be locked
into the device and that seems to be
very different from what people are
doing with the physical objects that are
talked about where you know there's a
constant you know and this is they sort
of integrate the objects into their
lives in quite a significant
where you know sir so somebody would say
I'll get the seashells and I'll put them
here you know I'm going to get the mug
and I'll put it here you know
grandmother's China goes here right and
so what they're doing is they're taking
this stuff from the past and they're
weaving it in to how they encounter you
know into the fabric of their everyday
lives and you know somebody that's
almost what somebody said right but with
a lot of these digital technology we
just plan on doing that because in a
sense we just think we're done when it's
inside when it's inside the device so
what we need to think so I you know I'm
not in general a big fan of ubiquitous
computing or augmented you know these
kind of augmented computing approaches
but I think this is where you can start
to think about cases of where you want
to try and bring this you know into into
people's everyday lives and it could be
as you know it's mundane as the shopping
experience right so I just how you know
I've got a little Theory there about
when reminding takes place but it relies
on me knowing about what the person's
doing right as opposed to kind of
locking the stuff up in in a device
somewhere I don't know whether ants in
question but you know just it sort of
does i think reinforcing natural
behaviors like repetition i was also
wondering whether or not you had an
opinion on like cognitive exercises and
whether or not assistive devices like
this can also actually be designed to
improve your memory like actually do
things that rewire your brain to improve
your memories so so i'll tell you the we
haven't done any stuff like that but the
microsoft cambridge people have some
very interesting data with Alzheimer's
which shows that sense cam is actually
helpful to Alzheimer's patients in terms
of help it you know so the classic
problem is that Alzheimer's problem the
patients they can't remember anything
about their day and their self-esteem
just drops you know because basically
you know that's you know you are your
memories in some sense and so so what
they've done and what what the classic
medical treatment is or a part of the
kind of cognitive treatment for
Alzheimer's is you have people make
Diaries right and then this is the cost
of making a diary is just prohibitive
right and they might forget
to make the diary so here we have is
this you know low-cost automatically
generated record right and what that
shows is that they can remember more
events right even without the triggers
so they run to connet you know you can
show them the pictures or you can ask
them yeah that can't be true I can't be
true but it anyway the result I do
remote is the self-esteem went way up as
a result of this so so I think there's
something in this space that can really
you know can actually help but it the
design is absolutely crucial right just
