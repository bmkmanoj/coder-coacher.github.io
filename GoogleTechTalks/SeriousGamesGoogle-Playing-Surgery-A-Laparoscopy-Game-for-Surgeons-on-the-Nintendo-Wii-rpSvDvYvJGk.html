with ng D U and I lead the serious games
Tech Talk series and we are ecstatic to
have some folks from the University of
Kronig inand Lou Arden in the
Netherlands along with Grendel games who
are jointly developing a game for
surgeons and we're gonna be some of the
first people to be able to play play
with and take a look at some of the
demos of the current version of their
game and we're hoping that this is going
to be one of the first simultaneous
serious and commercial game launches on
a major platform so please join me in
welcoming Hank Tim and yet C thank you
very much
I'd like to start with some videos so
you might ask yourself what does a robot
a girl some some mining planet for a far
away has to do with surgery or at least
learning the motor skills of surgery and
that's what we're here for today we're
gonna demo and gonna tell about the
whole process of making this game this
seriously entertaining game for the
Nintendo Wii which trains you basic
laparoscopic surgical skills and to tell
you all about this we brought a surgeon
Hank tangata who do marker that's very
Dutch in pronounceable probably for all
of you Hank thank Arthur who do marker
and he's gonna tell you about what
laparoscopy is and how we came up with
making this game so thanks minimally
invasive surgery or laparoscopy is
around now for about more than twenty
years it is still struggling with one of
the major problems that we were
encountered with in the beginning we are
a sort of combination
where we are at the moment with
developing this this game we cooperate
between the University Hospital another
hospital in labor and software developer
chamber games and we joined up to
produce the company called cutting edge
so it's all about laparoscopy
laparoscopy is around for a very very
long time now and we are still
struggling with the same problem so the
problem with laparoscopy is our effect
there are many problems we working with
wrong tools and we introduced a sort of
port Indian in the abdominal or any
thoracic wall and through that port we
introduced an instruments the problem is
that from there on it becomes a little
bit clumsy and and difficult because
what is happening all your movements are
reversed
we call it the fulcrum effect so we
introduce an instrument and if you want
to move the tip to the left you have to
move them in the handle to the right and
vice versa so that makes it not
intuitive for many users the other
problem there is is that you are working
with 2d screens so your you have a
complete loss of depth perception that's
the second problem and the third problem
in laparoscopy is that you're working
with stiff rigid instruments and if you
compare it with open surgery is what you
do with your hands the end result of the
movement of your hand is the enter and
result of about 10 joints so you can
make very very precise sort of movements
and all that has changed now to rigid
instruments it is more or less where
your whole arm is in the plaster of
Paris cast where you only have the
function of squeezing your thumb and
your index finger so that's so that
those are the other problem so that
means that that Rafi
still is a difficult task so we try to
train surgeons and residents before they
go into theatres and that's on a box
like this or on a boxes and we train
them according to the FLS that's a
fundamental approach copic surgery from
the sages and we try to work to teach
them surgery
it works with with instruments like like
this rigid instruments and very simple
tasks this is called the back transfer
and you have to move packs inside a box
where you can't see them directly so you
can only
what you're doing on the television
screen you have to transfer those tears
back from one side to the other side
it's the mechanical task and you can
play around for a long time and you get
better at at the end another way to
train surgeons is with simulators we
have a lot of simulators in our skill
center this is a very very nice one very
beautiful machine very very good and I
think the topic of the market at the
moment so we invested in our skill
center of about 1 million euros in
buying simulators so this is what we
imagined what it would be like so a
skill center this is our skill center
pitch of our skill center full with
people fighting to find a place on the
simulator but after a while just turned
out to be the case so that's very
strange so in fact we invested a million
all the resins that came in the first
moment this is what they said well well
wow this is cool this is really awesome
but what happened is that after about
before the day and that they were
completely fed up with the simulators
and they didn't come back and that's
strange because the same uses the
process that the potential users were
gaming day-in day-out so they don't have
anything against electronics or screens
or what else so so for one reason for
one or the other reason they are not
happy with simulators and we try to
figure out what that was so the first
thing we we knew is that simulators are
very effective in teaching and
laparoscopy we know that from a lot of
literature so if you try and to get the
results back on the simulator two ways
to get them back the first one is by by
force and that's what we do at the
moment we tell them well you're only
allowed in your if you are reaching
several levels on the simulator well of
course you can force them to use the
simulator in this sense the problem is
as soon as they are finished with the
special type of curriculum they stop
using the simulator and that's a pity
because we know that from a lot of work
from Butch Raza and
in New York surgeon is a real example of
of Investigation at this sort of surgery
and he knows that if you keep practicing
or simulators you're getting better and
better and better so it never stops it
ends only after your death so there is a
good reason for keeping the simulator
alive so then we thought well what can
we do if it doesn't work with with force
perhaps we can tease them to use the
simulators but there are enormous
differences and I found out because at
one moment I was asked to teach in
Alagna in a symposium in the Netherlands
about serious gaming because they
thought well you have a skill center you
have lots of simulators so you must be
an expert on serious gaming and only at
that moment I found out that our huge
differences between simulators and
serious gaming in a simulator and on the
sort of exercises like the PEC transfers
what you're doing is only mechanical
exercises so you could be more or less
brain death and you could still exercise
this sort of exercises and that's and
the other thing is that the end result
of your exercise is predictable
Sartorius not a real clue or a mission
or what else you have to fulfill and we
cannot go task well in gaming it's
completely different because in gaming
what you do with your hand is completely
unimportant whether you are using your
mouse or your joystick that's not the
important thing what you are doing is
playing a game it's not for nothing is
called an immersive game so we are
involved in a story so that's the
difference and that keeps the people
going so at that moment I thought well
perhaps we should join or try to create
the merits between the serious gaming
business and the game business
why don't we produce a game that can be
controlled with surgical tools so
instead of using a joystick or a mouse
use a sort of surgical tools to
manipulate the game so that was the
basis of the whole idea then we found
out that probably the Nintendo Wii was
certainly at that moment but it still is
the only platform that's capable of
fulfilling this sort of task it has a
very precise more
in capturing device because we looked in
the professional business as well from
motion capturing devices and they were
too clumsy too expensive because we
wanted to have something that is
affordable and that's and that's very
practical in in the use so we came to
the Nintendo Wii and from there on I was
googling to find a software company that
could help us with developing a game and
that's how we came to Tim learning from
simple games and young observers hello
everybody my name is Tim laning I'm here
together with my co-founder and co-owner
of grundle games were a serious game
company and we got a phone call from
Hank to see if there was a possibility
that we could come up with an immersive
design for a lower cost laparoscopic
surgery training so we we started
working on the prototype on this very
picture you see the first prototype
controller that we developed together as
you can see it utilizes a nunchuck and a
Wii Remote for both the left and the
right hand but it was a big big as a
matter of fact we presented it at first
at the GDC Series Game Summit and
afterwards at the games for health and
Boston it came in a suitcase there was
about a square cubic meter so that was
that was fun and there's no way that
this is going to be distributed but what
this thing did was basically proof that
we could actually come up with a device
that works on consumer grade hardware
and that allows you to interface
actually with with an entertainment
system so we were all very happy with
that and was basically the start of of
far better cooperation cooperative
effort what you see here is the
prototype the new prototype controller
this is not gonna be the final product
but at least it showcases what it can
look like the base underneath is a lot
smaller than a Wii Fit as you can
imagine on the top the nunchuck is
inserted and
very forward slide the Wii Remote is
inserted and you can just do lebra
scopic surgery with a device like this
by simply putting in but taking a hunk
of plastic by inserting a couple of we
remotes and a couple of nunchucks and
you can get some staggering results on
which yes is going to elaborate in a few
minutes we do game design so we came up
with with figuring out how basically
remove all medical context because one
of the problems of the simulators is is
that they're not games they're not games
at all I mean some people call them
serious games but in fact they're just
training motor skills with comparative
medical context but the medical context
is exactly what puts these residents off
I mean they've been confronted with this
the entire day they need to go to a
skills lab at night to be able to chain
his stuff which is not very very
attractive so we came up with a couple
of analogies that would explain or would
relate to the the practices that you
need to do so we came up with a piece of
narrative because we think that's
important in a game to at least get a
feeling of a place to give it a context
what you see here is one of the designs
of our robot there are a whole lot of
robots in our game and we came up with a
game design that basically is something
of a merger between lemmings I don't
know if any of you know lemmings
lemmings and the incredible machine and
perhaps a little hint of a game called
ICO the robots are basically mining
robots that are abandoned on a planet in
a deep crevasse that they created
themselves because they were mining for
minerals for humans and they were left
back there the main character of the
story is a robot called Swank and Swank
was basically the butler robot of the
family that ran the entire mining
operation and Swank had a particular job
basically look after the dollar of the
family called sorry and he had to teach
her a lot of stuff
you have to make sure that she did her
homework but in fact she basically
reprogrammed him to teach her tango
lessons they were having a blast dad
find out and basically abandoned the
robot swank to the bottom of the crevice
along with the rest of the mining crew
and the little girl goes to look for a
friend so deep in the underground world
and there are a lot of dangers like this
slug that has an appetite for anything
that's metal
and it's basically besieging the robot
so what you need to do in the game is
basically get scrap metal that's piled
up in the underground cavernous world
and smelt that put it in a melt melter
and smelter and create like scaffolds
elevators and stuff to create a route
for the girl and the robots to go back
up the same time you have to make sure
that she doesn't get attacked and that
they don't get get attacked so here you
see one of the snails the real bastards
attacking one of the robots through this
game we also came up with a lot of
designs there were a lot of the design
question is what you see here are some
preliminary results some sketches from
flora that is in the game world the
vegetation is important because this
vegetation has has a direct relation to
the to the to the game itself as you
will see in a minute you we control two
large robot arms with the control set
and those robot arms basically interact
with the game world so they make sure
that you can place bridges that you can
build elevators and things like that but
you also need power sources and these
power sources are organic growths that
are in that cavernous world so we need
to have something tangible to interact
with that creates that is utilized as an
energy source here you see some final
results plant number three is with the
one on the highest row the third one
with the orange orb in it
is one of the designs that finally made
it into the game we have it in a blue
variety you will see it in the demo in a
second whenever you try to approach it
with one of your hands the plant closes
if you move too fast so you really have
to make a secure movement and try to
grab that particular orb before you can
utilize this utilize this so you really
have to use your high and eye
coordination skills just as you would in
the poorest Copic surgery the placing of
the objects needs to be done in an
inverse movement kind of way through the
control set which has a relation to the
training of laparoscopic surgery skills
the two hands the two arms robot arms
that are in the game each have different
tools so they have like drilling
machines that you would use to destroy
bridges that these slugs make or that
you would use to drill scrap metal loose
while you hold it with your other hand
the metallic claw a pincher and this way
you can train actually train the active
and the passive hand as you would in
simulations but it's not a simulator
it's just a game so we wanted really one
of the game to have production value
because we feel that's one of the
largest problems that that are out there
right now with serious games most of
them lack production value so there are
no fun at all they're not fun to look at
and they're no fun to listen to
since they're more of an academic test
and actually a video game what you see
here is a picture of a Californian
artist Michael maze Lee he has a
fantastic dulcimer on which he creates
music and he's actually Co composing the
music for the video game so he has an
actual soundtrack some elaborate
soundtrack he will be cooperating with
challeng Lenstra who is a composer and
director of opera music in
our country the Netherlands so it's
going to have an actual soundtrack as
opposed to blink bonk plink plunk but
most of these simulators do the
animations that you have just seen are
provided by a game ship we've outsourced
them to a local local animation studio
local game outsourcing studio that we
always closely work with they also
employ students so they get a chance to
actually learn things from this so it's
a it's a close cooperation effort you
pre-recorded some videos that at least
show so what you see here is a
pre-recorded gameplay this particular
level the objective of the player is to
basically get the robot safely to the
top you see them wandering around with
with the blue spheres that they found
those of the energy spheres
elevators up to try to get to their goal
should them see the left hand and the
right hand and Zara
the DHB control left-hander has now
selected the tweezer as has the right
you can see the robot have idle
animations and looking around collecting
those orbs
the player actually has to start to
invent lies scrap metal to be able to do
the building process so here he's taking
this crap following it down in the
melter then you immediately see a couple
of options he had the left hand as a
tweezer in the right hand as a driller
its drilling releasing a scrap throwing
it back into the melter
the process of gathering some of the
scrap metal so he has two options either
billet build an elevator or build a
bridge selecting the bridge piece and
carefully placing it in the landscape
and robust applause as you can see the
corners of the level itself are dark
this is not because this is a badly shot
video this is because actually the
plastic surgeons scope only has light in
the camera itself so it's always in a
very dark area by choosing an
underground world we use this you see
one of the slugs creating their bridges
you see the player selecting a driller
to destroy those bridges so it can make
his own bridges well this little is just
coming out with zap them with chakra
they don't like that here you see the
pair taking one corpse out of a storage
place now the elevators power
safety so this is a brief demonstration
of how we basically transformed the
guidelines to the poorest topic surgery
it's actually came up with good nice
game design rules and it has nothing to
do with laparoscopic surgery anymore
basically it's just become a game about
an underground world and a little girl
and a bunch of robots that need saving
badly just comment on what we try to
read so we didn't try to teach
procedural skills so well because a lot
a lot Koli for instance consists are a
lot of difficulty so it's technical
skills and procedural skills the second
part is what we're not trying to do it's
only trying to teach our residents to
have a good three-dimensional sense for
a photo for what is happening in the in
the abdomen so that's and work with with
two instruments so the limit is very
limited set of goals we try to do we end
to reach with a game like this but you
could include in an environment like
this is is make them aware of the
environment that's not a problem in the
aura is if always a very complex sort of
working area so there's information
coming from everywhere and we try to
teach that with crew resource management
training a very sort of labor some sort
of exercise but the other you could try
to implement that as well in a game like
this so this this is what we are doing
at the moment and now what we needed to
know because about a month three weeks
before we came here the the controls
were finished and now we were able to
test if an expert would grab those
controls and intuitively use them and
the novice would have a quite long
learning curve so what I did these this
is still preliminary results and small
sample size but we had 14 laparoscopic
novices never done anything on
laparoscopy before and eleven experts
we compared those we made them do an FLS
test the thing you saw this thing with
the transferring of bags this is a
validated tool to see what the motor
skills of the laparoscopic surgeon are
and we made a custom test level that
looks like this let's see which forced
the forced that sounds of forced that
makes them touch balls inside of a
little balls colored balls and sticks
and this was modeled on a standard test
you have in standards simulators so we
compared the two and we looked at two
things the learning curve so we let them
do five tries and we also compared the
tests that we made this test to the
Ovilus test so if there's we wanted to
see if there was I'm struggling for
words here we will see we were trying to
find out if the ethyl esters the
standardized tests would have the same
results as this test so what you see
here is first preliminary results on the
X bar you see the number of attempts and
the time that it took them to complete
the task to touch the balls and the
Green Line shows the expert so at the
first try
he needs to familiarize and then you see
that he quickly goes to well the fastest
time that he can do this tasking and the
red line shows the novices and they get
there but much slower and you see a much
bigger standard deviation here so the
the difference between the novices and
experts are
big and then I'm sorry um
significant thank you so much and we
also compared the FLS test to our test
to see if the scores on both were
correlated correlate destroyed so what
you see here is that you see two things
you see the green dots that are the
experts they have fast times to complete
the task the test and the red dots are
the novices and you see that there's a
beautiful correlation between those two
so our tests does the same thing as the
ls test these are still preliminary
results we're doing we're gonna do much
more results so this same test with a
bigger group and then we're gonna test
face validity so asked expert surgeons
and surgeons in training if this is
something they would like to train with
and after that there is not that much
for us to do any more because what we
need to do is have other surgeons and
other researches test these listing so
learning effects and even transfer of
skill so that the skills you're learning
on this game do they transfer to
practice so that's my bit wobbly story
about the research I've been doing well
and I'd like to hand over the the end of
the presentation to Tim thank you well
thank you all so much for for attending
this with what we'd like to give you
what we'd like to tell you is basically
that in our vision this is the future of
of games basically we want to get rid of
the World Series in series games we
think it isn't necessary to put that
word in front of him we think that games
teach you something anytime
what you what what is important is that
basically if you can make a game that
runs on a consumer grade hardware device
like this that actually practices skills
medical skills on consumer grade
hardware it becomes possible and it
becomes viable to teach a lot of people
in the world also in those countries
that don't have a lot of money for a
similar simulator to teach them to keep
the skills in a fun way
basically to train that and those skills
not to teach them but to train them and
she's actually saying and besides that
please keep in mind that this specific
set of controllers is very handy to
practice those skills but at the same
time there is just the game has consumer
controls just a regular nunchuck and a
regular Wii Remote that you can play the
game with in a perfect way so basically
you're opening you're able to publish a
game on warm market whereas most people
see them as two and we think that is not
necessary anymore we thank you for your
time thank you for being here and we
hope to see you soon so are there oh
sorry
VC ops can you open up for are there any
questions on the bridge and since we've
only got one live mic so if you want to
pose any questions to these guys and
then did you guys also want to do some
were you guys gonna do some demo
gameplay yes of course okay questions
the distribution model and you guys
thought about that
there you go and I guess related to that
is like this is Nintendo know about this
is it are you running on deaf kits or
okay so what's our distribution model
and what does Nintendo think of what
we're doing right now
thank you Tim whoo Oh answer that in
terms of distribution models we are
currently looking at different business
models you can imagine that with digital
distribution there's a very clear an
open place where you can actually also
build a community and get feedback from
that community and basically perfect
what you are offering to them so that's
definitely something that we're that
we're looking at about Nintendo yes we
have talked to them multiple times and
they are aware of the project and I
think it's a very nice project that it
basically shows they're proud that
someone has found ways that multiple
people have found ways to utilize their
console to do different things but it's
a it's basically our game so basically
we're the ones that are doing the
development so they absolutely know
about it and but we basically we pay for
our own way we build we get our own def
kits and that's how it is
thank you any more questions how much
the per station since the is pretty
because they're infrared cameras of the
pretty course in terms of precision so I
wonder if you guys tell any analysis how
much movement yes we did and what we saw
was that it is at least as accurate as a
standard simulator we compared it well
not to the most expensive one but well
an entry-level simulator it does decide
well it
the same accuracy so here's we did
research on that thank you one major
major advantage of this setup because
most simulates you have to calibrate
before you can start and the fun with
the infrared is you don't have to
calibrate you're immediately in business
and it's immediately exact later on if
you want to try you can see it in one of
the demo versions because that was of
course our worst nightmare that you with
the rods that come out of the prototype
you could touch each other while in the
screen it wasn't touching that's the
worst scenario for us but it really is
exactly as you can see when you use the
prototypes so when it's in the virtual
world touching it's touching in the in
in the real world so at this point
exactly
okay simulators what do they think about
the EM so what are the reactions of the
students I have to repeat the questions
and didn't do that with the last one so
what are the reactions of the students
who need to train on this I think yeah
they are very enthusiastic about it they
only saw the very preliminary versions
but they are very keen in getting hold
of one of the machines so at the moment
we're not at that face so no they don't
they're really really fond of it and
then they like it just in the game want
to play again have you done any user
testing to see whether students keep
playing the game and the question is
whether whether the students keep
playing the game well we are not at that
level at the moment because we are only
invalidating the validation studies so
we can't afford to have one student
sitting in the room for four days
because he's obstructing the progress if
the validation studies so I can't tell
you at this moment yes
the question is whether we face problems
with regulatory issues on medical games
this is a tricky question yes of course
we we face that so we are very very
careful with that so we are not
pretending a fact that we're building a
simulator we are building a game and
what we are aiming at is that the
surgical world my friends are going to
use it and they will probably tell
themselves that it might be a useful
tool so we don't pretend this is a
simulator they will find out themselves
that's very political sorry before that
showed the surgeons that actually played
any type of video game do significantly
better on laparoscopic tests did you
have plans to like kind of redo that
with this game versus just any game just
see if like you're teasing out even more
skills beyond what just a normal Xbox
game would do yeah let's summarize the
question there has been work been done
testing and all sorts of well well
typical kind of games with the three
three-dimensional inside Boutros a bit
that from new york he did a lot of work
on that and he found that that sort of
games were effective in in training
people and the question is are we
planning to have a comparison between
that sort of games in our game yes of
course we are having that sort of sort
of sort of comparing studies yeah but
again this is only the because the real
testing can only be done in fact after
much more of the game is finished so we
are a bit early so what we did and at
this phase is just testing of the of the
mechanics of the the whole of the heart
and soul of the whole whole machine how
accurate is the 3d 3d positioning with
infrared
system and that's what we did at this
moment so we don't pretend to have done
more than that yes so there's technical
training and then there's procedural
yeah so if you talked about going to the
procedural is that that seems yes we're
the reuse yeah the question is in fact
any training at least a laparoscopic
training consists out of a technical
part and a procedural part and are we
already looking in the procedural part
yes we did we abandon completely to
precede your part we're staying away
from it because the world's too
complicated it's too tricky and then
you're entering the minefield of lawyers
etc so we are staying away we don't
pretend that we only want them to play
and have fun and keep playing that's
that's important the problem with most
immersive games that you have to warn
the residents that they should practice
more we want to warn our practice that
they should stop practicing because it's
time to go the question is how this is
compared to the to the da Vinci
laparoscopic robot it's called the robot
it's not a robot but it's a mechanical
device but how does compare and how we
see the future with perhaps games like
this well to be honest the robot is very
popular but it hasn't made an enormous
impact yet it's a sort of university -
it's not a sort of tool for oratory for
surgeons it has not a real database with
a real proven
and extra functionality over all concern
laparoscopic surgery so there's a nice
Taurus it's very expensive so it hasn't
made an enormous impact yet in the
future perhaps it it might make it well
as at the moment is they are not at that
face it cost a fortune
the the maintenance contract is costed
not a fortune and it cost a lot of time
to set it up etc so for instance to give
you an example or standard copy
cholecystectomy is done before you have
tuned and calibrated and The Da Vinci
robots
so that's where we are at the moment
with the da Vinci to be honest nothing
against the da Vinci but it has a very
limited use for specific indications
such as the prostatectomy that's a very
popular one that's a nice confined area
where you have to make a very delicate
sort of combined movement that's that's
the end in the place for the da Vinci at
the moment questions now I want to make
sure that people get a chance to come
down and take a look at the demo unit
and for those of you in Mountain View
we're heading over to BigTable if you're
interested you're welcome to join thank
you very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
