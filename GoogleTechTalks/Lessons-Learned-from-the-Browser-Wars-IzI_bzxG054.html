pleasure to introduce Scott Birkin who
comes to us as a project manager from
well actually is a lecturer and author
and a trainer of project management and
he learned a lot about project
management at his tenure and that
actually was ten years at Microsoft
where he was a project manager there
primarily working on the internet
explorer and so he's here today to talk
about his experience we also have
another session this afternoon from 1 to
2 which is geared toward project leads
and is more AQA session and if anyone
would like to join for lunch today with
Scott please stay after thank you okay
microphone good microphone check people
in the back wave still awake okay I'm
not a morning person this is still
morning time for me so you'll find that
my pace gets better as the morning
passes into afternoon so i'll try a few
guys are not morning people thank you so
much for showing up I'll try to keep you
awake until we make it to lunch now I'm
going to talk to you about today is
actually a very difficult talk for me to
do when I talk to Carolina by coming
here and speaking here I published a
book that came out and I talked to
everyone that I knew about where i could
go maybe talk about some of the things
from the book Carol and I talked we
tried to cope with something more
interesting than just telling you about
well page 27 tells you you know I don't
want to give you a verbatim of the book
so we said well let's talk about stuff
from the browser hey yeah I spent a lot
of time working on that is good stuff to
learn maybe you can learn from the my
suffering so that's what this talk came
from the problem is that the list i came
up with four lessons that I learned was
several pages long and when I showed it
to a friend he said none of this is
interesting to me it's all interesting
to me my lessons what did Scott learned
so I had to spend a lot of time for
finding this to be not just lessons that
I learned lessons that I learned that
might be interesting to other people
especially people at Google and people
who might not be old enough to remember
when the browser Wars the first browser
Wars took place so I'm not going to talk
too much about the book I'm going to
talk about a little bit the beginning
I'll pass the book around so you can
look at it while you're
falling to prevent you from falling
asleep while I'm talking but just to
give you the background on me beyond
with Carol and said I left Microsoft in
2003 and I left to write books I decided
that I wanted to spend time writing
books since we could be a while to
figure out how to do that I didn't know
how to put sentences together I've been
spending so much time as a manager got
my book together while I was writing the
book I started working as a consultant
to bring in money while I was writing
and my plan right now this is my first
book is to promote the book see how well
it does try to keep doing consulting and
teaching so i can write the next book
and i can come and talk to people like
you again and have a good time and fun
make fun of Microsoft and all those good
things so the book captures or tried to
capture everything I thought I learned
in being a team leader at Microsoft and
I tried to distill it down to you don't
have to be development lead you don't
have to be have the job not to have the
word manager in your title to get value
out of this stuff it's all about well
how do you make your decisions if you're
working with other people who are smart
how do you effectively communicate with
them how do you build good relationships
what are you doing things go wrong I
tried to break it down into the 15 or so
things that really make the difference
between being successful and not today
and the stuff about the browser wars and
what I learned then there's a couple
things that are related to what's in the
book how to figure out what to do what
to do with ideas writing specifications
how not to annoy people which is
actually a chapter in the book very
proud that they didn't cut that out mid
game strategy and of course what to do
when things go wrong so my agenda for
today is of an important announcement to
make I'm going to talk about a brief
history just to refresh your memory on
the first part of the browser Wars it's
a history part now talk about process
smart people and organizations writing
specifications about managing innovation
and ended up business and customer
challenges so my important announcement
for you is extra important if you like
beer is that as part of my no frills
self-funded book tour the social event
from my tour is tonight at seven o'clock
at this brewery so if you like beer if
you like project management if you find
something I said today
entertaining you want to come and make
fun of the x microsoft guy you're all
welcome to come i don't know how many
people will show up i don't know how
much money i'll have left to put towards
beer but as much as I have I'll put
towards beer and you get a free beer for
me and if you have any books left i'll
give them away so you're welcome to come
that was the important announcement here
is the 32nd top speed summary of the
first part of the browser Wars just to
get some context 1993 once you made this
thing called mosaic did it as this
public works project my people left
create a company called navigator
actually tried to market the product is
a is a corporate capitalistic endeavor
microsoft created in an explorer which
was based on the codebase they purchased
from the people that made mosaic which
shipped as part of the plus pack this is
where i come in a little bit i worked on
the plus pack i worked on IE one wasn't
even part of windows it was this thing
you had to pay extra for he got in a
separate CD all of a sudden boom
everything navigator took off millions
of downloads and now the browser wars
were on navigator 393 that was in 1996
1997 that was like the first wave in
explorer 3 was actually well received
and all of a sudden everyone's Wow
Microsoft's in the game I for which a
lot of the bad horror stories i'm going
to share with you come from this does
anyone here who work the knife or i
knows a bunch of Microsoft people here
any I for veterans good i can tell you
the truth okay excellent okay then
towards the end netscape was acquired by
it no yeah this gave acquired by AOL
some people say that was the end some
people say that it was over before then
but when that happened that was pretty
soon it was right before i 5 was
released which was which did well was
popular and was well received and that
concludes the first part of the browser
Wars more in a very encapsulated fashion
if you really want to get a full history
I'm not going to give you the
documentation the documentary a version
the Roger Moore version of what happened
but there are books about this one book
that I can recommend to you
more Microsoft biased is how the web was
one gives you a chronology of all the
stuff that happened very business
focused the other one is competing on
internet time lessons from Netscape and
it's bad with Microsoft which is more
focused on Netscape i read both of these
books in preparing for this talk and
have to tell you given that you guys
work at a company that's in the center
of the industry walks will be written
about what you are doing now and before
you read them a couple years from now
before you read them have a few beers
because what they say you're like what
like they're talking about things that
you did in a different context you like
okay maybe that's what they said
happened but that's not what I remember
so just preparing you for that all right
now let's get on with the actual talk
again every team every project is
different now when it comes to thinking
about how software development is done
or how project management should be done
what kind of coding techniques you
should use there tends to be people many
people develop opinions based on their
experiences that they cope with
philosophies but how this should be done
you should always do this you should
always implement things this way she
always write this kind of specification
and the thing that I learned through in
an explorer but also in other places was
that that kind of militant religious
attitude about how work is done is not
productive because every time you start
a new project every time you start
working working with different people
the dimensions are different the
problems you're likely to have are going
to be different the strengths of your
organization your little team are going
to be different and what you're trying
to achieve is going to be different so
when you walk into a door and say well
you know we're starting a project again
so that means we're going to do the same
way we did it last time you have this
preconceived model that you are forcing
onto a new universe that doesn't
necessarily isn't actually going to
benefit from that previous model so the
universe is changing all the time and
something is wrong if you walk into
every new day bringing with you these
same things that you feel like you
learned in the past you're trying to
make happen in the future by the same
token if your opinions change all the
time you're not paying attention either
so there's this joke that we had there's
someone that I worked with on the
Internet Explorer team who I won't name
but he was a project manager
like myself and his opinion would always
match whoever spoke last whoever it was
so he'd come in and said we should do a
a and then someone say I think we should
do B we should do be let's do be too
cold in the weather vane we're holding
WV because any time that something new
happened you would say we should go with
this new thing so as an example this is
if this is one way to look at my
recollection of the Internet Explorer
versions that I worked on and even
though it started with a small team we
were probably the IE one team had about
15 people on it and I was actually
working on the IE one team is a
usability engineering I was not a
project manager yet there's very small
team were often corner of the company no
one cared what we did it was his
fledgling little effort very organic we
didn't regularly right specs we did
whatever we wanted I too was the same
way except now there was the they're
starting to be attention placed upon the
team and what we did because it seemed
to matter more to the rest the company
so we still small Silla organic no real
structure or discipline engineering
process bunch of people in the hallway
making stuff right but now our strategic
then all of a sudden the team got bigger
still organics still strategic but now
the size of the team is larger no so I
look I'm not going to walk you through
all these because you can read it on the
slide but in each one of these projects
the needs for how much process we needed
the need for what kind of specifications
we should write the needs of the
engineering tools we use we're all a
little bit different and I don't think
that we knew we really paid attention to
that all the people that have worked on
I won and liked working in that way with
a time they got to I for which would
became a really large team the I 14
probably had about 250 people on it 300
people maybe I don't really know it's
somewhere in that ballpark so going from
15 to 30 in about three years that kind
of growth all these people were still
thinking I'm going to work the way I
work before some cases that could work
but if they were working on things that
affected 100 other people in the group
there were problems so one lesson the
needs of a teener project are always
changing smart managers and leaders are
paying attention to the moment today
being here now
what does this team need for me as a
manager for me as a leader which need
for terms of tools and process and
structure writing specs and build
processes and all that stuff and it's
thinking about today and not thinking
about how they want it to be or how it
should have been or how it could have
been the word process comes up a lot and
most people don't like that word they
think of assembly lines which is what
the pictures in the background they
think of factory you're going to take my
word you're going to make a process for
doing something you're going to take all
the fun out of it you're going to bleed
it dry and you're going to make my role
in significant I don't think that
process is necessarily a bad thing it
all depends how you define process and I
think the way people tend to define
process they think of like college
culture computer science department
culture process is this thing that
manager people who don't know anything
about technology impose on everyone else
that's what process means that's what
they think it means I think it means
something else I think it's any prep is
any series of tasks that you do to make
something that's what a process is so if
you're hacking away Rep all night having
fun and you make something that you
think is cool you show your friend
that's a process if you were to sit down
and make a blueprint and spend six
months planning something before you
wrote a lot line of code that's a
process to different kinds of processes
depending what you're trying to do
different process might be appropriate
when you're thinking about what is our
process good it's my team using a good
process the way you know is thinking
about it from one step back not the
method none we're using extreme
programming or using the waterfall model
we're using this kind of code you say
okay is this process going to help us to
be effective how effective are we now
how effective will be like to be how
effective do people feel they are is
this process making us more or less
effective can we put something in place
so we make better decisions like the
code review idea minimizing the chance
of mistakes there some way to make sure
a stupid mistake is avoided good process
will help make that happen right you
think of like warning signs you think of
warning labels you get on things you
think of you know stops
right at the corner of an intersection
that's a thing that's put there to help
you in the process of driving to help
prevent you from making a mistake makes
sense now sometimes this is where people
start to get the the rub a process may
ask individuals to pay a local price in
their daily activity to benefit the
larger group the coding standards coding
coding practices that you have to use or
following a certain template when you
write a specification you're paying a
local tax I don't really want to follow
this you know this form because I'm
doing everyone else is doing it the
whole group benefits this is where it
gets complicated a good example in the
world is the highway system which by my
definition this is a process this is a
process for driving it's a set of rules
that prevent you from doing certain
things can't drive wherever you want
right but by following the rules you
benefit from being able to go relatively
quickly you're guaranteed that as you're
driving the guy next to you well most
the time will stay in his lane right
that allows you to go at 75 miles per
hour because everyone is using the same
process there's money that can be spent
to make the roads safe and reliable and
there's like there could be lights on
the road and there are these barriers to
prevent you from falling off a cliff
right this is all good right I like
driving fast I couldn't drive as fast if
there weren't good roads now it's not to
say that every team needs a highway with
this system that's been placed here and
it's very difficult to move it's a rigid
structure right you get performance
benefits from the rigid structure but
you can't say up we don't want to go
that way anymore want to go over here
without spending a lot of money to
change the process so there are other
kinds of roads right same general idea
there's a path it's now easier to go
that way than going through the jungle
right but it's not you can't go 90 miles
an hour on this road you don't have to
follow them there's no lanes drive
wherever you want right more flexibility
here but you may run into accidents you
may hit so on who's also on the other
side of the road so process is this very
really a broad term and when you're
thinking about how to be effective in
getting stuff done with other
people matter how smart they are you
have to be thinking about well how does
our process fit what things can be add
to the process and how we're going to
shape this whole landscape so that we're
able to be effective that's what process
is about now people fear process because
it's like the example the highway you
can look at a highway system is hat loss
of control right like if um if you're
sinking all right I'm in a Jeep I'm in
an SUV right I want to go in the
mountains I'm on the highway how it
prevents me or makes it difficult for me
to go up in the mountains it is
restrictive in a way if I'm not going in
the same direction as everyone else then
process will prevent me from doing stuff
a lot of people feel that it trivializes
your job once it's a system for doing
something it prevents you from
maximizing applying your maximum
intelligence the thing you're trying to
do because there's now these boundaries
in place in lots of cases I think at
some point in our lives we have a bad
experience with a process being
inflicted on us that was poorly designed
that didn't match what we did and wasn't
implemented trying to get the maximum
value out of who we are I can think of
lots of stuff in elementary school it
fits into this right you can think of
lots of stuff and some like I don't
think this happens often to Google from
the people i know who work here that
i've talked to you but at many companies
that's what having a job means is you
are a cog in a wheel and you were fit
into some structure that isn't designed
to make you as efficient as possible
it's designed to make you be one more
cog in a larger structure so that one
example from IE that I can share with
you is we had this big process battle
about check ins co check-ins this
affected the whole team every time a
developer wrote a piece of code or fix
the bug the checks on the end of the
build we didn't have any real process
for it so they check it in we had source
control so there was that but in terms
of the team there's no structure for
communicating at tracking it so so on
the rule was to check something in you
send out mail the check in alias which
most people most people are on
goes out and if people have questions
with they ask you never really worked
once we got beyond this tiny little 10
person team it didn't work anymore there
are too many people too many people
doing too many things so the test team
or Quality Assurance team ended up
wasting a lot of time because things
would get checked in and hadn't gone
through all of the steps that need to be
gone through there's no one verifying
the check-ins before they happen so lots
of wasted effort as the team got bigger
and the pace of our work got faster
complaining increased my timing at the
eye for it was just a disaster people
would take their check-ins and instead
of checking in little pieces as they
went along which is healthier way to do
it they batch them together because then
they only had you the check in once and
then the whole build would go because
his use check-ins were coming in right
finally finally the Builder the guy who
was responsible for building he had to
integrate all the different components
got so sick of this he went made a
little web tool the team was resistant
we had talked about it but everyone was
afraid of too much process we don't want
little restrict us don't hold us back so
he went off and did it he showed it to a
few of his friend developers they
started using it just to beta just a
side thing and within a week everyone
said that's the way we got to do it why
didn't we do this before this is so much
better I spend less time checking in now
I spend much more time writing code just
an example I'm not saying there's
something wrong with your build process
I'm not saying you should make a web
form but what I'm saying is that there's
this tends to be this pattern resistance
to process resistance something is so
awful and then finally people give in
and try it and they're like what were
you complaining about it this is so much
better related to fear process is smart
people and how to organize them now it
may be hard to believe may be hard to
believe but there was a day and time
when Microsoft around the time that I
got there had the reputation for being
this wild fun organic place to work you
came in and your own office you could
work on whatever you want and it's free
that was at least the stereotype that
was the model everyone thought took
place so
as a manager I was taught okay if you're
going to manage smart people and
creative people you have to understand
you have to understand the kinds of
environment they're going to want to
work in there's lots of evidence that
smart and creative people they like to
define their own boundaries they don't
want to be told where they should stop
and when they should start they want to
figure it out for themselves it's ended
before working with other smart people
right like people you know people kind a
long to spend time with people kind of
kind of a they want to go to go as fast
they can resist structure and like to
learn things on their own all right so
what does this mean if you are a manager
of a corporation your manager of a team
you find a bunch of smart people and
willing to work on something what do you
do how do you organize them right well
you start out the simplest way possible
right you say okay you three guys seem
to want to work on that thing go work on
that thing you guys go over there in
that corner you other three guys you go
over here last three you go there go
have fun you know we'll figure out your
goals as you go you'll make some stuff
and we'll worry about integrating it
when we get to that point great
excellent the time goes on some of these
little things do well so you get more
people who are working on these little
piles of stuff and there's no rules as
no structures self-organization right so
you keep going time goes by you've got
ten eight little groups right mmm
starting a little bit different now if
you are a manager or if you're someone
who's trying to look at the whole
picture it's a little bit harder to fit
these things together because these guys
are speaking German right these guys
might be speaking French these guys are
trying to do Esperanto Esperanto right I
don't know what I'm talking about okay
for the recipe is these don't know I'm
time for pretended I said something
really clever and then okay now when
you're at this view you're starting to
think at some point after six months
after a year you're going to start to
think okay we've got these ten teams
really smart people but there's only
certain pockets that have been paying
off for us these are paying off in terms
of value for customers paying off
actually in revenue paying off and
developing technologies that are adopted
by other two however your organization
just define success defines pay off
there's only certain areas that are
really paying off well you have to start
to think all right how do we maxim
as the resources we have we got these
smart people who are doing stuff it's
interesting but it's not helping these
core pillar things so then you know i'm
not going to worry about it it's not a
problem we're doing well then here goes
by six months go by you've got this big
system now and you can clearly see that
thirty percent forty percent of your
smart people or they're not directly
contributed these things so eventually
you start to say all right we need to
focus we need to figure out how we can
get these smart people who aren't being
as maximally effective to what we're
trying to get done as possible and how
do we move them around and you try to
bring them so they're closer maybe not
fitting all the way right there maybe
not like you know you don't want to you
don't want to put them in a hole but
you're trying to say okay you're kind of
working on this sort of thing these guys
are doing that so we're going to
organize you sort of towards that right
so going back to the beginning when
you're starting out you got little got
nine people organize the three minutes
of three versus 120 people organized
into six units of 20 the way that you
think about what efficiency means or
what effectiveness means or what value
means is different it's not
fundamentally different it's not you
should say these people are now work on
an assembly line but your scale the
weight when you start thinking about the
scale it changes how you measure value
it changes how you think about what a
good decision looks like so once you're
in a organization is big enough and you
have these really smart people who
initially at the beginning you felt
great you're smart you're motivated to
go do it when you get to this point
these things start to stand out more not
that they shouldn't be there but they
need to be there with a better reason
than why these guys were there and this
is natural I don't think there's
anything evil about this it's just even
if you got even if all these people are
brilliant you end up when you're
thinking of ok on the CEO on the manager
I'm the team leader the way you look at
these things changes
just as an example just for fun I went
back through the wayback machine is the
archive the internet archive and it took
a look at Google now actually Google is
a great job the main website you do a
great job you've done a great job of
minimizing the effect that kind of like
okay Group a group B group C we're going
to this stuff is exploding and expanding
but you can see the same kind of thing
happening just by looking at the I don't
know how Google is organized but I'm
guessing it's that kind of thing is
starting to happen already so this is
from ninety eight ninety and 2000 more
stuff got ad via advanced search and
preferences 2001 we now have the
introduction of tabs tabs are there
right advanced preferences language
tools a fifth tab news new right what's
good for ya fifth tab news is not new
anymore still there though it did well
right or earned its earned its wings
then in 2004 there's now more more
dreaded more okay because now there's
got this Google's not just this little
thing anymore you know little sister I'm
a man I'm guessing right smart team of
people a little bunch of people images
bunch of people two groups news more Oh
more okay now a little Buffalo people
right and this is was yesterday they got
more now this has changed now because
there's so much stuff here rooms bigger
right so if you were a UI designer if
you were a manager if you're looking at
the whole thing now you're not thinking
you're not as worried as much about
getting little teams of people that's
not your primary problem anymore getting
a little groups of people do smart
things your primary problem is now okay
how do we got all these things what's
the best way to shape them organize them
from a user interface perspective but
also from an internal organizational
perspective that it changes a change of
the dynamic so my an explorer is to
bring this back to the browser war stuff
and stuff I supposedly learned IE 2 is a
stupid little thing it was a stupid
little project HTML ism
markup language when he markup languages
there were right okay that will make it
will make one yeah you ten guys you're
smart yet go over there then two years
later it was being called the platform a
development platform like it was just
ridiculous you know how much attention
was being paid to this and at the time
one of the backstory things if you pick
up you either of those books you read
about this in 1997 Brad Silverberg was
the VP for the Division I was in the
internet platform tools division and the
plan that he was pushing for this
document in the book I'm not giving you
confidential information plan he was
pushing for was to make HTML and might
the window the Microsoft browser a
platform and to move away from windows
that's why there was a UNIX version of
ie was a mac version other versions were
planned we're going to move on windows
will leave behind and the big battle the
company at the time was whether we
should really be doing this or not Jim
Allchin according to the book I'm not
telling you this the book is telling you
this Jim Allchin was saying windows
windows is a free billion-dollar
franchise you can't bet against the
three billion dollar franchise we how
many of you could bet against guaranteed
three billion dollars a year right I
don't know if I could do that so he said
you can't do that they argued the argue
the ark apparently Jim Mullikin one and
by i-5 this team was lopped in half and
the browser became just the browser
again and all the windows people when
all the people were thinking about a
platform went back to windows sidebar is
done let's get back to what happens when
a team grows as much communication
doesn't scale as well as you'd like
three smart people in room five
somewhere people in the room can go very
quickly can't can't communicate very
effectively but at a fast pace once you
get to 30 smart people 50 smart people
it gets more complicated fred brooks in
his book mythical man month as this
thing called Brooks law it says every
time you add a person to a team the
total number of people total number of
links in the network of communication
goes up not arithmetic Lee but
geometrically so every person you add
starts this network gets bigger and
bigger so if you're not paying attention
to how your chant your team has changed
you
people who are still behaving as if
they're a local simple little unit when
really they're in this larger system
that is demanding a different way a
different style of communication from
them some other stuff in your to it
changes the way your rewards are given
out to when you're on a big team you
can't sew longer about hey look at this
great piece of code that I wrote look at
this great thing I designed it has to be
about how this thing contributed to the
bigger picture how this the thing you're
working on makes the whole thing work
better so that the dynamics change all
right so the purpose of specs whether
you write them or not there's a problem
that needs to be solved than most teams
then the problem is that before
decisions are made before 10 people or
five people or three people spend a week
working on something you want other
people to have a chance to review the
ideas and the concepts before they're
built it's just basic common sense right
before you go and build a house you draw
up a plan and you show it to someone
else who knows something about building
you said look at this you see any
problems with it i should change before
spin towards a thousand dollars building
a house now granted writing code is not
building a house it's not two hundred
thousand dollars it's not six months of
work granted but your time is precious
important when you're working at
something you want to have some way to
review your decisions before they're
implemented but you also if you're
working with other people you want there
to be a shared understanding what you're
trying to do like if you are in a
rowboat and the guy in front you is
rowing in one direction and you're
trying to ruin the other direction
you're not going to get anywhere as you
can both say hey before we start rowing
let's agree that we're going to turn
left okay well it's going to turn left
now you're off and running that
conversation if you're building
something more complicated than rowing a
boat is a specification that's what that
does that's the real purpose of specs
now you don't always need to write this
thing down but that conversation needs
to happen and the more people involved
or people that are affected by what
you're doing the more important some
kind of process for it is so I'm going
to skip what they I'm going to skip with
this that slide says now the thing that
people really don't like about specs
they don't this I think so that they
don't recognize it's a difference
between the actual writing of a
specification and what this
specification implies so what
people don't like about specs is that
when the time comes that you need to
write them it's because someone is
dependent on what you're doing that's
usually when there's no need arises so
on says hey John you know last time I
work with you you built that thing and
you changed it the day before it shipped
and all the documentation I wrote was
completely useless so this time can you
talk to me before you make any changes
okay how about even better let's agree
and what we're going to build so when I
start writing the documentation it's
going to match what's built that's a
dependency someone is dependent on what
you're doing when you're starting off
you're a small team is for me I 1 I 2
just like documentation there was no
localization there was no no one else
was consuming this stuff but when the
thing was successful people want to use
the thing once you start calling
yourself a platform people want to write
to your platform you now have customers
that are depending on what you're doing
so then specifications reflect that they
force you to be accountable to your
dependents so people blame
specifications I want to document all
this stuff but really they're just
frustrated having dependencies so it's
important to recognize the difference
once you're successful the longer you're
doing making stuff the same thing if the
version 6 of your thing version 8
working on it for two years you will
collect dependencies guarantee you the
more platform e you are the more
corporate clients you have for your
thing you will collect dependencies and
you will start to have to honor those
dependencies to continue to be
successful eventually you may have more
dependencies you can effectively manage
and you'll have to struggle to come up
with a way to continue to innovate
without breaking those dependencies on
inner explorer we step arguments all the
time about spec should be written this
way or there should be no specs jawline
and Sally and Bob or smart leave them
alone they'll figure it out don't write
anything down I have these arguments
about the Liam the the result not that
we had arguments about the price we have
Argus to the process and not why we were
doing the process so if you think you
don't need specs you need to ask
yourself okay how are we being effective
managing your dependencies are people
getting what they expect to get when
we're done great okay if you can answer
those questions without a specification
fine but if you're having problems with
those things specification some kind of
specification documentation that's going
to be your answer oops yeah follow
dependencies ok here we are managing
leading innovation can I get a time
check how we're doing on time what time
is it 22 12 I right on the nose okay
never thought of Microsoft person for
Microsoft person could be on time that's
exactly the time I thought it was going
to be okay one secret to being on time
is not to tell people what time you
thought it was see so now I can say it's
like a magic magic trick i can say that
i thought that that's what was going to
be all right and we're worried
innovation is not Holy Grail so I have
no idea what that means I got I got I
got okay so here's the deal so
innovation is a word that comes up a lot
in our industry oh good they're so
innovative Fred he's most innovative guy
I've ever met the word innovate is a
very specific real meaning it means
change it means doing something
different we assume in our industry we
it's like this underlying assumption
that innovative means better but it
doesn't lots of things get heralded for
being innovative even though they're
actually worse than what was there
before we believe in innovation even
when we have evidence to the contrary
that it's actually not going to be
useful to us so what you really want to
be focusing on is progress is this thing
better than what we had before that's
what's important and you can be better
without getting an award for the most
innovative idea of the month being
better it tends to be being better can
often be very pedestrian making lots of
little simple improvements that
collectively make something much better
if you disagree with me you don't
believe me or if you're told to innovate
anyway innovation doesn't guarantee all
the things that we like to believe that
it does having an innovative design for
something doesn't guarantee that it's
going to do well that it's going to make
customers happier that's going to sell
more it's going to improve your
technological infrastructure there's no
guarantee because
innovations change and it's risky when
you do something new you're not really
sure of all the effect is going to have
hard to predict when you're changing
stuff there's a book by the only other
point about innovation I'm going to make
is that there's a lot of evidence at
least from the business sector I'm not
saying that what wins in the marketplace
is going to be better or that you should
your only goal in life is to win in the
marketplace but if you are looking at
the history of business and the
technology business there's a lot of
evidence that the second wave tends to
win that being first and being the
innovator doesn't historically set you
up to be the person after five years
it's going to still be the leader in
that market there's a good book that
used to be very popular at Microsoft
while i was there i don't know if it
still is called the innovators dilemma
which is all about these first wave
second wave kind of trends the game
company atari comes up they were the
first to do this home game thing and
nintendo to kind of blew the mouth water
hey these modems anyone remember haze
modems right it used to be like this
ninety percent you know like
monopolistic kind of success and then
within a few years they were they were
destroyed there's lots of examples about
why that happens and some suggestions
about how you manage that but innovation
is not the Holy Grail what you want
instead is directed innovation you want
to be able to say here's a problem that
we know we want to solve we identified
that our customers suffer from this
problem we know that we can make money
from this problem and we think we have
the technology that will let us build
something that solves those things let's
innovate here this thing the only
innovation to be a you know Buckminster
Fuller Einsteinian I'm just going to be
smart and just come up with no that's
closer to research directed innovation
is a thing when you have the skills to
make new products and new ideas that's
things to be the sweet spot of creative
thinking so you come up with some you
start off by coming with some specific
thing you know you want to achieve that
might be achievable you define that and
you direct your innovation towards that
thing please have some examples yeah
Carly gets better mileage a mousetrap
that is you made effective and easy to
use a beer that has some certain
set of characteristics that you think is
important and once you have that the way
you do directed innovation which is
something that I experience for the
first time on i-4 I'll talk about that
in a second is you you come up with some
period of time you say alright here's
our schedule here's the amount of time
we have to explore different ideas for
this thing here's a matter of time after
that we have to refine the best ideas we
found and then at that point we're going
to that's we're going to make decisions
and we're going to build something and
ship it so you end up with something it
looks like this where you you have some
space you're creating I'm saying three
weeks that could be any number explore
alternatives narrow down alternatives
you started there with a specific
problem trying to solve you end up here
with a single definition for what you're
going to build you go in to build it and
during that time period you have hey
you're innovating you're coming up with
all kinds of different ideas are bounded
by some problem definition that's big
enough to give you room to innovate but
you know you're not gonna be thinking
about new kinds of you know processed
cheese or new nuclear weapon systems or
something right as you know there's some
framework for what you're directing your
innovative power is at actually don't
have time to talk about this so I'm
going to skip it the last thing I was
going to talk to you about is about
trade-offs oh I should mention okay I do
want to talk about that slide so an eye
for eye for was the first time he had a
big enough team we had enough resources
that we could innovate we had the chart
of a new platform integrate the internet
and desktop software that was her
charter so we try to do this thing that
I described but try to do this new thing
we try to this new thing where we
brought in we dedicate a time exploring
ideas and refining them but we had never
worked that way before we were used to
working in this very ad hoc manner so
what this diagram shows this is a
diagram this I didn't make this diagram
a woman named Virginia City r has this
diagram and it's about change human how
humans respond to change and change a
process you change a system for how
things are done this is a chronology of
from a psychological perspective
what tends to happen and if you're
starting here time goes by and this is
your three months further along then
when you when you when you start over
there and what this shows is at the
beginning you're at a certain level of
quality of performance ability to get
done whatever you're trying to get done
you need to do some kind of new element
we are going to do directed innovation
because Scott said so okay great team
starts doing that once you've asked you
for the work differently there tends to
be some fluctuation in their level of
performance because there's new things
they have to do there's new people they
have to talk to there's differences in
how they get stuff done or unfamiliar
they're going to make mistakes and a
level of performance tends to fluctuate
at some point hopefully reaches a point
where the change cliques in people get
how to be effective in this new way of
working and then performance improves
and now there's a new level of
comfortable status quo but you've
increased the level performance so I
show you this diagram not because it's
not strictly for innovation any time you
make a change in how work gets done this
pattern tends to surface like if you
start if you were to decide tomorrow to
start running five miles every morning
your story tomorrow morning when you
first did this you're going to suffer a
lot as you're getting used to this new
way of getting up every morning right
but at some point your body will adjust
you'll adapt so it's like it you'll get
coffee earlier whatever transforming
idea you get to a point we have a new
status quo so for me on inner explore
for we change so many things at the same
time we're doing this direct innovation
thing we're charted with being a
platform no one knows how to do that
right for me my memories of I for all in
here that's what I remember I don't
remember much about that don't remember
much about that I remember we did this
we got things a little bit better and we
shipped and then for I five we just
totally we had like our wave of
conservatism we had so we had so many
trouble with so much trouble working I
for with all the changes we made that we
pulled back on lots of aspects of how we
got work done and actually if there are
questions that can talk more about what
happened in I five but my point to you
is it even if you're doing something
smart you have an improvement that
you're making to a
project a way of working a system of
working it's just for yourself or for
your team that you will tend to see this
pattern happen and you have to have
enough confidence in the change that
you're making you're going to see your
way through some initial chaos and not
bail out and say you know what you're
right we shouldn't write specs or
whatever so last thing I'm going to talk
about is about trade-offs there are
certain fundamentals that surface again
again when you're making things it's not
just software you're making anything
there's certain fundamentals that you
will encounter the project management
one this is like project management
textbook 101 stuff is time scope quality
and cost any time you are working if you
want things to be higher quality you'll
trade that you have to pay for that with
higher costs if you want things to be
done in less time you either have to
narrow your scope or lower your quality
interrelated trade-offs between those
variables from a different perspective
when you're thinking about design or
you're thinking about direction strategy
similar trade-offs between the business
the customer and the technology that
you're using there's this diagram oh not
a diagram story about I for this is a
screenshot from Internet Explorer for
for those of you who never use an
explorer for returned all this crap off
which I was one of this is this major
this is a major investment for us this
was called the channel bar and what
happened at the time this is 1996-97 we
were told this is a platform the
industry Wired magazine push technology
new platform for doing stuff so we
invested so much energy and figuring out
how do we get businesses other
businesses to pay us money for placement
in the real estate that we have value in
desktop that's what this is so these
companies that deals with us MSNBC
Disney Warner Brothers the other ones
aren't filled in yet but we made deals
with all these companies because we felt
this was the future of Microsoft this is
the future of the industry advertising
something you guys are very familiar
right this is before this is 1986 so no
one knew what the hell they were doing
with advertising this seems ridiculous
now but everyone else was doing equally
ridiculous things but my point is we
made a trade off we went for the
business first without thinking about
the customer so we put this together and
we said all right we're going to put
this here what does it do not really
very much you click on these things and
it takes you to it was supposed to take
you to this special updated version of
their website custom made for this
platform but it turned out that there
really wasn't much they could do there
then they couldn't do on their own
website right so we had this whole
business model set up that had no
customer component to really there's no
customer value to want to go to the
desktop to look at this thing when they
could just go to this website so my
point is that you always have these free
trade offs there's three ways of looking
at doing anything the technology view
what can we build what would be cool to
build how can we make it right the
business view where can we make money
how can we make money how much money can
we make and the customer view what do
people need to do how are they going to
do it what problems do they have that we
can solve combined these shoes together
if you're smart you're working here or
you're building technologies they're
going to generate money I'm going to
satisfy customers synergy you've got
this nice sweet spot well we did on IA
for which we spend a lot of time here
really why didn't have a story
straightened out for what customers are
going to do what push was going to help
people do but we didn't let that stop us
in part because the industry was you
know stampeding in this direction and we
felt we had to follow but my point to
you is you're always looking at these
trade-offs and if you're smart when you
come up with a new idea for technology
you say hey this is so cool your next
set of questions have to be okay we're
just going to use this and why other
than other developers that think it's
cool all right which if you were if
you're developed if you're making
development tools that might be enough
because that's your market but if you're
trying to you know you're trying to
reach other a wider audience what are
they going to do how's it going to help
them and the second set of questions
okay God technology got stuff that we
know people need to do the technology
will help them with how do we monetize
this how to make this work that these
concepts are very fundamental you guys
probably conversations like this all the
time but I had never seen a diagram like
this until a few years ago that helped
me whenever I was confronted with a
business person who only thought about
this part of the world or host
confronted with an engineer who's only
thinking about this part of the world
laying it out this way shows oh so
having a good business idea that
customers might like we can't build
isn't good right some marketing people
spend their time here oh we don't worry
about that right now you to worry about
that right and you have some
technologists that spend their time here
all right which is a nice place to spend
you can think of all the you know open
source software free software that's
here all right that's great too it all
depends on looking at this framework
what the goal is your organization are
and how you're going to make it all fit
together okay so I am done with a wrap
up here and they'll take questions here
about Tim and it's 12 minutes left every
team every project is different so you
come in the door could also if you're
more philosophical you could say every
day is different you come in every day
the world's a little bit different
people are a little bit different if
you're paying attention people who are
effective tend to be ones were paying
attention what is different now and how
I responding to today instead of how I
want today to be process is not an evil
thing you have a process you're using
under what you call it and if you're
thinking about how to make your team
more effective how to make your team
happier how to be more effective
yourself you're thinking about processes
what do I talk to when what decisions do
i make how do i make them smart i talk
about some organizations as bird's eye
view lots of little small teams and then
once you're once you've got 10 small
teams you've now got a different set of
problems as organizations grow you start
to have to deal with a different kind of
working structure the last thing that i
mentioned it was about trade-offs if
you're really going to be effective at
making strategy decisions direction
decisions you have to see those three
circles and we work
the people who are working in who are
agreeing on the same place and those
three circles that you're trying to
target so with that I will oh just to
last thing a wrap up so if you like to
anything I said today you want to talk
more about it you can feel free to send
me mail i'll be at the brewery tonight
drinking beer so if you like beer you're
welcome to come I'll buy you a beer
there's a free chapter of the book so
the stuff I talked about towards the end
the business technology about how to
figure out what to do is a free chapter
the book is available it's all about
that level of stuff if you go to Scott
Burke and calm you can find the free
chapter up there and open the floor for
questions yeah seems like the place
where I he added the most value both the
customers and
HTML could you talk to how about both
where the ideas came from the technology
I mean there was his discussion about
thing called Cairo yeah would that let
it do it and also the strategy there was
just a notion of music you know beat the
pants out of Netscape with that one
picture ok so the question was the HTML
one of the key innovations of ie just
talked about how it was developed and
what the strategy was in an explorer had
several sub teams that all felt that
what they were doing with the key thing
that was gonna make the difference so it
was a team that was called the Trident
team it was responsible for the D HTML
engine there was one of the biggest
teams on the product that team came from
a group in the company that had been
doing forms engines a forms engine is a
tool and it's like a piece of you know
visual studio or macromedia dreamweaver
lets you do form layout microsoft has a
lot of experience and doing forms engine
stuff so the people who worked on d HTML
it seemed like a no-brainer microsoft
knows how to make development tools for
doing forms layout so it seemed like a
there was a team that was doing a
different forms technology to that team
came over and became the d HTML team so
team that already knew how to do that
stuff so the thinking was we know better
than most of the companies in the world
how to make forms type development tools
the fact that has to be done in HTML
whole thing we'll figure that out but
that was the that was the first step in
terms of the actual choices that were
made d HTML I didn't I wasn't a program
manager on the D HTML team so I can't
give you what their thinking was at the
time but it was about horsepower trying
to make as much value out of the
platform as you could and present that
to developers and let that be the way
that you got adoption we have more
functionality more value for developers
the dinosaur question close but that's
part i guess it seemed like is probably
a big story in there that venti sure was
really difficult for netscape to to copy
room right to replicate it took ten
years to get yeah that but he thing was
a technology that Microsoft knew very
well how to make forms tools for
developers so there was an advantage
that that was I think that was a primary
thing it was just as a strength that
Mike's have had in the company took it
and said go you know add that in and it
seemed that you already knew how to do
it other questions yes
this I'm curious what was the situation
with ie were thinking of a three part
sorry what was mr. oh let me I have a
few books Eva way i'll give them to
people ask questions here you go sir
since you aren't happy with the answer
at least get a book uh strategy for
being free it was anybody okay as soon
as it became a market your battle it's a
market sure battle giving my stuff for
free is an ancient method for competing
right not saying it's a good method or
fair I'm not but it is an old method
right you give stuff away until you get
enough people exposed to your thing and
eventually they're willing to pay for it
or use it and say the other guy I don't
think it was a brilliant strategy it's
very basic strategy if you're the new
pizza shop in town you're going to give
stuff away for free this heavily
discounted coupons grand opening right
same it's the same basic idea other
questions nessa said about look when i
was at microsoft just like 6-9 months
ago there's almost no one working on IE
anymore yeah well what happened to more
absolutely no my understanding i left
the i-team in 99 so right before version
5 shipped i had moved on so that was
before the team disappeared so i don't
know the full story but i can tell you
my impression my impression was that the
war was over we have 200 but towards it
you know marines this we've wad the
flags in the ground other battles to
fight get these Marines back in the
field that's all it was that there is no
there's no incentive I'm putting my
telepathic hat on I don't know this for
sure no one showed me there was no
incentive to continue investing as much
money and resources into continuing to
develop something that wasn't a
competitive issue anymore it's a
conservative view of the world right
heck we've won we're not concerned
anyone's going to be a threat let's move
on and that's what creates the window
for a Firefox right there was a huge
window there nothing had happened on IE
for four years right the battlefield is
empty right so that created the
opportunity for what's going on now
which i think is great that's my
understanding three you have 300 people
it was expensive expensive 300 people's
a lot of people right put them on
something it's going to help us with the
next thing that we're worried about ya
did you use Microsoft Project good
manage the budget so very people there
were not many teams at Microsoft in my
view like people I came across that use
project I think you had a handful of
people that were like the integrators
the people who are thinking about how do
we get these 20 component teams to line
up they use project for people who are
more feature developer managers like
myself we're building stuff we're less
worried about the huge integration tree
now it was much more informal we would
some people would use it but it wasn't
something where you would pass around
project documents all the time the
project team uses project but most most
other teams didn't now Microsoft is not
like no one tells you at least when I
was there no one told you how to use any
particular tool and most Microsoft teams
tended to think that what everyone else
was doing was bad so there's a lot of
like the windows team you know we're
office we know what we're doing windows
so it's not surprising that there wasn't
people weren't using these things other
questions yes sir there's an exception
to that yes you were forced to use dev
studio and that's quite dev studio got
to be so good right I don't know I have
enough experience to give you a
confident answer I'd say that it was if
there weren't that many other
development tools for C C++ stuff on
windows anymore Borland there weren't
that many tools around anymore I don't
really know yeah it was bad until
Microsoft this must be using from the
works of those involved in culture that
especially if you're in the organization
you use it and but that doesn't mean
that once the thing is done you'll
continue to use it yeah other questions
yes sir what is do you think Firefox has
it be i'ii take it it's a much better
product I mean hands down there's no
question I mean there's a beating in
terms of market share I think you have
to look at the there's so many
battlefields there's the consumer
battlefield individuals who download
stuff so that's why so much of so much
of firefox success is with the
development community people who are
choosing on their own but when you get
to you want to get past ten percent
market share to 40 you're talking about
General Motors you're talking about
Safeco you talk about companies they
have 30,000 desktops and one person is
going to make that decision and it's a
whole nother ballgame now you're talking
about total cost of ownership upgrade
costs it becomes a different thing so
for firefox too depends what the goals
are to be the market share leader it's
going to need corporate adoption and
that you have to sell it corporations
differently Microsoft is like IBM is to
be it's a very safe choice for people to
now use Microsoft well no one's going to
fire you for making that choice to go
and use this new thing is startup open
source it's a different dimension so but
it's a better product though so that's
going to help ease
all those things yeah does she get a
report yeah well my question was does
can I have another book uh I have a two
I to left hey it depends how good your
question is when's all your questions oh
ok but God ask your question that was
the only question oh I'm sorry I can't
condone that I can't I can't I can't
allow that I'll give you a chance to
cope with another question blue this
little piece of change how do you think
how much was middle management and how
much do you think that impacted overall
direction of the company's diversion um
the first thing I will say is that every
in mind while i was there every group of
microsoft was very different very
different the external perception which
is probably something you guys feel is
that they're all like everyone thinks
even when I was there Microsoft is you
know org didn't do everything is the
same you wear the same shirts you and my
experience was totally different that
every group had a lot of autonomy and
worked very differently so as towards
the end after i left i think that
there's it's become more systematic it's
still different you go to the office
group and it's a very different way of
working then in windows and in the
developer division then in the gate xbox
still very different so it depends where
you are but on the whole the company's
continued to grow i left it was probably
40,000 people it's now 60 thousand
people when you're at that scale I'm
about some of the factors here the way
management works tends to go towards
bureaucratic pens too so i would i would
say it's more bureaucratic more
conservative harder for people with
harder for executives who wanna do
something radically different harder for
them to do it than it was still probably
better than the fortune 500 i'm guessing
not that i've worked there it's probably
better but it's worse than I remember it
but for what I've learned I think that's
just the nature of companies getting
bigger you will tend to see more of that
as
you get bigger not always the bed of
your management the bed your CEO the
more you can protect against that but as
you get bigger you will start to see
more that happen it's just ball averages
or something other questions good
question yes sir in the front I'm not
opposed oh just isn't it for questions
yeah I mean that was at the beginning
and that was one of the things that
everyone said was a certainly perception
that that was they said navigator was
the end of Microsoft that was thing they
did that having been that right they
said this is the future you don't care
about what don't care but desktop
anymore instead of sending my java job
had the same potential to be just
everything was gone so Microsoft was
very worried about Java and there was
lots of talk about maybe the whole
balance of this effort should be on this
Microsoft Java effort and where the Java
effort should live bounced around in the
company should be part of the
development tools division should be
part of the platform group right so
there's a lot of fear about Java I
didn't work on the group that worked on
Java and that's a whole there should be
a book about that because that whole
Java of Sun version of Java microsoft
version of Java thing the tactics for
that whole thing was very complicated
and very nasty I didn't I don't know the
details of it though but that make for a
better book than know what those two and
i right I think yeah in the back in
Microsoft I don't think it'd be much
different I think I'd probably have to
think through who who I know like what I
said at the beginning I would have to
think through who I knew that was there
at the same time and make sure that what
I said make sure I wouldn't end up
upsetting anyone that was in the room at
least right but there's nothing here
some of the stuff I said I said while I
was there I for was a very interesting
case study for lots of reasons lots of
weird stuff happened on it so I've
talked about it there before off the top
of my head I don't think I change very
much I think if I was talking to Mike
recite probably go into more dirty
details maybe because it would mean
something more of the people they would
people would know the reference is
better this i knew i was talking to an
outsider audience so i tried not to talk
i didn't use any vp names or you know
manager names of people would wouldn't
know here yeah there you
okay that's not a thing right don't get
me wrong no one told me that's what they
did that's what I think happened yeah
the one the warring windows in IE too
there's lots of wars right i mean
there's lots of left there are lots of
wars then I mean you can look at least
look at Microsoft such a big come
Microsoft wants to be like GE right they
want to have interest in so many
different businesses a general electric
makes refrigerators and jet engines
right the Microsoft wants and is wants
to be like that so video games is one
right Xbox is a trailing market right
then you have the whole search engine
thing which Microsoft is trying now for
the seventh time to try to get involved
in right then you have the whole
advertising and which Microsoft doing a
better job with now through msn that
better job they've done historically
advertising you've got um the home Sony
Microsoft has a thing for sony they want
to compete with Sony so II home getting
control over the other entry points into
the whole how you use technology says
lots you went through the division list
there's like seven major divisions of
Microsoft there's a war for each one and
Microsoft trails and most of them right
or their second or third or worse and
mostly I'm sorry no the windows team is
very well suited for business windows
team in the office team generate like
eighty percent of the seventy percent of
the company's revenue so that's major
foundation of the company windows and
office look at the financial statements
every year it tells you how much revenue
each group generates so I'm not telling
any secrets so windows and office other
questions about microsoft project
management right above here
