you know present our work at the Free
Software Foundation Europe to you give
you a little bit of insight on who we
are what we do because when I might look
at the coffee machine he wasn't even you
know too aware of what we've been doing
or that we've been around for so long so
he figured out that might be true for
some others as well and figured out this
could be an interesting talk for you
indeed when let's see well we get this
to the next slide yeah okay let's hope
this keeps working anyhow when talking
about the Free Software Foundation I
think what most of you would be able to
come up with is that the free software
foundation was around forever almost
it's been found at 1985 by Richard
Stallman who in the early 80s decided
that we must have a free software
operating system that he would call new
fog news not unix and he proclaimed that
in 1983 started working in 1984 quit his
job at MIT so MIT would have no
copyright claims on the new system that
he was about to write and in 1985
founded the Free Software Foundation you
know near to MIT for some time you know
they were using office space there to
take care initially of the legal needs
of the new project to make sure that you
would have a legally solid project even
in 10 20 30 years with all the you know
legal evolution that was going on it was
very clear that you had to have a
legally solid project that was how the
Free Software Foundation initially
started it is the maintainer and
protector of the gnu general public
license which is the most often used
free software license in the world
depending on who you ask fifty to
seventy percent of free software is
under the GNU GPL which invented the
copyleft principle that is
whatever is free has to remain free the
new lgpl the lesser general public
license is the little sister if you will
that allows to UM combine it more with
some proprietary programs but I'm sure
that many of you will know that any way
it is and always was the fiduciary and
manager of the new project which is the
basis of new linux that you know is used
rather widely these days around the
world and it has very soon realized that
this project could only succeed really
if people were to understand why
software freedom and freedom in the
digital age are relevant and important
and so the Free Software Foundation grew
to essentially the first organization
that was really dedicated towards
promoting freedom in the digital age
this is mid 80s most people had not even
realized that there was an issue at all
and Richard set out to do this the Free
Software Foundation when you think about
it and the decision and statements it
makes much of it are essentially all of
it is dedicated to us the very long-term
vision it's always trying to ultimately
reach a stage where free software will
be the norm where no person is ever
forced to use non-free software ever
again and sometimes you have to make
difficult tactical decisions in this
regard sometimes even decisions that the
community disagrees with or finds over
the top or you know too extreme you know
that there were discussions about
whether we needed a free desktop whether
you know depending on QT which was
proprietary at the time we're good
enough this brought about you know
ultimately and there were discussions
about many other issues where the FSF
has always tried to take the route that
would ultimately give us freedom even if
it is more inconvenient in the short
term convenience the short term was
never the
all it was trying to make sure that in
the long term we would have free
software and free software would be
available to all hmm we need to find a
better way to do this this was true
until about two thousand armed for the
FSF alone meaning the free software
foundation established in the united
states and 85 but the world is changing
fast it's been changing rapidly in the
late 90s and several of us realized that
indeed we would have to do something
about this because you see the success
of free software creates new challenges
we were seeing that the free software
community was growing rapidly it was
growing rare very very fast and we were
also seeing that those who were
previously laughing at us thinking that
we would never succeed we're starting to
take us extremely seriously you know if
coined this as the giant awakes because
we've been suddenly attracting attention
that we knew we would attract at some
point in time but that obviously has to
influence what we do and free software
had a lot to offer free software is an
incredibly valuable resource think about
all the knowledge that is in free
software this is a huge pool the huge
reservoir of knowledge and functionality
ultimately as well this one also works I
just hope it doesn't go on by itself um
but all of these while you know in a way
being good in signs of success also mean
that we have to think about the
consequences of this because it creates
you know a bigger community that also
means we have to explain to the people
who come in
into that community what free software
is about so people don't forget where we
come from and understand why we are who
we are and where we are because if we
forget this knowledge then ultimately we
will only have a short term victory
because people will forget and will then
later be easily swayed away to other you
know nifty gadgets if you will without
ever realizing why they should have
stayed with free software at that point
the giant that we awoke attacks for
software on various levels in 2000 we
saw this really being more and more
massive it's based on law it's based on
politics it's based on technology in all
these areas simultaneously we've become
under more and more pressure and since
we have so much to offer there are a lot
of people who would be willing to take
all that and proper ties it for
themselves there are always people out
there who are willing to take all that
and have no problems with not giving
anything back which you know with the
non copyleft license is fine but the GPL
I believe has also been so successful
because it establishes a balance between
taking and giving that works in an
imperfect world so all of this to us
meant the Free Software Foundation as an
idea had to learn it had to adapt to
this new scenario it had to grow
and indeed that is a process that began
in 2001 today we have several free
software foundation's around the world
the first one outside the united states
was the Free Software Foundation Europe
but shortly after people in india
launched the Free Software Foundation
India and last year the Free Software
Foundation Latin America was founded by
a group of people in Latin America so we
enact indeed now not only have one free
software foundation we have four of them
all of these based on the same idea of
long-term free software work all of them
working together but this is very
important it's not like one was the
subordinate of the other this network of
free software foundation's is a global
network of equals who are independent
from each other legally financially and
personally we have to my knowledge at
the current point in time no overlap at
all in people between those free
software foundation's we talk to each
other regularly every day and we share
our ideas in order to have you know the
common goal that we work for but at the
same time we've gone to the network
because we know that now it is no longer
sufficient to take down one organization
legally or with whatever means you have
to stop the idea of the Free Software
Foundation you will have to take down
all four in very different areas and
that is a test that is beyond any of our
enemies that's by design
but I wanted to talk to you about the
Free Software Foundation Europe which is
the one that i founded in 2001 with
several people from the european free
software community in close connection
with richard stallman we are a European
NGO a non-governmental organization or
civil society organization depending on
the political classification that you
want to use and the structure we have
chosen is one that is specifically
designed to be stable reliable and
transparent we try to be as transparent
as possible with everything we do we put
everything online that we possibly can
including our finances you can find all
of that on our webpage you can find who
we are who works for us in which
projects all of that is public at the
same time of course as you will see we
also undertake rather difficult um legal
actions as well as political actions
that sometimes make it necessary to have
a very strong internal group that you
know shares that knowledge and then you
know it filters out towards the branches
we are currently active in ten european
countries we have 25 people in our core
team from nine countries i believe yes
that was as of yesterday um that core
team contains ten members of the General
Assembly who are the legal buddy the
legal core if you will of the whole
thing usually you don't need your
statutes if things go well but if they
don't go well you need somebody to
ultimately be other responsibilities and
you need to have something in place that
allows you to you know keep the
organization running even when the
consensus based system should fail at
some point in time because normally we
operate on consensus of all the active
team members which means that these 25
people are the consensus basis on which
we work these are the people who are
included in
consensus building and that makes up
ninety-five percent of all the decisions
in the Free Software Foundation Europe
including who should join that team and
who should leave the team and we have 13
associate organizations in 10 countries
and also some outside of Europe in fact
we have one in Argentina and 100 pan we
do thus form part of a very large global
network and we do communicate very much
on a log on a local as well as global
level because these days nothing ever
happens only in one place you know you
have to you know know what's going on on
all these levels because otherwise what
you don't know on one level can really
hit you hard on the other we have at the
current point in time five full-time
employees and to half time employees we
will have another full-time employee
working for us in a month or two and
indeed we are rather happy about that we
do have hundreds of volunteers and
fellows who help occasionally a trade
shows who support our work whom help us
reach out to people explain certain
issues who give talks about FSA and what
we do at local user groups so this kind
of work we are by those measurements the
largest free software foundation in the
world I would say we don't have as much
money and as many full-time employees as
our older sister organization the FSF in
the United States has but in terms of
Workforce I would probably say we are
the largest we definitely are the
largest in terms of countries included
we are the only FSF that has managed to
include so many countries and different
cultures under one roof
and these are areas of activity now I've
left away some of the things that you
will definitely know because obviously
the glue project is still important to
us it is mainly maintained and
coordinated by our sister organization
in the United States still they do most
of that work we support them as much as
we can we have several new developers
ourselves including for instance vaniqa
who is a founding member of FSF europe
the author of the new PG so I've only
listed the parts that you may not know
or may not be entirely aware of this
includes United Nations the European
Union obviously the national politics
issues legal work we do some business
work we have several essentials that we
always have to take care of anything
there is the fellowship so let me start
on the global level let me start at the
United Nations the Free Software
Foundation Europe has done quite a bit
of work at the UN for wandering the
world summit on the information society
the WSIS i'm not aware who of you has
followed these processes but the UN
generally holds summits on certain
issues you know an environment and
gender and so on and this one was the
one about the information society trying
to come to a global understanding on how
a global information society should look
and what should be the rules and how do
we bring this forward how do we help
other people join that information
society and how should all these things
you know interconnect it was a dual face
summit one phase 2003 in Geneva the
other face was November last year in
Tunis you have to understand that most
of the work though does not happen
during those summits which are like few
days essentially when you come to the
summit everything is decided the summit
is the show that's where you know the
heads of states come and you know shake
hands and everybody smiles and is happy
the part where the work happens are the
preparatory meetings the prep comes
these are week-long conferences
sometimes I've spent two weeks in a row
in Geneva
you know every day from seven till
midnight to you know work out it's a
exactly how should the global
information society look we've been
trying to push free software very much
because free software was one of the
controversial issues the u.s.
governmental delegation contained
multiple Microsoft employees who were
flying under the flag of the US
delegation and they were pushing very
strongly for free software to be deleted
entirely from all the documents they did
not want to see any reference to free
software in those documents at all open
standards should be anything that we use
essentially um from Microsoft's you
point that is so this is rather critical
because you see the work that happens
there once there's an established
consensus on that level where all the
states have said okay let's agree to
this it becomes unbelievably hard to
ever get them to consider this again
because they say oh god it's such a pain
we've discussed this for five years
couldn't you show up when we were
discussing this we really don't feel
like bringing this up again because if
we bring this up again then they will
start talking about I don't know trade
politics towards our country will talk
about you know lowering tariffs in
international trade for certain products
that they try to to get into our markets
so people on that political level really
don't want to open that can ever again
once they've closed it which makes it so
important to be there when they work on
it because whenever you have such a
consensus people will always reference
to it they will always say you should
agree to this because you have already
agreed to this five years ago in that
conference and then people will look up
the document saying oh yeah indeed we
agree okay so we can debate it here we
don't want to open it again water is
gone somebody stole my water
okay thank you the work we've been doing
for free software obviously um has been
in the civil society context I myself
have been co-coordinating the patents
copyrights and trademarks working group
of civil society together with consists
muggy from France and I've been starting
up the European caucus of civil society
which is the the gathering of the
European civil societies including the
the trade unions and other other groups
that in this context are actually civil
society validly the the large German you
need largest union in the world i think
is part of civil society during such an
event and indeed i was part of the
german governmental delegation during
the first phase of the summit on behalf
of the german civil society coordination
circle so I could actually enter work
groups that were only for governmental
people out of this world summit cane
among others the Internet Governance
forum which if you haven't heard about
it yet that's not a surprise because it
doesn't really exist yet it's now being
started up it's coming out of this world
summit and while Internet Governance
originally most of us thought okay this
is DNS because it's always been about I
can the discussion people have been
pushing to get that discussion into
other areas including cyber crime and
spam regulation now I'm sure that all of
you at Google understand that if you do
spam regulation there is endless
potential for screwing up the Internet
entirely because most of what is
proposed as anti-spam remedies do really
nothing against spam but is very
effective in terms of monopolizing the
internet for one company and that is
precisely what some companies try to
push in that scope now and that's why we
are again they're trying to prevent that
sort of thing the first meeting will
happen October in Greece this year
the next one will probably be in Brazil
and we're definitely planning on going
there another organization that is
rather unknown but extremely important
is the world intellectual property
organization wipo this is where all the
global copyright and patent and
trademark talks are conducted this is
where the treat is administrated this is
the organization that actually educates
the national people who then educate
people in their countries about these
issues this is the place where you know
the the trend to monopolization of
knowledge had its its church if you will
this is where much of it originated and
traditionally this has always been
towards you no more monopolies more
restrictions stronger enforcement always
and I don't think that is exactly what
we need indeed free software post a real
hard challenge for them because you see
it violates everything they believe in
we give up some control voluntarily
because it's good for everybody
including ourselves those of us who give
up the control benefit from this as well
and this is something that completely
violates the throw like more monopoly is
always better idea that you know many
people at wipo had for a long long time
this is changing now slowly very slowly
we've become an observer organization of
the wipo so we can actually sit in
during the meetings and talk we can make
statements ourselves and we do we've
been yeah and indeed they're not always
very happy with our statements but they
thank us anyway you know exactly
we are working with an alliance that is
under the label access to knowledge
which includes you know many different
civil society organizations from
different areas including medicine
including music publishers and so on
trying to get ultimately to a treaty on
access to knowledge trying to get away
from the you can only do things that you
know limit stuff we want also a treaty
that actually allows things and says
this has to be explicitly possible
whether this will ever get to a treaty
stage is one question if it doesn't it's
still a good activity because it allows
us to raise that issue with certain
people and we've been trying to push
wipo to evaluate the global patent
system in order to find the areas that
should not be patentable starting with
software we've been making those
statements in the plenary and the first
countries have started picking them up
saying this would be a very useful thing
to do so we will keep pushing this
together with other organizations as
well because ultimately then this will
happen if enough countries ask for it
something like this will be done and
personally I believe this would be an
excellent thing and it would ultimately
also benefit the patent system which you
know is breaking apart we do give
lectures at young TED conferences United
Nations Commission's trade and
development and World Bank a UNESCO
frequently I've been speaking at a World
Bank course repeatedly the past years
like there's always a World Bank course
in torino on for world bank managers you
know who managed the world bank finance
projects and I've always been invited to
teach them about free software and tell
them why they should use free software
in those projects why they should push
free software with World Bank resources
in their local projects so there is some
process on on that level as well
ultimately all of this work the entire
UN
is incredibly slow tedious and once it
reaches you it's almost unstoppable the
things we talked about today including
for instance the broadcasting treaty at
the Y pillow and at other things all
these issues they will reach us not
tomorrow but you know in 10 years but
when they do reach us it will almost be
impossible to stop them entirely because
then all the countries have agreed to
them and then no one wants to discuss it
ever again they want to implement it and
you know have it off the table they
don't want more work because they have
enough other issues to worry about as
well so please no thank you that means
we have to be at this level if we try to
make a you know long-term difference we
have to be at this level even if that
work only shows in 10 years if it makes
our work on the on the European and
national level easier in 10 years um you
know that is good that is necessary
because it's hard enough on the European
level to begin with it as well as the
national levels we don't have to make it
harder for ourselves by ignoring the
global level where much of this
originates which brings me to the
european union european law often
overrides national law that's also it
also at least partially part of the idea
we do have legislation happening on your
peeing level or EU level i should say
that is rather significant for us
software patents i think it's clear to
everyone here in this room personally i
started working on software patents in
1999 that's a really long time and i
really wish it had it were completely
over it isn't with one the big battle as
far as you could win that um although we
would have really preferred a directive
against software patentability instead
of no directive at all but it's coming
back and it would they will try to sneak
it
anyway so we have to be worried but for
all these these works that we do we
always have to be careful and how we
approach them for software patents this
is a very good example of how we have to
work in changing alliances because if
you take these two I've put software
patents on then I've put I prayer to on
there which is the IPR enforcement
directive second part it's it's called
differently but internally we called I
prayer too because it's it's sort of the
leftover scratch together from ipad one
that they didn't get approved which you
know introduced hard harsher punishments
for copyright violations and other
issues I prayer to now tries to create
criminal law for copyright infringement
on a commercial level as well as patent
infringement on a commercial level now I
mean not only does the combination of
the two really you know have a chilling
effect if you think about you know the
fact that you cannot write software
without violating a software patent if
you now write software commercially and
commercial infringement always is a
criminal issue that means the government
has to actually um you know investigate
and enforce this every programmer and
every manager of every IT company
ultimately you know has to wonder how
far away they are from jail because
sometimes you also infringe without
knowing and that's indeed part of the
whole Peyton minefield idea now the
Alliance's that we have to fight against
these two are very different because I /
to nobody wants that at least from from
the area we work with the software
companies don't want it the proprietary
software companies don't want it the
very large ones they definitely don't
want it IBM doesn't want it it's it's a
very clear thing and we can even work
together with the business software
lines on this issue who otherwise you
know doesn't really like us too much
because they would rather see like to
see software patentability introduced
which we on the other hand don't like so
you have changing alliances in this
field that you have to try to pick
according to the fight you're fighting
for software patents we deliberately
chose to stay in the background for
instance because we knew that if we took
the leading role on that fight people
would try to display this oh it's only
those free software freaks against you
know software patents all the other nice
guys they want them so we took a step
back at the FFI I took the lead this was
a strategic decision made by Bennett
writer Houghton pills and myself in two
thousand we discussed this in two
thousand and said okay ffi I should take
the lead because ffi I can work with the
proprietary companies as well that's why
the ffii has been working visibly on
that level we've been doing what we
could to support that work and you know
work in the background as much as we
could but we've been relatively careful
to not show ourselves too much to a
point where it became clear that this is
not an issue of free versus proprietary
software but this affects everybody but
this was a strategic decision at that
time and it's important to understand
that to understand why sometimes we have
to take a certain position in a certain
way to make sure that we have the
largest possible alliance against
something that might harm us there is
the Microsoft antitrust case in the EU
which I hope you will have heard of it's
been all over the news it's been going
on for several years now the European
Commission has started to investigate
the behavior of Microsoft based on
complaints by real networks and sun
microsystems because there's two parts
to this case there is the media bundling
part is you know Microsoft putting the
windows media player on every single
platform trying to kill the encoder
market by making sure that every single
windows that is shipped can play windows
media and thus whoever wants to encode
something knows that they can have you
know windows media on ninety-five
percent of all the desktops and
therefore they don't have to bother
about the real player which would need a
one-click install
that has worked painfully well
unfortunately the windows media format
although technically worse than the real
media format on although both are
proprietors from that regard we don't
really care about them but still windows
media has essentially kicked real out of
the out of the field and in fact reels
out of the case by now because they
settled with Microsoft for 500 million
euro roughly and lost the interest in
the case left that case and now that
thing is going on by itself real has
invented itself in trial is a new
company its changes business model the
new real player comes with windows media
support natively so you can tell that
there's no more reason to ever encode
anything in real because even if you
want to use the real player it will play
windows media so that is a really
dangerous situation also for free
software because the whole media field
is very mind with software patents so we
need to intensify our efforts in this
area it's rather bad right now we have
to do something about it the other part
and that's the part that we've been most
active in is about the protocols between
clients and servers you know the active
domain controllers the part that samba
does in the free software world or also
you know for Windows desktops and Samba
while being excellent software had to
rely on reverse engineering for most of
its work because Microsoft after
initially trying to you know get a
standardization effort on the way under
the sips heading the the common internet
file system and starting the sips
conference themselves in attending it
for the first years once they were
enough in the market that they could use
the desktop monopoly to push everyone
else out of that server market they did
so they stopped attending the conference
and they've started tweaking the
protocols in ways that suddenly and the
other server implementations couldn't
interoperate anymore now this is the
part that we've been investigating with
the Commission in fact we brought in the
Samba team as technical experts to the
case
and I've been following the case up to
the final decision by the Commission
which meant that Microsoft should
publish its protocols and um pay a fine
which was the largest fine do you ever
like 500 million euro but obviously for
Microsoft that's not a lot of money so
they paid that in fact they paid gladly
much much more because they pay 2.5
billion to son so son would lose his
interest in the case and withdrew they
paid 500 million to novell so no
Bellwood loses interest in the case and
withdrew and they paid 20 million to the
sea CIA so they would lose the interest
in the case and withdrew so at some
point in time the FSF II was almost the
only third party on the side of the
Commission in this case fortunately now
for the latest round the esis
organization on european level has you
know joined us which is a large group
with major industry in it that's been
founded essentially as an anti Microsoft
group if you will um so we're no longer
alone but at some point in time it
really looked extremely bad for the
Commission and if you are in the
position of the Commission you have to
ask yourself do you fight this fight to
the end or do you try to get some
outcome some settlement where you don't
lose your face we are not the one who's
kicked in from the court and so it was
rather important for us to stay in the
case and indeed our role in this case
has been quite central in the way it's
been communicated to explain also to the
media what this case is about because we
can talk much more freely than any of
the other parties can we can explain
this as it is we don't have commercial
interests to protect and also we cannot
be bought there's no money in the world
that would be enough to buy us out of
this case the case has been a solid
money loser for us because no one wants
to support that case give us antitrust
law deals and corpses and nobody wants
to get near to stinking corpses but at
the same time there's
nothing that anybody could do to make a
stop and especially the Commission has
been rather happy about that for
Microsoft they've been spending much
much more in this case then they were
ever find they've been paying two people
to get people out of the cour case
multiples of what they've been fined and
they will pay much more heavily if they
did not have to publish the protocols
because they wish to employ the same
strategy that they've been employing in
these markets think of Netscape as well
they wish to employ those strategies in
order to conquer the next market in the
next of the next in the next you know
now they think about you know mobile
phone set-top boxes you know in the
Internet at large everything you know
there's this nice deformer quote you
know it's like we've conquered the
desktop we've conquered the server and
now we will conquer the web they would
like to do that and this case is the
last one of the antitrust cases really
the last of the big ones everything else
has failed so this case is the last one
that can establish what is adequate
behavior in the market and what is not
and that's why we think this case is so
important that's why we actually put a
lot of effort into this case to make
sure that it works in carlow Piana our
lawyer who's been working for virtually
no money in fact um amazingly well and
with an efficiency that is unbelievable
based on trying to work for something
that he believed just as the rest of us
has been doing excellent job and he
cannot be thanked enough for that in
fact all of us here Oh him
do we get the next slide yes but the EU
is not only about defense it's also
about offense if you will we do project
to you know actively bring things
forward one of them was the ignore
project stands for egg new linux audio
distribution because it's been a new
linux distribution based duel flavor
based on debian or Red Hat depends on
what you want it's a one hundred percent
free software distribution if it's
called a cannula it cannot contain
proprietary software at all FSF he holds
a trademark on it and has issued it
under a trademark license that says if
you want you if you can pass L it you
can do anything you want you can do
derive versions you know do whatever you
want you can use the name a Google you
can use the trademark Abdullah you can
even play with it you can modify it
slightly you know to your to your liking
all of that is fine but you cannot do
one thing you cannot use this name to
actually promote proprietary software so
ignores always one hundred percent free
and if you ever find provider package on
aguila please let us know and if you see
somebody distributing something under
aguila that is proprietary please let us
know because we have also with its
license given authority to all our
sister associations to enforce that
trademark license every FSF in the world
is entitled to enforce that license
Aguila provides professional audio
environment it provides professional
audio people if you will musicians
studio employees and so on with
professional audio capabilities based on
the gnu/linux which by the way also
technologically has certain advantages
including an extremely low latency the
latency of a new linux system can be
tuned down to something that is way
below that of a microsoft system for
instance and it is part of our work to
bring free software to the desktop and
into the niches you know we have a very
good operating system it works extremely
well and we don't really have to worry
about using gnu/linux on a server
everybody knows you can do that
everybody does it but we now have to
move forward to the desktop because
Microsoft has demonstrated that the
desktop ultimately drives everything
that comes behind and that you can use
that to conquer other markets so we have
to not only stop that behavior we also
have to make sure that we do make our
stand on the desktop itself and we have
another project coming up self
scientific education learning and
freedom this is about freedom in
education it's a project that will have
its kickoff meeting early july this year
in fact rather soon it's funded by the
commission as aguila was and it's again
a European consortium also with players
from around the world Latin America and
India included to bring free software
into education more there is some good
stuff already but we want to consolidate
that and to create free software
educational material which means
material that are free software
themselves so you can you know adapt
them use them learn from them use them
yourself build things on top of them and
also knowledge about free software you
know to teach people about free software
and then of course there's our everyday
work first of all Europe while it's
still you know it it still consists of
countries and there is countries who are
at least to us part of Europe but not
part of the EU Switzerland is one
example of them and so we do have to
work on the national levels as well
there is no alternative to work on the
national level you have to work the
national level otherwise you know
ultimately what you do on the higher
levels above will not come into full
fruition you have meetings with
politicians advising them on certain
issues briefing them sometimes if you
can and trying to explain to them what
are the issues with certain criteria
very often these politicians will not
agree with you on one very much but at
least sometimes you can get them to
listen and sometimes you can explain
some things to them not always not
always to the full extent but there are
ways to do this and we've been working
with various politicians over the years
from various parties because that is one
of the fundamental principles of FSF II
that we say free software must never be
associated too closely with any
political party free software belongs to
everybody we talked to everybody in the
Democratic spectrum that is no matter
how much we may personally like them or
not like them or how much we personally
agree with their politics or disagree
with their politics free software is
transcendent it has to be it has to be
neutral from the party political
perspective and that's why we've always
been extremely careful while we've been
working with some parties more closely
than with others because they were more
interested that we have no preference
ourselves with whom we work we try to
approach everybody equally
and we have the national initiatives
there is the German health card that is
security wise a total disaster if you
want to read up on a really really
horrible project i invite you to to
check that out because one of the german
free software activists we work with too
much mouse has been digging himself deep
into this issue and he's been finding
things that are horrible starting from
the fact that you know essentially
everybody could compromise that system
like every person that is part of that
system like it's just data typist
ultimately can compromise the system in
its entirety and you know the value of
that data in that system obviously you
know the health data of all German
people you know you can think that some
companies might have some interest in
that and would be willing to pay some
money now think you know about the
amount of money that could be offered
and the amount of money that the typical
data typist makes and now think whether
you will find one person that you can
bribe there's several design flaws in
the system that are so inherently broken
that you know it's probably beyond
fixing but people were simply like
hushing it up because they wanted to get
it out of the door you know it's like
don't talk about a chip it you know
it'll all be fine don't worry about it
so we've been doing some work on that
trying to help to my smallest get it
published because they were trying to
intimidate him also to not speak about
this publicly to not make this publicly
known so we've been trying to get the
word out that's been part of our German
team work in Italy there has been a law
that everything that has to be shipped
in terms of distribution of software has
to have a certain stem from a collecting
society and so on the CIA law on that
one we've worked locally with the BSA
again it's it's one of these really
stupid laws that ultimately ends up
being unenforceable but make it
impossible to to have any business based
on software in Italy if it ever were in
force in the way it was proposed
and we do a lot of what you could call
legal maintenance legal maintainability
is a big issue for us because we always
I mean from the start that should be
very clear the Free Software Foundation
has always realized that free software
if it ever became legally questionable
to use for large businesses would not be
able to succeed in what it set out to do
because we would become a hobbyist issue
you know if a large company could not
use free software legally safe you know
know that it you know this is a safe
thing to use I could be sued for using
this companies will not use it the risk
of being sued for them is too large so
we always knew that if we want it free
software to become the major force we
would have to make sure that the
companies can use it so it has to be
legally maintainable it has to be
legally stable and that is always part
of our thinking it's always part of the
things we do the new lgpl the new GPL
obviously play a major part in that role
and indeed we currently have the gplv3
process on going to create the next
version of the glow GPL on which is a
global peer review process if you will
for that license inviting everybody and
everyone here included to read that
license find the bugs and tell us where
they are so we can fix them before it's
officially released and FSF is very busy
right now organizing the next
international conference on gplv3 which
will take place thursday friday next
week in barcelona there will be free
software people flying in from all over
the world Richard Stallman Evan mogan
included and if you have time and can
somehow make it and want to learn about
this this is the most convenient and
most central place for you to get
first-hand information from various
people around the world with people
coming from Japan from Latin America
it will be a big conference in terms of
brain chair it will be a relatively
small conference in terms of people
because you never have that many people
and who are interested in these subjects
deeply but if you want the largest
amount of knowledge about these issues
that conference is your best choice and
then of course questions advice
counseling we every day we get emails
about you know I I have this this thing
I want to ship it with gnu/linux can I
do that I have these this issue with
this software I've been taking the
software modifying it in this way do I
have to release it on the data license
can I choose another one these kind of
issues those questions come in every day
we have volunteers who handle them very
well and explain to the people exactly
what they can and cannot do making sure
that you know people don't um start off
on the wrong foot in free software if
you will however that is not yet enough
we need to do more you may have heard of
the GPL enforcement work of haha beta
who's been working very successfully for
the netfilter team enforcing the GNU GPL
in embedded products based on the net
filter code in the linux kernel and that
code is in many set of boxes you know
dsl router is waveland routers that kind
of thing and he's been finding that many
of the people who were shipping that
were indeed violating the GPL and he
tries to work with them to solve the
problem and if they don't agree then he
actually takes them to court now we've
always been little more reluctant about
taking people to cart but the comes the
point when you have to do that
ultimately and setting up an
infrastructure that can help people to
do the right thing with GPL you know how
do I approach this how do i secure the
evidence how to approach the company how
do I talk to them and slowly escalating
you know from the let's talk privately
to fix this to the okay you didn't want
to listen maybe I have to talk to you
publicly to the you know okay now I have
to take you to court um you know whole
scheme all of this has to be handled in
a in a coordinate
way if you wanted to succeed so we are
thinking about building the freedom task
force to indeed do these things in FS Fe
but also help others do this work you
know give others the knowledge on how to
do this themselves if they don't know it
just to make sure that that knowledge
exists and we're thinking about how
Advaita who've been working we've been
working with over the years and he will
contribute to this he said how exactly
that it's going to be correlated with
the GPL enforcement we don't know yet
it's possible that GPL enforcement's
will become part of the freedom task
force because how that would really like
to go back to coding he spends too much
time on legal work he feels and I can
perfectly well understand that to be
honest and then of course we do mean
business I mean business is not the most
important thing to us um you know
freedom comes first but business is
important we do want business to succeed
we do want free software businesses to
succeed and we are always incredibly
happy when people make huge amounts of
money with free software that's a very
good thing so we do try to help people
to achieve that we do give them input we
do give them advice people come to us
talk about the business model sometimes
they try to find with us ways of how
should I structure this how can I do
this so it is actually mostly compatible
with free software how is the best way
to deal with these issues we also
provide a neutral party for conflict at
times you know a mediator if you will
where when two parties who are both
commercial have a debate about free
software issues sometimes that escalates
and people you know start to fight which
is bad for business and it's bad for
free software so we help them resolve
those disputes and people trust us in
this role because we have no commercial
interest ourselves we have no commercial
interest in this our only interest is
upholding free software making sure that
free software remains solid you know
kind of like the free software immune
system if you will that's our only
function in this
in this hole in this whole scope so for
us it doesn't matter whether company a
or Company B makes more money that's
relevant to us and that's why people can
trust us with this so they usually do
this on a private level so nobody ever
hears about this but we do do this work
and then there is the essentials work on
the web pages on translations trade
shows are very important to you know
explain what we do to the people there's
a lot of that work and a lot of it is
volunteer-driven we have a very active
translators team that translates to a
lot of languages these days I don't even
know how many at the moment any number i
would give would be wrong and this you
know very often somebody says oh I want
to do a translation to finish you know
can I start we say yeah great go ahead
you know reaching out as many people as
possible obviously is to us a very core
task in fact awareness building is
something that in a way is a central
element of all our work let me just make
this bigger you see awareness building
is where all of these things meet
because people who understand why free
software is important people to
understand the issues of freedom in a
digital society they will make the right
decisions for themselves in that regard
we've all sometimes been thinking about
you know seeing ourselves in the
tradition of the Enlightenment trying to
give people the knowledge so they can
make the decision for themselves you
know for us you know if we did not have
to exist at some point in time because
everybody knew these things that would
be fantastic we try to get rid of
ourselves we try to make ourselves
unnecessary by giving the knowledge to
the people as much as we possibly can
and hopefully we then don't have to do
that work anymore
realistically we will probably never
reach that point but that is what we aim
for because awareness is where the
market begins because customers who
realize that free software gives them
freedom will ask for free software
creating market for free software
companies who when they realize what
free software is about will not only
propose this to the customers themselves
they will also build their businesses on
for software and ultimately the people
for themselves will demand that freedom
if they understand what it's about so
awareness really is the key issue if you
if you were to ask me what is the one
most important thing that if you could
like magically you know slip your
fingers and it existed I would say it's
awareness for the free software issues
if we could do that like like you know
like this that'll be my choice because
then almost all the other problems will
disappear automatically all of this is
is the complex network field and
awareness is a key issue that would tip
the balance in our favor so let let me
briefly talk about the fellowship before
I finish the fellowship is about
becoming a part of the Free Software
Foundation Europe it's about getting
people involved and active you know
bring together people who have interest
in freedom from various areas we
deliberately try to reach out to areas
that are not purely software that is why
we work together with a professional
design agency to create a design that
would translate somehow the idea of free
software into a visual language that
other people could somehow connect to
it's a it's a very highly reviewed on
reputed international agency that's been
doing the global ups layouts really
really big no global ups brandings been
doing but this being done by the same
people but they did the pro bono for us
because we managed to interest them in
free software we you know as
put it over lunch we infect them with
the idea of free software with the idea
of freedom and we like to spread that
virus if you want to call it a virus the
fellowship is all about that bringing
together people who have that idea to
form a community of people who are
active in this field exchange ideas on
how to do these things you know to on
how to you know explain these issues to
other people and we've been having
fellows who you know just run off
started you know giving talks about
fellowship and fs fe and and really
brought the knowledge to the local
levels it is also a way to show
political support for the work we do
it's about showing that you know you
stand behind these issues you know you
get your email alias like you at ssf org
and you get a login on the portal which
is at WWF sfe org and you can show by
this that you support this work that you
stand behind it that is extremely
important because there is strength in
numbers especially when you talk to
politicians very often you know when
they asks how many are you you know you
can have the 10 best people in the world
but if they hear that you're only ten
you know Davis are the only ten we can
ignore you but if you say where
thousands then they suddenly treat you
differently so you have to have a way to
make this visible the Fellowship is our
way to do so and since you know vaniqa
whom i already mentioned is one of the
founders of the FSF e we also wanted to
give people something that would be cool
and at the same time allow them to work
on another interesting field which is
privacy and security so we give people a
an open PGP smart card which is you know
a crypto token hardware token that will
never surrender your key to anybody you
get this card you know with your name
with your fellowship number customer
for you and you can use it to you know
obviously sign your email encrypt your
email or at the decrypt your email and
and do all these things that we've all
been doing for a while or most of us
have been doing for a while do them
better of course because the key cannot
be compromised by the machine being
compromised anymore but you can also do
nifty things like authenticating your
ssh logins with it you know card is in
ssh you're on the other machine card
goes out SSH nothing it's quite nice
i've been using it for a couple of
months now exclusively and it helps to
attract interest because you run around
with a card and people ask you what's
that it's bright green it's really
fernanda do you have your card here
because i forgot mine downstairs anyway
it's bright green people ask you what is
this and you know this is a smart card
what does it do oh hannah has this year
but it's great because it'll you know
you I carry it everywhere I go usually
especially at conferences you together
with my name tag because people always
ask you what is this and then you can
explain to them privacy security free
software it's a good hook into the
conversation and of course the fellows
contribute to our work because you know
the employees need to get paid they get
paid crap but they still need to get
paid I mean we know I mean seriously the
people who work for us all work for very
little money all of us I mean every
single one of us we don't do this for
the money but we have to live so usually
around thirty percent i would say of
what you would normally get on the
market often depends on your thirty
fifty sixty percent and we all love to
work for the FSF ii still because it's
interesting work is challenging work but
you know we depend on everyone outside
FSF e
to help us do that work because without
that contribution we can't the
Fellowship has allowed us to hire Kieran
O'Riordan who's been working for us
full-time in brussels on the software
patent issue in the last months and is
now working for us in brussels on the
various other EU issues currently
organizing the gplv3 conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
