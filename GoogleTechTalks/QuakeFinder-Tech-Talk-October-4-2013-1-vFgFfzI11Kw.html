MALE SPEAKER: Hi.
So good afternoon,
or good lunch time.
And today we're going
to hear from Tom Bleier
and learn about
earthquake prediction
and what's possible today.
Just wanted to say a
few words about Tom.
Tom, I guess, has been
interested in this
for a long time, doing work
in earthquake prediction
20 years ago or so
in high schools.
30.
But his profession is
being a rocket scientist.
And then around 1999, he
went to Stellar Solutions
to be a rocket scientist.
But quickly, they decided that
earthquake prediction would
be a great endeavor for
them, and they started up
a humanitarian research
project at Stellar.
And Tom heads that up now.
So let's find out
more about earthquakes
and whether we can predict them.
Take it away, Tom.
TOM BLEIER: Thanks, I
appreciate the opportunity
to come to talk to
the Google audience.
One of the things that
I'd like to open with
is that this is a bit of
a career change for me,
working in aerospace
and satellite system
engineering for
about 30 or 40 years.
This was one of these things
where you have a passion just
to learn about something else.
And this passion has
evolved into this project.
And so we're going to
tell you about the project
today, and hopefully give
you some insights into what's
going on.
So our company is called
Stellar Solutions.
The project is
called QuakeFinder.
It's been going on now
for about 13 years.
And what we're doing is to
develop a way of forecasting
earthquakes on the order of
two weeks to a couple of days
before the earthquake.
So this is not the P wave, S
wave earthquake warning system
that you may have read about
in the last week or so.
That's a system that works
on seismometers actually
picking up the earthquake
that's already started,
and then sort of going
close by and warning people
that the earthquake has started
and it's coming toward you.
So you get anywhere
from zero seconds
to maybe about 30
seconds of warning.
And eventually, they
hope to have that work
into a cell phone alarm system.
But if you happen to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time,
like in the BART tube going
underneath the San Francisco
Bay, or next to a
gasoline storage facility,
that may not be good
enough to protect you.
So we think there's a purpose
in having a short term
earthquake forecasting system.
Some of the people that
are helping us here,
in addition to Stellar
Solutions and NASA,
we've got some universities
in Taiwan, Greece, and Peru,
as well as the
university of Colorado.
So I'd like to
acknowledge those folks.
So what about this
earthquake forecasting?
It's a tough problem.
It's not something that's been
solved, as you may realize.
If you look on the lower
left of the screen there,
you can see that
weather forecasting took
a quantum jump
when they developed
geosynchronous
weather satellites.
that could watch
the storm coming
into like the Gulf of
Mexico or wherever,
and supercomputers to
do modeling of the way
whether actually
propagates and moves.
Likewise, tornadoes took
a quantum jump forward
when they developed
Doppler radar.
So instead of just listening for
or having eyewitness reports,
they can actually see
the funnel cloud starting
to spin up, and actually provide
a warning of a few minutes
before the cloud
actually touches ground.
Volcanoes are a
little bit harder,
but they're coming along.
You can actually watch the
volcanic cone in flight
as the magma starts
moving up into a chamber.
Interferometric SAR,
synthetic aperture radar,
is a way of monitoring
that from space,
as well as GPS on the ground.
So you can watch gases,
you can watch inflation,
and you can get a sense of when
the volcano is going to blow.
Landslides are kind of similar.
You can watch the
rain gauges, you
know the topographic area and
what areas are ready to go.
But the problem is, and
come back to earthquakes,
and nobody's making earthquake
forecasts, at least not
reliable ones up to now.
So if you look at how man
has approached this problem
from around the year
100 AD, the Chinese,
in the upper left-hand
corner there,
came up with an
interesting little thing.
It looks like a
vase of some sort,
but there's a
pendulum inside of it.
And as the earthquake waves
come through the area,
this pendulum starts
wagging back and forth,
knocks a steel ball out
of the dragon's mouth,
and it falls into a little toad
on the periphery of this thing.
So not only can
they record the fact
that there is an
earthquake happening,
but they can actually get
a sense of which direction
it was coming from, depending on
which ball goes into which side
of the array of toads there.
If you fast forward
a little bit more
towards today,
after we discovered,
or after the scientists have
discovered the Ring of Fire
and plate tectonics,
obviously there
is a large amount of earthquake
activity going around.
So people have been
putting in seismometers
for years and years to discover
where the earthquake happened
and how big it was.
But they're also looking
for patterns of earthquakes.
Something that might show a
cluster of magnitude 4s or 3s
before a very large magnitude 7.
Unfortunately, that hasn't
worked out very well.
And there really hasn't been
any good forecasts made.
More recently, GPS and LIDAR,
or laser ranging systems,
were instituted and placed in
certain areas along the fault.
So you can measure the amount
of stress that's being built up,
and strain that's being
built up along the fault.
But even that hasn't
really turned out
to be a good forecaster
of earthquakes.
And finally, on the
right side there,
interferometric
synthetic aperture radar,
you can take a
picture of the ground
with a radar imaging system.
And then a week, a
month, a year later
take a picture from the
exact same spot in space
as the satellite finally
comes around to the same area.
Take a picture,
overlay the two images,
and you can develop these
interferometric rings that
tell you, essentially, how
many centimeters the ground has
moved.
So if you take a picture before
an earthquake and one after,
you get these very wild
ring looking patterns
that sort of look
like a butterfly.
Unfortunately it hasn't shown
that it shows much deflection
before the earthquake.
So even that has not
worked out too well.
So we decided to do
something different.
Everybody else was
doing mechanical things,
all of these things
I just talked about.
We decided to look
at it orthogonally.
We wanted to look at
electromagnetic monitoring.
And we were interested to know
if there was any physics going
on at the hypocenter
that might generate
some kind of an
electrical signal.
So the thing that got me
started in this whole thing was
a briefing that a USGS
scientist gave back in 1970's.
And it was called
earthquake lights.
Now anecdotally,
there's been stories
all over history about lights
flashing in the sky prior to
and during earthquakes.
But this guy actually had
pictures of a place in Japan
in 1967 to '69 where there
was a flurry of earthquakes.
And he started taking
pictures at night
of these glowing patterns
showing up in the sky,
sometimes on
cloudless nights when
there's no lightning going on.
And more recently, we had a
collaborator down at Peru.
And the university down there,
the Catholic University,
had a surveillance camera
looking out into the harbor.
So this-- oops.
Here we go.
So done on the
bottom there, we're
looking at this
surveillance camera.
It's a little distorted, but you
can see some flashes of light.
And where we're looking
is out towards the harbor,
towards the ocean, essentially.
The camera starts moving.
It sees one flash of
light, sees a second one.
That represents the
P wave and the S wave
going through Lima
from an earthquake.
It was a magnitude 8, about
150 miles south of there.
So all along the coast
of Peru these lights
were flashing as the P
wave and S wave came along.
There was actually two
earthquakes that happened here.
The second one, you
can start to see
it moving the
camera a little bit.
That also had a P wave and
S wave going through Lima.
And again, the camera will
start to pick that up,
hopefully in a few seconds here.
And it represents a major change
in stress in the Earth's crust
that's causing this.
And as the camera's
starting to move,
you'll see in that black
area again, a flash of light.
There it goes.
That's the P wave going through.
And finally, the S
wave coming through,
showing that there's some
electrical activity that's
really being
generated as the crust
is being bent and torqued.

When the researchers saw
this, a lot of people
said, oh, that's just power
lines arcing back and forth.
And he thought, you know,
it didn't look like that.
It looked like it would happen
more out into the harbor.
So he started asking around.
And you can see in
the upper middle
there where the
university camera was,
looking out towards the harbor.
And on the left-hand
side, an airplane
was landing, a small plane, was
landing at the Lima airport.
The pilot saw the
lights, and he knew
what direction it
was coming from.
And a third guy
was a soldier down
in the island, which is the
land mass in the bottom right.
And he saw it and
was interviewed,
and said, yeah, I saw
in from that direction.
When you put all of
the vectors together,
it showed that the
lights actually
came from a small island in
the middle of the harbor, sort
of a rock outcropping.
And the artist's rendition
here was vertical streams
of lights going from the
rock upward into the sky.
So that's what they saw.
They knew it was in the harbor
they knew it was not on land.
Wasn't caused by transformers
or anything like that.
So if we fast forward now to our
area, San Francisco Bay area,
back in 1989, there
was a large earthquake
of magnitude 7 or 7.1.
That was the Loma
Prieta earthquake.
And some of you may have
actually experienced it.
It happened during the
World Series baseball game
up there at Candlestick Park.
Unbeknownst to most people,
Stanford University,
Tony Fraser-Smith
had a Navy project
where he had a magnetometer in
a little town called Corralitos,
which was about six miles from
the epicenter up in the Santa
Cruz mountains.
That magnetometer,
unbeknownst to even him,
was picking up some really
large magnetic fluctuations.
So the graph that you
see there is actually
a frequency spectrum down
at the 0.01 Hertz level.
So if you can imagine a sine
wave of magnetic fluctuation
that takes 100 seconds to go
through one complete cycle,
it's a very, very low frequency.
We call it ultra-low frequency
magnetic field changes.
When he looked at
that frequency band,
he could see something
dramatic starting.
About 30 times the
normal background
signal starting about 12
days before the earthquake.
And then getting very
quiet, unknownst to him
even at the time,
for about a week.
And then just before the
earthquake hit, for three hours
this thing went almost
off scale, about 60 times
the normal background signature.
The gap is because the
little Macintosh computer
fell off the table,
ran out of juice.
They had to retrieve the
hard disk and get it back.
And they could see all of
these other peaks afterwards.
And those peaks are
not aftershocks.
They're actually peaks
of magnetic field changes
before the aftershock happens.
So that made a lot of
press, and was written up
in a lot of scientific papers.
But it was sort of
dismissed at the time
because it was only one site
that had a magnetometer.
There wasn't anything
that correlated
from other magnetometers that
could prove that it wasn't just
a fluke.
So here we have a
situation where signals
are being generated,
they're being recorded.
We've seen it in
earthquake lights,
we've seen it in magnetometers.
A guy down here, almost
across the street,
at NASA Ames, a material
scientist, not a geologist
or anything like that,
he was experimenting
with granite trying
to see if he could
get any electrical
activity out of it.
Now this is not
piezoelectricity.
This is actually
something different.
So he would take a nine
foot long slab of granite,
kind of like a curb
that you see along
the side in the parking lot.
And he'd squeeze one end
of that about half way
to the breaking point.
It wouldn't really
even crack it.
It would just be about half way.
When he did that, he
put a copper conductor
on the tip of it, and
hooked it up to an ammeter.
And he could actually get
a steady state current
coming out of the rock.
Now, these were nanoamperes,
10 to the minus 9th,
but the rock was starting to act
like a battery and current was
flowing through the
silicon-based rock.
Everybody thought
rocks were insulators.
They wouldn't be
able to do that.
But it's sort of like
a semiconductor effect.
Instead of an electric field,
stress is the energy source.
And it releases small ions
from oxygen anions that
are ripped away from
the lattice boundary
and start going
through the rock.
When you look at something the
size of an earthquake fault,
you're not talking about 10
or 15 square inches of rock
any more.
You're talking about
square miles of rock.
When you do that, and you
stress it asymmetrically,
you get currents on the
order of 100,000 amperes
to a million amperes.
And those were actually measured
by measuring the magnetic field
changes prior to a large
earthquake in Taiwan.
So a million amperes
spurting out of this area
causes very, very large
magnetic field changes.
So I'd like to kind of show
you an animation just to get
a sense of the
timing of everything,
because the timing is
important here also.
So here we have a cutaway
of the crust of the earth.
The brittle part is on top,
sort of a P-type semiconductor.
And down at the bottom
is a more plastic area,
sort of the magma
area, an N-type.
The red dot in the center
represents the hypocenter.
That's where the
earthquake actually starts,
and it zippers out from
there, or avalanches out
from that high stress point.
On the top of the
crust of the earth,
we have our magnetometer.
And we have some mountains
in the background.
So I want to show how all
of these things interact.
And I'll start it now.
So we have the
observatory, which
is a three axis
induction magnetometer.
We have the hypocenter.
And we get these
pulses of current
that create unipolar pulses.
Lightning also causes those
pulses, but we'll show those
a little bit later, and
why they're different.
So what we want to do is we
want to instrument this somehow.
And by having a
magnetometer on the earth
looking for these magnetic
pulses, we can see them.
We can record them.
And we want to show that
they're not continuous.
In other words, they
pulse out for a short time
and then they stop.
So we record the pulse, on the
lower left there-- lower right.
We get another pulse.
We record that.
And then these
charged particles,
the positive ones seem to
migrate to the surface.
And when they cluster
around a rock outcropping,
they can actually
ionize the air.
The voltage gradient
at the point of a rock
so large that it
ionizes the air.
And all of this happens before
the earthquake actually snaps.
So that sequence of magnetic
pulses, air conductivity,
and earthquake lights
are all happening
on the order of 14
days to a couple
of hours before the earthquake.
Now, being a doubting Thomas,
we decided, OK, you've
got a laboratory indication
that there's current,
but nature is not nice and
clean and dry like a laboratory.
We happened to have a
seven ton boulder at a site
where we were building a cabin.
We had to get rid
of that boulder
because it was on a hillside
and it was ready to kind of roll
down right through where the
cabin was going to be built.
So we had to break it up.
And the simplest way to do
that is to drill holes into it.
Four of them about
four feet deep.
Pour inside of those holes a
concrete mix called Bustar.
It's essentially an
expanding concrete.
As soon as it starts to dry,
it expands dramatically,
and it actually breaks the
rock from the inside out.
At the same time, in the
upper left-hand corner,
you'll see near my feet are
a couple of white tubes.
Those are the magnetometers
that we laid next to the rock.
Across that clothesline
on the top of the rock
we put a couple of ion sensors
that would sniff for ions.
There was a surface
charge indicator
that picked up about 3 volts
of charge, by the way, on that.
And off the camera
where you can't see
it was a $250,000
infrared spectrometer
looking at the center of the
rock, kind of like a bullseye.
And we wanted to see if there
was any infrared energy there.
The lower left, you'll see
some pulses that started up.
So we poured the
concrete at 10 o'clock
at night, because we had
this infrared thing that
had to work at night time.
At midnight, two
hours after the rock
was started to have
this concrete expansion,
we started to get ions being
sniffed by the ion sniffers.
And on the lower
right, we started
to get pulses of
magnetic field indicating
that there were currents being
generated inside the rock going
downward where it was
touching the ground,
and then essentially
grounded out from there.
So in a sense, we had created
our own miniature earthquake.
We had taken a natural rock in
its natural setting, broken it
slowly over about eight hours.
And two hours into it, we
generated all of these signals
before the rock actually broke,
which is like the earthquake.
So what does it really look like
when you get an earthquake now?
Now we're going down 10
miles below the surface,
not on the surface.
So here's a 30 minute segment
of induction magnetometers which
only show the ripple
of the magnetic field.
You'll see a few oscillations
on the lower right there.
That's a little burst
of magnetic energy
from the sun during
a solar storm.
But just before
this earthquake, we
started to see these
skinny little spikes that
were sticking up
out of the data.
The spikes for about 1/10 of
a second to 10 seconds long.
So they're rather short little
things, and they're asymmetric.
In other words, they're
taller on the top
than they are on the bottom.
Very unusual in nature.
Nature is always balanced.
It sort of has a
characteristic oscillation
that goes both
positive and negative.
This was more like a spurt.
It was spurting up and
then decaying down.

What happens over two years
before the earthquake?
Do these things
happen all the time?
Turns out they do.
So if you take the Alum
Rock earthquake, which
was past Milpitas up in the
hills, on the Calaveras Fault
back in 2007, we discovered
these same pulses at that time.
We looked back in the data
two years before it occurred,
and we got lucky.
We had one of our
magnetometers about two miles
from the epicenter.
So we were nice and
close to it this time.
And we saw pulses, like
10 or 20 every day,
all the way through
those two years.
It's like the fault
is moving, grinding,
slowly bending that fault.
But every once in a while
it catches and releases,
and you get a pulse, a wave
train that might be 150 or so.
The trouble is, it
doesn't stay there.
In other words, there
wasn't any earthquake there.
It was like it
caught and released
before it could actually
zipper or avalanche
into an earthquake.
On the lower right,
in October, 2007,
the pulses started getting much
more frequent, much higher,
much closer together.
And we could see this
build-up happening just
before the earthquake.

Same thing happened
in Tacna, Peru.
So that was one earthquake.
This is the second earthquake.
Soon as we put the sensor
in, in about a month
we picked up two earthquakes
up to a magnitude 6.2.
But we didn't know what the
background signal looked like.
So we had to wait
the entire summer.
And you can see that there's
virtually nothing happening
all summer, until the early
fall when the pulses started
building up, quite
high this time.
And this was in
an area that they
were expecting a
magnitude 8 earthquake.
A really high danger area.
Turned out that we had a cluster
of about four earthquakes
happening in close
succession, and that's
what this precursor said
of magnetometer indication
seemed to show.
So that's magnetometers.
We didn't want to put all
our eggs in one basket.
And we said, what
in the physics is
happening besides
just the currents?
And we said, OK, those
charged particles
that were migrating
through the rock,
they were actually measured
at 300 meters per second.
So not the speed
of light, but it
was migrating up through
the rock to the surface.
So we ended up putting a
positive and a negative ion
sensor, which is nothing
more than two plates
of conductive
material, one charged
to like six volts, the
other one at ground.
And depending where
the charged particles
were, if they were positive,
they'd deflect one way.
If they were negative,
they'd deflect the other way.
We could count those
as they were coming up.
And prior to the Alum
Rock earthquake--
this is two weeks
on the top plot
and two weeks on
the bottom plot--
we started to see little
spikes of ion signals going up.
There was also some noise in
the system when it rained.
The center got wet and it
started to conduct on its own.
So where the x's are,
that's just noise.
But down at the bottom
plot, on the bottom right,
you can see where the
earthquake actually happened.
And the positive ions that
were being monitored actually
went off scale 23 hours
before the earthquake.
And we had never seen
anything like that before.
The humidity was like
70%, so it couldn't
be caused by the wetness
of the fog or anything.
So now we had a
second indicator.
The third indicator
is what happens
to the charged particles
when they hit the air?
They eventually
neutralize in the air,
because they bump into water
molecules or other dry air
molecules, and they
drop their charge.
But the law of
conservation of energy
says charge has to go someplace.
And what happens is
the charge ends up
being manifested in a photon
of energy in the infrared band.
And it turns out
that the 11 to 8
micrometer band is the same
band that the GOES weather
satellite can actually see.
So when you look at
the news tonight,
and you watch the clouds coming
in to the California coast,
if you were to actually
watch that satellite
data at nighttime,
not at daytime,
there's an infrared
camera on there.
And they rarely show
those images at night.
But if you were to look at
them, that infrared camera
is looking down on California,
like Mountain View here,
and it's seeing the
temperature of the ground
go up every single day.
as the sun comes up, heats the
ground, 70, 80, 90 degrees,
whatever.
Then at nighttime,
when the sun goes down,
that energy radiates
out of the cold space
and the temperature of
the ground goes down.
So you see this characteristic
temperature curve,
negative slope, in the
upper right-hand corner.
Before an earthquake,
however, that slope
starts to go positive.
So that says, like in the
lower right-hand corner
there where the red dot is,
is the Alum Rock earthquake.
The pink and yellow
area represents
areas where the
slope is starting
to go either neutral or positive
prior to the earthquake.
And that phenomenon was
picked up by some scientists
down at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
And we're now trying to
use that same technique.
As a matter of fact,
here's what it kind of
looks like when you
look at California.
This was in July when
there was actually
a storm going through
Southern California.
The gray represents areas
where the slope is just normal,
it's negative.
White means clouds.
It can't see through them,
so that's like neutral.
We don't know what's going on.
But the red are areas where
we have a positive slope.
So you can see the
next day, on the right,
we're getting a little
bit more cloud free area,
and there's a few
more areas of red.
But you have to be careful
because as a cold cloud moves
away from warm ground,
it looks like it's
heating up dramatically.
And that is not an
earthquake signal.
So we use a technique to
look at confidence level.
Wherever it's sort of red here,
it says we've got good data.
Wherever it's green
around that area
before the clouds, that's where
you don't basically trust it.
So that being said, what is
it that we're looking for?
And it's really a pattern,
a time pattern of all three
indicators-- magnetic
pulses in black, ion sensor
indications in blue, and
infrared indicators in red
on this.
So we put them all on one
plot before the Alum Rock
earthquake.
And you can see that
it built up two weeks
before the earthquake.
All three of them
at the same time.
Then there was about
one week of quiet,
and then another peak just
before the earthquake.
And if you remember what we were
showing before with the Tony
Fraser-Smith data-- this is just
magnetometer data on the top--
he had the same pattern.
Two weeks or 12 days
before, it got up
really high for about
four or five days.
A quiet period, and then a pulse
just before the earthquake.
And they line up pretty
close, within a day
or two of what we
saw at Alum Rock.
So we've seen about seven
or eight more of these
through other earthquakes.
The trick is you've got
to be in the right place
at the right time, because
the magnetometers are trying
to pick up a signal that's
10 miles below the surface
of the ground.
Those large currents
that are going out
dissipate very quickly.
You can't hear them more than
about 10 or 15 miles away.
And the result is that you have
to have a sensor about every 20
miles.
So what we've done
over the last 13 years
is to put out 130
sensors in California,
all the way along the San
Andreas fault from Eureka
to the Mexican border, the
Calaveras, the Hayward Fault,
the Garlock Fault, San Jacinto.
All of those major faults now
have magnetometers and air
conductivity sensors.
And then we went
overseas because we
didn't get enough
earthquakes in California.
I mean, we need more data.
And we're the only guys
that want more earthquakes
in California.
Not by my house, but
some place close there.
And we'd like to
get more samples.
So we put them in
places like Taiwan,
which has 15 times the
number of earthquakes
that California does.
Peru had a couple of
magnitude 8's, Greece
had some large earthquakes
in the Corinth area.
So what we've got now
is we've got a theory,
we've got some data, we've got
a pattern we're looking for.
We'd like to move from the
laboratory and the research
actually to operations.
We'd actually like to start
making real time forecasts.
And if you guys have ever gone
through a software development
cycle, it's usually, the first
part of it is pretty easy.
You've got the basic idea.
But by the time you make it
usable for the general public,
it takes a heck of a lot
more work and refinement.
That's the phase that
we're in right now.
We have four things that
are technical challenges up
on the top, and two
programmatic challenges,
which are on the bottom here.
So we're going to look
at them real quick.
Lightning.
As you saw in that animation,
a lightning strike above ground
looks a lot like the
underground strike.
And we don't want
to count those,
because that's a false alarm.
And we'd get killed if we
had lots of false alarms.
So how do we know that
this is lightning and not
an earthquake going?
What we did is we partnered
with a company called
Earth Networks, who actually
publishes all of the lightning
strikes in the United
States, actually worldwide.
And each one of these
little red crosses
here is a lightning
strike documented
by the time of the strike,
the location of the strike,
and the magnitude of the strike.
And actually, the direction too.
And what we can do is take one
of our sites and look at it,
and see if there's any lightning
within 100 to 200 miles of it.
Look at the time of
the lightning strike.
Look at the time of
the magnetic pulse.
If they're coincident
within half a second,
that means it's lightning
and we throw it out.
If there's no lightning
and we see a lot of pulses,
unipolar pulses, then
it's from underground.

Likewise, man is noisy.
I don't know if you've ever
looked down the street here
as the cars go by, but
we can see a car drive
by 300 feet away from one
of these magnetometers,
because it deflects the
Earth's magnetic field.
But that we can deal
with pretty easily.
Its BART.
BART is a killer for us.
Every time a BART
train starts up,
it draws about 10,000 amps into
a big electric traction motor.
And that pulse of
current is amplified
by 140 miles of track.
So for example, on
the left-hand side,
we have a site at my
house in Portola Valley,
which is just down the road
here west of Stanford up
in the hills.
Pretty quiet.
All three magnetometers
are well behaved,
and we can see 20 pulses
a day going through there.
On the right-hand side
is Richmond, California,
across the Bay.
And that's within about two
miles of a BART station.
So at midnight to 3:00
AM, the BART trains
are in the barn
getting maintained.
From 3 o'clock all the
way through the rest
of the start up cycle in
the day, the work cycle,
they're going back and forth
across multiple tracks.
And you can see the amount
of noise that's generated.
So that's a challenge that
we still have to handle.
Luckily, outside of
the Bay Area, and even
some places in the Bay
Area, we get clean data.
It's just along the
Hayward and Calaveras
fault that we have problems.
Likewise, the air
conductivity-- you guys
have bugs in your software.
I have bugs in my hardware.
And I really mean real bugs.
I mean, there are spiders.
They think these air
connectivity sensors
are nice and warm and cozy
in the cold winter time.
They'll crawl up inside of it.
They'll start
spending their web.
And every web is a nice
conductor across the plates.
So we've had to go in there
and put stainless steel screens
on it, really fine
screens, to keep them out.
We've gone to stainless
steel to get rid
of some of the
static electricity.
And we've coated all
of the circuit boards
with silicone because we don't
want moisture to get in there.
So these are things
that we can do.
But now we're at a
point where we're
trying to push ourself into
forecasting these earthquakes.
And I think the thing that
will increase our credibility
is if we actually do forecast
three earthquakes before they
happen.
So if you do one,
they say you're lucky.
If you do two, you're
just really lucky.
If you do three, you know,
you've got a trend going here,
and there's something to this.
So we put as our goal
for the next five years
is to predict three earthquake
somewhere in the world
where we have our sensors.
The other thing
is that we've just
got to communicate
what the heck we're
doing to the outside world.
And quite honestly, we're
not really good at that.
We have a website.
We show all of our
data on the website.
Every station that
you saw on that map,
you can go to the
website and click on it
and actually see the data.
So if you know
where your house is
relative to one of these sites,
you can actually look it up.
But just communicating
that to the general public
is something that
we're not very good at.
I'm winding up now, but I did
want to stop and just give
a special thanks
to Google Earth,
because that is one
of the greatest tools
that we've ever used
in our research.
Because we're trying
to position all 200
of these magnetometers in
areas that follow the fault
every 20 miles, within
one mile of the fault,
and in a quiet location.
So we can actually go
into a nice rural area,
go down a cul-de-sac
by Google Earth,
find a house that
would be really good.
We can even tell a guy
what part of his lot
we think we ought to
put this thing on,
because we can see where
he's got equipment and horses
and tractors and stuff like
that, and just pick a spot.
So by the time we go to the
guy's house, knock on his door,
ask him if we can
use his property,
we already know where
we want to put it.
And 50% of the time,
they'll say, oh yeah.
This sounds really cool.
Go ahead and stick
it in my backyard.

So finally, getting involved.
This has been a collaboration
between Stellar Solutions
and our small team
of about five people,
a number of universities,
a little bit of NASA help.
We've gotten a little help from
Tesla, from PG&amp;amp;E, Telefonica,
Vodafone.
But this is sort of a community
upswelling of interest
that we think we're starting.
We're trying to find
more sponsors, people
that can help us get
these sensors out faster.
That takes money, unfortunately.
And we need help getting
the word out too.
We need help with our
website and our way
of publicizing this thing.
We also need technical
help in the algorithm.
So we kind of throw that
out to the general audience.
If anybody is really
intrigued by this
and wants to get
in touch with us,
there's my name and phone
number and email address.
I can give you a card
after this if you'd like.
So I think at that point,
we're pretty much done.
I would like to open it
up to questions, maybe
for 10, 15 minutes, depending
how much time you guys got.
So--
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
TOM BLEIER: OK.

MALE SPEAKER: I have
a microphone here,
if anybody has any questions.
TOM BLEIER: We've got a
couple in the back there.

AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the amazing talk.
My question is about do
you have any indication
of the magnitude
of the earthquake?
And do you have like a
lower bound of earthquake
that you can detect?
TOM BLEIER: Really
good question.
We definitely have a lower
bound for the earthquakes,
because these signals
do originate miles
below the surface.
And it seems like the smaller
earthquakes have some smaller
currents.
So by empirical
analysis, just looking
at examples of earthquakes,
we think a magnitude
5 is about the threshold.
But that's about the time
where you start to get damage.
When you get to a 6,
things start to fall apart.
And 7, you've really got damage.
So we cannot predict 3's,
4's, you might get a 4.8
if you're close.
And relative to
magnitude, we've only
had about eight good
examples so far.
I think we're only about halfway
there on doing magnitude.
We think we can get the time
within about 24 to 48 hours.
We can get the location to
within 10 miles of the closest
site that has the
biggest signal.
And the magnitude, we're not
sure if a magnitude 7 or 8
will just have a lot more
pulses, a lot taller pulses,
because we've never
had a magnitude 7
that we've picked up.
We're up to about a 6.2 is
the largest one that we've had
so far.
So the fact that it's
over a magnitude 5,
we can kind of
get an indication.
When we have a cluster
of earthquakes,
it seems to last longer,
the pulses last longer.
We don't know what a
magnitude 7 looks like yet.
So we'd like to
get one of those,
but again, not too close here.
I think we had another
question in back.
Same question, OK?
Anybody else?
AUDIENCE: So if I want
to keep track, like oh,
what are the signals
looking like,
how can I-- I see your website,
but how can I tell-- other
than Tom is thinking, hey,
watch out if you're in wherever.
I mean, are you all
putting this out,
or is it kind of between you?
TOM BLEIER: Well, we're
in a research phase yet,
so we've got to be careful
what we put out, number one.
There's also a law
on the books that
says we can't go to
the press and say
there's a huge
earthquake coming.
So we work through USGS, and
we work through the California
emergency management area.
And there's a
bunch of scientists
that banded together called
California Earthquake
Prediction Evaluation Council
that would look at it.
And while we're
doing the research,
we would send our
predictions through them.
And they would vet it.
They would look at it and
see if it makes sense.
But the process data
is on the website.
When you go there,
there's a data tab
on the upper middle
of the website.
It'll ask you to just register,
just give us your email address
and you can put in a password.
We just sort of keep
track of how many people
are coming to the data part.
But then you have access
to essentially all 150
of these sites, overseas
as well as California.
Pick out the one
closest to your house
and just watch it every
day if you want to,
and you can see what's going on.
AUDIENCE: OK.
So I have a question then, too.
With the data, if it goes to the
committee and then they vet it,
then where would a person
see that or hear about that?
TOM BLEIER: We haven't
yet done that yet.
We haven't made our
first prediction.
But I think the
sequence is, it would
go to a group down in
Southern California,
and end up going to CEPEC group.
They would make a
recommendation to the governor
through Cal Lima.
So you've already
seen three steps
that we have to go through.
I don't know how long that's
going to take, by the way.
It may take longer than
the earthquake forecast is.
But theoretically, it
would go through Cal Lima
to the governor, and
then the governor
would actually indicate that
he's officially putting out
an earthquake warning.
So there may be like
a yellow and an orange
and a red type of thing as
you get closer and closer
to the earthquake.
That's what we sort of see
as the operations concept.
As we go through the pulses,
the quiet period, the IR and the
ions coming up.
But the hope is that
you'd have about 24 hours.
And you'd say, 24 to
48 hours from now,
in this site in Mountain
View versus this site down
in Southern California,
you're at a much higher risk
for an earthquake
greater than magnitude 5.
Now, what would you do?
I mean, I don't know about
you, but I'd probably
still go to work
and still do that.
But I'd have my emergency
supplies and water and fuel
and food that I needed.
Have sneakers in my car in
case I had to walk home.
If I had kids, I might keep a
really short leash on my kids
so I know where they are.
All of these things that kind
of came to my head in 1989
when we had that big
earthquake, and my kids
were out at soccer practices
and everybody's house.
And it was hard to get
them all back at the time.
I would probably do
things differently
if I knew I was in a high risk
time period, like 24 hours.

Anything else?
In the back there.

AUDIENCE: Thanks
for the great talk.
Is there any work going
on putting these sensors
under the sea?
Because the North
Anatolian Fault Line,
the expected Istanbul
earthquake is supposedly
happened under Marmara
Sea, and probably it's
going to be hard to track those
fault lines under the sea.
TOM BLEIER: Yeah.
We haven't figured out
how to put these things
underwater yet.
Interestingly enough,
the earthquake lights
have been seen coming out of
seawater, not only in Lima,
Peru, but in many other areas.
So you wouldn't
think that they would
go through conductive water
all that easily, but they do.
The ground underneath us has got
a lot of salt water in it too,
and it does go through that.
I think it's just the practical
problem of encapsulating
this thing so that it's
water tight at the depth
that the thing is.
And we're getting
16 megabytes of data
per day out of each site.
So we're not doing kilobits,
we're doing megabits.
And that's really
hard to get it out
of the undersea applications.
But we talked to
some folks in Turkey
about the Anatolian Fault, and
recommended that we put them
along the ground based Anatolian
Fault for a number of miles.
And that's just sort of
sputtering along right now.
But there's a few people
that are interested there.

Anything else?

AUDIENCE: Is QuakeFinder or
any other interested body
trying to make correlations
or associations
between this electromagnetic
phenomena you've described
and the known
behavior of animals
going missing before
an earthquake?
TOM BLEIER: Yeah.
As a matter of fact,
we have a project
that's just starting up now.
You remember the big
Sumatran earthquake
where the tidal wave came
in there, tsunami rather,
and killed all of those people?
There were anecdotal stories
of elephants running away
from the shore before that all
happened, birds flying off,
all sorts of animal
behavior going on there.
One of the guys in the Red
Bull Company, the energy
drink, he lost a
close friend there.
And he approached a
scientist in Vienna
about doing an animal research
project on one of the islands
just off the coast of Sumatra.
And he came to us and said,
gee, there's lots of stories,
and I see lots of
reports about animals
that have been documented.
It would be interesting to
put your magnetometer and air
connectivity sensor
in the same complex.
And they're actually going
to instrument animals.
Now, I don't know how
they're going to do this yet.
But fish jumping
around in a tank,
birds flying around
in a cage, they're
going to instrument these
things and plot how they react.
And they hope to have a
fairly large earthquake
within a few years.
We'll have one of
our magnetometers
right next to them
to see if we see
those same indications
prior to that.
And if you think
about it, the fact
that we got these extraordinary
number of ions coming out
of the ground before Alum
Rock, if you were a dog sitting
on the ground or laying
down on the ground,
and that amount of
charged particles
were coming out of
the ground, your fur
would probably stand
out on end, just
like static electricity hitting
a Van de Graaff generator.
Maybe that's what
they're picking up.
It's very possible.
That's not normal for their
fur to be standing up.
Some other guys have actually
put animals in a cage
and generated ultra low
frequency magnetic fields,
and they got them to
react to that too.
So animals are pretty sensitive.
They use magnetic fields
for navigating, birds do.
They can sense things much
better than humans can.
So there may be a
definite connection.
I can't say that for
sure, but it kind of
makes sense to me that
they would feel it.
AUDIENCE: Is there any reason to
think that earthquake activity
might be correlated with the
events off of planet Earth,
say with the activities
on the sun, or just
the larger solar system?
TOM BLEIER: I think
there have been
a few studies about
major solar storms,
whether or not that
triggers an earthquake.
And it hasn't shown very
much positive result.
I mean, from a
worldwide standpoint,
you can look at the number
of earthquakes per day.
And there's a lot
of them, 10,000.
We just had a big solar
storm the other week,
last week I think it was,
where they saw Northern Lights
in Minnesota.

There's no big flurry
of earthquakes going on
at the time.
So if there is a trigger,
it's really subtle,
and it's not something that
has shown big correlations yet.

Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

AUDIENCE: So far, have you
seen a lot of false positives
on the recordings
that you've gotten?
And how are you
actually deciding
when an earthquake's going to
happen, such as a threshold?
Do you have some sort
of probabilistic model
to assess the probability?
TOM BLEIER: Good question,
because yes, there
are a lot of noise out there.
And we kind of
addressed some of them.
I think lightning
was the biggest one,
because it actually has the
same shape as the underground
lightning , as the
underground earthquake thing.
Lightning is a little
bit faster, though.
It's about 1/10 of
a second strike,
unless you get multiple strikes.
The pulses that we're
looking at are about 2/10
of a second to maybe
up to 10 seconds long.
They have a slightly
different shape to them.
So it's a little tricky to
weed through all of that chaff
and see those.
Solar storms, when
we see those, they
have a very characteristic
wiggle pattern.
We can actually filter those out
with MATLAB using low frequency
filters on it.
The cars going by when
they're close enough,
they have a very characteristic
balanced type of a pulse
that we can get out.
But a lot of it is
setting thresholds,
eliminating lightning,
eliminating solar storm data.
So you kind of subtract all of
these things that you know of,
and then whatever's
left over, it
flags it to us in our software.
And then a human being
looks at it from that point.
Because occasionally,
somebody will
part a tractor right next to
our system, or start a welder,
welding a fence near us.
And that looks very different
than the earthquake signal.
So are we there yet
in our sophistication
on the algorithms?
No.
We need more help
more, refinement.
So we're in the tuning
phase right now.
But, yeah.
AUDIENCE: So have you had a
situation where you thought
an earthquake was going to
happen and it didn't happen?
TOM BLEIER: We actually
made one forecast.
Actually, our
partner down in Peru
did, when we had that cluster
of four earthquakes in Tacna.
After the second
one, he sent an email
to the rector of the
university saying,
I think there's going
to be another earthquake
in that same area,
and there was.
It was like putting
your toe in the water.
We just gently did
that, tried it once.
The other ones that we've
had in California and Greece,
we haven't really pulled
the trigger on them
yet, because we didn't feel
that our algorithms were
quite tuned up enough.
And we're really afraid of
doing too many false alarms,
because that's crying
wolf, and people will just
lose confidence.
So we'd rather take it
a little bit slower,
make sure that the
algorithms are moving.
And hopefully, we'll be close
to a really big earthquake where
it won't be down in that noise.
It'll just be booming.
And hopefully, we'll
get a couple of big ones
that will be very evident.
We're not there yet.
AUDIENCE: So based on
historical records,
how much data do you expect
to collect in, let's say,
the next five years?
TOM BLEIER: I can tell
you where we are now.
I think we're at
about 24 terrabytes.
AUDIENCE: I mean, compared
to numbers of earthquakes
that you can then try
to correlate against.
Train algorithms--
TOM BLEIER: Well, now that
we have more sensors out,
which took us 13
years to get there,
we think that we'll hit most of
the big California earthquakes.
How fast do you think the
earthquakes in California
are going to happen?
I don't know.
We're in this cycle now
where Hayward actually
has a repeat cycle of every
140 years on the Hayward Fault.
And we're at about, I
think, 145 right now.
And it's 140 plus or minus 20.
So we're in that sweet spot.
The San Andreas Fault that goes
through here happened in 1906.
And they think that's about
100 to 150 year cycle.
So we're kind of getting
close to that sweet spot.
But you've just got to be there.
And you have to have
a year or two of data
to make sure you understand
what the noise environment is.
Probably ought to wind
it up pretty soon,
but last licks, last questions?
MALE SPEAKER: Are there
any more questions?
TOM BLEIER: Very good.
MALE SPEAKER: All right.
Well let's thank Tom
for a wonderful talk.
TOM BLEIER: I appreciate it.
