engineer at Teledyne Brown engineering
and for about ten years he was at NASA
and for the last couple of years of that
he was on loan to the army space Missile
Defense Command and he developed an
interest in liquid fluoride thorium
reactors or thorium as an energy source
and it's given a couple of talks here
before about five or six years ago he
started a online forum called energy
from thorium comm and he's here to tell
us about the uranium 233 stockpile at
Oak Ridge National Laboratories and some
of the valuable things that we could
extract from it or do with it in the
near future in part to help NASA explore
the outer solar system and to save lives
thank you Chris
does this okay this works great
hi Kirk Sorensen nice to be here always
fun to be at Google like to take you on
a little trip around the solar system
we'll start with the planet Jupiter
which is like a miniature solar system
all of its own and it's got
extraordinary moons like the volcanic
moon Io and the cracked and frozen moon
Europa which may hide an ocean of liquid
water and perhaps even life under its
thick ice we move on to the ringed
planet Saturn and it's giant moon Titan
which has an atmosphere twice as thick
as the Earth's with radar technology
we've been able to peer through Titans
atmosphere and see its surface features
and we found an alien geography shaped
by liquid ethane that flows like water
does on earth carving channels and
filling lakes and oceans Mimas is a
battered moon of Saturn whose surface is
dominated by a huge crater and we can't
escape the impression that there's
something about Mimas that maybe we've
seen before that's no moon it's a space
station
Enceladus is an icy moon with geysers of
liquid water that might also Harbor a
liquid water ocean under its surface
under its thick ice like Europa and with
that liquid water perhaps the hope of
finding life tiny phoebe lies on the
very edge of Saturn system of moons and
Saturn has some electrifying polar
weather as you can see from this picture
this incredible picture was taken from
behind Saturn looking back at the Sun do
you see that tiny dot right there
that's us we've taken a picture of
Saturn and caught ourselves in the
picture and we plunge on we're deeper
into the darkness passing the planet
Uranus with its diversity of moons and
even on to the mighty blue planet of
Neptune and its large moon Triton Triton
is another world where we found geologic
activity nitrogen geysers and cryogenic
volcanoes in a few more years we may
even get a picture like this as our
robotic eyes fly past Pluto and look
backward I hope you've enjoyed this
incredible journey it was made possible
by thousands of very intelligent very
hardworking people over the last 50
years many of whom lived right here in
California and worked at NASA's Ames
Research Center in the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory
they built spacecraft with computers
antennas instrument sensors and
telescopes they put them on huge rockets
and flew calculated trajectories with
extraordinary precision but without one
key material none of this would have
been possible this is plutonium 238 it's
a radioactive material that has a
half-life of 87 years every year about
1% of this plutonium decays and emits
high-energy helium and a lot of heat now
don't confuse plutonium 238 with its
more well known sister isotope plutonium
239 plutonium 238 has no use in nuclear
weapons this is a device that we've used
to turn the decay heat of plutonium 238
into electrical energy it's called a
radioisotope thermoelectric generator or
arts
gee and each spacecraft we've sent
beyond the asteroid belt has had one or
more despite the poor conversion
efficiency of thermoelectric technology
RTGS have been popular because they're
very rugged and they have no moving
parts
plutonium-238 is highly radioactive but
since its alpha particle emissions are
easily shielded against rit G's can be
quite safe to work around the Pioneer 10
and 11 spacecraft both had four RTGS
they were the first spacecraft to
Jupiter and Saturn the famous Voyager
spacecraft each had three RTGS
Voyager 2 was the first spacecraft to
Uranus and Neptune the Galileo
spacecraft had two larger and more
modern R&amp;amp;T G's Galileo was the first
spacecraft to orbit the planet Jupiter
and took most of the photographs of
Jupiter and its moons that I showed you
earlier the Cassini spacecraft had three
of these larger RTGS Cassini is the
first spacecraft to orbit the ringed
planet Saturn and has discovered the
rivers and lakes of Titan the geysers of
Enceladus and the incredible weather of
Saturn and this is the New Horizons
spacecraft it has the last RTG that we
originally built as a spare for Cassini
it's on its way to Pluto right now and
will be the first spacecraft to visit
that distant world in 2015 many
different radioisotopes have been
considered for RTGS
there are several basic requirements the
radioisotope needs to have a half a life
several times longer than the expected
mission duration and its emissions
should be easy to shield against based
on these two requirements plutonium-238
has consistently been the popular choice
for RTGS plutonium-238 was produced at
special facilities in the Savannah River
plant in South Carolina for reasons that
I'll explain you can't make
plutonium-238 by itself in normal
uranium-fueled reactors during the
course of typical operation in a typical
uranium-fueled reactor the fuel consists
of two isotopes of uranium uranium 235
which is fissile and uranium 238 which
is not only a few percent of the uranium
and a typical reactor is uranium-235
but that material is the starting point
for the production
plutonium-238 when uranium-235 is struck
by a neutron it will fission about 85%
of the time but in the 15% of the cases
where it doesn't fission it will absorb
the neutron and form uranium 236 which
will go on to absorb another Neutron and
form uranium 237 uranium 237 will beta
decay with a half-life of 7 days into
neptunium 237 which is chemically
distinct from uranium and can be
separated but if you continue to expose
neptunium 237 to neutrons eventually it
will absorb one and form neptunium 238
which will then decay with a half-life
of two days into plutonium 238 so that's
the long and relatively slow process by
which plutonium 238 is produced the
reason why uranium reactors aren't a
good source of plutonium 238 is because
of the presence of uranium 238 which
makes up the bulk of the nuclear fuel
uranium 238 will absorb a neutron
forming uranium 239 which will then beta
decay with a half-life of 23 minutes to
neptunium 239 which will also beta decay
with a half-life of two days to
plutonium 239 further neutron
absorptions will form plutonium-240 and
241 because all of these plutonium
isotopes are chemically identical to one
another and their masses are so similar
it is virtually impossible to separate
them from one another when we look at
the isotopic content of the plutonium
formed in a typical uranium-fueled
reactor it's easy to see from that
little green sliver that very little
plutonium 238 is formed and it's mixed
with four other plutonium isotopes from
which it cannot be practically separated
since it's nearly impossible to make
plutonium 238 of an acceptable quality
in a uranium-fueled reactor during the
course of normal operations a different
technique was used to make all of the
plutonium 238 we've used up to this
point they started with neptunium which
was extracted from spent nuclear fuel
and then exposed to neutrons to form
them to Neum 238 which decayed to
plutonium
2:38 since the original target was only
neptunium the vast majority of the
plutonium produced was plutonium-238
making plutonium 238 from neptunium
targets is long and complicated work
only about 10 to 15 percent of the
Neptunian will form plutonium 238 on any
particular session of exposure and each
session involves dissolving exposed
targets in nitric acid separating them
to NEMA plutonium from one another and
recycling the unconsumed neptunium and
then fabricating new targets the
radioactivity levels of the materials
and the fission products mean that work
has to be done in remote facilities
similar to this chemical separation line
at the Savannah River Site in part
because of the difficulty and expense of
making plutonium 238 the United States
stopped manufacturing this material in
the late 1980s but we didn't stop using
it for our deep-space probes and our
inventories have dwindled considerably
in the mid-1990s we bought about 16
kilograms from the Russians but they've
stopped producing it as well and the
next two spacecraft that we have planned
will consume our remaining inventory
nASA has a whole list of missions queued
up to use plutonium 238 in the future
and their demand for the material
require that over a hundred kilograms of
new material be produced this has been a
problem a long time in the making
several years ago a report commissioned
by the National Academy of Sciences
recommended that plutonium 238
production be restarted immediately in
order to continue the exploration of
deep space but this recommendation has
not been implemented in large part
because of the cost and uncertainty
about who will pay for it NASA wants a
Department of Energy to pay for
plutonium 238 for their needs
but the do-e says that since NASA is the
only user of the material they should
bear all the costs Congress has an
appropriated funds for either agency to
take up the mission even if the Naas
reports recommendation is implemented
the old way of producing plutonium 238
will cost an estimated 150 million
dollars and will only be able to produce
about 5 kilograms of material a year in
a best-case scenario in the process it
will tie up much of the nation's
research reactor capabilities for the
foreseeable future
we need to start producing that we
needed to start producing this material
two years ago to meet planned mission
demands now we're getting further behind
and even with the old technique it's
uncertain we'll be able to make enough
plutonium-238 to catch up to national
needs what we need is a better way a way
to make plutonium 238 at the same time
is making money from the production of
power I have an idea
we need a reactor that doesn't have the
problems of the uranium reactor we need
a thorium reactor and that might not
come as a surprise to you we know we
need a thorium reactor we need a thorium
reactors started on a very rare and
valuable material uranium 233 uranium
233 will fission about 90% of the time
when it's struck by a neutron producing
neutrons that are used to convert
thorium 232 into thorium 233 which then
beta decays into protactinium-233 and
into new uranium 233 thorium uranium 233
is unique as the only nuclear fuel then
it can accomplish this in a thermal
spectrum reactor but 10% of the time
uranium 233 will absorb a neutron
forming uranium 234 and then uranium 235
recall that uranium 235 is also fissile
fissioning about 85% of the time and you
probably remember the series of
absorptions indicates that will lead to
plutonium 238 the real significance of a
uranium of a thorium fueled reactor is
it can operate without any uranium 238
and so the production of other isotopes
of plutonium is nearly eliminated
uranium 233 is the key material to
making this scenario reality at the Oak
Ridge National Labs there is currently
about a thousand kilograms of uranium
233 stored in a variety of forms most of
it would be directly useful to making
energy from thorium unfortunately the
Department of Energy is currently
planning to destroy this material at
great expense to the tune of about 500
million dollars the way that uranium 233
is used to make energy from thorium is
that it will absorb it will generate two
neutrons from fission one of which will
continue the fission process and the
other of which
we'll begin the transmutation of new
thorium into new uranium 233 so this
process once started in a liquid
fluoride thorium reactor can continue
indefinitely generating energy from
thorium this is a schematic of a two
fluid liquid fluoride thorium reactor
and the uranium 233 would sustain
fission in the core and thorium in the
blanket would be generating new uranium
233 and then plutonium that would be
very small amounts of plutonium would be
produced in here could be extracted
chemically the heat from the fission of
uranium is used to drive a gas turbine
power conversion system which generates
electricity and rejects heat that could
be used in a desalinization process so
we can generate primary heat for power
and also a very valuable by-product in
the form of Dasani and water now if we
committed this uranium 233 inventory to
a liquid fluoride thorium reactor or
lifter it would produce about a thousand
megawatts of electrical power this would
lead to an estimated 600 million dollars
in electricity sales per year along with
the production of roughly 15 kilograms
of plutonium 238 for the space program
but there's a lot more that a lifts are
running on thorium could produce it
would generate 20 kilograms of
molybdenum-99 for hospitals which would
mean hundreds of thousands of doses of
this life-saving isotope for patients it
could generate 20 kilograms of radio
strontium that could be used as heating
units here on earth for remote sites it
would generate 150 kilograms of stable
xenon and the Adeem e 'm that wouldn't
be worth very much compared to the other
products but they'd more than pay for
the thorium that it took the start that
it took to keep running the reactor
uranium 233 naturally decays to
thorium-229 with a half-life of a
hundred and sixty thousand years that's
a very slow rate of decay but if you
have a thousand kilograms of uranium 233
it means you'll be getting about four
grams of thorium 229 a year and
thorium-229 decays with a half-life of
about 70 300 years to actinium 225 then
to bismuth-213 and find it finally to
stable bismuth-209 which is the active
ingredient in pepto
there are promising medical
investigations underway right now to use
actinium 225 in bismuth-213 in targeted
alpha radiotherapy trials and what these
involve is you develop a monoclonal
antibody and you attach one of these you
attach bismuth-213 which is one of these
radioisotopes that forms from the decay
of uranium 233 that antibody binds
directly to a cancer cell and as the
bismuth-213 decays that alpha particle
gives a knockout punch to the cell and
kills the cancer cell so this is a
technique to take a very potent
radioisotope directly to the cells that
need it and early indications are that
this technique could be revolutionary
for cancer therapy there was a report
done for congress about ten years ago
about extracting the thorium-229
precursor from the uranium-233 inventory
at Oakridge a thousand kilograms and
right now it appears that the only
practical way to get thorium-229 is to
extract it from this natural decay
process but it's the only way I've been
able to even conceive how to get
thorium-229 which is the predecessor of
this bismuth-213 that's used for cancer
therapy bismuth-213 appears to be very
potent as a state in this report so only
a very my new quantity may be needed to
treat a patient on order of a billionth
of a gram well with a hundred and sixty
thousand year half-life uranium 233
decays very slowly but if you had about
a thousand kilograms you're making about
four grams a year of thorium-229 they
had a plan a while back to extract this
thorium-229 from the uranium 233
inventory but it was cancelled due to
budget constraints now the uranium 233
is scheduled to be down blended and
thrown away which is really dumb in my
opinion it's stored in an old building
at Oakridge 30:19 and they want to tear
down the building so they've got to
figure out what to do with this material
before they tear it down if we could
save the uranium 233 and extract the
thorium-229 we could probably save
thousands of lives through these new
targeted alpha radiotherapy techniques
in fact this is the only way to get this
material is to extract it from the
uranium-233 if we save the uranium-233
we could build lifters that could make
plutonium 238 for our deep-space probes
and we might be able to launch probes
like this to explore Europa and map
under its ice it might be able to send a
probe out to Saturn and Titan that could
drop a balloon in the atmosphere of
Titan and and float around and let us
see what's really going on there for an
extended period of time all the powered
by tooth Platinum 238 and perhaps
someday a picture like this may be taken
that would inspire generations to come
of the limitless possibilities of the
exploration of space
thank you very much Ian hi Kirk I didn't
catch in your talk did you have a
prediction for how much a one gigawatt
lifter how much you're in plutonium-238
that would actually produce yeah early
calculations are and and and these are
probably maybe plus or minus five
kilograms as we could we could make as
much as fifteen kilograms per year in
normal operation but there's another way
that we could even kind of juice the
reactor with neptunium that they already
have in order to increase production
rates at the expense of consuming some
of the uranium 233 but the really
significant thing about using lifter to
make this material is it's a sustainable
process it would be something that we
could do in a reactor that would be
making money anyway in normal operation
from the sale of power right now the
ways we make plutonium 238 consume a lot
of money and so nobody really wants to
go do them whether that's the DOA or
NASA because there are money drain but
this could be yeah it's gonna be
something that happens a lot of course
normal operation any other anybody have
any questions what are the legal
obstacles to producing such a reactor as
I recall there was a ban on reprocessing
nuclear fuel enacted in the 70s yeah
back in the 70s there was a ban on the
reprocessing of nuclear fuel that banned
most people know that van was actually
overturned by Ronald Reagan in 1981 and
so the ban does not exist today it's
just that for a variety of reasons
conventional reprocessing of nuclear
fuel for conventional nuclear reactors
has not been economically attractive now
we're looking at a very different
approach to operating a nuclear reactor
and and running a reprocessing
technology that would be compact and fit
probably inside the reactors primary
containment so I think we would have a
sort of a different argument on those
economic grounds versus what they have
today any other questions yes sir
uranium 233 yes not that I know of I
think we have the world inventory of
this stuff here ah last question again
the question was are there any outside
the u.s. sources of uranium 233 and then
I'll add my own question on top of that
which is can you say a little bit about
what the Indians are doing with regards
to this alright the the Indians are
working on a thorium and uranium-233
fuel cycle using solid fuel I'm not
exactly sure how much uranium 233
inventory they may have if any so I
haven't factored that into any of these
calculations and and is the approach
that they're using likely to lead to any
plutonium 238 production that they could
then sell to other countries or even use
for their own space probes there may be
some plutonium 238 production in their
third stage of reactors that they want
to operate their solid fuel heavy water
reactors with thorium uranium 233 fuels
so in such a fuel cycle if you ran it
for a while you would also produce
plutonium 238 perhaps they may want to
extract that for use and if the Indians
do want to pursue 8a beyond this beyond
the asteroid belt deep space exploration
campaign then they may have some
material to do that well
from the Indians it would depend on when
they started that third stage I don't
think they're at the third stage yet I
think they're the second stage with fast
breeders and plutonium fuel with thorium
targets I'm not an expert on the on the
the Indian thorium fuel cycle approach
right now so our stockpile scheduled for
decommission the uranium 233
it's the decommissioning is undergoing
as we speak so this is something that we
need to act on soon we have it because
it was originally generated in thorium
fuel that was irradiated and other
reactors now a thorium fuel was sent to
Oak Ridge the uranium 233 was separated
and was all collected in a single
stockpile as many you know the the
Oakridge in the 50s and 60s they were
getting ready to try to build thorium
molten-salt reactors and so that's why
the uranium 233 ended up there so I just
tried to have visiting your website
energy from thorium comm and I mean it
sounds like this is an issue which needs
a lot of anything's going to change
needs a lot of political involvement yes
another one thing I've seen at other
political organization websites is at
the very top like you know click here
and here's this form letter you just
type in your your email address or your
name and an automatic and maybe your zip
code and automatically finds out who
your congressman or senator razor or so
basically all you need to know is your
own name and address and you get a very
quick letter out to two people who can
do something about that so that's a good
idea I will see if we can implement that
thank you any other questions I was
wondering if and it's obviously a fairly
early but do you have any estimates of
what it would cost to build such a
reactor a material processing pipeline
lutonium they're very rough and I'd
probably rather not want to put him in a
tank talk right now we can talk
afterwards can you say anything about
what Oakridge thought it would take to
build such a reactor back when they were
investigating this stuff in the 60s I
think yeah they actually estimated that
it would be less expensive to build what
they called them on top breeder reactor
back then it would be less expensive
than it
typical light-water reactor that was
their assessment of the of the build and
operational cost big part of that was
due to the fact that the molten salt
reactor could run a ambient pressure not
at the high pressures that a
water-cooled reactor runs at so all
right any other questions okay well
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
