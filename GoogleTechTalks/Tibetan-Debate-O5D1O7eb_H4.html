in session the evening session begins at
7:00 it's compulsory 2:11 usually you
can hear monks into the courtyard
debating till after midnight this is 60
degrees for 15 years and everybody
debates there are 15 levels 15 different
levels of debate for different classes
that you're going through and there are
also specific actions you make like
stamping your feet clapping your heads
closing the door to the lower realms
you're severing their delusions with
your wisdom and you're drawing them up
to the higher realms so there are a
specific action to make to just the
imprint of you why you're debating you
are doing this to clear your own mind so
you can benefit other beings - your mind
is completely clear so anything can be
debated about any topic any person can
be challenged the Buddha himself can be
challenged any texts can be challenged
so maybe we'll just stop here maybe
we'll introduce the text what what is
the sceptic to debate today the artistic
motivations generating the -
enlightenment
they're debating about the generating
the mind of enlightenment and assist
because the first one is about the
meaning of the man kind of you might say
that the meaning of generating money
from a team in like so that is called
the meaning of generating the -
enlightenment so now they are trying to
ask the question that is it necessary to
generate the proper motivation of mining
from a Germany it is necessary that it
has to be the higher part like a
Mahayana practitioner so he said yes the
one who is so you know you don't have so
now they are you fighting about like
they do have because they is not telling
the truth actually and they were
debating about generating a mind if
enlightenment and the miner frightened
men the meaning of mining enlightenment
that one who
answering said that that to benefit all
the sentient beings to achieve the
ultimate happiness Buddha will be recall
as the meaning of the mine of
enlightenment so now they're debating
about that is it necessary to like to
generate our mind if enlightenment one
has to be in a higher vehicle that means
the Mahayana vehicle because in the
Buddhist teaching there are Hinayana and
Mahayana so he said yes it has to be so
higher but the Lord the Heena and a
practitioner the lower vehicle do they
have those kind of intention or not so
he's saying no but they do they have a
mind or not so of course they have a
mind because their practitioner so now
they are trying to debate about proof
that they have also degenerating love
and compassion because the generating
love and compassion itself is to
generate the money frightened men so
they try to prove that even the lower
practitioner like the henna and a
practitioner do have the money from
Eisenman though it may not be generating
the - enlightenment to benefit all the
sentient beings but they do have their
own the motivation to benefit to achieve
enlightenment so that's why they are
trying to debate right now free open and
they try to use their own wisdom to
prove that they have they have different
way well there would be thousands of
actually like the one who is sitting in
the heart here he has to know everything
in details everything has to be
memorized because there will be
thousands of monks sitting and
witnessing that person is telling the
truth or not and behind that person with
a high throne all the master will be
sitting beside and whether they are
answering properly or not whether
they're questioning properly or not so
they have to judge that way well right
now because usually the master comes for
masters not feeling well so that's why
yes
he is kind of capable to answers
messenger everybody take turns actually
anybody well because when you response
with your mind and speech it react from
your body that means your whole body
speech and mind is so deeply focus that
it expressed through the movement
because like it we call the meditations
one is called the post meditation we
talked this morning the second is called
the analytical meditation and this is
the one way of analyzing analyzing and
it's the part of meditation and this
will be the highest meditations issue
because you are analyzing you're using
your wisdom go deep into the object of
meaning
object of meditations you analyze and
make sure that if you go this way it
concentrate you have to prove it if you
go this way so you are squeezing into
that making sure that whatever you
practice it should not be contradicted
by any other things so this is why
you're sharpening so that's what is kala
you have to understand before you
seriously practice into it so this is to
let make sure everything nobody's gonna
get violent but they're variable much
water they have an opportunity to
challenge the monk so that's what's
happening there just want an effort to
get in there to put their questions and
there's they'll wrap it up yeah they
aren't to push it because like everyone
has its own proper own wisdom to think
in a proper way to prove that that that
has a different way to prove that to
reach that meaning so they try to push
that I want to debate and try to push
each other to prove themselves and how
does it conclude I mean do you prove
something or does this a process well it
does because sometimes if that person
who cannot answer they will prove you
everything that went especially when you
go deeper into your marriage
the debate they can prove you that with
every logical reason because you cannot
lose your point at the same time you
have to protect that by if someone use
any other meaning so you had to give
every reason to to discard that so you
have to protect your point and so you'll
be using your every wisdom to prove that
protect that but some the one who is
questioning will use every wisdom every
angle to disprove that so that means you
would have to know and once you cannot
prove that you have to give up and then
they will like you know sometimes people
will make you like really read because
you they say all kind of world you
haven't done anything what happened you
practicing you know so you are forced to
go back to your own room and they will
read that and try to make sure
everything this is how that we study so
that means when you study means it's not
like you read it you know when you close
that's it
no understanding means it is it has to
be like in your hand that you see every
nerves in your hand that means every
meaning has to shine right like in your
palm that means there should not be any
kind of like are they the Dominus dark
spot we have a big with some master we
call that this master this is the master
who don't have any kind of darkness that
means any tax you who ask there's no
doubt about it it's not a matter of
belief it is the matter of reasoning and
proving that if you have a right answer
or not you have to prove it is not with
the blind faith no believe in that
yeah you can because if you have a
reason then you have to prove that to
reason and logic but if you cannot prove
it you have to shave your head like you
should do my dog locally you and Patty
did you want you to know how many
different kind of - enlightenment that
one is and then with the relative
religiousness and then also like the the
the generating the motivation there are
total like a 21 each - to divide the 21
like the generating - enlightenment so
they're reading and reciting the text
so that and in that it reads shows
everything about the different kind of
generating mind of night in minute so
they're going by the example like like a
generating mind will be like a gold like
so they want to differentiate what is
the difference between the the limitless
the - enlightened men and and then the
great the mindful night you know so what
is different it is it contradict each
other so it has a relations the
combination for both so he said he is a
man of enlightenment which has the
combinations of luminous Compassion's
and the great compassion
they were debating about like generating
a minor enlightenment usually there are
21 different kind of the generating man
entitlement and the two are they in the
mind if enlightenment 21 even by giving
an example there are 21 and even by the
reality of those it has 21 so this it
goes through the text when you read that
it will show every details about it and
each and every the the - enlightenment
all has to prove by debating so now
they're debating about like like how do
you call like the compassion the great
compassion and the limitless compassion
so it has the combinations of both or it
does contradict or not so how many point
it has so they try to debate on that and
now that it were debating about like the
limitless compassion so what is the
meaning of limitless compassion so
they're saying that you like like
wholeheartedly wishing everyone to
overcome from the suffering is called
the limitless compassion so that's how
did they try to debate about it and the
great compassion is like are you wishing
every sentient beings and environment to
achieve the ultimate or to overcome from
the suffering so they were debating in
this topic
yes actually the purpose the every
movement has the beautiful significance
like we raised this the right hand high
up which is to symbolize the sort of
wisdom this sort of wisdom and
stretching your left hand or palm is to
is this ocean of samsara we call that
means all the and ascension beings is
here in the ocean of samsara so when you
clap means the sort of wisdom is cutting
down every ignorance and delusions and
anger and hatred overall retention
beings you pour down and they're lifting
up like this so we use like this see
that means do you pour down so leading
every sentient beings from the cutting
down the ignorance and delusions of
every sentient being and leading to the
Pure Land and you hit your left feet on
a floor to close the door of the death
so you're clapping and when we start
usually we have to generate one must
need the wisdom so we use the word
called D D D is the seed of wisdom so
you have to use the word called like
that then diversity like that so then we
then we ask the questions and like one
may recite like a text any text I want a
study they will give only two or three
wars from that and the person who is
answering has to recognize those tags
and in which topic that is taught and
what kind of meaning that is so that
person who is answering has to know that
two words from like thousands of pages
and zoom up into which point that we are
debating and in that how many subject it
has so that way and that one has to
recognize every point for that sometimes
there are only four answers right Len G
yeah four answers you can get that means
yes and no progressive and
and contradictions so some kind of like
that actually roughly because in English
there's no word for that the progressive
means like like for example like a
progressive suffering for example
progressive suffering means the since we
have this contaminated body that means
this contaminated body itself is a form
of suffering that means progressive
suffering that is called it that we call
the the suffering of suffering suffering
of change and pervasive suffering so the
suffering of suffering is like when we
have a stomach pain at the same time
headache is called the suffering of
suffering and the sufferings of change
is like like when I'm hungry if I'd food
then I I think that I will really from
hunger and when I eat more then it will
change into suffering so it will see
suffering of change that means like I go
to sunshine thinking that I will really
from coal whenever still too much that
will transform into suffering so
anything that we are relating in the
contaminated phenomena it is the
suffering of change and the progressive
suffering means once we have this
contaminated body this body itself is a
form of suffering that means we are mean
to face the suffering we can run away
from suffering so that's called the
pervasive suffering major like though we
study for 25 years so and each every tax
that each and every day we receive a
teaching we have to memorize at least
there will be six or seven pages we have
to use that route tax is commentary of
this it has ever like a seven or eight
or even twelve commentary on it
the text is we call the logic and reason
from the brahmana Vertica and then the
the perfection vehicle that is the the
Prussian of Muhammad ax and then the
third one is called the magic
the entrance to the middle way emptiness
usually teach about the emptiness and
then we study about the cosmology or the
physiology the treasure of knowledge we
guard the treasure of knowledge means
abhidharma and then the last one is
called the Madame the what I call the
Vinaya which is the monastic discipline
so this faith and the five major tax has
like a many many commentaries so if in
order to cover up this tax
it takes twenty five years to cover up
so this like each in every world we will
debate everything and major debate we
will we usually debate about like it's a
we have a part like the younger
generation they will mostly debate about
the logic and reason they will debate
even about the colors difference there
were the phenomena everything and when
they go a little bit higher for five
years they were mostly debate about the
stages of the part that how there one we
practice about engaging into the Sisqo
fraction that is like a general city
holding morality the concentrations of
virtue the wisdom the patience and
concentrations and wisdom so we'll we're
debating on these issues and how that
when we engage into this practice and
how we can achieve and which kind of
stage that one can achieve so we will be
debating and it will like show every
part in everything because it won't give
you every logic and reason to crew
because the mind will go for the deeper
and deeper and it will lead you that you
reach this kind of stages color blue why
don't why don't you challenge one of
these people just for a little test here
yeah we usually debate about like what
is the difference between the like for
example the red color and colors so they
will ask a question what is what is the
worst material we have in
today with them so what is the
difference between the red color and
colors this is not the answer actually
what's the difference what is the
difference he said what's the difference
colors emission frequency I'm saying
that this I'm saying that the labels are
arbitrary and that they are applied for
convenience to various reference points
that have relation to human optical
processing we debate in luck about the
difference between the red color and
colors so we give a three point into
that that means if it is a red color it
has to be a colors right
that becomes one point but the if it is
a colors it is not necessary to be a
rare colors that can do white colors and
so that's how that and then both is the
red colors so that's how that we try to
differentiate and what to make
so we debate like that
no no so similarly we debate about the
lack of beans like for example like a
black horse so if I debate on you like
is a black horse animal or color so so
we have it paid that is it a the black
color colors or animal so that means if
it is a color then color is not a being
color is not an animal now you have to
understand about see now you have to
understand about what is the meaning of
colors and also you have to understand
ever what is the meaning of beings so if
you don't have the understanding about
the meaning of beings one cannot know
what being means so you have to know
that so they mean means it is the
fabrications of many like the five sense
faculties is called wings yeah yeah yeah
generally is we are talking about the
majority right now see you can see
there's the combinations of the
fabrications of five faculties five
sense faculties so the color doesn't
have those so this way that we debate
and then we debate about the why is
called like a like for example
generating mind if enlightened men like
we usually go about generating man
enlightenment is three different kind of
man of vitamin s ways speaking about
like a the generating the - enlighten
man like Shepherd shepherd like -
my two men the second is called the the
captain kept him like - enlightenment
and third one is like the king like my
name item
so these like a like many practitioner
they will practice in a different way to
benefit the sentient beings like for
example the Shepherd like Shepherd like
how the Shepherd when they look after
the Sheep the Shepherd will make sure
that the ship reach the safe place and
making sure no one left behind and will
follow after that so this is Shepherd
certainly some the practitioner will
practice that may all the sentient
beings reach enlightenment making sure
no one left behind and they will follow
after that so with this intention that
some practitioner will practice and then
the second one is called a captain
boatman so like a captain when the sail
through the oceans the captain and the
crew will reach at the other part of the
ocean safely sailing through the oceans
making sure no one is left behind they
will reach together so some of their
practitioner will practice that me all
the sentient being is including oneself
reach enlightenment sail through the
ocean of samsara reach enlightenment all
together safely so that is called the
captain like mine if entitlement and
then third one is like the king like -
my team in that means like in order to
benefit the beings within the country
like if one become a king within the
country or the wall then one can
willingly benefit anyone willingly so
that way some of the practitioner will
make sure that first of all there may I
be able to be a king or the Buddha or
enlightenment so that I can willing the
benefit all the sentient beings so this
is called a king like minor for 90
minutes so this way like the
practitioner will try to generate in a
different way to practice and to benefit
others so that's how we debate
professors when they come into a debate
it isn't about learning stuff and it's
not about this proving each other it's
about ego and showing who has the
biggest ego quite often does that BOTS
come up here I mean who is debating here
and what is really going on what is that
emotion what does it do to people well
see that's a that's a big difference
like in our like school or college or
university and the monastic because like
the more in ministry is the more you
learn the more you study is saying that
the less you know people that it seems
less you know and the more you have
knowledge people become more tiny means
they don't want to harm anyone they
become source humble and so small that
they won't don't want to bother anyone
so this is something the transformations
of their practice by generating good
heart love and compassion because of
their practice but whereas in like a
university or things like that the more
you learn it creates a lot of ego so
this one I cannot say whether how can we
can help those person but yeah this is
the difference actually that's fine even
it's a Buddhist word his own word said
it doesn't mean that some higher being
has given you a teaching that means you
have to follow doesn't mean that you
have to follow that's it no that's why
even Buddha said you have to check like
when you take a goal from the mind
you have to first hammer it melt it
refine it and make it pure similarly any
teachings that you see you have to check
yourself analyze it and anything that it
help you to be a better person if it
helped you to to general love and
compassion to to bring happiness inside
then you apply otherwise anything even
it may be the highest practice but if it
doesn't make you happy in fact you'd
make your wars you can leave anytime
that's why in in our tradition is
there's no missionary you are not forced
to change or transform or convert
everything is its own individual will to
follow so we never incur sintra we have
to encourage their own path to follow
their own path a text it says the earth
is flat ok Corine earth is not flat
but now there's new science coming that
says that they're supposed to be a
golden earth there's actually a golden
gravity they're beginning to talking
about you know there are only knows the
dilemma has meetings every two years
with the astrophysicists and people like
that
he said I'm meeting two here at Stanford
and also a back east at University some
of the discoveries of modern science and
Buddhism if there's to seep out they're
similar
if science proves us wrong we have to
change it the sole source of pretty much
no there's no there's no there there
might be a new commentary from time to
time explaining feeling a fresh aroma to
a text but literally there's no new
material the mind is finished because in
Tibetan is Google is all here Internet
is all here because they have to like
memorize every text like special
attending master he can memorize like
two pages a day and can remember has to
remember for their life so is the
highest capacity all the tax all the
commentary yeah one life is not enough
and that might permeate all phenomena
three great universes to the sixth power
the size of this one if simultaneous is
aware of off another no you would be on
this planet on this planet but that
David asked what their mind permeates
all phenomena I mean that's unimaginable
well they were challenged to put forth
of the Buddha like this numerous
instances where he would like world man
want to be a monk everybody said he
can't be a monk no possible tension but
before the Buddha the Buddha said yes
this is that of in a previous life you
were a fleet and
a big flood and during this flood you
took refuge on a picture during the
flood you watched around a stupa a
Buddhist stupa three times and that gave
you the positive potential to be among
his life so he could see that but you
and I can't see outside this room well
if you take that view then you're a big
problem coming okay because there's
nothing to take refuge in yeah biggest
like you know when we take refuge one
must know why we have to take refuge
like for example that we usually take
refuge is because whatever we have like
the power the well positions that look
relatives the body it is all we have to
leave behind we have to leave behind
because the birth aging sickness and
death is deep like a it is confirmed
that means it is said with our life we
cannot no matter what we can run away
from this so behind that like other
things are all stuff we call stuff that
means we can balance we can control that
but not this so in order to overcome
that balance only with the guidance of
those beings like if you really try to
transform with an inside because in
order transform within inside we have to
rely on something that who has an an
experience so that's why we've already
teachings like a buddha like enlightened
beings so this way when we're alive we
have a study experience we had knows all
simultaneously so you it's not just a
belief you actually have an experience
with a certain thing that you begin to
trust them and have faith in their mind
due to the events in your life while
you're coming them that you have
immediately just like you accept them as
your teacher yeah because some of the
master tape are reborn again and again
like they can immediately know where to
be born and which part of the that if
they are born they can be more
beneficial so they can change they can
we take another form of rebirth
wittingly so that means they have the
ability to change their body to be born
willingly so there is a death and
rebirth is love cost and effects because
about like a believing one this is
whether we believe or not that is a law
of cause and effect does we don't have
to believe it is set up whether we
believe or not death and impermanence is
set up it is we don't have to believe
and we don't have to believe about the
emptiness of every phenomena that is the
fact because so in order to overcome
that only the transformation from within
inside that's the only way we can face
that it's not a matter of believing it
is the fact
so you're always welcome to visit your
master then you can see how people
debate and how the life is different
life is absolutely different
we have only heightened Twista
you
come down go to make it longer go down
there okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
