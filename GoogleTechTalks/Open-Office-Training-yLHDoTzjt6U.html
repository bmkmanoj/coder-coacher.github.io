well it's a little quick 101 well
probably about 45 minutes or so and I'll
take questions too so please feel free
to interrupt me as we go through this
I'm gonna talk about what it is I'll
talk in a little bit about the history
of it since it was asked I'll talk about
what it doesn't mean that it's
open-source and I'll talk about what
open-source software is a bit and why
that's important and I'll just quickly
go through the components of Open Office
and talk a bit about its strengths and
weaknesses talk a little bit about how
to migrate or whether that are migrated
and then about integration with other
office suites like Google Apps Microsoft
Office etc and I'll answer questions as
well
so what is openoffice.org and also just
a little note it is actually called
openoffice.org it is not it is actually
not accurate to call it OpenOffice even
though we do all the time because
somebody else owns a trademark for that
phrase so just you know I try to
remember to call it openoffice.org but
anyway so it is a cross-platform
multifunction office suite and so it
runs on any platform well any of the
three major platforms Windows Macintosh
and Linux
it has also talked about all the
components but it's got you know the
kitchen sink in terms of an office suite
it supports open standards so all of the
document formats
except for OpenOffice base which is a
separate issue but all of the formats
the the word processing the spreadsheet
the the presentation are all open
document format which is a standard that
was approved several years ago which
I'll talk a little bit open standards
but basically it means that because it's
public an open standard is a standard
that's published and it's free and so
that means that anybody in perpetuity
can implement software that uses an open
standard so that's really important it
does read and write Microsoft Office
formats except for the newest format
which is docx for Microsoft 2007 I think
I hear tell
interestingly enough that office 2007
the new service pack or something now or
will actually read open document format
which I find fascinating and at some
point I'm sure that openoffice.org will
also read the docx format it's matured
considerably I have you been using it
forever since the beginning and so it's
always gratifying every new release I'm
like wow this is you know I mean that
really has matured if anybody ever used
it at one point oh how many of you have
ever used at one point oh no okay so
yeah okay it's just incredible how much
it's changed it's really great it's free
as in beer that means you can download
it and use it at no cost and it is also
free software that is it's open source
and I'll talk about that a little bit so
as I said it's cross-platform it's
available as a free download for Windows
it's bundled with most Linux
distributions so when you you know put
in Ubuntu or red hat or fedora or
whatever it's actually comes with and
there are two versions available for the
Macintosh this is actually where the
Macintosh is you're a little bit of a
disadvantage
unfortunately the official
openoffice.org for the Mac only works
with X Windows those of you who have max
maybe you know about Expo knows it's
it's actually a separate window
environment that doesn't use the native
nice cool groovy Apple graphics so it's
a little rougher it's not quite as nice
there's a program called neo office
which is a it's a port of OpenOffice
that's done by an independent group it's
pretty good although it lags behind in
terms of the features so it's working on
a code base that's older than the
official newest version there is going
to be an aqua port for OpenOffice aqua
being you know to have all the nice cool
and groovy interface stuff but it's in
alpha so it's way behind so the Mac is
actually sort of the poor cousin in the
OpenOffice realm which is really quite
unfortunate from what to my mind but
actually if you don't mind running X
Windows the the the the newest version
for the mac is always up is always
available to you so it's open source
what does that mean then it's open
source why is that a good thing so let
me just tell you a bit about what open
source software is for those of you who
don't know open source software it's
it's it's been around for a while now
it's it's gaining currency and how many
of you use Firefox
okay so Firefox is you know the poster
child the open source poster child
because many people like my parents for
instance use Firefox and have no idea
that it's open source which is great I
mean I think that's really wonderful
so what open source software is is
basically a software that is generally
freely available to download and use you
can download it and use it for free you
can install it wherever as many copies
as you want the you know there's sort of
there's no license fees it's generally
based on open standards so again open
standards are standards that are
published and that are freely accessible
which means that anybody can know how a
certain format is put together and
anybody can recreate that format in a
totally and completely you know a way
that's totally completely consistent so
what you will talk about it a little bit
as the issue between aventura
operability between Open Office and
Microsoft Word Microsoft words format
except the recent one and that's sort of
a long story but I don't if you wanna
thought if we're talking about that
we're talking about it but it sort of
long story but historically Microsoft
offices formats were not open standards
and so what that meant was that nobody
knew how documents were put together and
people who wanted to be able to read
Microsoft Office formats had to
reverse-engineer them which as you might
imagine is problematic because you if
you can't know in detail how a document
is put together you can try to reverse
engineer but you're gonna be wrong I
mean there's no question you're gonna be
wrong and so it is true I mean
OpenOffice has gotten much better over
the years but I remember a long time ago
this is back I probably 2000 to 2003 I
had a colleague of mine who used to like
to use word to it's like I mean he would
just do all
this crazy formatting stuff and so I'd
be submitting bugs to the OpenOffice
team using using my colleagues documents
kids never completely totally messed up
so and it's gotten much much better but
there's still our fidelity issues it's
not completely perfect but an open
standard it would be perfect because the
standard is open you everybody knows
exactly how a document is put together
and that is freely accessible on the web
it's published so any software developer
who wants to implement an open standard
can do it and their software will render
the document in a totally completely
consistent way based upon the person who
made the document why this is important
for you for anybody it's important for
anybody in terms of long-term storage of
documents in terms of you know how many
of you have floppy disks or maybe you
actually managed to save it on a hard
drive documents that were written in a
word processor that no longer exists I
mean you know right it happens and so
and and it's that's lost unless somebody
has done the work to do that to sort of
do that reverse engineering and get that
data out of that old document those all
formats but an open standard is one that
it's published so that so it is always
possible for you to render documents in
their original form you know
theoretically 100 years later you can
still rent because those formats are
open so that's really what's important
that's why it's important and so
OpenOffice is based on open standards
and you know I mean it's just that
anyway so that and that's for me I think
I mean speaking I mean I was an academic
so I actually have a fairly reasonable
sort of idea about sort of what what's
important in terms of sort of keeping
documents for long term and what's
important in terms of data access and
information access and if there's one
good argument or one of the major good
arguments for libraries for OpenOffice
it's going to be the open standards
argument so the code is available so you
can go to openoffice.org or or any any
website for any open source project
Firefox for instance and download the
source code and for most people that's
not gonna do you any good because you
know maybe you're not a programmer or
you wouldn't know how to read it or
whatever but the reason why that's
important is that that means back to the
question that's that somebody I think
maybe you asked that's it's that
software never has to die okay so if
you've got a company that's you know
written a software product and it's
really popular and then for some reason
the company goes out of business or
decides to stop supporting that that
it's a software or whatever you're stock
there's nothing you can do
you're totally out of your just like
you're out of luck and it's happened
many many times but with open-source
software the code is always available so
if somebody has the code that software
can live on if somebody cares enough
about it and wants it to live on and
that's really important so and also it
means that if you know this has also
happened a great example I have this
great there's this great software that
I've used a lot called activecollab
which was a project management software
that was an open-source tool and the
person who wrote activecollab which is
his right decided to take it close
source he decided to make it a
commercial product it's it's his total
right he made it do it but the people
who but some but what people did was
they took the last version of that code
that was open source and fortunate
Sumiko project peer so now there is an
open source project management package
it's a it's a Basecamp clone if
anybody's used Basecamp
it's actually quite good and it's going
in a great direction and it's been saved
from you know from being closed forever
because you can do that with open source
software so that's sort of why it's
really important to have the code
available it's community and community
driven and community owned because it's
out there because you can find the code
the community innocence owns it it's
it's owned by the community um the
copyright is the person who who made it
but you know in terms of thinking about
sort of like who can have access to it
who can modify who can have input in it
it's really from a community process and
so and that's really that's really great
yeah
uh-huh
right it yeah it varies but I mean the
basic models for I mean the this sort of
two basic models for how open-source
software starts and one of them is that
somebody has some developer or small
gerber developers has a very particular
need or they say itch to scratch and may
write the software and the second model
is that actually a company writes the
software but who gets involved after
that depends upon who's interested and
in some situations the community around
it is actually pretty small and stays
just those people were lynched it could
be sort of mostly around the company
that made it there's a great example is
there's a package called Sugar CRM which
is a open-source package but yet it is
it was built by a company and it's and
its difficulties and some developers
around it but the company is the primary
driver whereas actually Simha CRM which
is another sort of an other example is a
non-profit focused CRM it has a larger
community of folks around it there's a
small development group but if that's
growing and it's it is actually in a
sense driven by people who are users and
in the in the user community there is we
should have talked about I'll talk with
you about that at the break because it's
a great example great story and it's
sort of off the topic but yeah but yeah
so so and so in a sense because you
everybody can have access to the code
people can take it in any direction they
want in general the open source the
communities around a software package
determine the direction it goes in I
have a great example I'm involved in the
documentation manager of a project
called openmrs
which is a medical record system which
is designed to for mostly for AIDS HIV
AIDS clinics in Africa and but it's a
community of doctors and users of this
and they these are the things they need
they get involved in the community and
they say you know we really need X to
happen we really need to a new reporting
module whatever
then that sort of gets fed in and the
developers can sort of work on it
depending upon the needs of the people
around it so and again it's available to
all and for me this is sort of one of
the most important parts about open
source software it's sort of the reason
why I got involved in it is that
basically this provides the anybody no
matter what their financial resources
can have access to quality software and
that's for me one of the really
important points about open source
software so any questions about open
source software before I moved back to
OpenOffice you feel like you got a good
feeling for it an understanding for what
open source software is and that sort of
stuff it's also often called free
software which you know it's funny
because I in the nonprofit world when I
use free software people just think I
mean doesn't cost anything and they
don't really understand that free
software actually has to do with the
information part of that then it is free
that's open but it's some people call
free and open source software so but
anyway you can choose your term oh no
see I already did this I forgot that was
here there we go
okay so openoffice.org so the minister's
room go through the components for you
pretty quickly it's got a word processor
just time here and it's called writer
it's got a spreadsheet that's called
calc it's got a presentation program
that I'm using right now that's called
impress it has a database system which
I'll show you it's got a drawing program
it's got a to monitor if you're a
mathematician it's got a formula editor
it's a pretty pretty well rounded it's
got the basics of any office suite and
more they all work together in the same
way as all office suites do they have
very similar interfaces the menus are in
the same places the little tool boxes
are in the same places that the
configuration is pretty much the same so
once you know one of them it's pretty
much easy to know them all
they're totally full functioning and at
this point it's pretty bug free that was
not true three or four years ago it is
true now
so the word processor you know there's
lots of inputs and output filters so you
know anything from WordPerfect all the
word versions you know but two different
other types of formats rich text format
and others and the one of the great
things about writer which oh sorry I'm
sorry one of the great things about
writer is that it exports directly to
PDF which is means that you know these
days there's a lot of new or free PDF
writers but for a while it was the only
choice you had and except for paying for
Adobe Acrobat so and you can do columns
and tables and you know all the basic
stuff that you can do using I've been
using OpenOffice writer exclusively for
I don't know I can't even I didn't even
know it since 2000 2003 I mean that's
all I've ever used
I mean since then and calc spreadsheet
basic stuff lots of formulas and
functions it has graphs again lots of
input and output filters integrates with
everything it's a basic spreadsheet
program and impress again just like
PowerPoint in terms of what it's got I
mean basically the features of these
three of writer calc and impress are you
know ninety percent of the features of
word excel and what's that PowerPoint so
so so for 95 percent OC that was I was
just there showing though an animation
for 95 percent of the people it's you
know gonna be fine
reads and writes PowerPoint files has
templates master pages does animation
yeah
okay so OpenOffice base and I will demo
open office space during the lunch break
but its design isn't open as a access
clone I mean you can see from the
interface you'll see it that it's it
looks just like access you know the
whole interface thing it uses this thing
called hsqldb which is a back-end that's
if you know access it's
to the equivalent of jet but it is
open-source its job in Java and it's
it's free and open source so the
database back-end is free and open
source and the front end is open source
you can also use any other databases
like my sequel or Postgres sequel or
Oracle or MS sequel server or whatever
using ODBC and it can actually read
access files but only the table
structure and the data it can't import
for forms or reports or queries writing
like that and it is not equivalent to
the present access so if you have you
ever used access if you use access you
remember what axis 97 was like that's
kind of about what this is like okay so
it's not there but it's it's actually
improved amazingly this is drawing
program I like it it's fun it's very
useful for drawing diagrams and
flowcharts and you know it's great and
it's really easy to insert you know the
drawings you make until your documents
or your spreadsheets or whatever if you
need math there's math I mean almost
nobody I ever talked to ever needs it
but I think it's cool and you can
actually sort of get an idea of the
audience that OpenOffice is geared
toward the fact that there's an equation
editor you know it actually is pretty
much geared to an academic audience
academic librarians take note and
there's an HTML editor it's very basic
you know it's WYSIWYG but it's very
basic but it will actually if you want
to do simple HTML documents you can do
that and you also can convert you know
your documents into HTML pretty easily
so the strengths of openoffice.org ana
by the way just so you know the oh oh oh
that's the sort of abbreviation that
I'll be using throughout it's sort of
easy it's open source it's free as in
beer it depends on episodes we've talked
about all that stuff reads and writes MS
Office formats Google Docs does read
these files and also writes exports to
these files so that's great and in fact
I I have to say that um I guess about
two years ago I stopped sending people I
stopped saving any of my documents in in
dot docx format because you can you can
set up OpenOffice to to default save and
dot docx format if you allow sharing
with other people and I sort of just
stopped doing that and I send people
either PowerPoint or open document
format and if they can't open the
outcome back in the format I tell them
to just upload it to Google so so I
don't because I just I just hate the
idea of sending read documents or not
not an open format it's my personal
political statement and as I said it has
about 90% of the functionality of Word
Excel and PowerPoint so almost everybody
will be completely happy I mean I don't
there are some people I know who just
really I mean that somebody had a
question about macros was you know
crucial macros so we'll talk a little
bit about that but I mean it's and I
actually know very little bit about
openoffice.org macros because I just I
mean most people use these these you
know use these applications in a fairly
generic vanilla way you know so for most
people
OpenOffice will be perfectly fine and
I've written a book an OpenOffice I've
written primers I've written all my
articles I mean everything I write I
used OpenOffice for and it's been fine
so the components are integrated there
are lots of developers I don't know how
many but there are a ton it is backed by
some very big corporations by son IBM
and Novell and others so there are
people who work full-time for Sun or
Novell or IBM and they work full-time on
OpenOffice so it's really this got a lot
of industry backing which is actually
it's sort of an interesting evolutionary
thing with a open source software for a
long time it was just you know sort of
enthusiasts and you know volunteers and
you know academic coders and
but in the last few years it's really
grown to be a business and so I don't
know how many of you heard about there's
a is a a program a database called my
sequel which is the backend of just
about every website in the planet and it
was bought the company that that is
behind my sequel was bought by Sun for a
billion dollar
okay so my sequel is free and
open-source software you can download it
you can use it for free you can look at
the source code the whole thing but the
company that you know sort of supports
it and and and is responsible for it was
sold for a billion dollars so it's a big
business now so and I think that's you
know it's funny it's like I think some
people think that's a bad thing but
actually that's a good thing you know
it's funny I had this you know you know
the the metaphor that people used with
trickle-down economics was that it was a
tide that lifts up and it lifted all
boats which was like a lie well I think
OpenOffice I mean it's just my
open-source software is actually in the
money that goes into it is actually
truly a tide that lifts all boats I
actually really believe that so so I
think it's fine that they're big
companies involved and the lots of
third-party extensions so there's a
there's actually a site that has all the
extensions and there's tons of different
things people have been using and ways
people have been extending OpenOffice so
that's really cool so weaknesses there's
still a few kinks it's not perfect base
you know I mean for really simple
databases it's actually pretty good
but in general it kind of sucks okay
I'll just say that it wasn't true access
does cut yeah I know I know it's true
access that's kind of suck but yeah yeah
but they wanted to copy access so again
it can't read open up excuse me office
open XML which is the Microsoft Office
new XML version which ya can't read that
yet I'm sure it will soon it's still
true unfortunately
that it's not 100% perfect that
Microsoft Office documents are rendered
perfectly in OpenOffice so I I often do
webinars and so I write my my
presentations we're webinars in
OpenOffice but I have to export them to
PowerPoint because the webinar software
only takes PowerPoint and you know
there's sites things are moved a little
bit the character and character
weirdnesses it's never perfect
the menus and features are different
than then Microsoft Office it just is
true there's just they're in different
places as well
so and they're sometimes called
different things so it's not so that you
have to get used to a different old
slightly a different interface I'll go
I'll tell you a story about that which
is that I have had various friends of
mine who are very low attack I mean
really really low tech and they didn't
wanna they couldn't afford to or didn't
want to pay for Microsoft Office so I
installed up an office for them and they
have I haven't heard a word and they
just use it so I think it's not you know
I mean it's it's I haven't heard a
complaint that haven't heard and I have
Pai friends about her write a lot and
write books and do presentations and
stuff and I really haven't heard of word
so I think that's a good that's a good
sign
you know these weren't geeks I was
giving it to huh
well if it was just a paper with the
footer and page numbers and basic it's
fine
I mean I've done that plenty of times
it's fine it's it's weird stymie knits
stuff what I mean presentations a little
bit because like you know the the the
graphics might be slightly off or there
might be a special character that I use
doesn't translate but it's pretty much
it looks fine I mean it's not like it
was horrible it looks fine and papers if
student if students do that papers it's
fine I mean nobody will notice nothing
no I mean the only way to be able do is
to open it up and open it up in Word and
look what I do if I really really really
want to make sure that the formatting is
perfect is I export to PDF and send the
PDF and that's you know it's getting
perfect so okay so if you're doing
collaborative editing like if you've got
a group people some of you use up in
office some of you use word forget it
don't even bother use Google Apps or use
some other online collaboration suite or
have everybody use one one package
because it's a mess if you go back and
forth too much especially if you're
doing things like track changes and
acceptance changes it's it's really hard
and it just gets really messy so and
that actually has gotten better a few
years ago it was impossible and now it's
messy but it's just not I would not
suggest it so that's not quite and that
may always be true because again you
know because the doc format is not an
open standard it has to be reverse
engineered and so what always will not
be perfect and so until the both sides
of the fence or totally truly open
standards you're not going to be able to
collaboratively edit between different
packages no matter what I mean it's sort
of deep way so it's not a slick I mean
you know doesn't have Clippy although I
think lip you didn't die I heard they
got rid of flipping some to some of the
whole thing now but anyway it's not as
slick it doesn't have little bells and
whistles and stuff so that's you know it
can be slower and take more resources
but that's actually really improved
dramatically so I mean I was I was
running I'm running 2.4 on one of one of
my machines and I was WOW
it was like faster but it just it just
you know came out really fast so I think
that's that's changing also we talked
about that
does anybody want want to hear about the
office open XML open standard issue do
people care
no nobody cares ok I won't talk about it
if you have any questions well alright
I'll talk about it ok so as I said the
Microsoft the Microsoft Office the new
format is called office open XML which
is completely confusing to everybody but
open document format which is the format
that that Open Office uses has been a
standard for quite some time
2006 ok open office XML which is
Microsoft offices standard was submitted
to standards boards to beast - and it's
like a huge it's like this thick and
it's completely Byzantine it was in fact
approved surprisingly enough to me but
how easy it is to implement that open
standard is kind of contested because
it's so Byzantine but so you know when I
when I didn't talk on OpenOffice a while
ago open off oath office open XML was
not a standard and so that was sort of
more contrast but now that it is a
standard they actually are now both
theoretically based on open standards so
that's that's that's just the whole
thing but people I mean the Microsoft
standard is problematic in a number of
ways ok so let me talk about how to get
help because we're gonna be using that a
lot today and actually I did this faster
than I thought so and actually all of
the links for these help things are on
the wiki under Cheryl link so the thing
about getting help with a software with
an open source software package is that
and this is sort of changing I think
quite rapidly but for a long time the
self help was your only
self-help being until hub actually can
be really great I mean the community
help that is around a lot of open source
packages is astoundingly good but it
does people are often used to calling
somebody up or they used to go into
trainings where they sit and you know
people tell them what to do or they're
used to you know they're used to getting
sort of more facilitated official help
and for open source software that's not
been available really for a long time
that is changing there and now more
companies that support open source
software there are more trainings
available for various open source
packages so that is slowly changing but
in terms of for the most part since
since there aren't a huge number of
people who use up on office yet it's
still going to be a lot of self-help but
but the help is great so there is there
are forums on openoffice.org the the
official forums where you can there's
some they're divided up by components
and you can ask anything from an
incredibly newbie question to an
incredible detail question about I tried
to do this macro and didn't work y-you
know I mean everything the whole gamut
or even people who they're people who
are developers in there who are saying I
tweaked this code you know so every
every the whole range and and they
there's a range of some open-source
communities or less this sort of or less
friendly toward newbies and others were
more friendly and it sort of ranges
depending upon the package but the
OpenOffice folks are very friendly
toward newbies so don't worry about
asking totally beginner questions and
that's very active lots of people lots
of cool answering questions there is an
IRC channel how many of you know about
IRC a few of you IRC is stands for
Internet Relay Chat which is an online
live chat system and you can find if
you're on Windows what does the name of
that program that really popular Instant
Messenger program so it's for the T
trillion yeah trillion also does IRC and
but there other there just if you look
if you google IRC client you'll find a
ton of them
my favorite is called X chat
but you just you you basically put in
the server and you put in the channel
and there'll be a bunch of people
sitting there and you can just ask a
question real-time say how do I do this
and people will answer so and I actually
I'll demo that later at lunch and then
there's a bunch of links that I that I
put in to sort of help you out I think
we have a straggler who has arrived so
that's it for the basic 101 and actually
we have more time than I thought which
is great
are there questions about about that yep
okay
mm-hmm
that's a good question
there are a number of ways people make
money on open-source software and I
don't know that I can answer that with
OpenOffice in particular but most people
who are putting money into open-source
software are also providing services to
companies and organizations and people
and it's those services that that people
pay for so it could be consulting about
how to migrate if you've got if you've
got a huge company and they want to you
know it implement this one package
throughout the company it's a huge job
and so there's a lot of time and effort
and energy and so that sort of stuff
people make money on in some examples
actually the Sugar CRM example I
mentioned there's a Community Edition of
Sugar CRM and then there are other
editions that you pay for and what you
pay for are sometimes added features or
you pay for support somebody to call
that kind of thing
that's that's a major model I don't for
openoffice.org I don't know exactly what
I mean no Val has a has their own
version of Linux and so Open Office is
part of that suite and people pay for
that it's Susan Susan Lennox and people
pay for a version of SUSE Linux which
has support and features and even has
extra stuff so that might be part of it
too but primarily people have been
making money on services
yep yep yep
yep yeah
yeah that's that's a great point and and
there are some projects like the one I'm
working on which nobody makes money on I
mean it's the the medical record system
that I work on you know there's no
corporate you know money behind it
actually the WH o or thorne Edition
helps to fund it but so there are lots
of examples of open source software
where nobody actually makes any money
off it that its entire gift economy so I
think yes yep exactly exactly exactly
yep yep yeah yes and yeah totally
there's a great site which people may or
may not know about
it's called Oh low net and it is a site
which talks about open source projects
and you can find out like let's just
pick Mozilla because that's easy so it's
got information got reviews who uses it
but the great thing it's got down here
is oh well that's wrong but that's okay
it sort of summarizes that's definitely
wrong but it sort of summarizes how much
the software because Firefox would cost
way more than that but anyway how much
suffer would cost if somebody had to
like write it from scratch based upon
the number of lines of code which is of
course a problematic estimate or
anything but you can sort of get a
feeling for how much you know there's
some which would you know would cost
gazillions you know if it were written
from scratch so but it's a great it's a
great those are where all the developers
are for Firefox let me actually look up
OpenOffice
and you could also learn about the the
code and how its licensed what it's
written in that's written mostly in C
and C++ it's got a very large active
development team it's got a mature well
established code base and it would cost
yeah this one is all it would cost 138
million dollars to write from scratch
a hundred one hundred thirty-eight no
one else was not spent in writing this
so just so that you sort of have a
feeling for that but it's a great site
okay so given that introduction that
people have some OS we had a newcomer so
can you introduce yourself
cool thank you for coming so far away
all right I think you actually came
further than me I came from Western
Massachusetts so I you know I don't know
whether that's for but Pennsylvania
sounds further away so any changes or
additions to this breakout session
brainstorm but people want to add or
subtract or based upon what I just
talked about
so let's see should we I don't have any
little stickies but why don't I just do
around it let me just take hands for
each of these and then we'll pick the
top say six or something or eight and do
those so and actually if people think
that the policy questions and the issues
with openoffice.org we're sort of the
same the same hi you are oh okay
well yeah come on in have a seat yeah
okay that's fine people think that the
issues with openoffice.org and Paul's
questions were the same yeah I think
yeah I think that was yep
yeah so I'll say plus a question
okay
so pause the questions and issues raise
your hand if you want to one two three
four five six seven eight unique
features of openoffice.org one two three
four five six seven right no commitments
I'm sorry thank you no commitments just
what you're interested in and you can
vote for as many of these as you want so
don't feel like you have to the choice
will be in this sort of the none of the
highest numbers yeah so I'm sorry you
sort of missed the beginning so these
are break we're gonna with their two
breakout sessions just groups yeah
groups get together and and talk about
an investigate stuff there's one in the
morning one in the afternoon and two
these we're brainstorming ideas for what
these breakout groups would be would
talk about and so so and now we're
voting so that we can isolate this down
to the top six so people can so have
three or four maybe yes yes right we'll
be breaking up into small groups yeah I
think six let's say this one I just
count again one two three four five six
seven eight
I think we probably should do four
groups each each session so we'll do
eight groups okay okay so Google
integration and other web services and
other web services integration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
