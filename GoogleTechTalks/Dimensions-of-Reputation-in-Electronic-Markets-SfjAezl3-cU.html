it's a pleasure I haven't actually
visited the Google campus here before
though I've been to the one in New York
many times today's talk is called the
dimensions of reputation and electronic
markets most of my research is actually
theory applied economic theory that's
sort of like you know the bulk of my
published work but recently I've been
dabbling with there's there's so much
interesting data that is being generated
as a byproduct of electronic commerce so
I've been dabbling with data recently
and I'm fortunate to have two wonderful
co-authors on this paper Anand oh gosh
and partnership notice both junior
colleagues of mine both of whom actually
last year were awarded NSF Career Awards
on their first try so I'm reaping some
of the benefits of sort of smart hiring
decisions that we've made over the last
few years so what's the motivation for
this sort of i'm going to spend five
minutes sort of telling you about the
sort of the broader research program
here and then sort of delve into the
details of the specific case study which
is reputation systems the motivation
here is that there's an increasingly
large amount of user-generated content
as all of you know and it's being
generated frequently in a commercial
context as a consequence it's our
conjecture and this is a fairly
reasonable one that this user generated
content is having sort of an economic or
business impact so for instance if you
go to an online retailer you read a
bunch of reviews of a product you're
purchasing decision is influenced by the
content in those reviews and so there is
an economic impact of this you generated
content so it seems like something that
businesses should be paying attention to
that little picture down there which I
stole from The Wall Street Journal is
just simply to sort of highlight the
fact that we've had product reviews and
we've had you know feedback on sellers
and for a while now but the volume of
user-generated content has sort of like
your the interaction between consumers
and websites goes from being sort of
transaction and one-way feedback to more
of a conversation as more people as more
employees create blogs as more um
companies sort of encourage the creation
of wikis that our product related or
commercial the amount of user-generated
content that we're going to be seeing as
having economic impact is increasing now
unfortunately this content doesn't sort
of come neatly packaged in a way that
makes it amenable to immediate analysis
it's not completely unstructured I mean
we do have language and there is sort of
a certain lacks structure associated
with the sentences in content but it's
only semi structured most of it that
like you know we've been interested in
is in the form of text but not
exclusively so you one might think of
recordings of customer service telephone
calls as also being a form of
user-generated content that has
information in it that might for
instance be relevant to product design
so the purpose of this sort of broader
program of research is to quantify this
information that is contained in using
aerated content and see if one can
associate this information with sort of
like you know some sort of measurable
economic impact so what do you need in
order to do this I mean first of all you
need to pick a context in which the
content is actually likely to make a
difference so one might for instance
today you know take a look at sort of
news groups around the web look for
references to halo 3 and try and
associate that with like you know the
earnings of the companies associated
with the email addresses of
the people who are making these postings
with the conjecture that like you know
people were talking about halo 3 today
are probably not being very productive
maybe this will sort of have this you
know halo 3 effect I saw this when halo
2 came out I'm in terms of not just
attendance in my class but in terms of
like you know when in general
productivity but there are some contexts
in which the impact is higher than
others so when the information contained
in this content is something that is not
easily available elsewhere that's when
the content is likely to have a sort of
significant economic impact let me
illustrate this with an example suppose
you are buying you know a flat-screen
television you might go onto opinions or
Amazon or some other sort of site that
is a repository of product reviews and
read what other users have you know said
about the different flat panel
televisions that you were planning to
buy but most people that I've talked to
also go to sort of more specialized
publications they go deep into sort of
the product specs that are well defined
specifications that you know influence
what people think the quality of these
flat panel televisions are so there are
sort of substitutes for these product
reviews elsewhere that are not sort of
necessarily generated by consumers on
the other hand take children's toys the
specs associated with most children's
toys are not really very informative
what you really want to know is is your
kid gonna play with this and enjoy it
and sort of like you know not you know
throw it into a corner in two days so in
that context reading sort of user
experiences from other parents about
these toys has sort of experiential
information that you can't generally get
from other sources and so contexts in
which they're sort of experiential
information contained in the
user-generated content seem to be
contexts in which you know the economic
impact is likely to be the most salient
you also need a measurable economic
variable you need something that you're
trying to to quantify what you mean by
economic impact it could be the price
charged by the manufacturer or product
it could be the price charged by a
retailer over and up
of their competitors as in today's as
will be in today's study it could be
demand could be changes in demand it
couldn't be costs in the context of you
know looking at customer service
feedback and you know the manufacturing
costs you might be looking a customer
satisfaction you might be scouring
employee blogs and trying to associate
them with productivity but you need a
measurable economic variable and then
you need a way of converting this semi
structured content into a set of
variables that can be associated with
the economic variable and what we've
done is used sort of a variety of text
mining techniques for sort of taking the
text that we have in structuring it
however in doing so it also sort of made
us realize that you need methods for
aggregating the structured this like you
know these variables in a way that is
meaningful to the business context and
I'll talk about this a little more room
in a little while sort of leave it
abstract for the time being then finally
you need a way of associating this
aggregated structured content with the
measurable economic variable the
structure the information contained in
the product reviews with say like you
know the price of the product or the
change in demand of the product so
today's case study is on reputation
feedback from a specific online retailer
and how that affects the pricing power
of competing sellers sort of a
disclaimer before I go on the results
that I'm going to present I mean just a
sort of set your expectations there
aren't going to be these things that
jump out at you and make you say aha I
didn't realize that this dimension of
reputation really mattered what I want
you to sort of take away from the top
today it has more to do with you know
here's how you would approach thinking
about quantifying user-generated content
that is created in a commercial context
and associating it with a particular
economic outcome and i'm using a study
on reputation feedback at this online
retailer as a way of sort of showcasing
how you might go about thinking about
and
lysing something like this all right so
so why is reputation feedback
interesting and why do we think that
user generated content might be
influential in this context well we've
sort of been grappling with this puzzle
for many years now that despite sort of
the ability of consumers to actually buy
from any online retailer that they want
and price compare there is still sustain
price dispersion I mean like you know
identical products sold by competing
sellers are listed at different prices
and are sold at different prices so
here's an example of a product that I
know you all love I thought I'd use it
as an example because you know I don't
know for how many years will be able to
use this as an example of a commercial
product anymore and so this sort of a
feeling of nostalgia that I'm getting
never I look at that box but here are
three sellers now these are sellers who
are listing this product on Amazon's
retailing platform so there's no real
difference in terms of like you know and
they listed one next to the other if
someone clicked on this amazon would
handle the payment and then this
retailer would be responsible for
delivery so if I told you that let's get
rid of that picture if I told you that
amazon made the sale with this listing
you wouldn't be surprised right so if
you think about it they have a $44 sort
of their prices $44 lower that midway
it's about $53 if you include shipping
lower than aunt online and so there's no
real premium that Amazon is charging
like you know based on the data that you
have over here but this isn't the whole
story on the same page there are also
two other sellers listed there's jnr
selling it for $62 less than amazon is
tiger direct selling it for eleven
dollars less than amazon however amazon
still manages to sell this product at
the
is that they are charging frequently so
those differences that I've highlighted
up there what I'm going to be calling
price premiums in what form so amazon
has a price premium of ten dollars and
ninety-nine cents / tiger direct and $62
/ jnr and the negative price premium
over the other two so you might conclude
okay this is probably an isolated case I
mean you know this is Amazon's platform
this is amazon's price maybe people
aren't seeing this page maybe they're
just going and clicking on it that's not
really the case um in the data that
we've gathered which relate to the sale
of 280 different software titles over a
six-month period what I'm showing you
here is the distribution of this
measured price premium so we take each
successfully completed transaction and
we look at the difference between the
price of the seller who made the sale
and the price of the other sellers
listed who was selling an identical
product who were listed on the same page
and who had that product available at
the time the seller made the sale so let
me repeat that it's at the time a seller
made a sale on Amazon's platform what is
the difference between the price the
successful seller was charging and the
price that the other sellers who the
consumer could have bought from had
listed for an identical product and this
is software and so we know we don't have
to worry about things like in a
condition of book and so I'm it software
software that's why we chose it sort of
as our first context so it's sort of
puzzling right I mean what's going on
here why are these consumers paying so
many more dollars to the seller that
they successfully that they buy from
when in fact a set of competing
alternatives that a lower price exists
yes you had a question
yes exactly I'm a question was whether
the last slide that I showed would
produce four data points in yes M so M
data points one for each competing
seller at the time a successful a
transaction is successfully completed we
have a way of sort of mining the XML
feed that they give us to info when a
listing disappears but i'll actually
spend five minutes sort of somewhere in
the middle of the talk getting into the
details of that if i have time so one
might wonder i mean what are these
consumers paying for I mean consumers
are rational to some extent they're
being presented with a set of competing
alternatives for an identical product on
the same retailing platform there's got
to be something that they're paying for
over and above that they're paying these
sellers a premium for
well um not really because these are
cases in which the seller who
successfully sold the product had a
higher price than one or more of his
competitors over here it wouldn't be
that surprising because it would just
mean that my price was lower yes but is
the last the whole point you in the last
chart would produce points over there
they weren't sales well no if Amazon
made the sale then there would be two
points produced that would be on the
Left where Amazon had a lower price and
two points produced which would be on
the right where Amazon had a higher
price than a competitor but still
successfully transacted okay
okay the question is do we consider the
position of the product no we don't
actually there's sort of an implicit
assumption here that if someone is
considering a product that they would
have actually sort of scroll down and
looked at all the competing alternatives
although I do believe that these
products are generally listed there's
sometimes a featured seller but these
products are generally reserved in
ascending order of price so sort of
makes it even more surprising because
you know the lowest price guy is going
to be on top all right so our conjecture
here is that when you transact online
you buy more than a product okay what
you're actually paying for is not just
the product itself but a set of what we
call fulfillment characteristics so the
things that we take for granted when we
buy stuff in the real world you go to
bestbuy you I'm thinking of buying a
flat panel television so this is sort of
like you know on my mind as the standard
example you go you look at it and then
when you actually transact you pick it
up and you have the product with you
it's in its box so there are a few
things that you've sort of taken for
granted in this transaction as compared
to transacting online right you don't
know when the product is going to arrive
you don't know if the product that is
going to be sent to you by the seller is
actually going to be the one that you
ordered if you have a problem you don't
know if they're going to take it back
and so there are all these sort of
dimensions of fulfillment that used to
be sort of obvious when you transacted
in a face-to-face setting which have to
somehow be inferred when you're
transacting online and it's been
recognized for a while the reputation
systems play a role here they provide
consumers with information about these
unobserved characteristics however what
sort of the prior literature has ignored
is that you know there are many
different characteristics I mean I might
care about getting the product as soon
as possible someone
us might care about like you know has it
been packaged well someone else might
care about like you know if I change my
mind want to change my order how
responsive is the seller to my needs
someone else might just say like you
know if I call these guys I want them to
be polite I want an email acknowledging
the fact that I've placed my order I
mean consumers are different the
heterogeneous different consumers value
different things and different sellers
have varying abilities on these
characteristics some of them might
compete on delivery some of them might
compete on you know sort of you know
sending it the day it's ordered in every
case I actually sort of went on to the
side and became a retailer for a period
of three months I sold used books just
to sort of get a sense for like you know
what it and it's relatively
straightforward sort of build up a
reputation here and different people do
care about different things so um we
think that the fact that um you know
nobody has recognized is yet that
reputation or like you know that sellers
are multi-dimensional in terms of the
information that's contained in their
reputation profiles and buyers are
heterogeneous is one of the reasons why
there's been sort of like you know an
area of evidence all over the place
about des reputation matter some people
say that positive feedback matters
negative doesn't others say that we
can't find any evidence that positive
matters but negative comments are the
ones that really matter these studies
are generally conducted using data from
eBay which sort of makes the outcomes
sort of susceptible to the usual
problems associated with variables that
are determined using an auction and the
measure of reputation tends to be fairly
one-dimensional as either a numerical
score maybe they're sort of like you
know how many transactions but it's sort
of taking something that is capturing a
fairly rich multi-dimensional
characteristic of a seller and reducing
it to like you know a number between 0
and 5
so if you look at this reputation
profile you'll see that yes there are
numbers associated with it how many
times is the seller transacted and you
know what's their average rating and how
many times have transacted but there's a
ton of other information as well and you
know every time someone posts feedback
and gives them a score they also post
text and there's a lot of information
about the seller in this text so if you
think about what I said about economic
impact it's reasonable to conjecture
that consumers are reading these things
and making their purchasing decisions
based on the information that is
contained in this text if that is the
case then the price that these consumers
pay to the successful sellers should be
associated in some way with the
information that's in this some
reputation feedback and that's what we
do in this study we sort of structure it
and try and associate try and find like
you know what kind of feedback leads to
like you know what level of pricing
power so here are our questions um we're
interested in identifying the different
dimensions of online reputation that is
what are the characteristics that seller
buyers are talking about when they post
feedback about sellers what do they care
about and can we quantify these
different dimensions so can you actually
measure the direction of like you know
having because this the content the
textual content that is provided here
it's not as if the buyer is given a set
of dimensions and asked to score them on
125 they just sort of like you know
typing feedback right and so we want to
be able to sort of evaluate the strength
and the direction of each individual
evaluation so how much better is it for
someone to have good service rather than
okay service is ok service positive it
may well be negative given the sort of
like you know superlatives that are
generally used in
user feedback of this kind a super-fast
debris faster than excellent delivery is
good packaging a positive evaluation and
is there a simple way of aggregating you
know these sort of these dimension
modifier pairs into topics that have
sort of a meaningful business context
and I'll spend a couple of minutes on
this towards the end of the talk and
then like you know the second part so
this is sort of explanatory I'm like you
know how do we quantify looking at
outcomes that have already occurred and
looking at the price premiums that
successful sellers have been charging to
what extent can we quantify how can we
associate these price premiums with the
information contained in the textual
feedback appropriately structured the
second bit has to do with predictive
modeling and can you actually use the
information contained in these
reputation profiles to predict given a
set of competing sellers who's going to
make the sale and if you can do that how
you go can you convert this and maybe
this would sort of be of special
interest to your company can you convert
this into some sort of product for
sellers when you tell us LOL and here's
your here's the feedback that your
consumers have given you
can you guys in the back hear me all
right um where you tell a seller this is
what your consumers have said about you
tell me who your competitors are let me
look at the price that you're charging
now and
is there a way that i can actually i see
the volume has gone up is there a way
that guidance can be provided to a
seller in the following way saying that
well here's what your consumers have
said about you show me the sort of like
here are the people who are competing
with you the price that you're charging
is too low you can charge more and
you'll still have a good probability of
making the sale so we've actually sort
of developed a prototype of a tool that
can do this for sellers on amazon one
could potentially think of converting
this into a tool for buyers one might
think of converting this into part of a
marketplace infrastructure so as to
increase the efficiency of transactions
all right so that's sort of the research
agenda can we explain price premiums
going to use it to predict here yes we
would and sort of the model that
underlies our data analysis does
recognize that buyers are different we
don't actually have any information
about how these buyers are different and
so you know the model is an identified
and we can't disentangle what but I do
have one result that sort of provides
evidence that buyers are heterogeneous
in a particular way but you're right
alright so what's the data that we're
using i'm sort of skipping the part
about the model and just sort of going
into the data and like you know like you
know the equations that we has to met
them so we tracked the transactions
associated with a randomly selected
sample of 280 software products across
five different categories what we did is
we gather data on all the secondary
market transactions that is this is from
amazon when a product is listed in
addition to amazon actually listing its
own offer there's a bunch of people who
sort
conduct Commerce using Amazon's platform
so that's what we're calling the
secondary market even though all of
these products are typically new we have
the complete reputation profiles for all
of the sellers who completed one or more
transactions during the six-month period
so in our sample there was a total of a
little over a thousand sellers about
twelve percent of them actually
successfully completed a transaction on
the 280 products that we're tracking so
they may have completed other
transactions on you know you might think
which is what are they doing there if
only and so this leads to about 108,000
observations and to sort of go back to a
question that was asked yes an
observation consists of a transaction
for each transaction if there are M
competitors then there are M
observations generated each one
consisting of the differences in the
reputation of the seller and the
competitor and the differences in the
price charged by the seller who
succeeded and the competitor who didn't
all right this is just a sort of refresh
your memory about the fact that you know
so this would if amazon sold the product
here this would generate for
observations to go back to house
question about how do we infer whether a
sale has occurred or not this is a
snapshot of the kind of data that you
know we start with where you have a
unique identifier for each seller you
have a time stamp associated with the
fact that the listing exists there is a
unique identifier associated with a
particular product and so microsoft
windows vista would have a particular
identify or a particular book would have
a particular identifier and there's an
identifier associated with a particular
listing and this is sort of important so
if a seller lists a particular item the
item is sold and then the seller says
okay I've got one more of these let me
list it again you'd have the same cell
i D you'd have the same item ID but the
listing ID would be different even if
arm it was the same seller selling the
same product and so um once a product is
sold the next time we get the feed that
listing no longer exists yes purchaser
and one of the things that i noticed i'm
wondering if you to capture here is that
much more likely to pay iranian
important to deal with somebody that
I've dealt with before rather than deal
with someone from all of the external
signals might be just bitter debtor and
the price might be lower but simply the
premium is small and the offer prefer to
be stinky do you have customer identity
over transactions so you can measure
stickiness okay so the question had to
do with can we take into account the
fact that bias sometimes like to buy
from sellers who they have transacted
with before because they have sort of
gain experience information from
personal experience in this particular
study no it's a good point it's one that
we've thought about we can infer which
buyer posted like you know Mira posting
about each seller but given the data
that we have we cannot associate a
particular buyer with each of these
transactions and so that's something
where it's it's a reasonable conjecture
I think that it actually would sort of
pan out as part of a sort of model of
behavior of consumers but in order to
actually sort of establish the extent to
which this matters we would sort of need
data at a sort of higher granularity
than we have available right now okay so
if you take this example we've got you
know a feed on a particular day let me
get the feed sort of on the next day or
these are sort of an eight hour
intervals if the listing still exists
for a particular listing then we know
that the item is still available
if on the other hand the listing has
disappeared we conclude that the item
has been sold it could be that this like
you know I think every 60 days these
items are automatically delisted so
there is a little bit of noise in this
data and we sort of check to see if you
know it happened to correspond to a
listing that was exactly 60 days old in
which case we drop it from our data but
we're sort of making the leap of faith
here that this corresponds to a
transaction rather than the seller just
sort of D listing it because there's
there aren't too many reasons why you
think a seller would d list a product
because they've already paid the fee to
list it okay so that's how we sort of
make inferences about what transactions
have occurred and every time we notice
one of these transactions what we do is
we look at like you know the competitive
profile or they'd say the competitive
czar a landscape for that particular
seller and we create these different
observations okay so we look at the
entire reputation profile of that but if
we capture like you know the identity of
these competing sellers we sort of
record the time at which this occurred
so that we can capture their reputation
at the point in time that the
transaction occurred and we sort of keep
track of that for each of the competing
sellers at the time that the sale
occurred
so we sort of measured the premium the
pricing power of sellers in two
different ways one is in the way that
I've just been talking about where there
are celica for every seller competitor
paired as an observation generated we
also sort of looked at a different
measure which is sort of like you know
take the average of the competitor
prices and take the difference between
that and the sellers price so we get one
observation per transaction so on
average how much more can a seller
charge then its competitors so that's
the distribution of seller competitor
pair um price premiums the one that I
showed you are an earlier slide where we
sort of like you know hypothesis is that
like you know all of this pricing power
that is contained in you know the the
right side of the distribution is on
account of like you know sellers having
a better reputation and this reputation
being something that buyers are willing
to pay for slightly flatter distribution
for average not surprisingly so you've
got but you know there's still um this
what's what's interesting about this is
that it's not just sort of like you know
it peaks near zero or slightly below
zero which is not surprising and but you
know there's there's a fairly large sort
of probability mass all the way down to
it doesn't sort of just Peter off so
there's clearly something going on here
all right the other variables that we
have since we know that this is not the
only thing that is influencing a
seller's success or not we've got the
price of the product maybe reputation
matters more for more expensive products
maybe it doesn't and we've got all the
numerical information that prior studies
have like you know maybe there are some
people who do only look at the numbers
and don't read the text we've got that
information maybe there are some buyers
who only care about how long the seller
has been transacting
and not really about their rating and so
or place a higher premium on people who
have been around longer sort of
inferring that they're more reliable so
we've got that variable as well and
maybe the pricing part of a seller is
affected negatively by the number of
competitors that they have if at some
point there only three people who have
listed a product maybe you're going to
charge a higher price if there are 14
people maybe you're going to charge a
lower price so we've sort of control for
that as well now how do we decompose the
reputation profile so our underlying
model is that every seller is
characterized by a set of fulfillment
characteristics and we model each
characteristic as a dimension
represented by some particular noun or
verb phrase shipping for instance would
be a dimension packaging would be a
dimension delivery would be a dimension
responsiveness would be a dimension
politeness would be a dimension service
would be a dimension and for each of
these sellers we sort of you know mind
their text to discover these dimensions
so if you take the example that I showed
you earlier you sort of let loose one of
these syntactic parcels or nom the text
that is contained in the reputation
profile and it goes and it sort of
identifies the different dimensions
and then the same sort of program then
sort of associates particular modifiers
with these dimensions so when someone is
commenting on shipping it could be fast
shipping and that's sort of like you
know that's fairly clear what the
polarity of that sort of modification of
shipping is same agreed packaging and
terrible service what about phenomenal
unresponsiveness you might conclude that
um this is clearly not a positive
assessment and I guess that sort of
strikes at the heart of why our method
is sort of different because how
valuable or not valuable phenomenal
unresponsiveness is going to be in the
text is going to actually be driven by
whether or not this leads to a positive
or negative price premium and this could
unbelievable price I'm not quite sure
that that's positive or negative it
could be positive it could be negative
as well of course if it's negative then
one might wonder why the buyer sort of
transacted with that seller at all but
anyway the main point here is that these
dimensions are not modified by scores
they're modified by words and sometimes
the polarity of these words can depend
on the dimension that they're modifying
all right so
this is how the text retrieval algorithm
works we get all the feedback postings
associated with seller we use a tagger
and you know the actual programs that
we're using here are sort of standard
open source stuff and we haven't sort of
actually the innovation here is not in a
new method for actually mining the Texas
is also from one of my co-authors panos
is sort of a text mining expert and so
this is sort of fairly standard you know
here's how you structure the stuff so we
end up with 151 unique dimensions and he
sort of pool of 142 modifiers that are
associated with them clearly not every
dimension has all 142 modifiers
associated with it but there's some
overlap so what we do is we take this
order like you know unstructured text
and it ends up being this matrix you can
think of you know every posting as
having a particular let me give you an
example actually so um you know suppose
the feedback was I was impressed by the
speedy delivery great service we'd end
up with two dimensions service and
delivery and to modify as associate with
those dimensions PD and great and then
we sort of discovered all these
dimensions and so they're sort of one
column of the matrix associated with
each dimension and then the
corresponding modifier is like you know
scores or like you know modifies that
particular dimension and so our postings
are structured in the following way
now we're still in sort of the realm of
words right phenomenal unresponsiveness
great service so what we're sort of the
model of behavior we have here is that
one it accounts for the fact that older
reputation postings are less likely to
have been read by a buyer that newer
ones so they're sort of like you know a
damping factor that we apply to you know
older postings relative to new depending
on their 25 listed per page and so
there's a particular factor associated
with clicking from one page to the next
page that and we take into account the
fact that a buyer might have different
weights placed on each of these
different dimensions but we don't have
data about what these weights are for
specific buyers and so what we estimate
will sort of end up being a mixture of
the true score associated with having a
particular word modify a particular
dimension and the weights themselves and
so given a set of scores associated with
a particular dimension what if I a pair
and a set of weights associated with a
particular buyer on what this captures
is the premium that that buyer is
willing to pay a seller
so then again just to sort of highlight
this what we're doing here is we're
using these price premiums as being
completely determined by our control
variables and the reputation as embodied
in the text and so the scores that we're
going to estimate now which you know
will account for what were the
quantitative variables and like you know
lifetime numerical rating and so on and
you know so there's one variable in the
this one dependent independent variable
associated with each dimension modify a
pair and eventually the coefficient of
that variable gives you a sense for how
important is that dimension modifier
pair and the sine of that coefficient is
an estimate of is the polarity of this
modifier for this particular dimension
positive or negative so we're not going
to sort of some sort of word bank or
deciding that like you know some words a
positive and some words a negative it's
the economic value of having these in
your feedback that is actually driving
how we score these on how we score like
you know the modification of a
particular dimension so here are some
estimates um like what I want you to
take away from this particular picture
and as I said like you know are the
regressions that we've run are very
simple you know we just sort of like you
know modify data in a way that like you
know makes the distributions well
behaved and it's sort of like an
ordinary least-squares we do sort of you
know control for unobserved
heterogeneity the so that might
partially account for some of this sort
of repeat you know a buyer might be
buying from particular seller may be a
seller has you know other aspects to
them that are not contained in this so
we've sort of this particular table has
product seller and competitor fixed
effects and the
dependent variable has to do with sort
of a base basic price premium not the
average now what this in I guess there
are two things that I want you to take
away from this these particular
coefficients the signs of these things
are sort of as expected if a this is a
variable that captures the difference
between the numerical rating of the
seller who successfully transacted and
the medical rating of their competitor
so having a higher rating than your
competitors leads to a higher price
premium having transacted longer is to a
higher price premium and the more
competitors that you're competing with
at any point in time the lower the price
premium that you're charging okay all
sort of like you know fairly intuitive
do the same thing but in the equation
that we estimate whose coefficients are
listed on the right of this slide we
also include like you know the dimension
modifier pairs one variable for each
dimension modifier pair and two things
happen first of all on the extent to
which these numerical ratings explain
variations in price premium goes down
the magnitude drops and the explanatory
power of the model goes up and so both
of these are sort of positive signs its
book them are consistent with the theory
that people are actually reading this
user generated content and making
decisions based on
it's um I don't have a good way I mean
like you know so I'm sort of committing
the cardinal sin of the speaker who puts
up like you know a big table of numbers
and doesn't have like you know a good
way for you to sort of get your heads
around them the signs of these
coefficients are meaningful so positive
coefficient corresponds to like you know
having determined that a particular
dimension modifier pair evidence that
that has a positive impact on the price
that arcelik in charge so excellent
communication is good best seller is
good friendly service is good great
merchant is good I'd hesitate to compare
the magnitudes of these across because
the ranges of the like you know variable
values are different what we've done
here is that the variable contains the
score of the seller on a particular
dimension modify a pair and then we take
the difference of that score and the
corresponding score of the competing
seller who did not make the sale which
is why some of these have negative means
and so some things appear more
frequently some phrases appear more
frequently than others and so it's hard
to sort of make a meaningful from this
table make a meaningful sort of
quantitative comparison between the
magnitudes of these here are some things
that you don't want to have in your text
feedback wrong address never responded
that experience defective product or
consistently significantly negatively
affecting the premium that you can
charge and so I'm sort of like you know
in order to actually make meaningful
comparisons we sort of went through this
exercise of saying well how do we
transform this account for the fact that
these variables have different ranges
and associate a dollar value with having
a particular phrase dimension modify a
pair in the feedback that your buyers
are posting for you so what you'd
interpret these as is if if a particular
seller had wonderful experience in every
one of their feedback postings
then like you know sort of the
estimation that we've done would suggest
that the seller can charge on average a
premium of five dollars and eighty six
cents over its competitors and you know
that may not seem like a very large sum
but you know this is the these are
software titles that cost anywhere from
like you know tens of dollars to like
you know a couple hundred dollars so
this is like an extremely significant
amount in terms of like you know
relative to the average margin that you
might expect a seller in this
marketplace to be making whenever I look
at this table I'm sort of end up playing
this you know word association game
where I try to combine can try to
construct phrases that might have like
you know the positive dimension modify
pair and a negative dimension modifier
pair it reminds me of sort of a party
game that used to play so so for
instance um you know lightning delivery
and a horrible experience so you know
there was perfect packaging but it
wasn't as advertised anyway um what I
want you to take away from the slide is
that you know there are potentially
significant like you know dollar amounts
associated with having like you know
negative text in your reputation profile
and these are numbers that you can in
fact sort of like you know make a
meaningful sort of side-by-side
comparison so wonderful experience is
clearly a lot more important than a plus
plus plus seller in terms of like you
know what dimensions matter more than
others we don't have a way of actually
saying that this dimension matters more
than that dimension because in a sense
we would have to sort of equalize the
modifiers then and our theory is based
on this conjecture that we're not the
first people to make this but that like
you know sort of the value of a
particular modifier depends on the
dimension that is modifying yeah
in terms of absolute take a look at the
data in terms of proportion of the base
price does it does it get better or
worse well we have controlled for the
absolute product price and yes for
products that have higher prices have
higher price premiums as well and so
like you know high prices associated we
haven't and that that's sort of an
interesting suggestion and that's
something that I'll try um is to sort of
look at price premium as like a in
percentage terms right okay I'm that I
don't actually have that analysis but
it's something that it's probably worth
looking at yeah probably a much more
wonderful than you
she'll be surprised how many people use
this a plus plus plus I mean actually
even more popular as a plus plus plus
plus plus and so like you know the 5
plusses there seems to be something
about that yes yes it is possible but if
you go back to so I mean each of these
sort of has occurred frequently enough
so that like when we actually are making
the Association we're estimating our
coefficients in this OLS associating
that dimension with a price premium sort
of the variance is low enough that it
actually sort of shows up significant in
the equation so we're only looking at
the 500 most frequently occurring
dimension modifier pairs and so you know
the ones that end up being sort of
having a significant impact on price
premiums are tend to be the ones we're
like you know their tents there is sort
of a sufficiently frequent presence in
our nearer so but you're right i mean
like you know there are potentially
different ranges of error associated
with these and i wish i had the data on
the actual sort of like you know dollar
error margins but i don't all right so
here's here are some other results that
in my last five minutes I'll try to sort
of go through it struck us after we have
completed this analysis that it would be
nice to have a way of aggregating these
dimension modifier pairs into something
into sort of meaningful business sort of
buckets this corresponds to service this
corresponds to you know delivery this
corresponds to responsiveness and we
experimented with a bunch of sort of
topic identification methods from text
mining and none of them worked in a
satisfactory way and this was actually
an interesting process because through
not being able to do this in an
automated way we realized that they're
all based on a different model
of generation of content because these
topic clustering methods sort of assume
that things are I mean say to dimension
modifier pairs correspond to the same
topic are more likely to correspond to
the same topic if they occur frequently
together in the same documents now
that's not the case with this kind of
user-generated content i mean if
someone's mentioned delivery once
they're not going to mention a synonym
of delivery or and so the sort of the
basic generative model that would lead
to efficient or like you know so
effective automated topic clustering has
to change for this kind of thing and
that something we're working on so we
resorted to the semi automated method
which is we hired two research
assistants to cluster these things of my
hand this is a familiar method I'm sure
many of you have used it in the past or
sort of participated in such processes
and sort of broadly a weave so we've got
positive neutral and negative sentiments
associated with a particular dimension
what if I a pair and we put them into
eight buckets we sort of went through
the same process of like you're not
trying to associate a particular you
know how valuable is having a particular
score and we sort of normalize
everything use these scores and so we
found significant variation in like you
know the relative importance of each of
them but I don't want to sort of we're
still refining this I'm not completely
satisfied with like you know the way in
which this has happened I want to make
it more automated but this sort of is
one of the challenges that we're dealing
with right now we also built a model to
predict marketplace outcomes very simple
one all we did was we took each seller
competitor pair treat that as a sort of
like you know one data point and we
trained a binary classifier which is
like you know given the seller and given
this competitor which of the two will
make the sale if they're both listed
together
that was sort of like another task that
was a simplest classification task that
we could think of we used let's see we
tried naive Bayes but that didn't work
well so we used a decision tree
eventually we didn't try sort of the
more support vector machines or any of
those more sophisticated things now the
model had virtually no predictive power
when you took only price and product
characteristics into account which is
against our not surprising if you took
the numerical measures of text and
numerical measures of reputation
lifetime and average rating and use them
as features it sort of substantially
better sort of like you know
classification accuracy if you took the
structured text variables into account
as well there was like you know nine
times out of ten pretty much we were
able to predict whether given two
competing sellers which one's going to
make the sale and this is off a sort of
like you know 5050 in the absence of
this um we've done the usual sort of
sanity checks on our opinion mining
algorithm the thing that actually
structures these again we sort of hired
two research assistants to go through
the process of manually identifying
dimension modifier pairs and the recall
of our algorithm did not differ
significantly from that of the human
beings and the final thing we did was we
this was based on the conjecture that
suppose a seller has successfully made a
transaction conducted a transaction I
mean I started by saying that sellers
are different they're heterogeneous in
their ability to provide these different
fulfillment characteristics this sort of
test goes one step further and says well
given that a particular transaction has
occurred it's also more likely that the
bio who participated in this transaction
values what that seller is good at so um
you know what we did was we identified
what each seller is best at relative to
like you know across all the fulfillment
characteristics and we tested to see
whether being
at what you're good at relative to your
not what your competitors are good at
but relative to your competitors scores
on what you're good at has additional
explanatory power over and above like
you know just being a particular
dimension and in like you know all of
the specifications it was positive and
significant and so this is sort of
evidence that like in that supports the
fact that like you know biosci
heterogeneous but that's as far as we've
gone okay let me wrap up what I've
described to you today is like you know
evidence that supports the conjecture
that there is useful information in like
you know the text associated with
reputation profiles I describe to you
how you can automatically sort of score
the sentiment associated with the text
in like you know a reputation profile
using an economic variable and rather
than sort of like you know some
preconceived notion of what the polarity
of a particular word is this idea that
textual feedback matters and has an
impact on the pricing power of a seller
we've sort of taken two different ways
of validating it we've sort of explained
observed outcomes and we've also built a
predictive model and shown that its
performance improves significantly when
you take the text into account so one
might think of these as if the theory is
right then you know you should have
explanatory support and your predictive
model should be better and so both of
these are consistent with the fact that
like you know this user-generated
contact is in fact having an economic
impact it's also fun research it's nice
to sort of dabble as I mentioned at the
start of this talk most of my prior work
was sort of applied industrial
organization economics theory in the
context of information technology price
saying network effects and so I'm
dabbling with data can be fun and so
that sort of like you know finding that
I'm particularly happy to have
gotten and to go back where I started I
think this is important and thinking
about how do you quantify the value of
information contained in textual content
is important it's a program of
Investigation that we're expanding to
other contexts as well because users are
generating content in these sort of
business contexts in a way that we
believe influences outcomes and like you
know as our methods to actually sort of
aggregate and mine this information
become more and more sophisticated it
seems like you know there are lots of
applications for how you might quantify
this influence and our particular study
is one way of here's how you go about
doing it if you're interested in my
research on other topics this is my
website you can also google me of course
and thanks for your time if you have any
questions I'd be happy to answer them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
