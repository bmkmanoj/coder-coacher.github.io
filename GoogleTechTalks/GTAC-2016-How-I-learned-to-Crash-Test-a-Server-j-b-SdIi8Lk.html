the conference talk on testing crashing
servers by Jonathan Abraham's so I will
hand it off to him okay thank you
the slides up
here it looks like it got fit here okay
that's probably when I moved in up that
there you go that looks like yours okay
thanks
hi I'm Jonathan Abraham's i work at
MongoDB in the test infrastructure group
hopefully some of you are familiar with
what mod would be MongoDB does and we're
going to talk a little bit about how we
test our server under crash scenarios so
as you are probably aware machines can
crash variety of reasons maybe it's in a
virtual machine or it might actually be
a physical machine and we need to see
what's going to happen to our mongo DB
server I mean it's pretty important
we're holding data that's stored out to
disk and we really don't know when we
came into this project we weren't really
sure can we be robust enough to survive
that so there could be operating system
failures hardware failures and then
there's also application crashes of the
MongoDB itself where maybe got some sort
of unexpected termination maybe from
fuzzing well we could actually try to
supporting a manga d which is the
process of the server but it really
doesn't fully simulate what happens if
you have an unexpected crash of the
machine or like the opposite operating
system kernel we really want to be able
to test some sort of immediate power
loss because of caching that might be
done at the at the lowest level of vio
and also kernel panics can leave the
application and the data and
unrecoverable states so this is your
typical startup of your machine after
it's been terminated or even booted it
will go into some sort of hardware and
software checks in the operating system
and then eventually it'll turn it over
to your application in our case the
lemond Goudy has its own recovery mode
it can detect the fact that had been
terminated and if it passes that then it
allows it to be connected to my clients
so you know how are you going to go
about when we get it when we jumped into
this project what are you going to do
about testing something like you know
power failures all the easiest thing is
just basically run
the on some machine in the lab or at
your desk and pull the plug and start up
again see what happens of course that's
manual and labor intensive and you know
you can't do this across you know
different testing cycles so then the
next the next thought was well we could
do a real low tech cheap solution let's
just put an appliance timer there you
don't have to be there to actually pull
the plug but the appliance time I'll do
it but the appliance timer is it's not
fine grained it's 15 minutes you gotta
wait before it can actually turn it back
on so you can't do these repeatedly over
and over again and get you know maybe
quick results another alternative
approach which we'll discuss a little
bit later how this was done was to use
an internal command to actually crashing
machine which is almost functionally
equivalent to a power cycle and then I
was able to set this up in a cron job so
we can run this internal command so
everything's kind of like running on
that machine so that was another
approach so we realize we really do this
a lot more often and you know so we have
to go figure out how we going to be able
to do the silver and over again because
the recovery the moment in which you
crash it's very subtle we really don't
know one point what might be running
that might cause something to be
unrecoverable so we want to run it like
maybe on a hundred times or something
for we feel good about this so we came
across this solution which I don't know
if you can actually see it here this is
what we use for the power part it's
called ubiquity empower pro let me see
if I turn on the light and it's a
programmable power device where you have
ssh access to it and all you do is you
go in there you can basically turn off
one of the outlets on here or any of the
outlets with a very simple command this
is how it's done hopefully you can see
that on the slides all you do is you
send the zero to shut it off to some /
dev / let's say output 8 which this is
plugged into and to turn it back on you
send the one in there and that's all
that script is doing right now
so that was one part of solution we
figured out how we can crash physical
machines and repeatedly turn them off
and on what about virtual machines
virtual machines operate differently
they use shared hardware or rather than
you shared resources because they rely
on the underlying host operating system
and it's also important to test virtual
machines for maybe terminations of the
virtual machine because that's what a
lot of our customers use out in a cloud
or even in their own data centers
they're actually running with virtual
machines so it's important to know from
a completeness / completeness
perspective whether or not virtual
machines are going to have any problems
as well as physical machines krasic
virtual machines actually turned out to
be fairly simple you know like using kbm
type of machines using the linux
containers it's just using a this verse
destroy command which is you know
there's nothing sent to the underlying
applications running in the machine it's
it's like basically destroying it and
but it doesn't destroy the machine from
the per sec perspective you can't bring
it back up it's just basically it's like
a shut off and VMware also has this VM
run stop hard taya command and turning
them back on is it's a saying Carl our
you're just running star commands and
believe not they actually do come back
on I did script this and we use both of
these and you could probably do this for
other virtualization you know other
virtualization machines as well so
here's the other part that I did uncover
about internal crashing which works for
Linux only there's this thing called a
assists RQ key which is like as if you
are at the console and you want to
basically put it into some boot mode
it's you can do this through software by
writing a one-out to process colonel sis
RQ sets it up and then you said that you
send the b4 boot to praxis RQ trigger
it's an immediate boot of your
your machine so here is another part of
where you can basically internally take
any Linux machine I think you know most
modern ones at least and it will just
boot it right up so it's it's like
another type of crash one other part
that we stumbled upon was that when the
machines do come back on and they're
plugged into something you have to make
sure your bios is set so that when it
sees the power will actually bring it
back up so that's another one of those
caveats when those machines have some
sorta ditional prompting that will
happen sometimes so that was another
thing I was able to script in so I was
able to actually do power cycles and
window machines but through the physical
means and there's a utility called
bcdedit and you can set the boot status
policy to ignore those failures so it
doesn't give you these prompts like do
you really you know want to go into
recovery mode you want to boot normally
so essentially you can just basically
plug a machine into here run run some
subscript of crashes it and whether it's
plugged into a Linux machine or Windows
machine they'll come back up now if you
want to run whatever application in our
case Mongo d you can go ahead and run
your applications as you would normally
and then you know do whatever test you
want to do so we have the machine we
figured out all these key parts to it we
stitch them together into a bash script
and like I said before the Mongol d goes
into this recovery mode this is
performed automatically in the case of
our storage engine wired tiger which is
what I haven't my shirt which is our
default storage engine now it's going to
go and look for some stable the last
stable copy of the data it has on disk
from the last checkpoint it wrote out
and then it apply a journal log to bring
it back up it's a little bit more we
want to do in the scripting before we
actually crash machine will actually
want to apply some sort of moderate load
or maybe more than moderate of all sorts
of different type of database commands
and to basically put the database server
into
anymode we can think of so that at the
time the crash happens we'll be able to
you know possibly stimulate a crude data
corruption or something like that that's
what would be our failure and in our
case you know that was specific to the
mongo d server we added in some other
options about how we wanted the clients
to do that whether we be in a replica
said single no replica said or
standalone what storage engine to test
when we started the testing wire tiger
was new to MongoDB we actually had just
acquired its and it was being introduced
as a second storage engine we use em map
v1 as our storage engine prior to
three-point oh and there was a lot of
focus on making sure that wired tiger
would you know was really going to be
robust enough to switch it so after it
started like I said we're going to do
some other things check the status of
the server but the key point is that if
we fail to recover or we can't connect
to the MongoDB because maybe it died or
something like that and some other
validation that we can run against the
Mongo d once it comes back up we know
the test has failed okay this basically
talks a little about the type of things
that we do after we've restarted it the
validation is an additional step for
those of you who do you it's Mongo d
that does not happen on recovery mode
recovery mode is not as it doesn't look
through all the documents to make sure
that it's um there's no problems but
validation actually goes through your
collections thoroughly it's it's a slow
process but it might be necessary to if
you do encounter this type of situation
what was good about this project is we
developed a script to make it basically
like a cell service application because
we had developers in all over the world
and this script actually can not only
can run on it doesn't need any custom
hardware can run on Windows machines it
can run on Linux machines it can run in
the cloud it c'mon localized and remote
hardware things like that and we'll save
some data for in case of failure is
detected will will backup data for our
for developers to use so in conclusion
we found that the crash testing help to
extend our testing
scenarios we had not previously covered
and to be able to provide these local
remote teams with the tools to reproduce
and analyze the failures and we helped
to improve the storage layer hopefully
for the MongoDB like I mentioned before
we did find some bugs there and here's a
list of some of bugs we found most of
more fixed and I think there might be
one that they're still working on one
open issue that i did find that i
haven't been able to solve maybe we have
somebody out here on the windows crowd
you can easily crash like i said
internally the linux machines but from
windows you get these blue screens of
death all the time but there's aI don't
believe there's any systematic way to to
crash your Windows machine if anybody
knows you know please send me an email
or be in touch with me afterwards and
I'd love to hear about that thank you
thanks Jonathan so tools to crash
computers i am picking up so many great
things from this conference turn my
light back on so we do have a question
from the audience how do you verify that
all committed changes are present after
the recovery all committed changes are
present after the recovery okay so that
yeah it's a good question so that's part
of the validation right so we one of the
things that one of the one of the
options that i mentioned before was i
write a check point document out before
i do the crash which is an optional
thing because also that can trigger
certain things that could happen that
the database layer so if that doesn't
show up then you know we have what we
call on homer and a replica set an appt
log so if that shows up then we should
have everything prior to that so that's
one of the ways we're able to determine
that but um you know if your application
you know want to do something like this
you probably have to come up with some
ways of figuring out how you're going to
be able to determine that it's
successful also from recovery all right
any questions in the room well then
Thank You Jonathan okay
