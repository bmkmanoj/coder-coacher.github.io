here today this is actually his second
talk today first one was in Japanese
just want to be in English I would
describe Patrick as an engineer who
learned how to do online marketing out
of necessity and he uses our products so
Adwords and you know search and so on
and I think it's a good opportunity for
us because we can see how someone really
uses our stuff and where it works well
and where maybe we could improve things
a little bit all right so with that I'll
turn it over to Patrick and if we have
time at the end we'll do questions oh hi
think oh everybody my name is Patrick
and Kenzie originaly I came from the
engineering side of this fence can I
just have a show of hands who's an
engineer here is who here's from
marketing or sales and anybody from I
think we get a lot of customer support
folks at the last one anybody from
customer support okay
so yay we get to talk more of an
everybody from engineers here so I used
to be an engineer I was a salaryman at a
big company in nagua if anybody might
have a hobby with cars
you know there's big companies in Agua
it was not that big company but
somewhere in there general like orbit
right and at one point in my career I
felt like I was kind of stagnating as an
engineer it didn't it wasn't really
making any progress in my skill set you
know building Java and apps all day fun
and not did a company that really valued
software and I thought well so if I want
to learn something I have to do
something by myself so I thought okay if
I aren't making career progress at work
then I should run a small business on
the side and maybe that will teach me
something about you know life the
universe and everything become a better
engineer as a result of understanding a
business aspect and around the same time
I was working on a technology incubator
and kefir Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture
is a little bit role doesn't have all
that many people who speak English but
does have a couple of hundred English
like teachers who came from America or
England or whatever teach English at
prefectural school
and they have a self-help mailing list
for things like you know I have a
problem with my landlord or if I don't
know how to teach lesson what should we
do and so since I was working for the
prefecture and often didn't have enough
work they said well babysit the email
list and if someone asks the question
try to answer form and so the question
comes in one day I'm thinking of playing
English bingo with my class tomorrow
and I don't want to spend the next hour
writing bingo cards by hand so is there
a better way to make bingo cards this is
right up my alley
I opened up the hit reply to the email
and I say there's this website WWll you
type in bingo cards into it and hit
enter they'll get a list of like ten
blue links and if you click on that top
top link they'll get something that
makes bingo cards for you
it's send yeah that accomplished
something for the Prefecture today and
they get back an email five minutes
later yeah dummy I tried that but
nothing works and so I checked the list
of search results and indeed nothing
worked for a teacher you have to like
manually make all the cards even with
the specialized bingo card Gration
software that existed so I thought hey
maybe I should make something for this
so I asked my bosses and got there okay
and created like the world's most
terrible Java swing yet this is actually
the better version but you know it was a
swing app that just dropped a directory
full of HTML pages which you had to like
you know select all and explore and hit
ctrl P and then Internet Explorer would
print them all out to your printer and
it would take bingo card creation from
an hour long process to like a five
minute long process so I drop an email
to this list of 200 people and give
pre-factor and say hey guys so there's
this like dot jar file you don't have to
know what a jar file is that's cool just
download it and click it and like do the
stuff and then hit ctrl P you'll get
lots of bingo cards and he won't spend
so much time with the straightedge
trying to make them and so I dropped
that to 200 people go home for the day
come back the next morning I had 60
emails in my inbox and 30 of them said
this is the best thing ever you've saved
my life I love you forever let me buy
you a beer sometime and thirty of them
said this sucks I can't get it to use on
my machine what is Jeff can't use it on
my machine what the heck is Java anyhow
and why do I need
and so when I was thinking that month
what should I do for a business thing
that's out well if 200 people in you are
not passionate about bingo cards that's
something I made in three hours would
get like 60 responses in a day
maybe there's a business in there so I
did what any engineer we do okay I'm
making your business I need a website
and so I made a website in notepad
because I didn't understand any way to
make webpages other than in notepad and
static HTML and threw it up on the
internet like okay now I need to get
people to visit the website how do I do
that
and here's the problem where I'm an
engineer and I have no effing clue about
marketing works so I've been reading a
little on the internet in my often three
days at the technology incubator and
I've heard about this SEO concept search
engine optimization you you do some
magic and the Google's love you this is
just FYI a lot of my customers call your
product the Google's like I was a word
the internet entirely thought Google's
so I was on the Google's earlier today I
found your website on the Google's I
found your email address on the Google's
I found your email sites on the Google's
etc I love talking customers anyhow so I
put it on the Google's and I was
wondering well how do I get people to
come visit it and I had this idea from
reading about SEO that it was wickedly
complicated but the one thing I could
wrap my head around was that if there
was a hole in the internet and you fill
that hole then Google should love you
and so yeah here's my problem as a
business man how do I get people to the
come to the website after I get them in
the website how do I get them to
download trial with my software after
they get the trial to software how we
get them to actually like pay me money
starting with organic SEO is a way to
get them to my website sold a hole in
the internet that sought of if you're an
English teacher you perfectly know the
existence of something called the Dolch
site words they're the first 200
reserved words you need to teach a
beginning reader in English like the
Japanese English class you start with
the sentence this is a penny are you a
boy oh I am a girl and boy pen girl is
these things are like adult site words
for preschool class and teachers know
that there exists in the world this
thing called the dolfe site words that
Edmond
wrote about in a book seventy years ago
they know that there exist five lists
broken down by grade level they don't
know what those words actually are but
they want to teach you many how so they
go to their local Google's they type
indulge sight words and in 2006 when I
was starting my business they got a
bunch of pages that said there exists
something called adult site words yeah
and so I you know what's a library found
a library that had 70 year old books on
English pedagogy flip to the chapter
with lists wrote them up put them on a
web page and I thought well if you're
looking for the jolt sight words you are
almost certainly an English teacher
you were almost certainly trying to
teach him so I'll give you an activity
don't sight words bingo did you want
dollar sight words Fingal and many other
bingo things to download bingo card
creator it actually worked pretty well
so this is the 2010 results so four or
five years after I wrote these two web
pages adults like word lists and don't
like word bingo cards in a notepad and
took two hours they were still getting
like sixteen thousand visits here and
that was literally my marketing for like
the first year just don't sight words
bingo every customer I got was looking
for don't sight words lists or adult
sight words bingo cards so this sounds
pretty easy like I'm an engineer I
understand nothing in marketing I you
know clued in on this pretty quickly why
don't all businesses do this so I do
consulting with American businesses
mostly software companies and like the
no tens of millions of dollars of
revenue a year region they often think
peripherally what I do is SEO stuff it
should be pretty easy we make you know
software that improves the lives of
thousands of people but we just totally
don't get this and why don't they get it
well how do we know what people really
need you know how do we phrase like
what's the difference in the way we see
the value that we're creating the way
our customers see the hole in their life
that gets filled by what we create if
you create you know one of my customers
has bug management software people don't
necessarily go search for a bug
management software they search for
things like you know whatever in the
other cracy they're finding in their
current solution when I say tracking
bugs in a in a CSV file seems to
not scale after certain points that's
there might be search scalable bug stuff
yeah this is especially common with
non-technical customers they don't
search for bingo carry creation software
because they don't know that that exists
or that software will generally exist to
solve problem just describe their
problem bingo cards take too long to
make how do I make bingo cards is there
a bingo card template I can download
question mark and then after you know
that these needs exist how do you create
content that's responsive to them which
is you know counterintuitive for a lot
of engineering focus companies to say at
least after you've invested in
understanding users needs and creating
content that's that's responsive to them
can you measure can you track to see
that you know we spent ten thousand
dollars in this campaign or a hundred
thousand dollars on this content
creation is it going to create two
hundred thousand dollars of sales or not
and if this is going to be a major major
strategic priority for us is this more
important than you know improving the
product or working on other advertising
other marketing things that we could be
doing but yeah sixteen thousand visits
in the first year so people who have
some inclination of you know how
business on the internet works like I
tell teachers I got sixteen thousand
visits adult site words in there like
sixteen thousand big number but you guys
probably know that sixteen thousand is
not a really big number on the internet
and monetization models side sixteen
thousand probably is not going to you
know provide you for enough food to eat
even in ogaki where things are much
cheaper than Tokyo but I thought well
one lesson that you can teach you as
bingo cards is like sixteen thousand
maybe if there were two lessons it would
be like thirty thousand or so if you can
do two lessons why not do a hundred
lessons how can you do a hundred less
ins dot dot
so every way to do content creation in a
scalable manner engineers love
scalability so I broke away from my
let's make all the web pages in notepad
by hand and taught myself Ruby on Rails
just come play with
no little baby's first CMS backing it
this is probably something a Google
intern could grind out in like an hour
it only took me a week and so the CMS
you know automatically creates a how
they use this to teach a lesson on
whatever the lesson for the day is you
know American presidents Prefecture sub
Japan all the numbers in Spanish and so
I got a freelancer to do this for me and
my CMS and made 942 activities like this
and this works out very very well by the
way five years later this is like this
single idea is half of my business
drives almost all of my organic SEO I'm
just creating niche content which in a
way that respects users and that
actually helps them out like fixes one
laser-focused needed them so if you have
a laser focus need for teaching lesson
about the countries of Spanish a sorry
for the countries of Latin America
tomorrow then Latin American bingo cards
you know here it's like here you can
print them out in like five minutes less
really helps them so this sounds pretty
simple why don't people actually do it
well there's these problems like how do
I find hundreds of topics to write on
you know your cup company that cell that
sells like ugh tracking soccer this is
like direct quote from from customer how
much can you actually say about bug
tracking software there's bugs you track
them the end and there's you know ways
around that but there's not ways that
they'll teach you in college around that
and there's not a big book of here's the
ways to do you know variations on a
theme in a way that maintains quality
and doesn't bore you to this I'm sorry
difficult problems for business this is
to actually get their head around
actually creating hundreds of articles
hundreds of you know useful pieces of
pillar content on your website it takes
a whole lot of time at you know most
businesses that trades off with stuff
that the people could actually otherwise
be doing like if you run a hair salon
and you are not actually cut
you know the business is like losing
money right so if you tell someone who
runs a hair salon you should really be
writing articles about every possible
style of haircutting that you can
actually think of then every time they
read in an article about haircutting
that's hair that they aren't actually
cutting that's revenues are not making
so you need to be able to sell to them
yeah this will actually help you and the
level of sophistication they need to
track that it is kind of hard kind of I
you know I'm a programmer I can write
out CMS and a week no problem if you run
a hair salon you might not exactly be
comfortable with scrapping into Ruby on
Rails in a shell and banging out a CMS
and then deploying that to your VPS to
put it mildly
even very engineering focus companies
often have a finite amount of
engineering resources and they've
devoted most of it to the product and
they don't want to spend large amounts
on engineering that would improve their
marketing outcomes without being told
that it's actually going to work and in
terms of process how do you monitor this
scaleable content creation or this SEO
initiative how do you track it down to
okay we spend a hundred thousand dollars
in the school we had two hundred
thousand dollars of sales so yeh and you
know there's ways around this put Google
Analytics on your website you know that
I guess you're like one percent of the
way to a successful solution and even
that very very you know everybody in
here knows that that exists thing is
absolute magic to some people who you
would assume would already know it I've
gone into customers that have you know
tens of millions of dollars of sales
every year consummated through a website
and say what is your existing analytic
solution I say what how many people came
to your website yesterday I don't know
supposing you wanted to know how would
you figure it out well I could probably
like do something let's the Apache log
okay did someone actually do something
with the Apache log and regular basis no
just not on the radar screen for
something that should matter to them who
knows the Aaron Wallis
it's okay SEO in America is kind of big
in the education about SEO space the
number one challenge with SEO is that
it's getting so complicated there's so
many moving parts to the puzzle they
have to understand the engineering
aspect of the marketing aspects the PR
aspect you have to understand what a
link what a link is how to get it which
links count how to find keywords how to
write content that you can study this
for years and not be an expert at it
and so it's getting to the point where
it's self-directed study for years can
make you and make you a pretty decent
SEO but if you were you know feeling a
hair salon or restaurant or a software
company that does 20 million dollars of
revenue it might not be possible to get
to that point of expertise by yourself
this is a problem that repeatedly fights
people in the hindquarters and then they
need to to hire out for expertise and
then they get into the SEO is a market
for lemons kind of dilemma where if you
don't know enough about SEO to implement
implement it for yourself how do you
determine that some outside provider is
going to be good and effective use of
your money versus you know some scam
artist who is going to spam up the
internet and get your site block and
Google my customers routinely say things
like this we are spending a hundred
thousand dollars a month on Google
Adwords but we can't find the money to
budget for SEO which always is a it
confuses me but it's a it's a real thing
in larger organizations when they have
no turf wars between various departments
and someone already has their pile of
money but there's no additional pile of
money that can be found they don't have
the time or the budget or the expertise
to start working on it the baseline
level of competence that you have to
have for working on SEO is gigantic we
need to you know the word CMS can't
scare you you have to understand things
about metrics and analytics and tracking
things on the internet you have to have
a good mental model of all funnels work
actually talking about later
there's hundreds of little individual
like
micro subjects with an SEO that you
could talk about you know which links
matter how does it interplay with the
social strategy how do you do PR in such
way that you get SEO benefits out of it
and it's very difficult to start from
like square one
where do you start what's the one thing
if you if your business had previously
zero investment in SEO SEO what's the
first thing you could do that would
provide some quantum of value to the
business I have good answers for that
but there's well I hope I have good
answers there's many of my clients who
if they you know they had a hundred
thousand dollars to spend on SEO today
would have no clue what the first thing
to do is and many of them would not have
a good answer you know who to pay to
find that out and it's hard to draw a
straight line causality between a
particular investment in SEO and a
particular business outcome which makes
the case for investing in it very
difficult for many businesses a
speculative investment is kind of
difficult especially in this economy
okay so I said half of my revenue comes
from Google at I was sorry from organic
SEO the other half comes from Google
Adwords
thanks guys I'm a big fan qualified and
we'll get to the qualifications later I
wrote this on my blog a couple years ago
it's been like 20 plus people have asked
me for permission to reprint it in a
journal article or a book or a blog post
or something AdWords is a very difficult
product to use yes
can I just have a show of hands who here
has used AdWords like you've pushed a
button in the interface at some point or
another okay most people who here is
used to AdWords to accomplish a business
result that mattered to them okay so
Jewish as anyone ever liked the success
of your AdWords campaign determines
whether you eat nobody so have like I
quit my day job at the point where my
business revenues were just about
approximating my sorry profits were just
about approximating my salary and if
half of my revenues come from AdWords
like a emergency in my AdWords account
is literally up there with I lose my
rent check
in terms of you know like impact to me I
know some companies in America are so
dependent on their AdWords that you know
a twenty eight twenty percent blip and
our AdWords performance means somebody
has to get laid off because we won't
have the money to make payroll really
big issue and well a it's important that
you guys has to the folks who are on the
AdWords product and engineering teams
understand that and that you know
something that in the scale of the big
buy or scales you know a problem with
0.01% of accounts no it's bad but it's
not like p0 or whatever the drop
everything get it fixed is but the
smallest possible problem in it problem
in AdWords applied to someone account
someone's account could mean that you
know some family has to apply for
unemployment I would always keep that
one in mind but I'm speaking about it
yeah so getting away from the jokes
about how difficult is here's what you
actually need to do to have successful
AdWords need to identify your keywords
list them up having bed of a bidding
strategy about them need to crap a craft
tech stance which is a technical like
text ads or this thing that no one will
teach you how to do there's no class in
university you can take them how to
write an effective text ad 101 it's
absolutely different from any other form
of copywriting or marketing and there's
huge differences in performance between
text ads that look very very similar to
each other you have to kind of figure
that out and muddle through it you need
to send people to landing pages many
people don't understand that landing
pages are really important I didn't for
my first three years Suzanne first
there's customers who spend like
hundreds of thousands of dollars a month
AdWords who all the landing pages has a
corporate homepage ask why is that well
what's a better way to set up you know
you set them up you know - landing pages
which are specific to each ad you put on
that are very specific to a particular
user needed you you know folks that by
doing focused ad groups and that way you
have a sense between the whole
interaction and it's just like okay so
when I started doing that I
I'm paying you know paying 1/3 as much
for ads and twice as much revenue out of
it they're like oh that sounds good but
you know you can spend millions of
dollars on Adwords and not have anyone
fully decide and say hey the way the
world works is you really need that
landing pages iterate on them here's
another way the world works things like
many people will dump people directly
into you know you were searching for bug
software we have it why'd you guys today
which is not the world's most effective
way to make a sale particularly for
things that require a bit of thought so
most of the effective adamance
advertisers I know the first step that
they try to get from you is permission
to contact you in the future like get
your email address and in return for a
you know three page white paper which we
wrote about this subject look at your
email address we'll deliver you the link
and you'll sign up for our weekly
mailing list and then you know three
days later we'll say hey you were
looking for a white paper about a few
days ago we have this Quick Start Guide
to the field of black created by our by
our industry expert well you take a look
at it and then you know a week after
that hey remember that blah you were
looking at last week we'd love to set
you up with a free trial account if you
have any questions you can call a
customer support staff or you can click
right here do a self service free trial
and then over the weeks you gradually
build up their trust in you as a trusted
provider of information about blah and
then you start asking for sale or asking
for you know kind of higher touch
conversions like can we talk to you know
can we actually put our sales rep on the
phone with that one of your
decision-makers to talk about your needs
for this then after you get after you
get permission to contact someone and
start that drift marketing that's what
it's called you have to actually convert
them into a paying customer and even
after you figured out how to do all
these things you have to iterate like
crazy because often your AdWords you
know won't start profitable even if you
get everything in place for it to
theoretically be profitable I spent a
year trying to crack the code figure out
a way to spend one dollar and get at
least one dollar in marginal revenue as
a result of that spend and you have to
keep doing
this as a process because your
competitors will keep doing a test
process and if you don't continually
monitor and improve then an AdWords
strategy that was you know productive
and profitable a year and a half ago may
no longer be profitable and you might
not even notice happening some of my
customers not a happy thing when someone
said what happened to the last six
hundred thousand dollars of AdWords we
spent though it brought in three hundred
thousand dollars of sales so here's my
like personal AdWords history I started
back in 2006 spending about a dollar a
day with the gold not to make money but
just not to lose so much and to try to
figure out you know how it is this how
does this system actually work I very
quickly turned off the cats and Network
because I had a feeling after reading
about it as a captain network was a hive
of scum and villainy and that was just
made for AdWords cents I made for
Adsense websites and a bunch of spam and
a friend of mine who was in a related
language learning field said the AdWords
content network is a hive of scum
ability
but that's only like 80% of it the other
20% is told of gold you should be
focusing your attention on that 20% and
I said from anyone else that would sound
like total BS but I trust you personally
so I will try this and I spent summer of
2007 I would get up every day and check
my AdWords placement report for what
websites did I put ants on nice day and
I would play whack-a-mole with like site
exclusion
I never want to place wet ads on this
spam site again death data I did for 20
minutes every day and you know a
terrible use of my time then conversion
optimizer came out and so raise your
hand if you know what conversion
optimizer is okay so conversion
optimizer is this magic algorithmic
pixie-dust that you can like sprinkle on
your AdWords account and rather than you
controlling at vids on a per keyword or
website level just a default AdWords
setting it will automatically bias your
bids up for keywords or websites that
send you traffic that converts and
automatically bio shared bids down for
everything else so if you get you know
your and placed on a valueless spam site
that doesn't send traffic
converts conversion optimizer will find
within a few clicks that people don't
convert when they come from that website
it will bash your bid to something close
to zero and you'll never be seen on that
site again if on the other hand like one
of your competitors puts ads on their
website happens to me all the time
someone who is in the process of using a
bingo card creation software is a really
good prospect for bingo card creation
software so ads on competitors websites
tend to work very very well for me so it
gradually biases my bids up on those
sites so I get a larger portion of their
inventory this revolutionized my both my
use of AdWords and my business my spend
went up by a factor of two in my sales
went up by like a factor of four and
within like a couple of weeks of content
optimizer being launched like if you
googled a sorry conversion optimizer and
if you googled google conversion
optimizer like results one and two or
google.com the result number three was
my blog saying it was the best thing
since sliced bread and then I got
contacted by the Google head office and
said hey well do you write a you know a
white paper on this and that contact is
actually a phone call I get a phone call
in the middle of the night in Japan
excuse me can you put me on with a CEO
one moment please
that made me very very happy anyhow so
made money I had some problems with
Google AdWords I'll talk about them
later in a bit of depth it's not a
healthy product what you're having
problems problems get fixed eventually
made more money so at the moment pretty
happy so Google AdWords is kind of hard
to understand if you're not like
building it every day so what do you
need to do to succeed in Google AdWords
well you need to write ads that have a
high so yes optimize for your CPC get
your seat you get your CPA less than the
LTV of the customer and boom you're
golden this is like Greek to most of the
people who actually have to use the
product on day to day basis and so one
of the things that might be wonderful
for development is creating things like
say conversion optimizer
conversion optimizer you have to start
looking at your like per site or per
keyword can
version rates without conversion
optimizer with conversion optimizer that
task is no longer on your to-do list you
don't even have to know that what exists
so it makes the product transformative
lazier to use any feature that you could
reduce in it that you could like add to
AdWords that took one or more of these
crazy acronyms and took it off the list
of things that the customer had to use
is a huge win for you so here's a
typical day in the life of the English
teacher and she goes to Google the
googles they're a funny side note there
are the blue googles and the green
googles they are physically distinct
from each other it's a blue Google's is
the one at work the green Google's is
the one at school it at home I think one
of them is MSN and one of them is
actually you but interrogating customers
mental models of the world takes a lot
of time anyhow so she might be at the
green Google's one day and type in how
to make bingo cards and then she gets
sent to a Content site like see how
further how to make bingo cards article
and then somewhere way down the page
which is assisting with his ads there's
one little ad for being a very creator
this little ad on this one page cost me
like two hundred dollars last year and
brought in like four hundred or five
hundred dollars of sales or something so
they click on that they come to a
landing page since I'm kind of
engineering this landing page is a
little more sophisticated than most on
the Internet in that it tries to make a
guess of what would be the most useful
content I have on my website and then
dynamically creates a landing page based
on that so right now if you were to
click on it and it didn't know anything
else about you from know you're
referring website it would assume that
you're probably doing it back to school
a new activity so there would be a bad
school and there's an a/b test going at
the moment so you can't see it but
usually ask for permission to you know
send your email about your back to
school bingo cards and here's the magic
AdWords math that you have to be you
have to really understand your bones to
make it work for you I pay 8 cents per
click
20% of the people
convert to the free trial when they see
that landing page the other 72% balance
and I never get to talk to them again
until because kind of mad okay so my
cost for acquisition for a free trial of
software is 29 cents 1.1 percent of free
trials will convert into a purchased
version the fabric means that this is
for this August so that means I pets
page pay $26 for a sale of a product
that gets made $28 for gross revenue
which means I'm like happy but only like
a little but that's kind of because
seasonality of teaching supplies is not
so great in summer months typically it's
more like I pay you guys $15 for a $30
sale which I'm happy and be happier for
job is like paying you like a buck 50
for a $30 sale but you know I'm not
quitting my Edwards campaign anytime
soon on it one of the key things to
notice which we'll talk about we get two
funnels is that this is sort of
multiplicative looked beautiful e
effective and that these steps are not
like there's often no causational
relationship between them from 20% to
28% it kind of increases my bottom line
straight by 40% that's a little hand
baby but it's broadly effective and
broadly accurate and so you go to
companies and say hey you know if you if
you're 20 million dollar company would
just spend a couple hours redoing your
landing pages and make it 40 percent
more effective but I say I don't know
dropping this garish logo here you could
potentially increase your bottom line
but a couple million dollars they're
like obs and then you have to kind of
sell them on this whole notion of you
know we can make a testing company in
your testing culture and your company
too and you will have actual stats that
back this up I will talk about that
later so why is this hard for people
well so particularly for small
businesses um if you run a restaurant or
a massage therapy practice or a you know
SAT coaching or a Kiowa Dooku in Japan
this might be a level of mathematics
a little higher than you're used to
which is kind of sad but very true so
you know like what's the difference
between the 20 between a 20 percent
conversion rate and 28 percent
conversion rate and a lot of people are
going to in like their mental model of
how the world works is that's like your
sales go up by 8% no no it's like sales
go up by 40% it's a very important
difference and I hate to say that you
know it's Google's responsibility to
raise the world's understanding of like
sixth grade mathematics but if you were
able to it would make you billion
salaries so other hard stuff you need to
have a clear understanding of what it
funnel is we're going to talk about that
in a little you need to be able to draw
on a causation line between I spent
money on AdWords and I got sales this is
actually kind of difficult I'll tell you
about one reason why in a minute and you
need to be able to track average call to
customer lifetime value well this is a
hard concept for a lot of people so I
got like some weird hobbies one of them
is just talking to businesses that I do
business with them just asking them
about you know I'm interested in
business in general well you tell me
about the business of running a sushi
shop so ask my sushi chef guy run sushi
shop hey um I think if you're like great
customers how much sushi do you saw them
in a year it's like well you're a good
customer you come in like once a week
and you order the same thing every time
and it cost 1,200 yen so I sell you
don't know and there's a lot of
companies including some very companies
you would assume to be sophisticated
like sell enterprise software who
couldn't tell you if you went up to
their CEO or head of marketing today
what is that like if you get someone as
someone signed up for your SAS what is
the lifetime value of that customer
don't know it's more than 300 bucks it's
probably less than 30,000 mmm well if
it's like $300 you can't afford to spend
$5,000 on customer acquisition but if
it's $25,000 then we should be spending
that like we should go to Bank of
America right now and bar
all the money we can and spend $5,000 to
acquire a customer attributing sales
hard who here has heard of the
distinction between last-click tricking
last click tracking the other loon I
don't do anchors and first click
tracking this is somewhere very deep
deep in the recesses of the Google
Analytics and Google AdWords
documentation they'll explain you the
difference between these two things
and it's kind of key if someone searches
for like you know back-to-school bingo
and it comes to my site via the organic
search results and signs up for a free
trial and it's happily using it every
day for two weeks and because like all
non-technical customers they understand
the relationship to the Internet is I
start on the Google's I type in what I
want I get there when they're coming
back to bingo card creator they type in
bingo card creator into their googles
and they come to this page and you can't
see these subtle pink highlighting here
but there's all pink highlighting on
this first result which is when people
generally who here knows what the subtle
pink highlighting on our search result
page means I just have a show of hands
okay so we actually have hands here if
you ask a thousand English teachers I
guarantee you that not one will be able
to tell you the business but about
thirty percent of the people who like
click on a result for a search result or
bingo card creator and click on an
AdWords ad already have an account down
the system for me and AD reduces what's
called last click tracking and last
click attribution which means that when
I look at my Google AdWords report if
someone has been already been converted
by like an organic search campaign that
they later come and click on an AdWords
ad anyhow and that's their last one
prior to purchasing software AdWords
will say yeah that's a win for Adwords
whereas business-wise for me that isn't
like I can't make then I can't count
that as a win for AdWords because I
can't scale that spending more spending
more money on that channel who's not
actually result in more sales for me
it's just kind of a pure cost that I
leaked to you guys by you know bidding
on my own brand name here the reason I
did on my own brand name is have a short
hate for a competitor groupie right here
so like you know just like AdWords
reports
before sales and if you go back first
click tracking just the first time
someone you're just about bingo card
creator prying to created and count and
no had to do a homegroup programming for
this that was only sixteen it's still
profitable at sixteen but I've been at
customers where you know you tell them a
this distinction exists and then break
out the numbers for them it's like you
thought you were getting a twenty
percent profit margin on your AdWords
campaign but surprise it's actually
negative fifteen
that is not like what I give someone
results like that do you think their
AdWords spend goes up the next month or
down the next month yeah they're not
happy so you're not happy thank you
so I'm gonna ask ahead a little bit to
try to get more presentation in this
time sometimes Edward has like problems
like all software and then traditionally
this is changing recently traditionally
when AdWords has a has a problem you
like end up in a casket
ESCA nightmare and I say that it's like
one of your biggest fans but two years
ago AdWords just suddenly turned off for
me my ads didn't show and I do the you
know automated online diagnostic and
they say you don't have a credit card to
test your account check the building
stuff no really do you build me twice
this week you build $20,000 on the same
card nothing has changed about the card
called the bank bank the bank has
processed the payments as usual so went
to the I click through we at the time
like seven layers of indirection to get
to the actual talk to a person form and
sent in something and got a response for
three days this isn't the peak season
for me and you know AdWords not
functioning equals I do not eat so I get
a little more agitated and I send in
another thing to the same response
forearm and it gets doubled again and
then I go to the escalated AdWords
support which is because I'm and I say
that's very much tell me cheek
internet-famous I can post a blog post
and make things kind of awkward and so
somebody who knows somebody you know put
put a bug in the air the right person in
Mountain View and they fix things up and
still nobody ever talked to me about it
but
if you don't have that support channel
you're some you know law firm in Buffalo
Grove Illinois who is dependent on you
know dependent on AdWords for customer
acquisition your total emergency mode
and there's no one to talk to you
recently there's I hear there's a phone
support for everyone I don't I haven't
like how the opportunity to use it
myself but and I know why Google does
this like sort of organizational DNA is
that for a nice scalable algorithmic
solutions as opposed to having you know
tens of thousands of people who are
standing by waiting for phone calls
strike a balance such that Google can
provide awesome customer fukrey support
in the parameters of the Google DNA
would be a big win for you guys and a
big wooden for many of your customers
particularly there's customers and I
talked to why aren't you were using
Google AdWords they're like dude it's
like the people PayPal fired for not
having good enough customer contact they
decided to you know make it big
advertising company does anyone here
familiar with PayPal is reputation for
customer service you're getting compared
this favorably to PayPal and that's a
failure mode okay so after I got someone
in the trial hug well on the website how
do I convince them to and oh hi oh we're
doing catalyst yeah so who's your heard
of funnels before I sands yay
so funnels is basically like you get
someone at the lowest possible level of
interaction with you low touch they came
to your website and then they gradually
increase in their business relationship
with you like maybe okay we came to the
website all right maybe we downloaded
trial and maybe after downloading the
trial we decided to you know pay you
money you should step of those is fun
well people fall out in the funnel
so funnel analytics is you just grab the
file say alright there's like 10,000
people who start the landing page not
them 28 that so 2600 you so I actually
if you into the free travel and these
steps
and so you can after you have these
numbers you can start making changes to
the business like I notice that only
actually go to the first page what can I
do to increase that 10% to 15% which may
be a good improvement in my so this
sounds pretty easy why is it hard well
not great options for software this
screenshot is from KISSmetrics
I paid KISSmetrics like 100 bucks I'm up
for it basically just so that the
screenshot could exist and I love it
because it takes data from a bunch of
places that I used to have and it's all
an easy-to-understand form for me google
analytics s support for funnels anyone
here use Google Analytics support for
funnels does anyone here like really
really happy with that product so not
too much time in the next ten minutes
but if you were like really happy with
that product I would love to talk to you
to hear why I'm sorry I don't mean to in
hash on it but well I do mean hash on it
so many customers have like a more
complex business model than just selling
bingo cards to elementary school
teachers over the internet they might
have you know data coming in like people
talking to sales guys a sales cycle last
12 months gets consummated with a
purchase order that gets entered into a
billing system which is totally separate
from all the web analytics stuff you
have to tie this together actually have
a comprehensive view of the funnel and
that's very difficult typically requires
customer program I work in very few
companies are at that level yet this
metric just trying to bring that here
from customers okay so hypothetically
assuming we get this graph funnel what
do we do next and that's an excellent
question if you're if you haven't done
this before you know if you knew nothing
about bingo cards just looking at this
graph would you see something that
obviously looks wrong about it or an
obvious first step for improvement and
you know after you've done this for a
while you start to get
idea for what the low-hanging fruit is
but there's no you know list on the
internet here's low-hanging fruit you
could try on your phone so one thing you
can do after you have funnels is to ad
test various things in your safe to get
against each other like if you have a
landing page or a front page that
attempts to get people into a you could
you know test buttons against each other
hey these and half the people to ace and
half the people to be see which one has
a higher percentage of people actually
come through and performs to school
confidence testing on that yeah it's
very easy to say and almost easy to
implement a you know wrote up a library
for myself with us in a week you don't
have to just do design like that though
you can test in application workflows
like hypothetically supposing that there
was an internal debate and the AdWords
interface if it was organized like this
would be if you use you could
hypothetically put half of the accounts
in like workflow a half then workflow B
and see which one succeeded more you can
test benefits propositions just catch
copy test authors you know 29.95 but
24.95 for only the next three days and
if you have business priorities that are
competing against each other like maybe
asking for an email address it has value
to us but it might decrease the response
to people for downloading free trial you
can use this as a technique to say that
okay how much do they really step on
each other's toes why is it hard
you'd be testing designed for engineers
but it has to get implemented by
marketing here's my customers they
always complain about it they don't know
what to test like do we start with
buttons do we start with headlines do we
start with in application workflow is
what the heck don't have testing in the
DNA like Google's from what I hear from
the outside you guys internally do lots
of testing and I think so I'm like you
know shades of the color blue is a
possible area for testing in Google but
other companies like might have say a
product oriented culture
where
attesting the marketing site is just not
something that occurs to us as a core
competence we've published this so you
know I worked with a Joel Spolsky
company fog Creek they like you know
have a team of 30 engineers which did
one website update update like you know
one website update a year went to the
website needed it or not for like five
years running and there was nobody whose
job it was to actually you know check to
see if the website was producing
business results why well you know our
engineers are busy like doing the stuff
that matters but isn't you know getting
your software into the hands of more
people stuff that matters for you and
helps them that helps you like oh yeah
we might we might spent that so part of
your challenge for AdWords is not just
to evangelize use of AdWords as the
product but evangelize the internal
Google you know test and measure and
iterate culture as something that
businesses should be adopting more
broadly so one thing that often happens
in companies our particular size is that
there's the marketing department that
actually wants to run this added stuff
because they understand what it means
and there's the engineering department
or the web department that actually has
to make it happen and if the engineering
department it's like okay we could
either do an a/b test of button capping
snow or we could do fun engineering
stuff they always picked fun engineering
stuff and when marketing says change
requests we need you to make two
versions of this button they find ways
to say no and customers repeatedly have
this like our own organization is
fighting us for this so it's awesome if
you can create a self-help tool for the
engine for the marketing department that
would let them work without much
engineering help you have one takeaway
from this presentation like Google for a
visual website optimizer take a look at
their site it gives you a WYSIWYG
interface so that even the marketing
droids can you know change the stuff on
the website without having to talk to
the technical people at all or interface
with the CMS or all these other scary
things that they can't get resources to
do you could like you know
them it's it's company in India like 100
million dollars will buy that company by
them seriously it's amazing and if you
compare the experience of using it as a
non-technical person ways to say Google
Website optimizer which is your guy's a
PE / multivariate testing product and
they are head and tails better from the
perspective of like the marketing
manager at an insurance company in
Kansas there's cultural reasons why
testing would be difficult if your so
here's a crisis and a anecdote from
Apple one of my friends went to Apple
and said hey what kind of a bee testing
area do you do and they said we don't do
a/b testing we do SJ testing the website
is what Steve Jobs says should be on the
damn website so they haven't had much
uptake on this there's many other
companies where like the highest paid
person's opinion or the you know the
website is the fiefdom of the marketing
group and nothing will ever appear that
does not flatter the interest of the
marketing group even if it's more
effective for the business so you kind
of have to you know make a cultural
change that these other companies to say
listen you don't have to totally turn
into like little mini engineers but
numbers are wonderful things that you
can use to make your lives easier and
better series just unlike miscellaneous
things I would love to see from Google
so this email marketing we were talking
briefly about before is so important for
most customers and yet there's no Google
product that does it I use MailChimp
MailChimp is wonderful but you guys
could offer a much more compelling user
experience by tightly integrating that
with analytics and or tightly
integrating it with Adwords because
almost all savvy AdWords advertisers are
sending people to a landing page where
you collect their email address so that
you can send them email so you could
tightly integrate with that and
practically giveaway the mail for free
to sell hundreds of thousands of dollars
of ads on it
so I am traditionally skeptical of
Facebook and Twitter as marketing things
I think the ROI on them is nowhere near
the term the ROI and SEO or Adwords but
people keep telling me that we're doing
it and it works for us and I ask why and
here's a priceless little anecdote from
ogaki not a town known for technical
staff
there's this mall and in the mall
there's a monitor about making their
aggregate tweets from the mall merchants
and so if you're the haircutter II at
the mall and there's no one actually
like in getting your hair cut they pull
out your cell phone and you type in a
tweet at mall if you're the next person
that comes for a haircut ten percent off
and so people come in and this is a good
experience for both the customer and the
advertiser the advertiser has something
they understand how to do they send an
SMS message on their phone like they do
a hundred times Danielle and then they
get instant results a customer walks in
the door and says I saw that tweet and I
want that service you have just done
your job in a way that works whereas
AdWords like okay you can study this for
a year and then test for a year and then
at some point several years from now you
will have business results that may or
may not be leaked or correlated to the
effort you put into it
so focus on that ease of use and focus
on the emotional component if using the
software that says listen you did a good
job your business is succeeding as a
result of using art product thumbs up
for you and also you know the level of
sophistication that Google takes for
granted about stats and tracking and
what app if the world was on that level
of sophistication the world would be a
better place so just like you know the
manufacturing industry has been so
improved by say that the Toyota method
and broadcasting have throughout the
industry the the world of your customers
and your bottom line would be much
better if you radically evangelized like
the use of stats and what that in their
businesses as well so invested in
education both education about actually
pushing these books I mean or its
interface and in making businesses
better okay we have some time for
questions nope there's my contact
details feel free to talk to me about
the stuff at any time this is like both
the job and a happy for me I love
talking about it so talk to me anytime
thanks very much for listening
