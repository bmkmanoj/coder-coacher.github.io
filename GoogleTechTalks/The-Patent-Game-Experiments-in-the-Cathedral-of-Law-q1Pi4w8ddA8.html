invitation to speak about some of my
research here at Google I'm gonna talk
about patent law and innovation and a
number of issues that have arisen in my
research that combined the two and
disentangled the two and explore the
connection between the two which might
seem obvious to people in the audience
to begin with and it seemed obvious to
me when I started the research but I
think there's some interesting
complications between patents and
innovation I'm a professor at the
University of Kansas School in law my
background is as a biologist I have a
PhD from Harvard and genetics and then I
sold my soul and became a lawyer and a
patent lawyer even and then gradually
migrated back into academia so the title
of my talk is the patent game
experimenting in the cathedral of law
and I hope that in a little bit you'll
see why I chose that title despite the
fact the title sort of a quizzical title
and by the way the Cathedral in question
is the cathedral at who all that money
spent about six months painting in a
variety of different lighting conditions
atmospheric conditions weather
conditions and came up with a variety of
views of the cathedral and I'm going to
try and link the view of a single object
from multiple perspectives to my
research in patents and innovation so
what I'm going to talk about today is a
collaboration with Professor bill
Tomlinson who is at the University of
California Irvine
he runs the social code group there and
he's by far the smarter of the two of us
I came up with an idea about trying to
test empirical questions of the patent
system and he made it possible and so
any good stuff that comes out of this
talk is certainly bills and any mistakes
are certainly mine I also want to
acknowledge two other folks that helped
very much Bryant Davies who was a
graduate student at UC Irvine he helped
to code the first version of what came
to be known as the patent game and the
Nitin Shan theorem spent much of this
summer working on a recode of the system
that I think improved it in a number of
ways this project has become known to
bill and me as patents and innovation or
the patents and innovation project and
its project that we've been doing for
three years and it's something that we
expect to be doing for a number of
additional years we are very interested
in something that seems banal and seems
obvious to some people at least which is
the connection between patents and
innovation or the spurring of innovation
and the more that we've explored this
topic the more that we've realized the
subject is complicated convoluted and
quite non-obvious to borrow a clumsy
term from patent law we've used an
experimental system which we originally
called
patent sim or simp at ins but it didn't
stick like a lot of original titles it
didn't stick everybody including the
user started calling it the patent game
so now we've given in to democracy and
we call it the patent game but it's a
simulation of the patent system using
computers that plays like a game and
I'll speak more about that in a few
minutes we've tested a number of
hypotheses so far using this
experimental system and the two
hypotheses that I want to explore with
you today are one that patents spur
innovation it's a common claim it's an
historic claim it's a claim that most
people that make it never question but
we thought we would actually look into
this claim and try and probe it in a way
that hadn't been done before and more
recently we have looked into a variation
of this question and that question is
whether property rights in a patent
system outperform liability rights in a
patent system and without belaboring
that point and I'll explain it in more
detail later property rights in a patent
system would be receiving an injunction
if there was an instance of infringement
an injunction forbidding future
infringement that's a property rule
a property right versus a liability
right or a liability rule which would be
if someone infringes a patents they
might damage us but there's no comment
as the future infringement infringement
might go on as long as the price is paid
for the infringement that's done they're
very different kinds of of rules in the
law and we've recently had an
opportunity to do some empirical testing
of how patent systems perform under
these different legal regimes property
rules versus liability rules in both
cases at least we were surprised it may
be that folks here in particular will
not be surprised at what we found
but it's spurred us on to explore
additional questions and additional
permutations of our research because we
think that trying to find a linkage and
trying to establish a linkage between
patents and other intellectual property
rights and technological innovation
which is something that probably has
huge social utility to society
innovation at least is an important
question to ask an important finding to
try to establish I'm gonna present the
empirical results that we think shed a
little bit of light at least within our
limited system on these hypotheses and
then I'm gonna talk a little bit about
future research directions that we
intend to go in this by the way is James
Watts steam engine or one of the the
various steam mentions that he along
with a variety of other people invented
in a burst of technological creativity
in England and particularly Scotland a
couple hundred years ago so the United
States Constitution happens to consider
patents so important that they put them
right in to the Constitution now most
interests in this country are not in the
Constitution and so it becomes harder to
enforce your legal rights if you don't
have a constitutional peg but patents
are right in there so are copyrights in
fact and the language that the founding
fathers put into the Constitution go as
follows the Congress shall have power to
promote the progress of useful arts by
securing for
at times to inventors the exclusive
right to their discovers now I've
removed the language for copyright in
part because it was extraneous to this
study and also in part because 200 years
ago the language was a reverse of what
you might expect because useful art
sounds like something you might
copyright but 200 years ago useful arts
was actually technological innovation
and science 200 years ago which refers
to copyright was actually writings 200
years ago and I think in the minds of
most people these are reversed in the
ensuing years so we have a very strong
authorizing clause in the Constitution
that say we can have a patent system now
over the years Congress has elaborated
this right by coming up with various
versions of the patent law
the most recent large innovation in
patent law was 1952 that's the version
of the Patent Act that we currently live
with with certain modifications that
have occurred since then now there's a
traditional claim that is often made
that without the prospect of patent
protection inefficiently few innovations
would result and I've put as an
illustration of this a tragedy of the
Commons involving goats that have over
grazed a piece of land now this is
something that I think is passed into
the culture as almost received wisdom
that without management a common
resource will become depleted and
certainly there is evidence that for
certain resources this phenomenon does
occur but this is a claim that has been
extended beyond the physical world to
the world of intellectual property and
many have claimed and many have claimed
with some reason that if one is not able
to protect ones new idea other people
might exploit that idea and expropriate
the idea thus create a negative
incentive for anyone in the future to
come up with an idea and share with
others because without protection they
won't be able to benefit from it any
more than their nearest neighbor who
grabs the idea
doesn't have to come up with it in the
first place but is able to do the idea
practice it carry it out and maybe at a
lower cost than the originator of the
idea now this project actually
originated for me in the search for a
footnote I was writing a paper and I
wanted to drop a footnote in the paper
that stood for the at the time quite
obvious statements that patents promote
technological innovation and so I sent
this project down to my research
assistants and they kept emailing back
saying they couldn't find anything that
would make an appropriate footnote now I
put this down two rookie mistakes I
thought they're just not looking in the
right places so eventually I got
frustrated and looked for it myself
all I was looking for was some
authoritative source in the literature
that said that technological innovation
is spurred by patent protection I
couldn't find it either and I thought
that was the strangest thing that had
happened to me in academia up to that
point but what I did find among other
things was a study done by the National
Academies which was published in 2003
which was a definitive and fairly
exhaustive look at the literature going
back hundreds of years trying to find
connections between patent protection
and innovation and I won't share the
entire report it's quite voluminous with
you but I will share a couple of
statements that I thought really were
attention-grabbing
one is the literature on the impact of
patents on innovation must be considered
emergent that's obviously a nice
euphemism that's you know that's in
there not to hurt feelings
emergent sounds kind of nice but what it
really means is people haven't done this
yet they haven't made the connection at
least according to the folks that combed
through the literature so emergent
sounded to me like a little bit of a
challenge I thought maybe I can help to
contribute to this debate and in fact at
the time having recently been a patent
attorney both in a firm and inside a
company I thought well obviously patents
Duisburg technological innovation I know
it
I mean I practiced it people paid me to
do it so I'll try and come up with some
way that I can supply a footnote for
people in the future so this is
essentially the origin of our
experimental approach
I looked into other methods many of them
were beyond my abilities involving
tremendous economic analysis and I'm not
an economist but with my colleague bill
Tomlinson I thought we could maybe take
an experimental approach and I was
fairly confident that I knew what the
answer would be now the report also says
the effect of patent policy has many
dimensions some fundamental to
understanding the determinants of
innovation generally and these continue
to challenge scholars both theoretically
and empirically so again a little bit
euphemistic it's essentially asking
people to find some evidence because
they couldn't so we decided to take up
the challenge we decided to use an
approach which is the simulation game
there are a number of advantages of
simulation games a number of reasons why
simulation games are increasingly used
to study phenomena in the real world
this by the way on the right hand side
is a climate model the climate
simulation not a game but a simulation
so see game simulations are often
considered to be useful within the field
because first of all they enable
rigorous manipulation of experimental
conditions you can control the
experimental conditions by controlling
the code that the computer users
interact with it also integrates human
interaction with real-time computational
processes and it allows for very precise
data collection some advantages of
interactive simulations are that they're
dynamic they use human behavior to model
human behavior which is actually a very
powerful aspect of interactive
simulations in a lot of cases computers
are used to model human behavior and
it's a very powerful approach but what
this approach
does is it tries to harness the
complexity of humans feed it through the
bottleneck of code and then reveal
additional aspects of human behavior
based on how humans interact with the
system obviously it's fraught with
complexities and potential for error but
it's seen in the field of simulations as
an advantageous approach to try and
harness humans to study humans it
generates a tremendous amount of data we
record every keystroke in our database
and we've barely touched the surface of
the data that we've gathered so far you
can use existing data to set parameters
so you can look into the real world and
try and estimate what your system should
try and simulate and then set the
parameters to reflect that and then you
can change those parameters and you can
run human subjects on different sets of
parameters you can compare results based
on alternative sets of parameters and
you can directly test alternative
hypotheses which is what we wanted to do
first of all we wanted to test the
hypothesis that patents spur
technological innovation at least in our
system interactive games a kind of
interactive simulation also have some
advantages that also come with
challenges so one of the challenges in
coming up with a good interactive game
at least I've seen from within the field
is you have to make the game compelling
and fun and the way that that's measured
however unscientific is if it is
compelling and fun then the users might
forget that they're actually playing a
game or they might mostly concentrate on
what they're supposed to be doing in the
game rather than thinking the whole time
oh I'm just playing a simulation game so
one of the tests that we had for the
success of our system was trying to
figure out whether users found it
compelling and found it fun and
fortunately those two criteria I think
were satisfied folks seem to really
enjoy playing our game and they seemed
to get engrossed in it we have
it's a fist pumping lots of in-your-face
yelling at the ends of games too much
excitement and talking in general so we
were constantly trying to tamp down he
the noise and the movement within the
test rooms and I even received phone
calls sometimes in the evening from
players that were getting together with
a bunch of friends that night and they
thought that it would be fun to play the
game now obviously that would have
interfered with the integrity of our
data gathering so I generally turned
those requests down but the strong
impression that we got was that people
liked playing the game and that they
really got engrossed in it they really
wanted to win it and to a certain degree
they stopped thinking of it as an
interaction and really became a part of
it um one of the nice things about
interactive games is that you don't
really need to explain to people what
the purpose is in fact we didn't explain
we didn't say for example what we would
like you to do is prove that patents
spur technological innovation
go ahead instead we simply explained how
the system worked and we defined a goal
for the players the goal was often to
make more money than any other player we
had a variety of ways of encouraging
that rather than tell them what the
purpose of the experiment was so having
explained the rules and having allowed
the subjects to become comfortable with
the system we could set them loose and
we might know what the results could be
either to falsify or to satisfy the
hypothesis but the players didn't need
to know that they simply needed to know
how to invent things for example how to
license how to assign how to litigate
etc and I'll show you in a moment how
that works
um it's easy to generate sufficient
sample sizes with this approach and it's
in the law at least an untapped data
source which was very attractive to us
this is not something that the law does
in general it's something that social
sciences don't do that much although
economics has used this approach for
years and I think it's becoming an
increasingly favorite approach and
so a couple of goals of the patent game
we wanted to successfully simulate
patent systems we wanted to collect and
analyze all of the data generated by
users we wanted to test specific
hypotheses that might get to the
following issues um how do patents spur
innovation if they do do outcomes vary
with specific parameters and if so what
would those parameters be and is there
an optimal system for innovation so
that's a project that's more for the
future I think although I think we've
shed a little bit of light on what sets
of parameters at least within our system
perform better than other sets of
parameters the database structure allows
the implementation of almost any patent
system feature the patent system itself
is fairly technical and this becomes an
advantage when you're trying to simulate
it because it's relatively
straightforward in many cases to choose
an implementation and code that would
seem to reflect the essence of that
aspect of patent law we used Ruby on
Rails and we aimed for ease of function
or ease of use for the users so drag and
drop inventing inventing is relatively
easy you do it with a mouse the
difficult part is coming up with great
invention but you don't need machine
tools in a laboratory you just need a
mouse a little bit of coordination we
tried to use pulldown menus we tried to
update events so that the user didn't
have to do that themselves and we tried
to use auto refresh in all of these are
fairly trivial features but we tried to
make sure that the system itself was as
non-distracting as possible so that
users could concentrate on playing the
game and attempting to win within the
parameters we had set but the goal for
the user was to win the game and we've
tried a variety of incentives to get
people to really go for it one
possibility is a prize for every single
trial so every winner of a trial every
score of the most points or generator of
the most in
in a trial win surprise and we tried a
variety of different prizes from fine
chocolates to money we also provide an
incentive for those that come second
third fourth and fifth and some of our
trials by assigning a probability of
winning based on the points that you
score so this was to solve a problem
that could have arisen if one player was
so far ahead of the other players it
became futile to try because they'd
never win so instead it still makes
sense to score points and earn money
because it raises the chances that
you'll be the winner the person with the
most points doesn't necessarily win he
just has a higher probability of winning
so what do we actually implement in the
patent game and a lot of these are
aspects of patent law which may put non
patent lawyers to sleep might even put
patent lawyers to sleep but I'll go
through them because I think it's
important to see which elements we did
try and implement so for inventing we
used the proxy of elements now these
elements could be numbers symbols
letters and in most of our trials we
used letters so a b c d e and f were
presented as potential building blocks
of inventions and inventors could take
those letters and make combinations for
example a CD or a EF or ABCDE F so the
inventions could be long they could be
short
those were the raw materials that were
available for inventing now combinations
of elements were what became inventions
in the game we did not allow for example
the patenting of basic building blocks
that may be a flaw of the current patent
system that it does allow the patenting
of basic building blocks at least in the
mind of some critics but you could not
patent a in our game we considered the
fact that a was pre-existing out there
to reflect the fact that a was simply
you know an element of nature's
phenomenon of nature but a B if you put
it together was potentially an invention
or ABC or ABCD
we took very careful track of prior art
so if someone had already made on a b c
you couldn't patent
a b c in the future and if somebody had
made an ABC similarly you couldn't
patents lesser-included strings such as
a b or b c and so the computer kept
track of prior art and prior art was
often announced at the top if you tried
to patent something which had already
been made or used or patented the
computer would say i'm afraid you can't
patent that that's there's already
preexisting prior art we also had a
distinction between making and patenting
in our game so you could make a
combination of elements and make it and
then if you wanted sell it on the market
sell it on the market for whatever price
the market would bear at the time or if
you wanted you could patent that
combination now we had different
possible settings for making and
patenting in the US system you can make
something and still patent it if you do
it within a year in the rest of the
world if you make something and put it
out there in the market you can't patent
it once it's been revealed to the public
it's an absolute novelty system versus
the system we have here which involves a
grace period we actually in most of our
experiments use the absolute novelty
rule so once you made something or and
used something you couldn't patent it
nobody could patent it not the user or
any other player we also included
functionality allowing people to license
or to sell inventions so having invented
for example ABC if one wished one could
make ABC available for licensing to
other players for a set price and the
owner of the patent would set that price
similarly if you didn't want to continue
infringing someone else's patents and
they were making their patents available
for license you could sign up and buy a
license and henceforth you could make
that combination without being sued
we also had an infringement and
enforcement system so if one makes a
combination which is patented by someone
else the owner of the patents has the
opportunity to to sue if they wish and
when they sue they have the option of
hiring a certain number of lawyers and
lawyers are expensive and so if you hire
a lot of lawyers it costs you a lot of
money now in various trials we've done
we weighted legal effort sometimes
greater or lesser extents so for example
sometimes if you hire a bunch of lawyers
it really helps you to win if you have
ten lawyers and someone else has one
lawyer chances all chances are the
person with ten lawyers will win in some
trials in other trials we minimize the
effect of lawyers now there's some
evidence that having a large legal
effort does help up to a certain point
and certainly some companies use teams
of lawyers to intimidate other companies
into giving up and if you're a single
inventor with no lawyer and you go up
against a company that has professional
patent litigators your chances aren't
great that you're gonna win for
procedural and substantive reasons but
this varied in different ones of our
trials but suffice it to say you could
vary your legal effort now the defendant
having been sued they also had the
choice to hire a lot of lawyers or a few
lawyers but again there was a cost and
the cost was a non-trivial cost and most
of the trials that we did there were
various things you could win if you
successfully litigated you might get an
injunction and the injunction would
prevent future making or using of the
patented combination which was at issue
in the litigation or you might get
damages and we actually incorporated
into our system not just single damages
not just the costs that you inflicted on
the owner of the patent by infringing
but to reflect the patent system in the
United States and some other countries
we included what's called treble damages
so you had a certain percentage chance
of winning one times damages a certain
percentage chance of winning double
damages and a certain percentage chance
of winning
treble-damages triple damages so for
example if the damages were a thousand
dollars or a million dollars under
treble damages the judge would actually
triple those up to three hundred or
three million I think we've skipped
forward here sorry um we also have the
possibility in our system of
establishing a patent term so patents
could last for the whole game or patents
could last for five minutes or for ten
minutes or for fifteen minutes so this
is something that we hope to explore in
the future the effect of explorations of
patents in the real world in some
industries companies hang on the
prospect of expiring patents and the
moment the patent expires they start to
use the patented technology with
impunity because it's no longer under
patent we also incorporated a number of
costs into the game so for example it
costs money to patent those reflect
prosecution costs that an inventor would
pay to the Patent and Trademark Office
and pay to patent attorneys who assist
with the preparation and filing of
patents and also time it takes time to
come up with good inventions and in our
game it sometimes pays off to take your
time to invent quality inventions that
are worth more rather than patenting
willy nilly anything that comes into
your mind the chances are that most
inventions in our system and in the real
world are not worth terribly much on the
market I already mentioned the costs of
litigation the cost of litigation can be
substantial in the game and it's up to
the players to decide whether they want
to spend a lot of money on lawyers and
obviously they sometimes take a chance
that they'll lose as a consequence of
saving money on lawyers we also have the
possibility of multiple users versus no
users we can set our system on autopilot
but the trials that I'll show you are
based on multiple users who've used the
system so this is an example of what the
interface generally looks like and let
me point out a couple of features in the
upper left-hand corner it shows how much
money each player has and each player is
is assigned a different color
and so this updates automatically and
players in the trials that generated the
data I'll show you
they knew what other players had in
terms of money so this might be akin to
seeing documents from the SEC or
estimates of market value etc below the
money box is the design box and this is
where one invents inventions and so the
a B C D and E are the raw materials and
you drag those down into the invention
box and you can change their orientation
you can only use in the trials that we
used for the data I'll show you we only
used one letter so you can't do AAA but
you can do a B C etc so your inventions
can be as small as two two elements or
as large as five or we can also include
six seven eight and there's no limit to
the number of elements that you can use
um then you have a choice
you can choose to make it and if you
make it you will be told if you make
this you can also sell it and the market
will give you X number of dollars for
your invention so you can make money
that way and augment your money in the
upper left hand corner or if you want
you can choose to patent it and when you
choose two patents it will tell you what
the cost of patenting is and you go
through that process and you come up
with a patent now in the middle column
it shows your patents so you have a
convenient place to keep track of your
intellectual property so for example in
this game the mate the player in red has
the patent AC and its value at the
current time on the market if you were
to make it and sell it as $2 not a
terribly good invention they also have
the possibility of clicking the hot link
for license and sell and making that
patent available for license to other
players for whatever amount of money
they want if they sell it they actually
lose the patent this is true to the real
world if you assign your patents then
the party that buys it now owns the
patent and they could actually apply it
back against you if you infringed the
patent you used to own um you also have
a place where you keep track of your
licenses so if you acquire some licenses
you'll know which license
as you have and how long the licenses
last and then other patents in some
versions of the game we allow everybody
to see the patents that other people
have which isn't terribly unreflective
of the real world because if you want to
see what patents other people have you
could search the PTO database or
actually Google patents is probably a
more effective way of looking that up
these days and then events are tracked
on the right hand side in certain
versions of the game and so for example
Alice made ba up here
Carol patented CDA Carroll patented AE
Alice made DBA Alice patented a C and if
an infringement event occurs the player
that owns the patents will be given a
little hot link saying you're a patent
may have been infringed would you like
to sue and if you click that it takes
you into the litigation function a
number a number of strategies are
available and these these are strategies
that we've noticed employed by different
players one is play it safe some people
really don't like to infringe they don't
like the feeling of having infringed the
feeling of being sued so they play it
safe if they want to use someone's
invention they license it or they buy it
other folks have no such compunction
they play fast and loose they infringe
infringe infringe and in some cases it's
not worth suing especially if the patent
isn't worth very much and so sometimes
they get away with it and sometimes they
get nailed in litigation sometimes
people come up with more elaborate
strategies sometimes they'll spend a lot
of time patenting coming up with good
combinations experimenting patenting
patenting patenting and then at a
certain stage in the game they'll sort
of come out and start to sue people or
start to make things that are protected
by their patents um some people have
elaborate licensing strategies I've seen
some players that try and find key
pieces of our key inventions that later
became useful to a lot of other players
and they sit back and just harvest the
licensing revenue they make the patent
available for license and it can be a
very successful strategy sometimes
sometimes players just want to
what they've discovered and sometimes
they they charge large amounts of money
for others to buy their inventions and
then there's the question of enforcement
some people have very sophisticated
enforcement strategies some people
enforce against everyone all the time so
they're constantly enforcing they're
constantly in court that might sound
like some companies that that you may
know other folks are more selective and
they'll only sue when they desire when
they think that it's desirable or when
they think that their patent is
especially valuable some players ignore
all the rules and just go for it no
matter what the consequences are there's
a whole bunch of mixed strategies that
are also available yes um
sometimes they do and sometimes they
don't that's a really good question
honestly I don't know the rigorous
answer to that question we have the data
you can imagine it's like swimming in an
ocean we have to choose what to look at
but that's something that we do plan to
look at because I've made notes on
various trials um where I suspect that
something interesting is going on and
I've made notes on the particular trial
and the particular player to look into
the database later but but I'm afraid I
can't comment in a rigorous way because
I haven't really looked at it rigorously
but it's a it's a great question yes sir
absolutely some do and some do it with
extreme Glee um it's interesting the
emotions that come up in this game I
mean it shouldn't be unpredictable
you're using humans to model human
behavior but the emotions that often
come up are are quite interesting um
some people take it quite personally
when they're sued um other people are
very dispassionate about the whole thing
some people get angry and and some
people just stay cool calm and collected
a couple of observations that are
qualitative observations we don't have
the the data yet to
act these out because we haven't had the
chance to look through the database for
it but players do seem to enjoy playing
I've yet to find a player that seemed
bored um sometimes players appear to be
frustrated if they're not winning but
players appear to enjoy the game and we
usually get oversubscribed when we look
for human users players really enjoy
winning this seems to be a universal
phenomenon of human behavior at least
with respect to our system as I said
there's fist-pumping there's woo there's
in you're facing players really like
that and again that's good for us
because that's one of the aspects that
simulant simulation games are judged on
are they fun and compelling um players
appear to want patents I'm not sure
exactly what explains it but it's
possible that the endowment effect might
play into this having invented something
you may want to protect it because it's
yours similar phenomenon to walking
along the seashore seeing a rock that
before you pick it up doesn't really
mean that much to you but once you've
picked it up you really like that rock
it's not a whole lot different than
other rocks but it's your rock now and
you'd rather not part with it players
invent selectively and strategically
again it's hard for me to assign any
rigorous analysis to this but it's clear
to us that there's a lot of selectivity
in what's patented what's made what's
licensed what's sold and which
litigations are pursued and which are
ignored and there appears to be
strategic behavior some players in fact
many players appear to be planning into
the future of the game and sometimes
it's successful and I imagine sometimes
it's not um
players often will license and they'll
often sell their inventions if the price
is right and one thing that is clear
players often litigate this is another
place where emotion seems to bubble up
in the game players often will sue if
infringement occurs players also appear
to care about which legal rules pertain
to a particular game
and I'll show you some data on this in a
little while but players seem to care
about weather for example you can get an
injunction for infringement versus
getting damages for infringement so the
first hypothesis that all I'll walk you
through and show you some data the first
hypothesis is that the prospect of
patent protection for inventions
promotes the progress of useful arts
this is language straight out of the
Constitution more than will the comments
so more than will a system in which
there's no patent protection available
oh and this is an argument that's often
made I'm in the computer industry in the
biotech industry in all sorts of
industries that you really need to have
patent protection in order for
innovation to occur so in the first set
of trials that I'll show you by the way
this is all approved we didn't do this
under the table or behind the warehouse
this is all institutional review board
approved and I have to say that the
folks that approved it were quite
bemused that we were even asking
approval the last gentlemen that I
talked to who approved the first trial
said it doesn't look like you're
injecting or putting people in
electrodes so I think it'll be okay
maybe if he saw the emotions that bubble
up he might have second thoughts but
this is all aboveboard properly approved
and we test it in the first trial that
I'll show you a pure patent system so a
system of which if you chose and if you
did it before it was used or made or put
on the market you could actually patent
your new invention we have another
system which we called the patent open
source system where you could patent if
you wanted or you could affirmatively
give away the intellectual property
rights you could sort of anti patent
your invention if you chose and although
it's not exactly opposite to copyright
open source we were trying to get at the
possibility of giving away rights as
opposed to taking rights and see what
effect that might have so in that case
you could either patent or you could
anti patent if you chose then we had a
pure Commons we had a system where
um you couldn't establish any
proprietary rights to your inventions
anybody could use them if they wished
and there was no recourse in litigation
sure not in the trials that I'll show
you and that's something that we'd like
to test in the future and there's a
variety of ways built into our system
that will allow secrecy to occur what we
what we'd like to do in the future is
see how important secrecy would be but
we didn't want to test it at the same
time as patents because then we'd have
two variables instead of one relatively
controlled variable so it's it's a great
question and I suspect that we'll see in
effect having been a little bit
surprised by the results we've gotten so
far I'm not exactly sure what the effect
will be but I'm really curious to look
into it so yeah we have plans to look
into secrecy and I suspect it'll be
important um sample sizes in this for
example we had we ran eight trials for
the patent system eight for the open
source patent hybrid and eight trials
for the Commons and each game was played
with five players reason we chose five
players is in in most industries there
are about five companies that occupy of
more than 80% of the market so rather
than play with ten which can get a
little bit cumbersome and also costs a
lot of money when you're paying human
subjects we settled on five because
about that would represent the vast
majority of the market in most
industries um
the duration of these games were thirty
minutes and they were exactly times and
we sort of used mutual controls in the
sense that there was a commons no patent
protection versus two systems of patent
protection the patent and the patent
open source protection so innovation
unique inventions invented in 30 minutes
the average number turned out to be
lower in what we in the trials that we
ran lower in both the pure patent system
the blue and also the patent
open-source system the green and the
pure common system the system without
intellectual property protection this
outperformed most of both of them to a
statistically significant degree at the
5% level so this is the number of unique
inventions made during trials we also
looked at what we called productivity so
productivity the way that we measured it
was not the number of unique inventions
made but the total number of things that
were made during a trial even if there
were overlaps so something might have
been made five times in the first graph
it would be counted once in the second
graph it would be counted five times so
sort of proxy of economic activity the
advantage of the pure Commons had was
exaggerated in productivity compared to
the innovation measure that we did and
we also measured social utility or
wealth so the total amount of of dollars
or money generated in the system during
these trials and the pure Commons in
this case ran away with the contest and
both the pure patent and the patent open
source systems were relatively tamp down
compared to the Commons performance so
some some data to put with the graphs
seventy six point eight versus 103 point
four for the patent open source system
versus the common system productivity
it's about a doubling about three
hundred and twenty-two versus six fifty
eight and then in terms of social
utility or wealth forty one thousand for
the Commons and about ten thousand for
the patent open source system so what
explains these rather odd results and
these results were I have to say so odd
that I decided I better look into the
data again because I figured I must have
done something wrong
because I knew that patents would
outperform the other two systems that
pads would outperform the common system
so I thought obviously I've done
something wrong I look through the data
I ran additional trials they all lined
up this way so the Commons in our system
at least with the parameters we set
seemed
perform the other two patent systems so
why what explains it well one
possibility is this is just a terrible
simulation in general it's a bad
simulation it really doesn't simulate
the patent system well so you wouldn't
expect good results or results
reflective of reality
another possibility is we set the wrong
parameters we could have set better
parameters and if we had we might have
gotten more realistic results another
possibilities the players that we chose
just a bad cross-section now we've
actually tested this on a number of
different sources of players now and the
results appear to be robust but these
are all possibilities and we admit them
another possibility is that despite the
received wisdom Commons actually spur
innovation better than do patents at
least you know in our system outside of
our system there's some evidence that
this phenomenon may occur so Helen
Eisenberg have talked about a tragedy of
the ante Commons in genetics too many
gene patents making it difficult for
genetic research to occur after the
patents have been granted so geneticists
and medical researchers paralyzed by the
existence of intellectual property into
not being able to further research
because of the existence of what they
call the ante Commons also Eric von
Hippel at MIT studied user and open
innovation his results show rather
strikingly that a tremendous amount of
innovation empirically occurs outside
the patent system and in fact occurs
almost despite the patent system despite
the possibility of liability a lot of
users innovate anyway and in fact a lot
of users both innovate and then go to
companies and say hey your products ok
I've made it better
could you please make it this way
because I would buy ten of them if you
could make it this way so there's a
phenomenon that's not uncommon in the
real world
I'm yokai benkler Larry Lessig they've
both written about theoretical reasons
why this might be the case at least
under certain conditions Besson and
Moyer
I'm an economist and a law
professor they have both looked into the
empirics of innovation and patents and
they've concluded although I'm obviously
drawing too broad a brush of their book
they've concluded in their book that's
in most industries the costs of the
patent system outweigh the benefits of
the patent system now one industry where
they find the costs not to be outweighed
by the benefits is the pharmaceutical
and biotech industry but in software
which might be relevant especially at
Google the costs appear to vastly
outweigh the benefits from a societal
perspective and probably from the
perspective of individual companies not
all companies but many companies um I
also want to mention particularly Elinor
Ostrom
and Elinor Ostrom is why I have this
slide here this is a swiss alpine meadow
and the tragedy of the commons the image
of the commons desolated because too
many people are grazing too many cows in
the commons and there's no property
rights no protection this may actually
be a rather English phenomenon it
certainly does happen in England or did
happen in England when people used to
brow graze their cows in the Commons but
the Swiss are difference
the Swiss actually graze their cows and
high alpine meadows and I don't think
the cows are distinctively different I
don't think the grass is distinctively
different but what's distinctively
different is the cows don't seem to over
graze and it's not really the cows it's
social norms appear to prevent the Swiss
from over grazing and there's a number
of examples around the world that Elinor
Ostrom has catalogued another example is
Maine lobster bays so along the coast of
Maine there's all these distinct bays
that are rich and lobster and they don't
seem to be over fished and it turns out
that there are very strong social
controls social might be a euphemism for
not overfishing Lobster in those bays
lobstermen
if they see other lobster man
overfishing
they sometimes
pressure them maybe it's social
ostracism maybe it's worse than that but
in the end in these days in Maine the
lobster are not depleted and there's
strong forms of social control that seem
to prevent the depletion so there may be
counter examples to the tragedy of the
Commons that exist without legal control
that exist without you know patents or
laws that are analogous to patents so
another hypothesis that we tested was an
IEEE pollicis that was inspired by a
paper it's one of the most widely cited
papers in all of the legal literature
it's by Guido Calabresi and a Douglas
melamed it's called property rules
liability rules and in alienability and
you can see that I borrowed or adapted
part of their title for my title one
view of the cathedral and in this
seminal article they proposed that
different legal rules might actually
have different effects now they didn't
talk about intellectual property at all
mostly they were dealing with torts and
property law and one of the contexts
that they talk a lot about is the
ownership of real property houses land
and also accidents what sort of rules
you set for accidents like car accidents
and I I want to say particular thanks to
Fred McChesney who suggested that we
take a look at this paper and try and
use our system to do an experimental
test of their hypothesis that you might
get different behaviors um this had not
apparently been done before and he
thought that in the patent context this
might be amenable to some sort of
experimental tests so we
enthusiastically took his idea and
adopted it and did the tests um this was
also I should thank the Searle Center
and Henry Henry Butler who was the
director of the Searle Center and the
various faculty at the Searle Center up
at Northwestern so what our property
rules what our liability rules well a
property rule I'll just use the words of
Melamed and calibrate it
in title our entitlement is protected by
a property rule to the extent that
someone who wishes to remove the
entitlement from its holder must buy it
from him in a voluntary transaction in
which the value of the entitlement is
agreed upon by the seller
so obviously the seller in this
transaction has a tremendous amount of
power they have a veto power they can
say no so this is like getting an
injunction from a court it's not exactly
the same but it's like getting an
injunction where if you've got an
injunction against further infringement
you can just say no I don't want you to
further infringe and if you do you put
yourself in danger of contempt of court
and and fairly strong censure
now what about a liability rule a
liability rule denies the holder of the
asset the power to exclude others or
indeed to keep the asset for himself
rather under the standard definition he
is helpless to resist the efforts of
some other individual to take that thing
upon payment of its fair value as
objectively determined by some neutral
party so in this case there is no veto
in this case whatever entitlement you
have can be taken by another and the
third party and the objective
determination this refers to courts so
you can take something from someone else
and their recourse is to go to court and
get the fair market value for whatever
was taken very different rules property
rules and liability rules this is
represented in our study by damages if I
infringe you I owe you damages according
to some estimation of what it was that I
deprived you of by using your patent
property rules interestingly are the
rule in the law and in law and economics
there is very strong support
theoretically Richard Epstein who's at
University of California I saw at
University of Chicago he has on a number
of occasions written about the dominance
of property rules and for example he
said in any comprehensive legal
structure property rules should dominate
liability rules as indeed they do
he's also noted that in real legal
systems
you look around the world at real legal
systems they often do favor property
rules the standard practice in virtually
all legal systems assumes the dominance
of property rules over liability rules
so we thought this was really
interesting grist for the mill we
decided to try and test it so here's the
hypothesis that we tested with respect
to these rules
um property versus liability rules
patent property rules represented here
by injunction will quote promote the
progress of useful arts which we think
of as a proxy of innovation more than
will patent liability rules and in that
case represented by damages so
injunctive relief will yield more
innovation than damages now the
traditional claim is that you get fewer
useful inventions remember the property
claim is that without strong property
strong patent property protection you'll
get fewer useful innovations so it's
it's an additional variation of the
original tragedy of the commons claim so
again we did fully approved experiments
and we tested four different treatments
in this case we did a property treatment
in which if infringement occurred and
the owner of the legal entitlement the
patent decided that they wanted to sue
for infringement they had a very very
high chance of winning in court I'm in
some cases a hundred percent chance of
winning a face sued they were gonna win
they were gonna get an injunction and
the injunction in some of our treatments
was perfectly enforced if you tried to
make that patented invention again after
you were enjoined against doing it the
system would simply say you're enjoined
you can't make that so you have to make
something else we also did a liability
treatment where you would get damages
you'd get the value of the patented
invention you'd get that if you decided
to sue and again in some of the versions
essentially if you sued you would get
the value back but the infringer could
continue to infringe as long as every
time you sued
um they paid they paid the damages we
also had one treatment in which you got
both injunctive relief and damages so
this was this was the great place to be
if you were the owner of a patent and
this is the current patent system you
tend to get damages and you often get
injunctive relief in fact you used to
always get injunctive relief and now you
mostly get injunctive relief I'll speak
about that in a second and then we have
another treatment where there was
neither injunctive relief nor damages so
essentially this is the Commons again so
the human subjects again were paid and
every trial there was a significant
reward or award that we tried to
calibrate to be effective in inducing
the kind of behavior we wanted which was
absolutely rapacious use of the system
to win at all costs we did 48 trials
five players per trial and each trial
had a duration of 30 minutes so remember
we had the injunction treatments the
damages treatments both and neither
remember that injunctive treatment is
like a property rule damages is like a
liability rule both is both rules and
then neither is neither just to remind
you innovations the total number of
unique inventions created productivities
the total number of inventions made in a
period of time and wealth is the per
capita amount of wealth generated in a
trial whoops that's probably my fence
right about that okay and so here's what
we got for innovation Richard Epstein
and the property folks would have
predicted I think that the injunctive
relief or the injunctive relief plus
damages treatments would have generated
more innovation than the other
treatments it turns out that between
injunctions and damages again with the
caveat that this is within our system it
may or may not reflect the real world
damages outperformed injunctive relief
and in fact damages and injunctive
relief outperformed the treatment where
you got both on the winner again was the
treatment that had neither the Commons
essentially now what about productivity
well productivity you get an exaggerated
but similar trend injunctive relief plus
damages the lowest injunctions a little
bit higher damage is quite a bit higher
and neither coming out on top
wealth per capita wealth same sort of
pattern damages outperforming injunctive
relief and injunctive relief plus
damages by quite a bit and the neither
treatment coming out on top we sort of
thought of the neither treatment as the
control in this test but you could think
of it as the commons treatment in the
previous the previous experiments so the
results of this trial these trials were
sort of interesting innovation
productivity and wealth in this case
were highest without rules without
either rule high with liability rules
low with property rules and lowest with
both rules so from our system and within
our system we conclude based on the data
liability rules spur innovation
productivity and wealth more than do
property rules now this is a challenge
to the orthodoxy that property rules are
strong injunctive relief a strong
property conception of what a patents or
intellectual property rights should
confer this is a challenge to that
Orthodox view but what's interesting is
there have been a number of court
decisions over the last 10 years which
have seemed to march to a similar tune
to our results in particular the eBay
vs. Merck exchange case in the eBay vs
Merck exchange case the Supreme Court
overturned a per se injunction rule that
had pertained for a long time in fact
the court below the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit stated in its
opinion that if you get a finding of
infringement
you get an injunction as a matter of
right that was the language that they
used so you get an injunction if you win
um the Supreme Court said no you don't
in patent law as with other areas of the
law you have to do a fairly nuanced
analysis to see whether you deserve an
injunction and to see whether society is
harmed if you get an injunction and so
the Supreme Court said there's no as of
right injunction sometimes you'll get an
injunction and sometimes you won't but
you won't get it as of right now
empirical evidence since the eBay Merck
Exchange case which was in 2006 decided
in 2006 indicates that now if you take
those data as being reflective of the
future which they may not be but if you
take that data reflective of the future
the chances of getting an injunction are
about 72% now if you if you prevail in
trial and get a finding of liability
one of the more general findings that we
think is interesting is that according
to what we found the choice of legal
rule does affect innovation productivity
and wealth and so calibration muhammad's
intuition that the choice of legal rule
might affect outcome it seems it seems
to satisfy or our data seems to satisfy
their intuitions again possible
explanations well it could be that the
patent game simulates poorly in general
we used bad parameters we used bad
choice of players maybe our sample sizes
were too small it could also be on the
alternative that patent damages are
better at spurring innovation and
generating wealth and productivity
they're better than that then what you
would get under a system of strong
injunctive relief and again that's
consistent with the Supreme Court's
change of the rule from an as of as of
right rule for injunctions to a
case-by-case basis where you have about
a third chance of not getting an
injunction a two-thirds chance of
getting it also a
could be that our results reflect the
facts may be that liability rules such
as damages outperform property rules in
patent law and what's interesting about
this is that there are many critics of
the current intellectual property system
that say that one of the problems is
that we've created tragedies of the anti
Commons so in the patent context there's
too many patents blocking too much
medical research you need a million
licenses to even do bench work now
there's some very good evidence that the
story's more complicated than that but
that's a claim that's been made for
example by Heller in Eisenberg and that
may chill medical research because of
too many patents in the gene context a
recent case the myriad case was probably
influenced by a perception that gene
patents were bad for medical research
that's the case that invalidated gene
patents and said maybe you can't patent
genes a case that's going to be appealed
and a lot of people will be watching it
another area that I think comports with
this is the area of remix culture the
idea that people shouldn't be enjoined
from taking existing intellectual
property and fiddling with it changing
it maybe even transforming it if you
needed to get a license before you did
that every time there may be very little
remix in but if you apply a liability
rule instead of an injunction or a
property rule to remix culture then if
you choose to remix you would have to
pay the economic damage that you inflict
on the owner of the patent rights or the
copyrights but you wouldn't be prevented
from doing the remix you do with your
eyes open and you'd pay for the damage
that you did but you'd be able to remix
nevertheless so one coffee at about this
second piece of research as calibration
Melamed wrote their work was meant to be
only one of Monet's paintings of the
cathedral who all to understand the
cathedral one must see all of them and I
think
um I agree with their statement except
that we're absolutely no calibration
element we know that and we're not
aiming for a money really you could
think of our research is more of a
doodle compared to calibration elements
work and it's part of an ongoing project
that we intend to continue to explore
patents and innovation more broadly
intellectual property and the effects
that it has on technological innovation
a couple of areas that we intend to
continue looking into and modifying and
hopefully improving are the theoretical
framework that we're operating under and
we're always open to comments
suggestions for improvements about this
we're also constantly trying to refine
our experimental design we recoded the
patent game entirely this summer to make
it more robust the parameters that we
use we're exploring a number of
different parameters this coming year
and things like prosecution costs how
much time and money it costs to get a
patent we'd like to explore the effect
that might have in our system
enforcement costs both in time money
certainty and expense the patent term
we'd like to explore what happens when
you vary the patent term we'd like to
explore the role of prior art so how
stingy or strict a prior art rule you
have information costs so for example
the secrecy question that was asked
earlier we'd like to try and explore
what happens when you make it really
hard to figure out what a good what a
good invention is and hard to figure out
what other people are doing and see how
that might affect performance in the
system get at the trade secrets aspects
numbers of players the duration of the
game if you play the game for 30 minutes
it's highly likely that you're going to
see different things and if you play it
for six months or if you play it for ten
minutes a day for a year
so we would like to explore long-term
ongoing games we plan to put it on the
web soon and let people essentially just
play come up with their own teams and
play for long periods of time we're
really interested to see what behavior
we might we might observe then damages
you know we've we've already explored a
little bit of damages and injunctions
one thing we'd like to explore with
respect to injunctions is we'd like to
see if you have a really strong chance
of getting an injunction the world
before eBay vs Merck exchange does that
lead to different outcomes
if you then if you have a very weak
chance of getting injunctions or let's
say a one-third chance or a 50% chance
or the current prevailing chance which
seems to be about 72% user
characteristics we'd love to look at
different populations of people the
interpretation of results we would just
like to say clearly that we have a
system an experimental system we don't
for a minute think that this is the
final answer about reality and in fact
we would say take it with a strong grain
of salt this is one simulation one view
of the cathedral and maybe not even a
good one we hope that we've done as much
as we can so far to make it realistic or
meaningful but obviously there's a lot
of parameters that we could have chosen
differently there's a lot of different
ways we could have built the simulation
so we we recognize that future
experiments varying damages and
injunctions as I mentioned and one thing
we'd like to get at eventually after
we've explored a number of the above
questions can you come up with optimal
sets of parameters where you maximize
the amount of innovation which ought to
be the goal
constitutionally if the Constitution's
original founding fathers motivation is
to be followed are there ways that we
can adopt the patent system to optimize
or maximize the amount of innovation or
productivity or wealth or some other
important parameter we think that that
would be
a fun thing to do and maybe even a
socially meaningful thing to do to see
if we could feed into the policy system
somehow and shed some light on how the
patent system might be adapted to
generate technological innovation rather
than forward it and we're not we're
certainly not ready to say that it does
one or the other but in our system we
certainly have been given a little bit
of pause about the received wisdom of
patents and innovation and so it's
certainly wet our wet our palates to
continue exploring this and to see if we
can shed light into the policy realm and
actually influence innovation yes that's
a great question um what we would like
to do ideally is we like to marry our
experimental results to this is more
relaxing as a we'd like to marry our
experimental results with case studies
from the real world which is difficult
because we now live in a world that is
homogeneously patented in the sense that
if you want to be a member of the main
trading club the World Trade
Organization you have to join trips the
trade-related aspects of intellectual
property and if you want to join trips
you have to sign up to the standard
Orthodox rules of patents trademarks
copyrights and trade secrets that the
Western world that Europe and the United
States have been living under for a long
time now that makes experiments hard
so we're reduced to natural experiments
with countries for example that don't
comply so we might look at certain
countries that often make it into the
news for non-compliance the ones that
seem to frustrate the US Trade
Representative even those countries are
difficult to look at though because
they're in flux so India for example
India for a long time was a target of
criticism for low intellectual property
rights they appear to be in a transition
to stronger more vigorous enforcement of
IP rights some people explain this based
on the fact that they have a burgeoning
local pharmaceutical industry and and
other technological industries China's
another country that comes in for
criticism and it's hard to know how to
look at that data and what to use as the
before and what to use as the after but
there are examples in history that we'd
like to look at as well so for example
Germany Italy and Switzerland at various
times have or have not allowed patents
for medicine for drugs so maybe by
looking at some historical evidence you
might see whether there's an effective
innovation at least in that industry so
what we'd like to do is match up
real-world examples like that and we'll
be forced to settle for historical
examples and pre trips post trips
examples because the countries that
don't have patent systems often don't
have a lot of technology anyway and so
it's it's hard for example to say oh
Cuba
there's no patent system in Cuba and
there's little innovation and so
therefore we need a patent system yeah
absolutely so that originally traces
back and unfortunately I'm blanking on
the name of the gentleman but it traces
back to a gentleman who I think in 1952
or 53 said a similar thing he said
basically and I'm not saying that he's
correct but he said basically the patent
system some complete and utter disaster
if we were starting from scratch we
would never choose to have the patent
system we have but we already have it
and it would be a disaster to abandon it
now because
so many investment decisions are based
on the existence of the patent decision
that would throw everything into
disarray so yeah I think that yeah I try
so my original background I like to
think is as a scientist and I'd like to
think that I'm not wedded to the patent
system or not having a patent system at
this point I'm just so fascinated by how
this system that we all depend on we all
assume works works that I want to keep
exploring it but I'd like to look into
fine tuning a fine tuning would improve
it I'd love to know whether no patent
system versus a patent system would
yield different results and I all sorts
of other ancillary questions I'm really
interested in but we we certainly don't
take a position that the patent system
should be abolished and we don't take a
position that we know how to improve it
at this stage I think we simply offer
you know one view of the cathedral and
we hope there's other views and we hope
that we're able to come up with other
views ourselves but we think it's an
incredibly important question to study
because so much depends on technological
innovation I think it's clear that the
economy depends on technological
innovation the work go from solo and
Samuelson I think has definitively
indicated that technological innovation
is good for economic growth but we have
this disconnect between intellectual
property rights and innovation and I
think we need to explore that disconnect
and figure out how to make it work
properly you know for individuals for
companies and for society because if
innovation is so good we better figure
out how to spur it yes
also maybe yeah those are fantastic
suggestions
do you wanna collaborate know that those
those are great suggestions you know one
of the problems that we have is we built
a system that's completely adaptable so
we can look into an infinite number of
things and when Bill and I sit down and
try and figure out what to do next it's
really hard to decide and then the
actual carrying out of the experiments
it takes a long time to prepare it we
need to raise the money we need to find
the subjects we need to get the IRB
approval all that stuff so we're
constantly thinking I hope we chose the
right question to look at but those
those are great suggestions we'd love to
look into those I'd be happy to answer
that question I think clearly yes I
think from the perspective of the
individual industries it's hard for me
to believe that software and biotech and
the making of you know armchairs should
all have exactly the same patent rights
applied to them and the same patent
terms applied to them
it's something that actually I'm working
on in a different context I think that
it's clear from the research that I've
seen that's come out in the last 10
years on that question it's clear that
different industries behave differently
and not to take that into account is
probably a mistake from the perspective
of of generating innovation in those
individual Innis industries
one of the the questions that sort of
pushes back on that though is how
complicated would it be to separate the
industries would we have to have 10
different patent tacks could we ever get
that passed through Congress it seems
almost impossible to get any patent
changes through Congress we've been
trying for six years to get some
relatively modest changes made but I
agree that it doesn't make sense and it
doesn't reflect the evidence that we
already have to treat software the same
as biotech the same as automotive
engineering and it strikes me that we
should be trying to optimize the effect
of the patent system on innovation in
every industry because I think we want
more innovation and I think it's good
for society to have it oh that's the
North Shore of st. John in the US Virgin
Islands I teach a class there every year
and that's just my favorite photograph
ever so I always end my talks with that
yeah I do I do and in fact one of my
colleagues suggested that the next time
we do the trials we should do a
questionnaire afterwards and try and
capture those attitudes but I think that
the players that play our game I think
they come out of it with a changed
attitude towards patents and innovation
in the sense that I don't think it's
clear to them that there is one winning
strategy and that having more of
something for example stronger patents
actually Spurs innovation so yeah I
think that it does change their view I'm
not sure that it changes it in a
consistent direction but I think all of
a sudden they think of the patent system
is something complicated and organic and
evolving and and may be hard to predict
which which is probably good because I'm
a patent attorney and I certainly didn't
expect these results in the game I was
pretty confident that I knew it was
gonna happen I was gonna be the supplier
of the new footnote instead I got
results that were quite different than
what I expected
so I think it's a great idea I think
we'd like to do questionnaires
afterwards thanks again for the
opportunity to talk about this I really
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
