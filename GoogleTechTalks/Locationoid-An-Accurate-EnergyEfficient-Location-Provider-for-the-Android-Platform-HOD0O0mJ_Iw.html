you for coming stafa user from UGA then
versity of science and technology and
today I'm going to share with you our
recent results on the location Location
Oich project where we target an accurate
and energy-efficient localization for
gsm phones in general and for the
android platform in particular so as we
all know location-based services has
been gaining momentum recently and
application ranges from finding the
nearest pharmacy to my are there any of
my friends nearby now there anyone
interested in playing chess now and so
on and the applications the list of
applications keep increasing every day
and run commercial services that are
being offered were a larger scale like
google latitude and places facebook
places and they keep coming every day as
i said however whenever we talk about
localization for cell phone we need to
keep in mind the energy consumption of
the localization technology we are using
because of course if your localization
algorithms leads to depleting the
battery very fast no one will be willing
to use it because energy is a very
scarce resource on mobile phones plea
the most commonly used technique for
cell phone correlations gpf however gps
as we all know requires is an energy
hungry device it acquire consumes a lot
of energy as I will quantify later in my
talk today and it doesn't work in every
place so for example doesn't work in
indoor environments it doesn't work in
areas with tall buildings because it's
require line of sight with the
satellites and at the same time recent
applications like navigation for example
in google phones android based phones
and nokia phones and other popular for
cell phones requires that you do your
localization very frequently so for
example order to track your car need the
to get the gps location very frequently
and this can lead to killing the battery
the
fast in your cell phone so the problem
we are trying to target is how to do
localization on cell phones with high
accuracy but at the same time you should
be able to do it an energy efficient
manner so that you conserve the energy
on your cell phone so the location oil
project what we has different components
one of them for example is to perform a
gsm-based localization using GSM network
not using GPS so that you are not using
the energy hungry GPS device another
component is to do power profiling for
the different location components on the
android OS so that we can quantify how
much energy each component TX when it's
running and once we do this profiling we
propose an energy efficient technique
for obtaining the cell phone location
using the internal sensor it is not
using the GSM network node using the GPS
but depending on the internal sensors
mean is that seller o meter and the
combos finally what we do in this
project is that we propose about
management layer that runs on the on top
of the location provider in the android
system that can combine all these
components together to as i said
accurate and energy-efficient
localization system so in the rest of my
talk I have two main components the
first one is said sense where we try to
obtain an accurate location estimate in
GSM network using probabilistic RSSI
fingerprinting techniques and in the
second part we were wolves jack which is
a hybrid gps accelerometer compass
technique other sensors to obtain the
cell phone location with minimum energy
on the final i will conclude my talk so
the first part of my talk is about cell
sense a probabilistic RSI based gsm
localization system and if we try to
compare the GBA GBS localization to gsm
localization we can see that jeebus is
an N
angry device doesn't work in all areas I
said it doesn't work indoors for example
and it is not available in all cell
phones this is just it's only available
in high-end cell phones on the other
hand gsm-based localization systems
consumes minimal energy or if any on top
of the standard phone operation since
your phone is already connected to the
GSM network and it's performing the
standard GSM protocol if you do
localization using GSM signal you're
consuming minimal amount of power in
addition to the standard GSM obridge so
this is good and it works everywhere GSM
signal is available so we are indoor you
can obtain a GSM signal your
localization technique and work in
indoor environments and finally gsm
standard according to wikipedia is
available on eighty to eighty-five
percent of the cell phones in the world
so again you have a very large coverage
in terms of devices so it's attractive
so if we focus on gsm-based localization
the current techniques that are being
deployed on cell phones and said base
these techniques are mainly cellid based
techniques or RSS I based my cell ID
based what we mean is that if you have
your cell phone and you can hear our the
system its estimates your location as
the location of the cell tower you are
associated with this provides an
efficient way of obtaining your location
however it's a very coarse-grained
accuracy because on the average your
accuracy will be half of the coverage
range of the cell tower if you have more
than one cell tower like here we have
three cell towers your estimated
location will be the center of mass of
all the cell towers you can hear from so
as we said this provides an efficient
way of obtaining your location but it's
a very coarse-grained accuracy recently
there have been techniques that uses
RSSI the received signal strength to
estimate the cell phone location however
since RSSI is a very complex function of
distance we cannot use a propagation
model to estimate our location typically
what's being done is you use what we
call an RF a finger brands another
figure thing that brent is basically you
tabulate
the characteristics signal strengths at
different locations the area of
interests so for example if I want to do
sell for localization mountain view I go
to different locations in Mountain View
and collect signal sensor information at
different location and I store this
information in what we call an RFA
finger brains it's a database of signal
strength characteristics at different
locations during an online phase the
tracking efface I am standing at an
honor at an unknown location and I am
receiving a signal strengths vector from
different cell towers and I'm trying to
find the location in the fingerprint
that I store they know offline phase
that is closest to the received signal
strength you can imagine of course that
using an RF saying fingerprint is a
time-consuming process because you have
to do go to different locations and
stand there to collect the signal
strengths however this is typically done
in a process that's called wardriving
where you ride your car and you have a
cell phone with GBS that's connected to
a computer and you are collecting
location information and signal
strengths information at the same time
and many of the current commercial
systems back street view and my location
from google currently have cars that
roams the streets so in order for
example to get the pictures of the
screen as the streets in the google map
application and the why you are doing
this you can piggyback your reg you map
construction in the same process so it
is not something that you have to do
particularly for localization you can do
it for other applications too so sorry
where'd wardriving overhead is very
minimal here too so currently there are
optimal energy are two main techniques
for using RSI localization in gsm
networks one is deterministic
fingerprinting and by this what i mean
is that the red dots represent locations
where you could you have the fingerprint
so at each of these locations you stand
and collect the signal strength
characteristics and here i assume you
have only one cell tower and the
characteristics that is stored in the
radio map in deterministic techniques is
average single signal strengths from
this cell tower so you stand at this
location you collect a number of
and you store in your resume ABS average
signal strength you hear from this cell
power the red dot represents an unknown
location you're currently standing at
this yellow dot and you want to know
which of the red dots I am standing
ahead currently so in order to do that
deterministic fingerprinting techniques
what they do is he calculates at acadian
distance between the unknown location
the signal strengths at the non location
and the signal stands stored in the
radio map and the returns are closest
location in the reggio map in terms of
signal strengths as the estimated
location so in this example the closest
location is minus 32 2 minus 28 and it's
returning it as your estimated location
we believe that deterministic
fingerprinting techniques provide
coarse-grained accuracy and that's why
we propose probabilistic techniques that
can help enhance the accuracy of
localization as I will talk in the next
part of my of my talk there have been
also proposals using probabilistic
techniques before what is called the
Gaussian processes and the idea here the
goal was to reduce the fingerprint
construction overheads so instead of
collecting 1,000 samples for example you
collect only 100 and then you try to
interpolate this 100 samples to obtain
more samples so you are you doing the
number of points you you need to collect
and in order to do that they assume a
Gaussian process model and a propagation
model to obtain the remaining of the
samples you can imagine in order to do
this interpolations your computational
overhead will be very high and actually
I believe that there is no actual
reduction in terms of the overhead why
because in order to collect 100 samples
you will need to drive those our driving
anywhere anyway so if you are do that
were driving it doesn't matter if you
collect 100 samples 1,000 samples
because you already drove the streets so
it doesn't save much in terms of
fingerprints eyes so our approach is to
use probabilistic Singh fingerprinting
and hopefully we can obtain more
accurate localization and instead of
storing in the radio maps the red dots
the average signal strengths we need to
store the entire signal strength sister
Graham so it gives you more information
about the signal strength behavior and
using this extra information you can
obtain more accurate localization
however the challenge here in order to
obtain a signal strengths Instagram you
need to stand at each location for a
certain amount of time so that you can
collect enough samples to construct your
esta Graham so by this you are
complicating the reggio map construction
process because instead of driving
continuously by your car you will have
to stop at each location so this will
increase your time significantly so what
we propose in cell sense is how can we
reduce this overhead in terms of
constructing the radio map so I'll talk
about the two phases which is offline
phase constructing the radio map and
then the tracking phase estimating the
location once you have your did you map
in place so in order to solve with the
overhead of the construction of the
radio map we use grading approach so
your area of interest is divided into a
grid where each cell represents a
virtual location so the idea here again
the red dots represent fingerprints
location where you collect these dots
with continuous driving by the car your
car you don't have to stop at each point
you continuously drive and based on your
son been great you will obtain these red
dots however we construct days to Graham
not for each dot but for each cell so we
use the points within each cell to
construct the histogram of this sin and
then we use the center of mass of this
cell as the regio map location so we
reduce the problem instead of using each
red dot to using the grid cell of course
we have a parameter here which is the
grid cell lens how long should be and by
this blog parameter we can control the
accuracy of the system and trade it off
with the scalability of the system
because the larger your cell size some
less your great number of grid cells and
hence is the better your scalability but
your accuracy will decrease and we can
try this later in the
evaluation section so this is now flying
fears what we do is we divide the area
into grid cell and construct a histogram
for each cell during the tracking device
you are standing at unknown location l
and you won't find you are receiving a
signal strengths vector of Q dimension
where q is the number of cell towers you
can hear in the GSM standards you can
hear up to seven cell towers so each
component represents the signal
strengths from one sample from a cell
power and what we want to find is the
location L Linda do maps that maximizes
the probability of this n giving they
received the signal strengths vector s
using vision inversion you can find that
probability of L given s equals a
probability of not equals the locations
that maximizes the probability of
failure given s is the same locations
that maximizes inoperative s given l and
i remind you the probative esta given L
is what we stored in the red you map so
this information on the right hand side
can be obtained from the constructed
radio map assuming the cell towers are
independent you can obtain this by
multiplying the individual components
and in order to enhance our accurate
aesthetic near like yers you for our
techniques better what we do is that we
use more than one sample so instead of
using just one sample for estimation we
use n samples at one time for estimation
you have more information so you should
expect to get a better accuracy and this
in this case you must apply the same
bills and the cell towers we have also
post processing step where we averaged
instead of returning the most probable
location we return the average of the
top K most probable locations and we see
also that this enhances our location
estimation process so how well did we
before in order to test our systems our
system we experimental use two different
test beds one in in the smart village in
Cairo which is a typical ruler area and
another in Alexandria which is a typical
urban area we have two data sets one for
testing and independent one for training
for years for the two different test
beds and of course in the rural area
notice that the density of cell towers
is less than the dynasty of cell towers
in the urban area this figure shows the
median error as we change the grid cell
size so as expected as you increase the
grid season sighs what happens is that
your localization accuracy decreases
sense your size of the grid size
increases however if you look at 400
meter grid size you can see the accuracy
is comparable to very low sighs grid
sizes so this is good news that you can
have relatively large cell sizes but at
the same time you can obtain good
accuracy in terms of the number of
samples used concurrently to estimate
your location you can see as we increase
the number of samples you use in
location estimates your accuracy trend
is enhancing but at the same time you
require to wait more samples in order to
get these samples so your latency will
increase so you'll have a trade-off
between latency and accuracy of location
estimation this is the last parameter
which is how many locations you average
as opposed to processing step so instead
of returning the most probable location
you return the key most probable the
average of the most K probable locations
and again as you see as you increase the
value of K your accuracy median error
decreases and your accuracies enhances
comparing our technique to other
techniques we have here we compare our
technique cell sense which is the red
curve with the deterministic
fingerprinting techniques the blue curve
and the Gaussian process is the green
curve and with Google my location
technique which is the verbal curve for
Google what we do is that we send the
query the cell tower to using the Google
API to the servers and we obtain a
location estimates the other two
techniques we implemented as a we
implemented our system we can see from
the figure this is the CDF of distance
error which gives you the probability of
that your location will be less than a
certain error so you can see the median
error at a point 5 for our technique is
better than the other
niques with at least twenty three point
eight percent this is this was in the
ruler areas for the urban areas we have
even better accuracy we can achieve up
to eighty six point four percent better
than any of the other techniques this
table summarizes the results in number
not sure if it's clear in terms of
running the time we are slightly more
than the deterministic elevating
techniques a pro well basically blending
techniques gives about 76 milliseconds
their location estimate and our
technique takes about 90 milli seconds
good location estimates Google my
location of course since its cell ID
base it doesn't do any a lot of
processing so it's about 12 milliseconds
to obtain your location estimates so as
we said you have a trade-off between
time and accuracy so in conclusion we
sell sense is a probabilistic finger
print based gsm localization technique
that uses gridding to reduce the
fingerprint construction overhead and to
scale the system and its accuracy is
better than any of the current
techniques for gsm localization by at
least twenty three point eight percent
in rural areas and sixty-eight point
eighty six point four percent in urban
areas i now switch gears to another
localization system which we developed
within the context of this project which
is Jack a hybrid gps accelerometer
compass localization scheme this
techniques doesn't use gsm for
organization but instead uses the
accelerometer and the compass available
in smartphones in order to do
localization combined with the GPS so
the motivation for this work that many
of today's smartphones contains
accelerometer and compass and it's
mainly used for screen rotation so if
you rotate your phone the this rotation
action is detected by the accelerometers
of the accelerometer is continuously
running it's used for gaming control and
for other many other applications like
flip to silence you flip your phone in
order to silent silent set and whenever
people talk about
localization techniques usually focus on
the accuracy of the transition technique
and the ignores dimension of energy
consumption however if you think about
it at some applications I don't need
very high accuracy of localization so
for example it's for me it's if I need
just to know that I am in mountain view
I'd be happy with our one kilometer
accuracy I don't need me trackers one
kilometer would be very fine for me so
can i leverage this coarse grained
accuracy to reduce the energy
consumption of my localization technique
and this is what we are trying to target
here we are trying to study this
trade-off and give control to the
application developer so that he can
choose whether he needs accurate
organization or an energy efficient
localization the jag approach assembly
and / iya overall idea that it obtains
an initial position estimate using GPS
and then it turns off the GPS and
switches to the accelerometer and the
compass to estimate the location and
from time to time is it synchronizes
back with the GBS because of the
accumulation of error so instead of
using the GPS continuously you are duty
cycling it with low very very low duty
cycle to enhance to iterate your energy
consumption so in the this part of the
talk i'll start by talking about the
android board profiling for the
different location components in the
android phone and then I talk about our
Bravo's the hybrid technique and finally
I'll touch on the bar aware location
power management layer in the location
blood for and finally I will conclude so
in order to profile the power
consumption of the different location
components we did it on an Android dream
g1 phone and we used a monsoon Bauer
monitoring device and the way it works
is that you replace the battery of your
cell phone with a batteries it comes
with the device and you connect it to
the device and you have an application
running on your computer that tells you
the current drained from the battery so
that you can when you are running
different components you can know which
component is using which amount of
current and since voltage is constant
you can use the current as an indication
of the Bauer
sumption the battery that is used
provide 11 50 million better our is the
capacity of the battery for the gps we
can see this is the typical curve you
get from your bar monitoring device when
you turn it on it's almost consumes an
average of about 140 million better our
sorry 100 milliampere for the
accelerometer and the compass that ship
that comes on the HDD HTC dream phone
combined that surround and the compass
and on the same chip this means that if
you are creating the compass or you are
cleaning the accelerometer both of them
are running as you are almost consuming
the same amount of power and you have a
3 3d accelerometer from this chip the
android api provides for different data
rates for wearing the android
accelerometer and this is a typical
curve you can get from when the
accelerometer is running in the user
interface mode you can see it consumes
about 40 or 45 average current during
its operation will confide this more in
in numbers later so these are the
different four modes of operation you
have the normal data mode where you can
have four samples per second up to the
fastest mode where you can have up to 50
samples per second and the power
consumption is not linear in the number
of samples you collect and I our
hypothesis for that is that you have two
modes of operation slow and fast and
that's why it is not linear however we
didn't have access to the data sheet of
the accelerometer and compass chip to
confirm our hypothesis for that
different techniques you can see the GBS
consumes about 140 million bear when
it's running compared to the normal mode
of operation of the accelerometer it's
more than an order of magnitude more
power consumption which gives you an
idea that if you run the GBS for example
it consumes 11.7 3
of the battery in one hour which means
that your battery you can run for eight
or nine hours if you use the
accelerometer in the normal mode your
battery would run to 100 hours so it's
significant saving an energy if you can
turn off the gps and depend on the
accelerometer for your location
estimates has another advantage I'm
telling you that Zach's alarm that is
already running all the time in the
background so that the operating system
can detect the orientation of the phone
that you change the orientation of the
phone so again if you base your estimate
on the accelerometer in the normal mode
you are not consuming any more energy
than the standard phone operation so you
are getting it for zero energy
consumption in addition to the standard
phone operation so this is an extra
advantage so we'll talk about how we
leverage this in our estimation as we
mentioned the basic oh you have this a
state machine of the very simple state
machine of the jack operation you have a
synchronization state and estimation
state and the synchronization is state
you stay you obtain a GPS location
estimate and you also calculate the
current speed from the GBS and calculate
the offset between the accelerometer
speed estimated from the accelerometer
and speed estimated from GBS for
correction I'll show it to you in the
demo once you obtain this information
hey you obtain a fix or after a certain
amount of time you switch to the
estimation process where you switch off
the GPS and base or your estimates on
the accelerometer and compass only and
from zacks run turn the compass you
obtains a displacement and direction and
you combine them to obtain your new
estimates and periodically from time to
time is to achieve acticin
synchronization state to compensate for
its accumulated error and this repeats
forever until your localization is done
in order to obtain the position estimate
you use a standard Newton laws to obtain
a position estimates from the
accelerometer and the compass I will not
go into the details the only thing I
need to highlight here that we need to
take the curvature of errors into
account since the
is the S is like a sphere it you cannot
use Euclidean distance in order to
calculate your location instead we noon
we use this entity's formula which is an
accurate two millimeter accuracy on the
earth is ellipsoid in order to obtain
some creationist okay in order to
evaluate our system we had two different
test beds one in highways and the other
in inside the cities and we study the
effect of changing synchronization
period on accuracy and we compare our
system within lock in lock is similar to
our system with the exception that
doesn't use external or campus so the
way it works is that it obtains as GBS
fix it estimates the current speed and
the direction and that it assumes that
this is bidden direction would be fix it
until the next synchronization points
that doesn't use x hunter and compass in
between so we compare our system with
this very simple technique using linear
prediction in order to system we had a
debugging it all based on google maps
where we draw the gps traces and the
estimated traces and i can show you an
actual demo from it so what we are
seeing here the debugging it all gives
you information like the total trip
distance on the top then the trip
duration your average speed your error
as a final point of the trace your
average your root mean square error and
your maximum error and you can control
the synchronization frequency in second
currently it's set as you can see here
the current value is 10 seconds so this
means that every 10 seconds you turn on
your gps synchronize with it and you can
change it up to 102 minutes so that to
see the effects and down here you can
see the trace this is a highway in
alexandria city the green text
represents the GBA stress which is taken
as the ground truth
and this yellow and red takes represent
our estimated location the yellow dots
represented the synchronization period
lobelia you turn on the GPS and then you
after the yellow dots fear takes
finishes it finish your gps is
completely turn it on and you are only
using the accelerometer and the compass
for estimating the location and it's 10
seconds that's why it's short will
change it now to see the effect you can
see for example if I'm synchronizing
every 10 seconds my estimate is very
accurate to some extent my root mean
square error is 6 meters if I increase
it for example to 60 synchronization
every minute instead of every second I
synchronizer to every minute you can see
the error accumulation here so again you
have the same sequence the same you
telling GBS for the same period and the
red beard is where the GPS is completely
turn it off you have a lot you to cycle
through your energy consumption is much
less but at the same time you are not
synchronizing with the GPS more
frequently so you have more accumulation
of error I remind you here we are not
using any heuristics on top of the
localization system so i'm not using the
street map to match the estimated
location to i can strap it to the street
I'm not doing this here you can of
course enhance this what we are not
doing this here of course you can click
on any point and they give you more
information if you click on the point
until you when it was collected from the
start of that race
GS v8 estimated speed you can see that
the GBS is B 2 16.5 and our estimated
speed from the accelerometer was sixteen
point six very close it gives us x and y
acceleration give you the GBS altitude
and the accuracy of the GBS we have
other figures to this is the same point
I clicked on on the different figure the
blue curve gives us estimated GBS bid
and the red curve gives you the
estimated speed using the accelerometer
and the compass or jack in general and
you can see there is a drift in the
middle and that's the cause of the drift
from the actual position and that this
buoyant there was a synchronization with
the GBS that's why the accuracy was
snapped again to Zakia the estimated
location we have our this is for the
accelerometer for the campus the blue
curve is the direction estimated from
the gps the red curve is the direction
estimated from the campus and you can
see there is an offset between the two
in order to correct for this offset what
we do is that during synchronization
period we calculate this offset and then
we remove it from the estimated
direction so during this period we
estimate this offset and we subtract the
offset from this curve which gives use
our anja kerrville top of the blue curve
you have other figures as excellent are
reading and the difference from zacks
true acceleration and estimated
acceleration you can see it's within
plus or negative point two meters
squared per seconds let's go back and
see numbers is the debugging tool would
give us the numbers accuracy and so on
in terms of our consumption what we see
here is comparison between the different
techniques for different synchronization
videos on the x-axis in seconds and the
y axis gives us the million bear our
consumption of different techniques you
can see that GBS if you leave it on all
the time it consumes as we said about
140 million beer per hour for our
technique comparing our technique to
the in lock in look is slightly better
than our technique in tenements of
energy and the reason for that as we
said in Luke doesn't use accelerometer
and the compass and our technique uses
the accelerometer to the difference
between the blue curve and the green
curve is the power consumption of the
accelerometer and compass however as I
mentioned since the accelerometer is
running all the time in the background
two detectives are changing the
orientation of the phone we are not
using any extra power consumption on top
of the standard publish if you take this
into account and remove it we find that
our technique consumes the same amount
of energy as then lock technique so we
are consuming the same amount of energy
and you can see that the saving embark
consumption is exponential compared to
GBS as you increase your synchronization
time you're saving a bar consumption
decreases exponentially so this is
significant saving in terms of accuracy
this has shows the accuracy for highways
the let's focus first on the green and
the blue curves the green curve is our
technique root mean square error and the
blue curve is the N log linear predictor
root mean square error you can see that
for short synchronization period are two
fifty seconds there is no difference
between the two techniques however as
you increase your synchronization period
beyond that in locust actually gives
better accuracy then how our technique
and the reason for that is that here we
are on the highways where you are
usually moving in a straight line so the
assumption if in lock is accurate we are
using the accelerometer and the compass
but we are not synchronizing frequently
enough so we have accumulation of error
that decreases our accuracy so as we see
as we I said in small synchronization
period we have the same accuracy but if
you want to move to higher
synchronization period in look would be
better for you if you are using the
highway the main advantage of our
technique in intra-city driving so here
we are driving inside the city and again
the green curve is our technique and the
blue curve is in lock technique and you
can see that we are significantly
better than in terms of accuracy in luck
even for small synchronization period
and the reason here at that the in low
consumption of moving in a straight line
is no longer wire is no longer valid
because within city you are changing
directions making turns and so on and
also you are changing acceleration in
lock assumes that the acceleration would
be fix it until the next synchronization
point which is not true when you are
moving inside the city you are
accelerating and accelerating because of
the traffic the nice thing here that the
the red curve gives you the power
consumption so what you can see that we
are saving exponentially in terms of
energy but we are losing linear in terms
of accuracy so you can benefit
significant in terms of energy
consumption with very little loss in
accuracy using our technique so I
touched briefly on the Bauer aware
management clear in the location blood
for currently in order to obtain your
location estimate what you have to do is
construct a location Lesnar register it
with the location provider and use this
Phi whether you need to use GPS or
network based provider and when you are
done you under gesture your listener and
that's it however the developer doesn't
have control over the occurs your energy
is requiring all he can say that I need
my education update for example every 10
seconds or whatever it doesn't he cannot
say that I need my accuracy to within
one kilometer or 10 meters or whatever
he gave it in terms of power or energy
power energy IQ a budget he cannot say
that I need a curious location so that
my battery can last for 10 hours or for
one day for example the developer
doesn't have control over this it would
be ideal if we can extend the location
provider of the Android operating system
so that we can give this ABI to the
developer so that he can have the old
ABI and the new ABI that gives him
control or hair over the energy accuracy
trade-off that we presented in the
previous technique so this is what we
are proposing to have a power management
layer where the application requests
the location accuracy and the energy or
synchronization frequency and the power
management layer will determine the best
location provider to use and how long it
should use and how frequently it should
report the accuracy to give you an idea
about the saving this figure shows the
accuracy of the GPS chip when the GBS is
turnin for 60 seconds and this is done
by ryota kelly you can see that you
start tues very coarse-grained accuracy
when you have a call to start and your
accuracy drops exponentially and then it
saturates at the end so at the end you
are consuming you have your almost
having the same accuracy but you are
consuming power with no enhancement in
accuracy it would be better if I can
stop by say I don't want any more
accuracy enough for me and then switch
office a GPS chip to enhance your energy
efficient this is the same curve was
running it for 10 seconds and as I said
if I am good with 250 accuracy so why
not turn off the chip to save energy so
in summary what we provided in the
second part of my talk is Bauer
profiling for the GPS and accelerometer
and compass on the HTC dream Android
Bauer mobile phones we should we showed
that GPS consumes an order of magnitude
energy more than the accelerometer and
the compass and we were both the hybrid
gps accelerometer compass based scheme
that uses the accelerometer very
infrequently in order to do
synchronization and then the benz rooms
accelerometer and the compass to reduce
the energy consumption we show that our
technique can give exponential saving in
energy with a linear loss in accuracy
which is very promising and our scheme
doesn't lead to improvement significant
improvement in highways when you are
having over in lock when you are having
long synchronization period however it
has significant improvement inside
settings where you have large number of
turns and accelerations and D
accelerations currently we are working
on performant complete bar profiling for
the Android
form of the different components so that
you are taking the operating system
overhead into account also in the power
management layer and we are also
thinking of integrating the power
profiling results into then android
emulator so that when developers are
working on the emulator of the android
phones they can have a sense of how long
the battery will last when you are using
this component of this technique on your
phone we are also experimenting using
Kalman filters and other statistical
technique to further enhance the
accuracy and also experimenting with
dynamically adopting the synchronization
period instead of having a fixed
synchronization period how can we
adaptively change it based on the
accuracy so that we can further enhance
the energy consumption I would like to
acknowledge Google before their support
for this research and this concludes my
dope questions
can you reach your yes so in order to do
this experiment we assumed that the
orientation the phone is fixed it can
maybe on the dashboard of the car or in
your bicycle so the question was can you
talk more about how can you handle the
different orientations the Android
phones come with an orientation sensor
at the same time so you can experiment
with taking this reading in order to
detect this orientation of the phone and
then we oriented to the standard
coordinates and use it once it's
oriented you can use the same technique
without any modifications however our
initial results on that shows that you
have very large amount of noise it is
not that accurate but again if you
assume that mostly when you are driving
you will not be carrying the phone in
your hand it would be fix it with some
orientation on the dashboard so for
example you can do an initial
calibration when you start your caliber
system and then use it from there other
questions
very interesting question the question
is we said that in lock is better in
highways than our technique and then we
are better in intra-city so did you
thought about switching between the two
techniques based on the deriving better
yes and actually I didn't include it in
the current work one way of course is
combining both techniques so for example
you can detect it from the movement
better from the accelerometer that the
user is driving with a constant speed or
he is not making a large number of turns
and based on this you can say I am on
the highway so in this case I can switch
completely to invoke and sable dr. alter
and calm bus will give me better
accuracy and it will save me more energy
so this is a very good idea yeah other
questions comments
I have one of those hours
you
the question here is that in the first
technique where we are you doing goddess
sybase gsm localization if you have an
area with a sparse 3d map sony's bar
cell tower dynasty you have say to send
towers and you will have many locations
with similar fingerprints meaning the
signal strength at this location would
be the same so how would you do when you
select one of them randomly or you
select the topmost the parameter I
showed which is K which is a posto
processing step what it does is that it
returns to you the average of the
topmost k locations so in this case if
you have to location similar fingerprint
what will does it will give you to use
the center of mass of these similar
locations and it will be weighted by the
probability so when you're taking that
the average it's a weighted average
we're using the probability so the
location with the highest probability
will have more weight than the location
with a lobe probability so in this case
you are taking a weighted average its
center of mass it actually is a center
of mass of education taking weight as
the probability of the location of
course your localization accuracy will
not be as good as when you have seven
towers but in this case this is the best
you can do
okay actually this is I was talking with
the another group in the morning about
same idea which is how can you do
localization with loaded dough in the
phones where you get information only
actually from one cell tower not to so
your if you have a row in the phone
usually it will give you just as
information forms associated cell tower
so if you are doing this how can i
enhance its accuracy based on this and
one technique is what you are talking
about is taking the history information
into account so that I can get a better
estimate so I'm not just taking this
sample I'm talking the history of sample
with me to avert or enhance the accuracy
right actually independence assumption
is usually taken for mathematical
tractability alch you haven't
experimented with taking correlation
into account actually in a previous work
in Wi-Fi based organization we had a
work for taking correlation between
samples from the same access point
actually you can go with the assumption
that samples from different cell towers
are independent but if when we talked
about using n samples at the same time
we assume that same busy from the same
power are independent but actually are
very highly correlated so you used model
this before using Auto regression and we
obtain better results when we take
correlation into accounts but it will
take you a more processing overhead in
order to remove this correlation so it's
can also
collection like what happens in that
sister GBS for example yeah that's a
very go into very good question
alright that's a good question the
question is did you try to use different
phones your experimental you just used
one phone because when you use different
phones each one has a different receiver
sensitivity so the lady map constructed
by one would be different from the radio
map constructed from the other actually
what we did is that all the phones we
used where g1 phones but we use
different g1 phones so at least from the
same model we are we tried different
phones and all of them of course gave
similar results we tried with nexus one
false but we didn't have concrete
results figure draft we just had it in a
demo that we can walk and give us
similar accuracy what we did also use it
tried different service providers so we
not just one service provider we tried
with Egypt has three major providers we
tried with the three of them and they
give us comparable results of course
depending on the cell tower dynasty what
we also planning to do is to do
automatic mapping between different
phones so even if there is a difference
between phones and terms of the receiver
sensitivity and antenna button and so on
can we have an automatic way of taking a
redeemer constructed by one phone and
the mobility automatically to another
phone this is something that we are
looking into now too that's a very good
question Irish
Oh
in which technique the first technique
of yours in Egypt we didn't have any
significant old buildings that can
affect the reception as I said you are
taking GBS as ground truth so for this
we are assuming it has zero error so
know the answer we didn't try any
canyons or so on if you have a data that
we can use for evaluation it would be
great to look into it thanks you have
another question
the way we do it is that on the street
yes
again not formally so we don't have
figures for this but we do it on the
demo so you would be inside the building
that wouldn't give you a location better
than the we had actually a demo I of
course it is not calibrated here but
well you can show we have a demo where
you can show their four techniques I'm
comparing with and you can see the
estimated location using all the
techniques and it could have the same
accuracy but we didn't have an exact
number that your accuracy degrades by
this amount when you are doing this
good question the question is when I
talked about the bar management layer on
top of the location provider we said
that i'll give the application developer
an ABI to specify his accuracy and
energy consumption requirements so the
question was what if you have
conflicting applications each one of
them requesting a different criterias
that conflicted the power management
player this is a very good question just
on from the top of my head in the worst
case you will be working with the least
of them so in this case you are not
doing any worse than the current ABI but
if you can do better you will do better
something similar that you introduced in
the latest ABI that fine remember
scheduling events instead of waking up
randomly you combine applications that
wake up at the same period of time and
make them all wake at the same time so
they save if you want say I need to wake
every 10 seconds and you are is based
apart every second may actually will be
waking up every second every 10 seconds
so what you can do is that you are lying
them together so that you can obtain
same thing so maybe it's something along
these lines can be used in the location
provider to but actually it's an
interesting problem that needs more
thoughts about it here any questions
it depends on many factors including are
you indoors our doors have a clear line
of sight to satellites or not is it a
cold star or warm start and so on so is
there are a lot of factors in our
technique if you remember the state
machine we're saying obtain effects or
timeout so this time out is used that if
your fix takes a lot of times and you
were time out and move to the estimation
this be it so that you don't consume a
lot of energy waiting for a GPS fix and
hopefully when you come later to the
synchronization state it will start from
not from the beginning from some point
so that it will enhance the take shorter
time in order to obtain the next fix
tell from the demo as you saw the
synchronization video does fix it we fix
it at some time when you increase it it
is a start at the time i was showing in
the x-axis is the start of transition
period and then the time use you stay in
synchronization video districts it
regardless of the synchronization period
okay
for what you need entra city driving
this one oh I don't think I have the
data says all of them are highway you
talked about this I fail all I older
data set I have here is for the highways
sorry for that be cool that's what
actually the term you take it more from
the compass so when you make a turn the
compass will give you a better estimate
of Z direction so we just exact song car
to estimate the displacement how much
you moved along this direction that's
why we combine both actually in the
slides here this is from intra-city
driving but I don't have the data with
me so this is within city but its
aesthetic it is not I cannot change the
parameters okay
inside what a car
you
because of the magnetic field so the
question is if you use the compass
inside the car there is a magnetic field
that may affect the accuracy of the
compass right and actually we are
showing it here we do have it and in
order to reduce it we do some averaging
and filtering on the accelerometer
compass reading and that's why maybe it
was this is one of the reasons this
figure I was talking about this is the
reading from the compass from an actual
experiments inside a car and the blue
curve is the estimated direction from
the GPS the red curve is the raw data
you get from the compass reading from
the phone and the orange curve is the
corrected figure takings offset into
account the initial offset into account
so if you just use it actually the red
curve is an averaging of the raw data
and then on top of this we do more
processing to obtain the orange curve so
yes it's noisy but we try to reduce the
noise by some processing on top of that
any more questions thank you very much
