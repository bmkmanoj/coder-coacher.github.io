check and a really risky idea and I
serve on the selection committee for it
for this venture philanthropy I read
Chris's fellowship application and when
I knew it when I read it I just I knew
he was going to get it because his his
essays his essays were so powerfully
written and so eloquently argued that it
was just a no-brainer and he did win
that in 2007 chris is from Washington DC

Duke University in 1994 and immediately
joined Teach for America where he was
sent to sunflower Mississippi and taught
elementary school there for three years

South Korea with the Fulbright Program
Chris entered graduate school at the
University of North Carolina and earned
a PhD in American history there in 2005

just a few months ago and it's a the
book is titled the senator and the
sharecropper James Oh eastland fannie
lou hamer and the persistence of
inequality in the south from grad school
onward chris has coupled historical
scholarship with social entrepreneurship
from nineteen ninety nine to two
thousand six he was the director of the
sunflower County Freedom Project an
academic enrichment program for
teenagers in rural Mississippi in 2006
he co-founded the US public service
academy which will be discussing today
in addition to the echoing green
fellowship Chris won the Eli Segall

Google thanks you said you weren't gonna
embarrass me I don't know where you
found all that stuff I'd forgotten
happen havilah stuff I guess so you must
have used that google thing so well
thank you all i know you all are busy
remaking the world so I appreciate your
taking a little bit of time to to come
in and listen to to me talk about the
the public service academy I want to
start with a story and you can stop me
if you've heard it before you know a
couple guys with this big idea they
think is going to change the world and
you know they start telling people about
it and folks are a little bit cynical at
first you know scoff Adam folks in the
industry are a little worried about this
future competition and you know but the
guys don't get discouraged they keep
persevering and then eventually you know
they create this this grand new
institution and and i'm not talking
about Larry and Sergey here at Google
but about myself and my friend Sean
Raymond with the US public service
academy of course we haven't gotten
where where you all are yet but we what
we want to do for the the public
there what what Google has done for the
technological cine the technology sector
you know is it which is to transform it
to rethink it to to change the way we
view it and the way we do it and
basically what we want to do is the
brochures tell you is we want to create
a civilian West Point we want to create
a completely new kind of college a
separate institution independent of any
existing college any existing government
program it would be a four-year
undergraduate degree the degree granting
college that's modeled on the military
academies but focused on civilian
service civilian public service instead
of military service and that's it I mean
really what it all comes down to is that
idea right there's a civilian
counterpart to what we already have in
the nation's five military service
academies basically it's a higher Ed's
start up and and there really aren't
that many of these out there in fact
there aren't any out there so it's not
something that people think about when
they think about colleges you know we
think oh we've already got our verdens
stanford and they've been around forever
and and the idea of creating an entirely
new college is almost unheard of in
higher end we do it in k-12 education
all the time you know with charter
schools and all these innovative kind of
schools but people get real conservative
and risk-averse when it comes to higher
end but what we want to do is we want to
start up a new a new college and this
would be focused on we would have a
mission that's different from any
existing school as we talked about here
on the on the slide we want to transform
how young people perceiving and prepare
for and pursue public service and what
I'm talking about public service what I
mean is is not community service not you
know volunteering at the soup kitchen or
helping out with habitat on a Saturday
morning we're talking about working for
public institutions working for
government you know at the local state
and federal levels everything from you
know the local teachers and cops on the
street you know the local level on up to
working for the Border Patrol and FEMA
and State Department at the federal
level and we what we find is that
there's a there's a perception problem
you know a way
in excited talented bright energetic
young people like the folks in this room
think about what they want to do with
themselves what they want to do with
their lives they very rarely nowadays
think about going into public service
into putting them into the public sector
and that creates all kinds of problems
for for our country and I'll elaborate
on that later but what we want to do is
we want to develop a whole new
generation of young people who see
things differently you think differently
about how we can do public service how
government operates I mean those of you
who don't maybe study political science
or know much about how government works
know that government pretty much works
the way it worked 50 years ago and
especially at the federal level it's
structured the same way the rewards are
structured the same way and a lot in the
world has changed since then as you
probably know you've been part of that
change you know there's a lot of there's
been revolutions a couple of revolutions
in in in business and and how businesses
operate but that hasn't changed
government very much and we want to
develop on a whole new generation of
young people who think differently about
how we can do public service better how
we can make our government institutions
our public institutions more effective
and more efficient and more economical
because our government is quite large it
spends a lot of our money and it
behooves us to make sure that it gets
spent well and that's basically what we
want to come out of this US public
service academy that comes out of this
this new kind of college when when I
started out I thought oh you know hey
I've got this great idea how you know
I'm so original and creative and you
know I thought I was all all you know on
the cutting edge and then I did some
research and I found out well actually
this is this goes all the way back to
the very beginning of this country and
that George Washington of all people had
this idea for creating a national public
college for civilian leaders he actually
had in mind he had two things in mind he
wanted a military academy that would
develop military leaders and a civilian
counterpart to develop civilian leaders
and he loved this idea I mean he would
talk about it to any visitor who came to
mount vernon and he he left money in his
will to curry
eight this civilian college never
happened the military academy did happen
it happened in in 1802 with Thomas
Jefferson is president and Jefferson
also wanted to build a civilian
counterpart and he tried when he was
president and congress didn't didn't
wouldn't let him you know because they
were worried about giving too much power
to the national government and so
jefferson went home to Virginia and
built the University of Virginia and
that was his version of what he wanted
to do for the nation a national civilian
college so I wasn't actually very
creative at all you know this goes back
a long way and we think that it's it's
it's high time to rekindle that dream
and actually make it happen so you might
ask well why now you know if George
Washington couldn't do it if Thomas
Jefferson couldn't do it you know what
makes me think that that that I and my
friend Sean Raymond who's been a partner
on this project you know what makes us
think that we could do it now well we
think there are a few things are going
on one is that that we have a tremendous
need in the public sector the baby
boomers over time we all know you know
they it's on the cover of Newsweek and
all these magazines and everyone's
worried about Social Security and all
that and those are important as well but
another thing that's happening is that
the public sector is going to be drained
of a lot of its leadership in talent
when these baby boomers retire because
what happened was the baby boomers got
into public service back in the 1960s
back in the era of you know ask not what
your what your country can do for you
right this idea this this time when
people saw public service as something
noble and rewarding and prestigious and
people from top colleges would would
fight for for positions in the public
sector well that euros a long long since
passed and the pipeline has not been
been producing enough people to go into
public the public sector so as these
baby boomers retire we're already seeing
shortages all up and down the local
state and federal levels all across the
country so you couple that need with the
desire of the 911 generation I see lots
of folks who look like y'all are part of
the 911 generation which studies have
shown is much more likely than previous
generations my gender
generation acts my generation to to go
into service oriented positions and so
you have this desire among among young
people you have this tremendous need but
then you have a challenge you know
because the best and the brightest don't
see government as a place to go to make
a difference as a place to go to spend
two to make your life worthwhile you
know who wants to be a bureaucrat right
you know they even that word just
conjures up these images these
fuddy-duddies sitting behind desks
putting puts and pushing pencils all
right and that's not that's certainly
not the feeling of this campus you know
where where where folks are excited and
active and thinking of new ideas and and
very creative that kind of energy is is
is needed in the public sector so we
need to to do something bold something
creative something new to to get those
talented young people to go into into
public service so that's what we want to
do we want to create this this civilian
West Point civilian counterpart to the
public service academies and we're
talking about a small college 5,000
students twelve thirteen hundred
students a year we would follow the same
admissions process as as the military
academies which some of you I don't know
if anybody thought about the military
academies back when you were in high
school thought about applying but you
have to get a congressional nomination
from your representative or senator and
they basically just write a letter
saying you know you are who you say you
are you're ready and then you go through
a very competitive admissions process
I'm actually getting into West Point is
harder than getting into Harvard because
they get far more applicants and not
only are you have to be good
academically have to be good physically
and so it's a very competitive process
and we think that the public service
academy would be just as competitive if
not more so because you know one of the
things about the military academies is
although they have a single-digit
acceptance rate their application
numbers are almost exclusively male
their their applicants are
overwhelmingly male their student body
is only fifteen percent female because
young women typically do not apply in
very large numbers to the military
academies for a variety of reasons and
and then if you look at if you look at
college students six
% of college students today are women
then you look at service organizations
like Teach for America which I did or
the Peace Corps AmeriCorps there are 65
70 percent limit so we think that
there's going to be a tremendous pool of
young people who would want this kind of
institution not only for the free
education but for the mission of serving
the country but doing it in a civilian
way so they'd have to go through this
process we look for academic achievement
leadership potential commitment to
service and when they get there would be
a different kind of college would be
very rigorous like the military
academies year round the curriculum
would be focused on civic education and
international education academically as
well as service learning we'd want all
students to to study abroad master a
foreign language we feel like that's
just one of the things that if you are a
21st century leader you just have to do
it's that just should be required all
students would take courses in civics
and ethics and economics whether they're
a biology major or an econ major or
whatever in addition to that there be a
an intensive leadership development
program modeled on what what the
military academies do you know a lot of
folks have these sort of images of what
a military academy is and we think of
George Patton you know like screaming at
a at aleve and like slapping them on the
head or something and that's not what
goes on there they have a progression by
that I mean a leadership development
program that builds from one year to the
next so that that by senior year those
students are ready to take on the
leadership of a platoon and so they have
a whole system set up and we're actually
working with the folks primarily at West
Point but also a naval academy and Air
Force Academy to to create a civilian
model civilian parallel to what goes on
their students would would have a
liberal arts major like like history or
or biology but they'd also choose a
field a public service field like public
health or law enforcement or education
and then they would do internships and
and coursework in that field and then
when they graduate they would oh five
years of service so that's the deal you
get a free education you graduate
debt-free but you owe five years of
service in the military academies of
court
you get sent to serve in in the army or
the Air Force and so forth here you
would be sent to serve in a public
institution a government position local
state or or federal and you would serve
for five years and that could be broken
up there would be a two-year mandatory
service commitment where you go wherever
you're told and then after two years you
could apply for a transfer you could
defer the last three years you can go to
graduate school or you could stay on if
you if you're in a position that you
that you really like and so that's
that's the the essence of it and we feel
that these students would be would be
better equipped to deal with the
challenges of public service after
having gone to the public service
academy it would be a very different
kind of college experience it's not
going to be for everybody we recognize
that you know they're 3,000 some odd
colleges in this country and and and
students who wouldn't fit in here would
fit in somewhere else very well but we
think the intensity and the the rigor of
this of this campus would create a
culture of service that like the the
military academies creates a bond among
students that that's very powerful and
much more powerful than what what
happens on most civilian colleges you
know the the unique curriculum focused
on leadership and service will develop
leaders in different kind of way then
than most civilian institutions or any
civilian institutions do now there's a
longer commitment to serve you know a
lot of times people who who run colleges
you know college president will say oh
you know we already do all that stuff
Chris you know you don't need a public
service academy you know we do this at
Duke you know what if that's where I
went you know in the sale we already
have the public service academy at Duke
and I'll say well really because I don't
know of any program that requires you to
serve for five years after you're done I
don't know of any program that's focused
on leadership and service the way the
public service academy would be I don't
know of any program that's specifically
designed to meet the needs of the public
sector the way the public service
academy would be cuz it's not because in
most colleges when you say public
service they really mean community
service they really mean nonprofit
organizations I got nothing against
nonprofits you know I
I run one now I ran one Mississippi but
they don't do what the public sector
does I mean there's certain things that
government has to do that government
must do and and must do well and isn't
doing as well as it should and that's
why we need a public service academy and
plus when you have a national college
like a West Point or a naval academy it
automatically raises the visibility and
the prestige of that of that field and
that's what we want to do we because you
know obviously 5,000 students 1200
graduates a year is not enough to meet
all the needs of our country but what it
can do is is inspire young people around
the country to see public service in a
different way to sit to say to
themselves well you know I may not go to
the public service academy I may be
going to to Berkeley or somewhere but
that's it that's a field I want to go
into and and it changes the way they
think about their their future and the
way they think about public service now
obviously I can say all this I you know
and and say oh there's a lot of young
people out there who really like this
idea and people would say oh well how do
you know and so we commissioned a poll
we've actually done a number of internal
polls but we did this external poll we
had this firm just ask 800 young people
18 to 29 what they thought they'd give
them a the brochure you know the basic
outline of what this idea was and said
what do you think so eighty eight
percent said that's great you know what
a great idea and then we said okay well
now we're going to give you every
argument we've heard against the public
service academy oh you know it's too
much money oh we should do scholarships
instead oh we already do this at at
existing colleges oh you know this is
just going to become a political of a
political time bomb that that or you
know it's going to be manipulated
political you know every argument we
could think of and then we asked them
the same question again and we got a
little bit of a decrease but still
seventy-seven percent of young people
supported the idea so there there is a
ground swell of support and then we
asked well okay if this had been around
when you are applying to college would
you have considered it would this have
been appealing to you and the majority
said they
we would've you know nineteen percent
very likely in thirty-seven percent
somewhat likely to have considered going
to this college and and so what that
says to us and it it's not democratic or
republican it's pretty much evenly
spaced out well that says to us is that
young people are looking for this kind
of opportunity not everybody certainly
but many young people want to serve the
country they you know Matt was saying
you know he gets he gets fired up when
he sees the you know the be all you can
be army ads and and and the things that
appeal to patriotism and and that kind
of thing but you don't want to
necessarily go into the military you
don't necessarily want to kill people
right but you still want to serve you
still want to do something for your
country you still want to be part of
something larger than yourself and and
so we think that they're going to be a
lot of young people who would be really
excited about this kind of institution
and and the numbers bear that out it's
going to cost money a lot of money I
guess you know in Google terms is
probably not a lot of money 205 million
dollars but but it is a significant
investment and we don't shy away from it
it's going to cost a lot of money to
build this institution and keep it
running and at a top level for four
years and years to come we're looking at
creating a public-private partnership
with the federal government pays for
eighty percent of it and we're looking
for for funders to to build an endowment
fund right now the institution the
organization as it exists is a 501c3 a
nonprofit organization we depend on on
foundation grants like Matt mentioned
echoing green and Kellogg Foundation we
just we have hundreds of individual
donors people who've signed our petition
gone to our website or heard me speak or
or read about us in time or wherever and
I have just you know sent in 50 bucks
hundred bucks thousand bucks to keep us
going you know to help us a hire interns
and and you know fly to places like this
you know to speak about about this idea
and to generate more more support and
what's interesting you know a couple
years ago I was living in in rural
Mississippi in the middle of nowhere had
this idea started sending it around to
anybody I could think of
and now we have a bill in Congress we
have 20 senators who are co-sponsors our
primary co-sponsor was the first one was
Hillary Clinton who'd read about us in
the Washington Post and basically called
us up had her staff call us up and say
look this is a great idea let's do it
and so we have and and we have mostly
Democrats I'll be honest but it is
bipartisan we have three Republican
centers of the 20 and then we have 116
representatives also as co-sponsors of
the bill again bipartisan and we've
gotten organizations from you know
everything from City Year to the Peace
Corps Association to the Urban League as
well as college presidents I was just
meeting Don Kennedy who used to be
president of Stanford he's one of our
endorsers and and you know a number of
college presidents including the last
three superintendents of West Point so
when it runs the game and anytime you
you have West Point and the president's
our superintendent of West Point and the
former president of Antioch University
supporting the same thing that that says
that you're pretty bipartisan and
ideologically broad so so we do get a
lot of support it is broadly based it's
not ideological because people see in
this the potential to create something
new and different and uniquely American
and I think that's exciting and so you
know I'm here to just tell you about it
solicit your support I know that you a
lot of wanted me to talk about action
items things that that you can do and
there's any number of things that you
can do you know we this movement would
not have gone as far as it has if it had
just been me or Shawn and me together
we've had volunteers who volunteered
their time people who volunteered to
design our website people who
volunteered to get us hooked up with a
particular organization people who have
have gone to their college president and
you know harassed him until he until he
endorsed us people have written their
Senators and Representatives people have
donated money people have done any
number of things to help make this
happen and so we would love to have many
of you all involved you know you can
start by signing our petition
that gets you on the mailing list for
our e-newsletter but also talking to
your representatives talking to other
people in your family about this idea
supporting us financially is of course
always it always important and also
lending your expertise there are a lot
of things we don't know how to do i'm
not i'm not a techie you know I'm not an
engineer I don't know how to do a lot of
the things that we would love to do
online you know we've had a lot of
success with some of the social
networking sites in terms of getting
young people involved we have a National
Youth Council with a couple hundred
college students who are who organizing
on their campuses nationwide to get more
of a ground swell of support you know so
we've done a lot of the stuff online but
we need to do more because that's that
you know that's where the action is we
couldn't have done anything without
within without Google you know but
without the internet without without the
ability to to connect with people
cheaply because honestly you know I was
in Mississippi earning less than thirty
thousand dollars a year I couldn't have
done this without the internet allowing
me to send this proposal out to
thousands of people for free you know so
so we need all all kinds of help and so
I'll leave it at that that's the the
basic story but I'm happy to answer any
questions that you all might might have
yes oh oh sorry yeah I guess for folks
who may want to hear some I think of the
middle this on okay it's also when I
think in the military I think of
officers coming out of the Academy's
maybe razzi programs and there's also a
distinction between officers and
enlisted do you think a public service
can academy will bring this type of a
distinction to the public sector as well
what are your thoughts on that it's it's
a great question and that's that's there
is a distinction because the military is
much more rank oriented than then the
public sector is but what we want to
bring is is yeah sense that that public
service academy graduates are kind of a
cut above you know that that you can
expect more out of them not in
elitist way but in a way of cultivating
excellence and that what that will do is
kind of act like like yeast and they'll
in the loaf you know that that having
you know a core of these these young
people who have these values you have
this experience going out into our
public sector over time they will
they'll raise the level of expectation
among all the people you know around
them so less of a rank distinction
between your officers and enlisted
because that's not built into the end of
the public's public assistance of the
civilian system but more a kind of a
hierarchy of talent in a sense you know
that or of ability and experience and
that we want to raise the level of other
people around them up as well that makes
sense yes in the back um so if you were
to get all of the money that you needed
to start the academy and push through
the first four years of students what's
the timeline for planning the curriculum
getting on board faculty creating a
campus um how much planning has gone
into that so far and what are your
visions for the future it's great it's a
great question you know and we kind of
came up with this after it kind of took
off and Senator Clinton and Senator
Specter got on board and suddenly we
were like well wait a minute what if
this actually happens you know what if
Congress passed the bill tomorrow what
would we do and so so back in in fall of
two thousand six week you know I just
started cold calling professors you know
I'd read about somebody who's an expert
in international education you know I'd
be on the phone be like hey you know
explain the idea in 10 seconds be like I
need you to serve on a task force for me
you know to serve on this task force on
international education or admissions
and curriculum and all these different
things so we cobbled together about 60
70 of these experts in higher ed to
serve on different task forces and they
came up with their various reports we
had a conference we argued it out for
about three days up in Wisconsin was all
snowy it was it was great they couldn't
leave we just argued all weekend long
and out of that came our first draft of
a blueprint and that's kind of a longer
look my original proposal was maybe you
know 13 pages or something and this is
about 50 60 pages it kind of lays out
what the curriculum will
would look like how the placement
process would work how admissions would
work what the time frame is in terms of
hiring people and so forth and now we're
in the in the process of revising that
to make it much more detailed about
about especially about timeline we the
bill calls for a two-year startup window
from the time the bill is passed to the
time the first freshman step on campus
um two years is not a lot of time so
what we want to happen is when Congress
passes that bill and ideally that would
happen next year when the new president
comes in and the new Congress comes in
so let's say at this time next year the
bill is passed we want to present with
them this blueprint to say look you can
start at square one with nothing or you
can you can start with this blueprint
that that now hundreds of people have
looked at and vetted and offered
feedback on and we could really hit the
ground running so that's what we're
we're working on right now we want the
second draft to be out this fall yes hi
I was wondering what the plan is for
enforcing the the service period how do
you enforce the service period well it's
called money because if they if a
student were to break the commitment and
not serve the five years they would owe
the entire cost of their four-year
education all at once so that's a pretty
hefty bill to be stuck with if they
decide oh you know I'm tired of this or
whatever you do need you enforcement
mechanisms and and and that's a pretty a
pretty stiff one if they have to pay
that all back at once and there's no
plan for example for let's say someone
served two years and wanted it to do go
out we do still have to they would
selected the full amount they would pay
her back the full amount I think
starting at at four-year I have to read
the bill close again I wanted to give
you the wrong i was starting at four you
know if they finished four years you
know there's there's some deduction but
not much because you want to make it a
serious disincentive otherwise you know
you'd get people going through
especially college costs being what they
are today you know going through maybe
doing a year and then and and cutting
out you know obviously we hope that we
would have instilled the the values in
the and the
sense of obligation but the the
financial disincentive it doesn't hurt
either to in terms of keeping people to
their commitment so this is actually
kind of a question on the same lines but
so I think when you talk about military
academies like West Point then it's it's
pretty clear that Pete the kind of
people who are going into that are
expecting for the most part to pursue a
career in the military and part of that
is because the military for people who
have graduated from places like West
Point and we're interested in that sort
of and that sort of thing offers like a
really good a really good career path
and I would venture to say that maybe
the the public bureaucracy doesn't have
the infrastructure that that sort of
supports that same sort of attractive
career patent because of how
bureaucratic it is I mean I mean the
kind of people that would go to that or
not the same kind of people there's like
a military academy I think what you're
suggesting you're hoping is the same
kind of people that might try and get to
get into Harvard or Stanford or whatever
and and so what what kind of
relationship if any is there with with
the public with it with the actual
public sector in preparing for sort of
accepting those sort of people because I
imagine that the idea is not to just
have them stand for five years and then
that's it and just rely on having 1300
people you know every five years to but
but to have them have prolong careers in
that in that sector you're exactly right
mean the goal would be to have career
leaders in the public sector just like
the goal the West Point isn't five years
it's it's a career in the military and
you're right that there isn't the same
easily discernible career path the way
there is in the military and there are a
couple things that we that we want to do
first of all on the front end we want to
create partnerships with the the
employing agencies so that we're not
just kind of willy nilly you know
throwing one person here one person
there but that we actually develop
relationships with these agencies and
then I have them request you know
certain numbers and it's a two-way
street they get a top quality graduate
but they need to provide mentorship and
professional development and leadership
opportunities early on you know they
need to provide something that's going
to be that's going to be attractive and
appealing for for the graduate as well
and so that that will invest the the the
graduate the young person more in the in
the development of them themselves as a
career public servant at the same time
though part of what we want to do is
change that culture you know good
because i think you're right i think
that you know a lot of public
bureaucracies there there isn't an
unawareness of leadership development
and and in professional development and
just ongoing learning and and that kind
of thing the way the military does quite
quite well actually I mean even if
you've been there 10 or 15 years they'll
send you off to some school for
additional training or they send you to
another place for something else because
they see this process as continuous and
so we want to do is try and transform
the public bureaucracies from within you
know that to raise the level of
expectation by having these young people
who have these different expectations
come in and help push those changes it's
a long term process though in the first
few classes are you know that there
there's going to be some tension some
struggle I've one more hopefully a
little bit more difficult question so
you showed that you should have really
pretty graph of that quite clearly show
clearly show that at least young people
are very supportive of the sort of
initiative but you know about four years
ago over fifty percent of the country
was very supportive of George Bush and
some people might disagree with how
successful that was and so I'm wondering
if there's any sort of any sort of
metric that you have available or that
you're planning on having on measuring
sort of the the probability that this is
actually a successful venture especially
in the face of the fact that you know
this country has a very real problem
with affordable higher education and
that this is maybe only one percent of
the budget but still one person of the
budget that's going to an experimental
school versus one percent of the budget
extra that could be going to making
higher education more affordable for the
general population and not for just
thirteen hundred a year sure uh one
thing is that that I use that stat about
the one percent just to show that that
in the overall analysis it's not a huge
number but we wouldn't be taking the
money out of the higher ed pile so so
200 million was implicitly you would
because that is money that's going to
higher education and that could
potentially go to our
to support other other initiatives and I
accept that we wouldn't be going through
the department of education budget we'd
be getting the money from actually the
department homeland security budget okay
so so we wouldn't be competing
necessarily but your but your larger
point is is a good one which is how do
we know that this is gonna work you know
how did how did Larry and Sergey know
ten years ago that Google was gonna work
well you know they didn't you know they
they had a plan they thought things
through is as clearly as they could but
ultimately they had to take a leap of
faith they had to take a risk and that's
what entrepreneurship is and ultimately
that's what we're asking for as well to
take a leap of faith to say there is a
better way to do to do this and we need
to go all-in you know we need to just go
and pursue this we can't try to do these
half-hearted measures of these these
these simple you know like many pilot
programs because that that won't change
the culture and so the short answer is
no we don't have a metric anecdotally
that you know the thing I like to think
of is a back 45 years ago when when John
Kennedy was was thinking about starting
the Peace Corps he actually he turned it
over to his brother-in-law sergeant
Shriver who's really the father of the
Peace Corps Kennedy gets all the credit
but sergeant Shriver was the one who was
in charge of trying to take this little
idea that Kennedy's just kind of tossed
out in the middle of a speech and
actually turn it into a reality and so
the first thing he did he talked to all
the experts all the higher ed people all
the international relations people State
Department people all these people to
try to figure out well how could this
this peace corps idea work and almost
all of them came back with the same ants
and they said well you know it's really
risky it's too dangerous world out there
you know as the Cold War Berlin Wall
just going up and everything and they
said you got to start small you know
take you know handful of kids maybe 25
40 kids pick one country they were you
can develop relationships send them all
to that one country for a couple years
and then you know go back to Congress
ask for a little more money get a few
more kids and so forth and he's like
you're crazy because if we did that
nobody in the world would ever hear the
Peace Corps again you know be stuck in
the bowels of the federal bureaucracy
nobody would ever ever know about it and
it wouldn't inspire generation he said
no you
you got to go you got to do it big you
have to get hundreds and hundreds of
volunteers you've got to get dozens of
countries and you have to make this make
this kind of a bowl American venture
that's that says who we are as a people
were risk takers we're pioneers we try
new things we fail sometimes but we we
often succeed and and so he said peace
corps has got to be like that so we're
gonna start with hundreds of kids and
they started they had no budget they
haven't even gotten congressional
approval and he started sending
recruiters out to college campuses but
it worked and within a couple years he
had thousands of kids and and you know
40 50 countries now you know it's all
over the world uh so that's this that's
the inspiration that we look at to say
you know what we need to we need to just
just do this and and when we start down
that road we're gonna we're gonna
encounter some some obstacles and
roadblocks but will overcome them
because you know we have the energy and
we had the foresight way the the passion
to make it happen there's someone in the
back she's got her hand up high I'm so I
was wondering whether or not you n
considered other models like instead of
having a school having programs within
lots of schools you know like a program
within lots of networks of colleges and
having I guess maybe something like the
Truman Scholarship where you know it's
like a program that your tractor for
four years and you're still have in the
community but that could potentially
have a greater impact because you would
be influencing your peers around you at
the other colleges quicker a show of
hands how many of you had no the Truman
Scholarship about half Truman
scholarships been around for 40 50 years
I love the Truman Truman Scholarship in
fact two of our interns this summer were
Truman scholars the Truman scholar class
of two thousand seven wrote the big long
statement of support for the public
service academy I think Truman
Scholarship is a great idea it does not
have the cultural resonance or the
impact that West Point has you know
everybody in this room knows what West
Point is and probably has an image in
their mind of what it means and what
kind of student goes there because when
you have an institution when you build
something permanent we have alumni who
can who can
who are tied into that place it creates
a different kind of bond and a different
kind of impact I think the Truman
Scholarship is great i did a Fulbright
Program right scholarship it doesn't
have the same kind of impact that that
an institution would it just can't and
so we did look at other models and you
know and and some people say well what
about the ROTC model as opposed to the
military academy model and and
ultimately that would be a great thing
to have I think but try to imagine
having ROTC without having the academies
it's hard because the academies are kind
of the core they're kind of the the
keeper of the values and the keeper of
the traditions and then once you have
that that flagship institution that
model you can implement ROTC programs on
a variety of different campuses and
still maintain the quality and integrity
of the programs if you don't have that
core then those programs will will will
will scatter and people will have
different definitions of what public
services different definitions of what
obligation and commitment are and
different different levels of quality
and so we think it would be the best
thing to do would be to create the Fox a
flagship institution create the model
create the place that Congress won't be
able to change you know later on when
when an administration changes you once
you build that place you can't get rid
of it and then once you have that later
on once the model is established then
you can create the the satellite
programs that existing institutions and
so long term down the road that's
something definitely something we would
like to do but we sort of like we think
this is a big enough piece right now to
handle I also have one more question
about whether or not you have an idea of
what percentage of the graduates you
want to go into local versus national
versus state public service we don't
know honestly uh what what that what
that breakdown would would be I mean
there there's some folks who are
passionately interested in Federal
service other folks who would really
much rather be on the local level but we
don't have a sense of that that
breakdown
it's def it'll make its way back up just
a quick question about why Homeland
Security is the sponsor of this that
just seems like an odd odd place for
this if we're trying to separate it from
being part of the military say or some
other that is a great question it's not
in our proposal that's a political
decision basically what happens is that
what's happening now because of the
deficit in the wars there are only two
places in the federal government that
actually have money and and I have
programs that that are being funded the
military defense department and homeland
security everywhere else is being cut
and substantially cut I think that was
part of the problem I think that isn't
oh you're absolutely right I when we we
were going to reintroduce the bill and
one of the things that we are going to
talk with the the writers of the bill
senator Clinton and senator Specter is
to say we would prefer not to be in
Homeland Security we think this fits
better as an independent executive
agency the difficulty is that if you
don't have a whole you need a home in
the federal government within one of the
departments so you have to be affiliated
somewhere your money's got to come from
somewhere we don't want to be affiliated
by the Department of Education because
we we don't want to compete with money
money wise with with existing programs
as we were talking about before we don't
want to take away from pell grants or
any other programs that are already
being being challenged for funding so so
yeah so that's that's why it was a
political decision bring it back up here
so i can i can see why you know at two
hundred million dollar line item on a
budget would be sort of a blocking issue
for forgetting political support sort of
having people rally behind it and I
wonder if if there's been any discussion
about trying to mitigate that cost and
distribute it amongst other government
agencies who are already trying to
invest in higher education outreach
programs and are like like DHS the
military department of state all have
budgets that they allocate toward trying
to recruit students from from
universities to begin with and they have
a lot of subject matter experts who
might be able to you know contribute to
the curriculum do 10 yrs as professors
or some acting some sort of supporting
role on at a public service academy has
there been any discussion of trying to
lower that that line item cost and
incorporated into the budgets of the is
tutions it would be you know benefiting
from this program there is a 1-1 model
is there's something called the
presidential management fellowship which
does that where where it's basically for
graduate students it tries to get
graduate students to come in for two
years you know top graduate students
come into the Federal service for two
years and the employing agency has to
pony up a certain amount of money for
each for each PMF person that they get
so we've looked into that that sometimes
causes antagonism within the those those
agencies the other thing that we're
looking at is what's called the inner
inter agency personnel Act IPA which is
I never heard about it before but
basically what it allows is allows for
high-level senior executive service
people to be detailed to an educational
institution for one to four years and
and that would be a great way for us to
kind of cut down on faculty caused by
having them come for for three or four
years service faculty members and these
folks are experts I mean there are PhDs
in their field they've had you know 20
30 years of experience you know their
their top people so that would be a way
that to kind of mitigate the the actual
hard money cost because their salaries
are already paid by their employing an
agency yes so the the one big worry that
was kind of going through my mind this
whole time and it was especially
aggravated by the whole department of
homeland security being the the
financier of the project I'm just
wondering what happens when you have an
educational institution that's so
closely tied to government and
patriotism and a sense of nationalism
that given what already sort of happens
to a large degree in public schools
around the country high schools even how
do you make sure that the curriculum
that the educational experience isn't
distorted excuse me distorted or
restricted based on that no it's I'm not
gonna pretend like there's any formula
that will have and basically what we
need to do is we need to create a
firewall between the the operation of
the school and the and the people who
fund the school um you know I mean it
happens in public schools you know I
went to University of North Carolina and
and you know every year there were some
wacko and the state legislature who
legislature who was upset by something
going
in chapel hill and and wanted to do
something about it and you have to you
have to build up the you have to
strengthen the the tradition of academic
freedom you have to incorporate that
contractual e you have to is to make
sure that that is a well-understood part
of this public service academy and that
people in Congress cannot and will not
have any say over hiring a faculty
determination of curriculum and so forth
that's not to say that it won't happen
that that people will create an uproar
but one of the things that we're doing
is creating strong ties with the
military academies who have been very
supportive of our efforts so far and to
kind of jump on their on their tradition
of academic independence you know people
in Congress don't go up to West Point
and say hey man you know you guys need
to be teaching this or that that they
have academic in Independence and it
wasn't always that way it took him a
while to build that up took about 50
years in fact uh but now it's a
tradition that in Congress understands
you can't you can't mess with curriculum
and faculty and stuff at the military
academies we want to build on that
tradition to set kind of hop in there
and say well just like you wouldn't tell
West Point what to do you can't tell us
what to do I think what what's really
going to have to be strong from the
beginning from the superintendent the
other the head of the University on down
especially with that first University
the first president and the first
charter faculty is to really emphasize
that to say this is an academic
institution it's a it's a free market of
ideas lots of things will be taught here
and will be said here and will be
debated here that that maybe wouldn't
fly in Congress or in the political
system but that's because it's an
educational institution so that just
needs to be a value up front and and
reemphasized every every opportunity but
I'm not going to pretend it well it
won't be a problem because it's a
problem in any state system so one big
difference between public service
academy in the military academies is
that the military academies are one gets
funded by the you know military and and
also people will stay on the military so
essentially the same institution that's
round
the program is still one where people
are going to be working at whereas in
this case you have people coming out of
the public service academy and going
into many different institutions right
so I mean one of the things is as it
pertains to curriculum the military has
freedom to set the curriculum but
they're basing it on their needs right
now the needs for the institutions that
are going to be hiring these people are
very different so so I think that's one
challenge but essentially my question is
what's the plan for integration between
the Academy and the institutions that
are going to be in some sense hiring
these people because for one people that
are coming into the economy are going to
want to have good jobs and and you know
have some sense of even security after
they're coming out and and and and and
perhaps even they might already envision
you know one of the one institution that
they might want to go into whether it's
the police department or whether
something else but the challenge might
be that you know at the end they might
not be able to go into those those
positions because it's not as clear-cut
as the military academy where you know
for sure that you're staying within the
same institution right so what's the
plan for this integration I think you're
absolutely right although what what's
interesting is that the military
academies is much more of a broad based
curriculum and they're basically
engineering schools and all the students
get essentially an engineering education
and and a lot of their specialties don't
happen until after they graduate you
know as somebody who graduates from West
Point and go wants to go into
intelligence they haven't had
necessarily a whole lot of intelligence
background as an undergrad they're going
to get that specialized training wear
whatever base they they go to you know
same thing artillery infantry whatever a
lot of that a lot of that specialized
training happens afterward what happens
more at the service academies in
addition to the engineering background
is there's the leadership and the
character development the character
formation that kind of that is
transferable no matter where they which
which course they want don't wind up
choosing because a lot of times they may
go in hoping for one particular branch
and then they wind up because of
shifting needs
they have to go somewhere else but their
skills their leadership skills are
transferable in terms of getting
employing agencies involved earlier on
that's how that's where a lot of the
internships come in and and and the the
public service concentration those are
you when a student chooses that field
they can start to get coursework and
internships in that in that particular
field and we love to collaborate with
the eventual employing agencies that's
why we want to develop relationships and
partnerships from the very beginning you
know we'll have basically six years you
know from the time the bill is passed we
have two years and then first freshman
come on then it's four years till they
graduate so we have six years to really
kind of cultivate some relationships so
we can figure out how best to meet their
needs without distorting the the
undergraduate experience other questions
okay I don't know if we wow I have three
o'clock just about on the nose so well
thank you all for for sitting and taking
