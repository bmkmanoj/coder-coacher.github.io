today I'm here my name is Peter Allen
I'm the director of Google
again I'd like to introduce Philippe
Goldin Philippe of something just a
moment about his background is a
postdoctoral researcher so Philippe
Goldin is a postdoctoral researcher in
clinically applied affective
neuroscience in the Department of
Psychology at Stanford holds a PhD in
clinical psychology from Rutgers he also
spent six years in India and Nepal
studying languages Buddhist philosophy
and debate which means that he can prove
you wrong in a non-violent way in
languages you don't even understand dad
Philippe is currently doing clinical
research funded by the NIH in three
areas and here I have to read because
otherwise I'll say it all wrong
neuroimaging investigations of cognitive
affective mechanisms in healthy adults
and individuals with various forms of
psychopathology the effect of
mindfulness meditation and cognitive
behavioral therapy on neural substrates
of emotion and attention regulation and
the effect of child-parent mindfulness
meditation training question is why does
this matter
Philippe and his colleagues are working
on understanding how meditation affects
the brain and I can think of at least
four implications for this one is that
meditation is moving out of the realm of
faith-based practice into the realm of
recognized science - as this research is
better accepted more people will
practice and benefit from meditation 3
you'll be able to submit the cost of
your zafu and zabuton
as medical expenses although not this
year and forth implication if you
haven't already you should immediately
go to go slash siy and sign up for the
next round of search inside yourself
google's own mindfulness based emotional
intelligence class so without further
ado please take a deep breath focus and
join me in welcoming Philippe Goldin
who's talk today is entitled the cognate
neuroscience of mindfulness meditation
Wow
thank you so much that was a beautiful
introduction so without further ado just
thank you very much for the opportunity
to be here and to share some ideas and
open to questions and suggestions and
let's let's start so today I'm going to
speak briefly a little bit about
attention mindfulness and brain systems
some cutting edge research where there's
a huge amount of interest both from a
clinical side because I'm trained as a
clinical psychologist psychotherapist
and also neuroscience I'm also trained
as a neuroscientist but how what really
how does the brain work how is it
plastic how is it influenced by
different types of training
I'm only here in front of you because
there are hundreds of people who've
influenced me some of whom are here
people who've taught me brain imaging
how to sit with patients how to become
husband how to practice meditation and
so forth so really I'm here but there's
hundreds of other people who really are
through their kindness that's why I can
stand here in front of you so in brief
I'm going to speak a little bit about
mindfulness meditation one particular
type of meditation practice and then
look at a clinical application how might
one type of practice mindfulness based
stress reduction be used as a clinical
intervention for adults suffering from
social phobia or social anxiety disorder
there are many types of meditation
practice and that's something that's
very important the word gone in Tibetan
bhav non sanskrit really refers to
cultivating a certain quality of mind so
it's practices that help us cultivate
the quality and there are many ways to
do that so there's just simply put there
are some classes of meditation practices
that really have to do with harnessing
attention focusing and developing
concentration so for example breath body
focused meditation visualize visualizing
an image a mantra or listening to a
sound or a certain object let's open
field
these are
different kinds of meditation practices
that have different types of results
then there's also linguistic analytic
linguistic or reasoning as exemplified
by monks doing analytic debate which I
did when I was in India in Tibetan
Buddhist monasteries and it's really
really fun and this here could be taking
a topic like the precious human rebirth
working here at Google why is that such
an amazing thing the death meditation
generating loving-kindness these would
all be objects of analytic thinking
linguistic logic types of meditation and
then the gem of all the actual medicine
where one form of medicine is a
meditation on emptiness in Sanskrit
Shunyata and this has to do with
dissolving a mistaken view of how I
exist how we exist and transforming that
into a view of how one exists that is a
lot more fluid and healthy so that's
another form of meditation practice that
is really these to build up to doing
this so in the field of clinical
interventions clinical psychology etc
there is a huge huge bursting interest
in applying Eastern concepts Eastern
meditation practices acceptance
mindfulness into Western clinical
practices interventions so for example
one of the most popular is mindfulness
based stress reduction I believe you had
John kabat-zinn here recently so this is
really fascinating because he took
people who were basically coming out of
pain clinics in UMass who the doctors
were like look we've done surgery we've
drugged them up with lots of medications
we've done everything we can
we're tired of them you take them and he
basically said okay I'll do it and he
caught a Fahd and created this program
mindfulness based stress reduction to
help people with chronic physical and
emotional pain thirty years ago next
year will be 30 years so he's
infiltrated the medical system in a way
that no one else has done to make it
legitimate to bring techniques to help
people deal with themselves in a way
that's really concrete fundamental
beautiful
another derivative that's really
fascinating is mindfulness based
cognitive therapy literally a hybrid of
one of the best forms of psychotherapy
cognitive therapy and mindfulness
meditation specifically as a treatment
to prevent relapse into major depression
so this is to help people who have three
or more previous at major to preface
major major depressive episodes and
helping them to prevent relapse into the
subsequent depressive episode so this
has been very very efficacious and
wonderful clinical trials across three
different studies three different
continents another form is dialectic
behavior therapy which specifically
incorporates mindfulness meditation is
one of one of the techniques to help
people primarily with borderline
personality disorder but it's been
extended to eating disorders as well and
then acceptance and commitment therapy
is another kind of clinical practice
that is explicitly incorporating
mindfulness and Buddhist ideas without
talking about Buddhism at all so these
are just some examples of how it's being
incorporated in clinical practices right
now what I'm going to focus on for today
is mindfulness based stress reduction as
a type of intervention and the first
question is what is that so it consists
of three different components formal
meditation practice breath focused body
scan of sensations being able to shift
attention volitionally from different
sensory modalities generating compassion
loving-kindness state of mind and then
there's an informal meditation practice
which is just as important as the formal
sitting which is 10 15 20 times per day
just for even one breath so you can even
do it right now just shift your
attention to your own breath just for
one cycle to breathing in and breathing
out so we ask people to do this anytime
anywhere any situation multiple times a
day to build the muscle of attention to
generate the habit of checking in
dropping in
oops and then the third component is
hatha yoga physical stretching which is
also a way of getting into the body
noticing sensation so this is the
program so to speak that we used for
adults with social anxiety mindfulness
has been shown over the past thirty
years across numerous clinical studies
to be very effective and robust for
reducing stress pain anxiety and
depressive symptoms overall mindfulness
based cognitive therapy has been shown
to be excellent as a relapse prevention
not a treatment for major depression but
a treatment to help prevent the next
depressive episode what is mindfulness
as defined by Jon kabat-zinn paying
attention in a particular way from the
psychological side what we think about
that is attention has many components
here we're focusing on the ability to
alert place your attention on an object
the ability when the mind becomes
distracted to reorient the ability to
have a specific goal and to use top-down
or executive control to stay on target
all kinds of qualities that are needed
to get any thing done doing this on
purpose meaning I have an intention a
motivation why I'm engaging in this
training of my attention doing it in the
present moment
meaning avoiding avoiding now so it's
experiential approach most of our life
is about avoiding avoidance of things
that are not pleasant here this is
really bringing a sense of equanimity to
what's changing from moment to moment to
moment without pushing away things that
I don't like pulling in things that I do
like embracing anything everything so
it's experiential approach not easy to
do and trying to do this
non-judgmentally meaning bringing
instead of an attitude of self
deprecation I really suck at this I'm
not good at this I never learn how to
meditate I can't stand my mind instead
bringing an idea of acceptance curiosity
openness about what is happening in my
mind my mental experience my brain
here's a quick process model the
intention could be simply I want to
reduce my stress I want to reduce the
symptoms of anxiety it could be that I
want to increase well-being or it could
even be used as self exploration and
possibly even enlightenment if that's
what you're interested in so for example
you could follow the breath and you're
trying to develop a tension
concentration and open awareness calm
flow for example but inevitably the mind
becomes distracted often within seconds
in that moment you're either one can
just begin to ruminate spin I talked
about people going into a soap-opera
mode for hours or minutes or days at a
time
fantasizing dozing these are all forms
of distraction but then inevitably what
has to happen with awareness is to
redirect reorient attention and to do
this without self judgment but but in
fact doing it with kindness and
curiosity in fact it's when the mind is
distracted and when becomes aware and
brings it back that's a key moment
that's actually where a lot of learning
takes place
mindfulness consists of in this Japanese
calligraphy awareness heart mind and I
think that's telling trying to bring
those qualities together what
mindfulness is not is equally important
to consider it's not distraction now
I'll show you some data shortly it's not
suppression of emotion experience or
suppressing showing one's emotion that
is not mindfulness it's not avoidance
it's not ruminating or spinning on
something positive or negative it's not
that whoops and it's not cognitive
appraiser or thinking in a way to change
the meaning of something that's going on
it's not a logic thinking language
process some of the potential mechanisms
for mindfulness has to do with D
centering dis identifying from the
contents of mind so as I have thoughts
sensations images memories those are
events that are occurring but they're
not me so this is D centering or dis
identifying
another possible mechanism is developing
attentional focus harnessing the ability
to place and maintain attention
regulation of emotion
obviously as one trains can harness your
attention things that would normally
distract or evoke emotional off-balance
will occur less and less frequently
changing in how we view our self arises
inevitably implicitly through doing this
kind of practice and then it's also been
thought that negative self focused
spinning or ruminating is decreased so
this is a study that my wife and I did a
while ago where literally just in a
sample of um people with mixed anxiety
depression we found that compared to a
waitlist control no change we found that
people with mind who did the mindfulness
course actually showed a significant
reduction post mindfulness training
compared to a waitlist in negative home
sir a waitlist controls people were
randomized either to waiting several
months before they started the
mindfulness class versus people who got
it right away so this is mixed these are
people with mixed anxiety depression and
what you see is that there's from pre to
post mindfulness training a reduction
but more importantly the amount of
meditation that people practiced during
the two and a half months predicted
significantly 50% reduction in
rumination yes good point so this is
actually people with the mind fits for
some reason the people who were assigned
to the mindfulness group reported
greater rumination at baseline so there
are waves are there are statistical ways
of dealing with that but that's also why
we need multiple studies then you
average over them and then those things
like that hopefully drop out the same
question yeah yeah so they were more
elevated and negative rumination this
sample at baseline
giving his talk so I'm sure that
everyone here at Google
almost everyone probably has to be
evaluated on performance the most
fearful feared social performance
activity in the world is for public
speaking fortunately I don't have that
but a lot of people do and it not only
is it fearful maybe in the moment when
somebody has to present in front of
peers or managers or bosses or CEOs but
people will ruminate as we were talking
over lunch some people will actually
spend my postdoc who worked with me for
two weeks before talk has to be given
negative you know anxiety diarrhea fear
sleeplessness so this is something that
a lot of people experience so this is
the most fearful social performance
thing but there are many many others as
well so what is social anxiety well it
has a huge lifetime prevalence in North
America about 12% of adults in North
America will meet criteria for social
phobia or social anxiety disorder it's
the third most common psychiatric
condition after major depression and
alcohol substance abuse third most
common it has a very early age of onset
eighty percent of cases of social
anxiety begin before the age of eighteen
in fact it's the modal time to of onset
is really about age 10 11 12 and it's
often undiagnosed untreated or even if
somebody shows up for treatment for
anxiety the clinicians usually don't ask
about social anxiety so it's usually
occurs early and it's usually precedes
the develop the subsequent development
of major depression substance abuse and
other anxiety disorders the other very
important thing about social anxiety and
its early age of onset is that it's
associated with the highest high school
dropout rate of all of the anxiety
disorders OCD panic generalized anxiety
agoraphobia etc etc so this is really
why people are interested in going
younger younger younger so what is
social anxiety from the first-person
experience so we for all of our
participants we asked them to identify
four painful so
situations this client offered the
following at a job I had about six years
ago I was supposed to introduce myself
to a group of five or six new employees
the president of the company was
speaking first and then I was supposed
to say a few words
my anxiety grew to such a heightened
level right before I had to get up to
speak that I needed to leave the room
and the building I had to take a walk
for about half an hour before I even got
up the courage to go back into the
building and to admit to my manager what
I had done and how I had failed so we
actually used these scripts
autobiographical scripts as stimuli in
our brain imaging studies induction of a
specific painful social memory this is
about as real as it gets
then we also asked people with respect
to that situation your own situation
what are the automatic negative
self-beliefs that arise this client
offered what's wrong with me
why do I get so nervous I'm going to get
fired for not being able to do this the
president must think I'm an idiot and
wonder why they hired me if I can't even
speak to a few people if I get up there
I'm going to blush and either throw up
or pass out so mental tripping cognitive
distortions fear of physiological
arousal that I'm not going to be able to
control so one model of social anxiety a
cognitive model says the following when
a person has social anxiety is in a
social situation it triggers a distorted
view of the self the social self I'm not
good enough as I am I'm going to screw
up this means the situation is a praised
or evaluated as this is a dangerous
place for me
this is threatening to myself and then
there's a very rapid attentional shift
to self focused attention so much so
that in study is where you have other
people who say hey no you're doing fun
you're doing fine
the person is so internally aware
internally driven they don't process
external information which of course
reinforces the disorder and this leads
to safety behaviors not showing up to
work not making eye contact not speaking
up or being assertive when one needs to
be for example not going to parties
bodily or somatic and concerns and
problems diarrhea etc cognitive problems
negative thoughts etc here I'm going to
be focusing on attention as one way to
probe the brain in people with social
anxiety and how mindfulness might modify
the neural basis of attention so the big
question here is integration
can we take incredible beautiful elegant
technology that West has to offer which
is to basically go under the skull
non-invasively and image the brain while
it's doing what it does and ancient
wisdom traditions of methods that have
been used for 3,000 years of how to work
with the mind ways to actually identify
and begin to modulate mental patterns
can we integrate this a full description
of a phenomena would really entail all
of these levels of granularity in my lab
we're looking at genetic predispositions
to people who have different anxiety
disorders to who will benefit from
cognitive therapy from mindfulness for
medications how this influences
molecules neurons neural circuits and
then cognition emotion behavior this
would be a full explanation here today
I'm just focusing on brain and cognition
emotion so we use the MRI magnetic
resonance imaging which essentially is a
huge magnet beautiful machine here's a
picture of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
Richard Davidson a researcher from
Madison showing his always the dilemma
how this works and I'm going to give you
a one slide primer on what is the
dependent variable in fMRI functional
magnetic resonance imaging you're lying
in the scanner on your back like the
woman you saw a moment ago and then what
I do is I present you with a negative
belief people think I am socially
incompetent you read that this triggers
firing in specifics populations of
neurons having to do with language
processing self-reflection that activate
neural circuits brain systems not just
specific areas but circuitry that then
says hey the neurons are firing please
send more oxygenated hemoglobin
more cerebral blood volume cerebral
blood flow to the areas where neurons
are firing bring more oxygen bring more
glucose because the neurons are
consuming energy and then we threw a lot
of signal processing and statistical
modeling try to infer what are the parts
of the brain that are active when a
person is spinning on a negative
self-belief so it's a whole series of
processes the steps but we can do this
what are the possible brain bases of the
psychological mechanisms that
mindfulness maiya touch well attention
emotion regulation self view wonderful
work by Mary Phillips Helen Mae burg and
lots of neuroscientists are beginning to
delineate where does emotional
reactivity occur in the brain and
emotion regulation so in the context of
a social situation that's feared this
could actually activate very quickly
fear arousal anxiety so we know that
roughly this is very condensed but
roughly there's the limbic and
paralympic system in which there's a
whole set of brain regions that detect
what's personally salient and even
generate emotional reactivity this sends
a signal bottom-up signals this is
threatening to me
this is dangerous to me and it actually
recruits activity in regulatory systems
many of which are instantiated in
prefrontal cortex parietal that says
please select some strategies and engage
in top-down regulation to either
increase or decrease the current
emotional state so we literally are
doing this consciously non-consciously
in our brain all the time and these
these regulatory practices often are
mediated by the way that we view
ourselves and our skillfulness or lack
of skillfulness in language how we think
how we interpret how we view ourselves
so here's just one task for example that
we use we ask people we present people
with our own painful autobiographical
social situations like the one I read
earlier then we have present one
negative belief at a time and have
people spin on their own negative belief
about themselves in that painful
situation then we ask them to provide a
rating
and then we've trained them to implement
some kind of emotion regulation strategy
attention focusing here that was
operationalized as when a cue comes on
above your negative belief
please shift your attention to the
physical sensation at the tip of the
nose of the breath moving in and moving
out physical subtle sensation shifting
attention we also have an attention
distraction condition as a control where
we ask people I put a three-digit number
and say count backwards by one from a
three digit number 168 167 and so forth
attention distraction and then thirdly
cognitive reappraisal think in a way to
reinterpret the meaning of the belief to
make it less toxic for yourself three
different strategies there are many more
than this we only looked at these three
so cutting to the chase
we found that post mindfulness training
post MBSR we found that all three forms
of emotion regulation the ability to
volitionally work with your psychology
brain to down-regulate negative
emotional reactivity we found that the
red bars are ratings of subjective
ratings in the scanner of negative
emotion to the negative beliefs the blue
bars are that same rating after doing
self-talk or cognitive regulation after
doing attentional focus and after doing
distraction all three methods were more
efficacious after doing this two-month
training in mindfulness meditation
greater skill and being able to identify
emotions and to skillfully regulate them
as needed just to go into a little more
detail attention is a very limited
resource we all know that it's also that
attention itself is not a unitary thing
but act as many components so three
components here Michael Posner is the
superstar person in the field of
attention he's done incredible work on
all levels looking at from genetics to
training kids in attention abilities and
here the he and his former
professor no Jin Fong they've developed
a wonderful computer task that assesses
three components there many more but
only three components of attention
alerting meaning the ability to sustain
your vigilance on an object to focus on
an object so you're coding can you keep
your mind right on the object you're
meditating on the breath can I keep my
mind right on the breath
we orienting when the mind becomes
distracted can I switch or shift my
attention back to the object of
meditation back to the object of the
work that I'm doing
third is executive control selectively
attending to what I want to focus on
actively inhibiting things that are
tasks irrelevant this is considered
executive functioning or cognitive
control or top-down control of attention
these three from alerting to reorienting
the executive literally develop in the
brain over the first two decades of life
progressively such that kids really
develop executive begin to develop
executive control in in their teens so
there's literally a developmental
trajectory of these abilities in the
mind brain these three components are
instantiated in the brain in a
distributed network of brain regions
that which is really wonderful because
that means we can probe the effective
attention training on the neural
substrates of these components of
attention so do you find enhanced or
decreased activity when people are more
distracted when they're more focused
when they've trained the muscle of
attention or different agents or on or
off coffee for example cutting to the
chase here look
the regions that are in these colorful
circles are regions that we found to be
their parts of the brain that were more
active that make up parts of this
attention Network from pre to post
mindfulness training in this case 15
adults with social anxiety so meaning
that people who these social phobics who
engaged in the mindfulness meditation
training when challenged to regulate
their attention from pre to post
training they showed increased neural
activity as well as behavioral indices
of the ability to regulate their
attention 15 is very small so this was
the basis for getting an NIH grant and
now we're doing this with 60 people also
randomizing people to mindfulness based
stress reduction and exercise wellness
program based stress reduction because
exercise has been shown in some cases
for people with certain kinds of anxiety
disorders to be just as efficacious as
some kinds of therapy so it becomes
important to delineate the group effect
exercise versus not exercise attention
training versus physical motivational
training to really delineate what how do
brain systems change what how are
different clinical interventions better
or worse for different kinds of anxiety
disorders so this was very promising
that we literally saw neural evidence
along with converging behavioral
evidence of a tension training to look
at the amygdala in this case the right
dorsal medial this is a brain region
that it's very popular because when
people are experiencing emotion this is
an area that becomes very active so when
spinning on the negative self-beliefs
I'm not good enough people don't like me
we found very strong amygdala activity
but I want to show you what happens
during these conditions spinning on my
own negative belief shifting my
attention to the breath healthy controls
some reactivity some down regulation
social phobics at baseline a delayed but
then a rapid increase and then
subsequent decrease in amygdala response
during spinning on negative belief so
take some time to billow up spinning on
the belief and the amygdala the brain
this part of the brain is literally
reacting to these negative beliefs now
this is pre
host the black is pre the same people
pre mindfulness training orange is post
and there are few things that I want to
point out first here there's an initial
burst in the people after the
mindfulness training in this amygdala
reactivity when spinning on beliefs one
of the things that happens when you slow
down and when you become more aware of
body thoughts emotions is that you
become more aware that's not always
pleasant but that's not the goal is not
to remove what's unpleasant it's to be
more aware so one way to interpret this
initial burst is that people in this
case the social phobics were actually
more aware of their emotional reactivity
when they were confronted with their own
negative beliefs greater emotional
awareness but notice that then it
quickly dropped what and then notice
that this occurred before the
instruction to shift their attention to
the breath what was initially a queued
effortful process to shift attention to
breath after two and a half months these
people shift to the left and start to
implement attention regulation
automatically perhaps with awareness
perhaps not meaning that what was an
effortful practice becomes automatic
population yeah this is a these are
across the fit in this case the 15
adults with social phobia and themselves
two and a half months later in the same
exact task do you have any sense in here
some sort of engineer here okay uh error
bars so we can tell them yeah I can't
tell whether you know whether this
squiggle is just noise or whether that's
actually meaningful that's a good
question so the fMRI signal they're many
ways to do signal processing and for my
brain reactivity brain neural response
tends to be quite noisy so we do a lot
of stuff and the only place where it was
significant the other place where you
see a significant drop significance is
here in the social phobics compared to
themselves baseline post MBSR where you
see this reduction that's the only place
where it's significant of course it's
only 15 subjects which is why this was
pilot data 460 where you're going to
have more power because uh that's
psychology 15 is a small sample size it
may not fit but what
the chart where the changer gross yeah
it's not significantly different and
actually you know I don't have an
interpretation for the end of this in
fact these are each twelve seconds so
realistically another way to do this and
we're trying it out is to make this two
minutes long because when you think
about reactivity to something you're in
the hallways you say hello to Susie and
Susie doesn't look at you or Susie
Susie's absorbed is something and is not
really attending to you the reactivity
there's an immediate reactivity there
might be a quelling and then there's a
continuing burst as we spin or cascade
on what's up with Susie like why isn't
she paying attention why why is she
dissing me so real samples would be much
longer than just twelve and twelve
seconds so we're actually exploring that
now doing um two minutes several two
minute samples which i think is probably
more ecologically valid we have to start
somewhere also self view I just wanted
to give just a little bit here because
this is something that's really exciting
which until recently no neuroscientists
would ever touch now there's a burst of
interest in can we not find the self
that's not the enterprise because there
is no scent there is no central brain
region of self but there are different
ways of manipulating how a person views
themselves and you can see that in the
brain so here here's one version of the
self analytic narrative view of myself
this is past future oriented how is
Philippe yesterday how is really going
to be tomorrow it's conceptual it's a
fixed concept and its associated with
ruminating on the self it's a very
conceptual linguistic based view of self
in contrast there's another version of
this way of relating to the self which
is really more experiential present
moment focused which is why this is
interesting for mindfulness continuously
changing experience of the self not a
fixed concept a reduced / generalized
memory which actually means been related
to reduction in depression and anxiety
so in terms of creativity given that
this is a very creative place I was
reading some in preparation I was
reading some stuff on creativity the the
extent to which a person has a
fixed view of themselves and their
abilities they perform at that level the
extent to which a person has a more
fluid sense of self less caught up in a
fixed conceptual notion that person
literally in experimental studies can
make associations that are more long
more interesting they can bring things
together that normally are not very
closely associated they have less
obstruction in thinking more creatively
the view of self I think is at the basis
of that kind of intellectual creativity
and neuroscientists are just beginning
it's actually hard to publish
neuroscience of self studies but there's
an interest right now so in the in terms
of these two more analytic more
experiential more embodied sense of self
and what we find is there's across many
many self studies you see there's this
set of three brain regions we add that
come up all the time these are midline
structures medial prefrontal cortex
dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and
posterior cingulate these three show up
all the time in this particular study we
found it in controls and also social
phobics which is very promising so this
is a very robust when you're doing self
focused attention cutting to the chase
what we found here is in the social
phobics post mindfulness training we
found significant reduction in neural
reactive neural response from pre to
post in brain regions having to do with
linguistic processing thinking to
yourself about yourself cognitive
regulation here more this reductions in
meta cognitive awareness parts of the
brain that have to maintain a concept of
self are reduced and medial prefrontal
place where self focused attention
occurs tends to occur also went down
reduction in thinking maintaining a
concept of self and self focused
attention dropped in the people who did
the mindfulness class so they had a less
of this conceptual narrative fixed Const
and had more of an embodied self and
this is the hot colors here indicating
greater attention actually so in summary
I hope what I've shown you is that for
people who completed the mindfulness
class in the context of a threat
stimulus personally idiosyncratic
negative self-beliefs reduction in
emotional reactivity an increase in the
ability to apply different regulation
strategies be they cognitive or
attention and decreases in conceptual
sense of self and use of language in the
context of one's own negative
self-beliefs meditation is associated
with changes in the neural basis of
attention regulation shift from
conceptual experiential self and I
didn't show here but we're now looking
at neural synchrony across brain regions
are they more connected integrated in
temporal analyses in people who have
done more and more meditation practice
thank you for your attention so there
many other studies that we're doing etc
but I'm more interested in what you
think and questions you have may be
things from your experience or what are
some of the implications where would you
push-pull Drive this kind of work oh gee
a microphone for people who are remote
somewhere sir yeah one one of your
slides cited as an aspect of the more
conceptual notion of self over
generalized memory could you say a
little more about that
yeah in people with um specifically
people with depression there tends to be
what's called over generalized memory so
when you ask people who are in a current
depressive state to think back about a
situation they tend to color their
memory of past situations as oh I was
always sad things were always suck they
actually lose in women current
trash may lose memory for details and
they over generalize into kind of swaths
of memory and inferences as opposed to
remembering details for specific events
and that's been shown prospectively
you take me when I'm a fine current
happy state depress state fleep what
happened three weeks ago six weeks ago
nine weeks ago and you've recorded those
I over generalize and I lose specificity
over generalized memory which is
problematic when you want a person to
say yeah you were sad or this occurred
but you you know they're here the
details of how you responded in you were
effective people tend to forget that I'm
curious how much of this works
cross-culturally and like for example in
Japan people get up and sing in front of
each other where that's actually very
common right yes thank you so much I do
not ask him to ask that social anxiety
in particular manifests differently okay
so here we go Wes no but we are a very
mixed culture right here but in the
United States states generally it's the
cowboy culture rough tough strong
individualistic people with social
anxiety have very poor self-esteem and
they're very worried that about negative
evaluations by others of the self Japan
there's another form of social anxiety
where the fear is not about me about
other people you know other people
having a negative value valuation of me
the fear is that I'm going to do
something in public that will embarrass
you and it's a very clear specific form
of social anxiety that is I'm terrified
that I'm going to do something to
embarrass you that is really culturally
influenced the next question is so you
take people who are from say mainland
China they moved here then they had
children first generation they have
children
second generation when do you begin to
see shifts in patterns of
psychopathology or shifts in sub forms
of social anxiety from landing here
first generation second generation
cultural influence infiltrates the view
of self language for example in Tibetan
language there is
not a word for self low self-esteem
there is no such word so much so that at
a meeting with hossam zidane allotment
people were like yeah one of the main
things we have here is low self esteem
we do everything to buttress up and make
everyone think that we're doing fine and
we don't need your help and I don't need
your help
but in fact that's we know that's not
the case whereas in Tibetan language
there is no such word also in Tibetan
language there's no word for emotion
destructive harmful states of mind no
word for emotion which think about Greek
you know Greek ancient Greek culture
ancient Indian culture there was no word
for emotion in Tibetan language Oh
Michael
Oh Mike in case somebody wants to hear
it just a micro comic thought but I
remember at a lecture a number of years
ago the speaker who is a historian from
Yale said there is no word for shallow
in French even though some people might
argue that the French invented the
concept so the fact that the word
doesn't exist doesn't necessarily mean
that the concept doesn't exist sure
or the problem even without the concept
true but um there's a recent study that
was done at UCLA where they in healthy
controls they induced certain emotion
emotional states and then what they did
is they had people label the emotion the
act of labeling one's emotion which is a
cognitive method right already distance
oneself from the emotion state oh I'm
angry there's an awareness and there's a
just labeling distance oneself so that
is a form of emotion regulation just
using language in that way so in one way
I would go the opposite can we actually
become more skillful and identifying
subtle subtle subtle emotional states be
adverse early and then cognitively and
then apply a more refined vocabulary to
identify those and label them so but
it's true with even when we don't have a
label people still experience things but
then they just don't have a there's not
a consensus on a word that I would use
to communicate that yeah
how long after the MBSR training did you
measure your subjects how long after the
MBSR training about a week or two after
completing the mindfulness program and
so that would be kind of the immediate
effects of having just completed what
we're doing now is we're following
people for at least a year after
completing therapy because this raises a
good point learning often occurs
consolidates over time and there's even
evidence that uh two three or four
months later people will actually get it
even after completing a course or if
they're even psychotherapy yeah you
presented the limbic system as a
reactive system but isn't it also an
active system that seeds negative
thoughts and emotions say it does is it
also an active system that that seeds
things in the in the in the cognitive
part of the brain or not sees know yet
so the limbic the Levant system is a
distributed set of nodes which has been
associated with emotional states and
specifically a motion detection so like
you watch a disgusting film clip there's
this limbic system there are parts of it
like the anterior insula Megillah that
will um when something salient Kazan it
will be more active so in motion
detection but also when you when you do
a mood induction emotion generation
seeing will not doesn't occur in the
limbic although the seating oh seating
as in generating yes so then also
there's generation of emotion not
exactly the same set there's a subset of
regions like sub general anterior
cingulate and amygdala are associated
with generating emotion when you
actually ask people to there's a study
when you ask healthy people to generate
sad mood or people with current major
depression to generate to enhance the
sad mood there's some reliable areas
that are associated with increasing and
those have actually become targets of
direct brain stimulation studies right
now with surgery in fact it's a little
controversial but yeah
in the functions that you mentioned are
learned in childhood like executive
function and some of those better other
some that adults can learn better than
others are there some that that the
brain development gets to a point where
it's harder to to change an adult stage
as opposed to others yeah so as a
general principle the older the more
that we're alive the longer we're alive
the in general there's less plasticity
so much so you can take a three-year-old
and take out the entire left hemisphere
and all the functions that were
supposedly instantiated in the left
hemisphere transfer there's beautiful
amazing I mean we human animals are
amazing and that functionality can shift
across brain matter so they're they're
even examples of people who were born
with only one hemisphere and only later
in their teens do they ever get an MRI
that showed oh my gosh hemisphere is
gone and they seem almost 100% normal
so it's beautiful plasticity but as we
get older we become a rigid as we become
older cortex becomes thinner one study
that a cross-sectional study that was
done by Sarah Lazar showed that cross
sectional rights not prospective cross
sectional they found that people longer
people who reported being meditators for
more years had less cortical thinning
compared to age matched people who
didn't do any meditation so that was
really exciting and interesting but its
cross-sectional correlational which is
you also have to take that with a grain
of salt so having said that there also
there are a huge interest in neural
plasticity right now but it doesn't seem
to be present in the entire brain but
only portions of it so there are limits
that people have to train their
attention that count might be
constrained by genetic what might be
constrained by life experience but also
constrained by not having trained it so
I wouldn't say you can take somebody who
has early stage Alzheimer's and be able
to train that away
not even close but we can harness our
attention and if you're sitting with
somebody who's done a lot a lot a lot a
lot of practice you can feel it it's
it's palpable and you can measure it
which is important too
