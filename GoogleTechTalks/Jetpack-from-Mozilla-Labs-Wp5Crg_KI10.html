presentation I ever had to give do you
guys know who's a tranny's like Jonathan
Zittrain grote the future of internet
how to stop it it turns out he was
talking right before me and so I'd
emailed him and he's like one of my my
heroes sort of on the same level as
Lawrence Lessig it's like oh I see
you're talking is like yep and I
practicing it so it's like oh great now
now I have to practice so this is about
sort of conversational computing it's
about answering the question of how when
we want to start modifying the web and
how when we want to get rid of the lots
of the interface elements that that sort
of compromise our browser how do we make
this happen so at the very beginning um
how many of you have been editing a
document you finish it up it's important
you could close and it says are you sure
you want to quit and you're like of
course I want to click and you hit the
like the quit button and like the split
second later like a father like I am I
didn't mean to do that he just lost all
of your work like yeah I'm assuming the
people who raised their hands did it and
everybody else that didn't raise their
hands is just embarrassed to admit it so
the point I want to make is that it's
not your fault I'm going to come back to
exactly why it's not your fault but it's
not your fault because our computers
don't work the way people do and
therefore as we sort of move forward um
we get interfaces which force us to have
things like this right and this is word
where you just turn everything on I
don't know if you guys know this but
ninety percent of the feature requests
for features in word are in fact for
features that are already in word and
it's just really hard to find all that
functionality why is it hard and wider
interfaces look like this why is it that
when we actually let our browsers
extensions go while that we just get
toolbar after toolbar after fubar well
it's because we're missing something we
have an incredibly generative method of
communication
in fact it's probably the thing that
makes us distinctly human and that's
language and in the headlong rush away
from the command line we've gotten rid
of language so we're we're tying
ourselves at the mouth we are not being
human so here's here's an example of
adding language back in so here we want
I want to figure out what the weather is
in San Francisco so I can just open it
up and type check weather in San
Francisco it pulls up it's very similar
to the way google searches work although
it happens in real time and I can just
type in F if I want to to see it in
Fahrenheit or I don't actually have to
type everything out I can just type CH e
bath and then it'll it'll look up the
weather in in bath um in in Fahrenheit
or sorry in Celsius so it's both very
fast to use because you can create your
own shortcuts but it's also incredibly
easy to learn because you just type what
you want to do so with google you type
we want to find we typically you type
you what you want to to do but that's
fine language seems pretty cool but to
be truly global you have to first be
truly local it's fine that we're talking
about sort of extensibility in english
but that doesn't help people who live in
taiwan or live in denmark and so what
we've been figuring out how to do
recently spent the last couple of months
sitting at how do we create grammars
which are extensible to other languages
so that you can have ubiquity work in
japanese that you can have it work in
portuguese you can have it work in Dutch
and the really cool thing is that
programming isn't actually needed to do
this so we do a lot of natural language
processing the problem that's what
language is processing though is that
it's impossible at least in current
technology and certainly not fast enough
so we cheap left and right this is
really one of those things where you're
a magician and you're saying like here
pick any of these three cards but but
pick this one right we
that all the time so we use the fact
that we know what your context is what
page you're looking at we know that you
are really interested in actions that
are a very verb centric so we we can
parse those things out so for instance
when we're parsing Japanese we don't
actually have to look for all the space
breaks which you normally have to do
when you're doing natural language
parsing of languages that don't have any
spaces instead we can look for the
particles and we can look for the verbs
and so we can actually get very fast
natural language processing and page and
space splitting for for these languages
by just avoiding the problem entirely
and so it's cool is that all these
languages and we're now work I think in
in five or six languages have been
contributed by third-party folks people
out in the community they don't know how
to program don't know how to do NLP and
yet are able to add their own languages
pretty quickly so we're really really
excited about that so then we come to
the other problem with the web and
that's that tasks are disjointed and
information is really far apart so to
give a really concrete example of this
and something that I think we're looking
forward to solve is that I here i am on
a page I would like to translate some of
this text so here are the steps one
select the text to copy the text three
open a new tab for translated search
will translate five view the search
results six choose a service seven paste
in your text aight choose a language
nine click translate ten read the
translation 11 close the new tab and 12
try desperately to regain your train of
thought right now multiply across all
the things you do on the web some point
here is no wonder we have a digital
divide right no wonder we have people
that don't know how to use computers or
claim that their computer illiterate
because just to do something as simple
as that the number of cognitive steps
you had to make the number of leaps you
had to go through to figure out what you
wanted to do was immense
um and I think the only way to start
really combating this problem is by
taking the tape off of our mouths and
coming back to saying just say what you
want to do so in ubiquity and I think
sort of as it's the future of the web
goes on we have something called task
fox which is making its way into firefox
37 or for something like that is you
just want to start taking that
simplicity of the google box and
applying it to verbs so in this case
what i'd like to be able to do is if i'm
here on the page I'd like to Mabel just
make a selection and type translate this
it figures out what this means I hit
return and there we go it's been
translated that's the sort of simplicity
I think you should come to the web and
as Steve was talking about just a second
ago as we start making the web go from
this static thing that you view and even
a web two point oh when you have a web
which is customized to you we have web
pages that are customized to you what
you really want though our services that
work anywhere on the web their
customized to you but we know that the
GUI model does not scale so we have to
have something else so you can start
doing more interesting things here so
now I can actually just say translate
this to Russian hit return it'll
translate it to Russian what this
enables is what i like to call task
centric computing and i have a more
catchy term for this later called youth
center computing but there's there's a
sort of a fundamental design mantra here
and that is every time we as designers
force our users to think about how they
do something and not what they want to
do we have failed and this is a metric
that whenever we design at mozilla we
apply very tightly because otherwise
you're making people think about their
tool and not their object it's sort of
the equivalent of saying like you have
to think about how to use a shovel which
way to rotate the handle to be able to
dig a hole if you have to do that you
wouldn't actually be able to dig a hole
soon we sort of take this task centric
thing too
the logical conclusion you want to just
be able to start doing things really
fast so here we go this is what you
Bickley looks like in in real life I
just translated back to english i'm
going to say highlight this text i'm now
selecting the whole thing and i'm going
to say email this thing to jano now a
couple cool things are going on here
it's getting closer and closer to the
web being about me and about being me
centric which has I've said email this
to John oh so one it's done this too and
interpolated it too we have email an
email in this case says like hey what do
you do for email it you don't say gmail
or yahoo mail or god forbid hotmail um
it looks at the websites you use it goes
through your places database and it says
huh I see that aiza uses Gmail all the
time so with no setup with really smart
defaults it knows what email means and
finally John oh because we're the
browser we know who all of your contacts
are we can read your gmail contacts we
can raid you read your facebook contacts
and we can do it in a privacy sensitive
way because it never goes off to a
server it's all staying local and so
when i type jano it knows john owes
email address so when I hit return it
actually goes ahead and makes that email
this is sort of like the ultimate task
centric computer and computing system
and what does this drive for what's like
the fundamental thing that we're looking
at here they were trying to save um it's
not really time although time is a big
thing we're safe it's not really
efficiency although this is highly
efficient it's that your train of
thought is sacred and every time we
derail that train of thought again as
designers we failed
you
this is something i think google can be
particularly good at we have a set of
synonyms in there I'm sorry I should
repeat the question if I don't for
translate if I if you don't know the
exact words to use does it help is their
way of solving that problem and at the
moment I don't think turn into would
work but I can't remember the things
besides translate maybe make sense of
but because we know we're doing verbs we
can have a big list of synonyms and even
better if there was sort of a
server-side look up well then you can do
the thing where you map all these people
type this thing in the end they went to
doing translate so now we have
statistical model of A to B and you know
it just becomes a matter of data being
ten times smarter than algorithms so
right now it's a little bit finicky
although people don't generally have too
much of a problem in fact what we've
discovered in user testing is that
especially elderly people really like
this because they no longer after thing
like what is that little icon with a
broken coffee mug do that spell check
why right instead they can just remember
spell check and it turns out that that
mapping is much easier so one give you
another example this is one of my
favorite one which is that if you want
to email a restaurant to a friend well I
can't even add a map just a length right
and it's 2009 which is just sort of sad
so how do we want to do this now now i'm
going to switch over to using yahoo mail
um I'm gonna make a selection here uh
witness oops don't do that oh no no come
back um
there we go um i'm gonna select this
address oh yeah in san francisco which
you haven't been to should all go it's
phenomenal um i type map this I zoom in
using using google maps and I've hit
enter and it's inserted the map directly
into my email which is sort of cool
because one this is google maps finally
working together with yahoo which
hopefully you won't like send people
after me for but that's really cool
because all the sudden is we didn't have
to wait for yahoo to go implement a
particular feature we got it immediately
right we don't ever have to wait for
developers to add features this is what
i think steve was talking about a little
bit when he said like how do we start
making the web really personal and
customizable is that the web is about
you and the things you want to do and
not the way that the developer set it up
but we can go a lot further here um
don't by the way I talked to to the
Gmail team a little bit and asking them
has anybody here on the Gmail team about
why you guys didn't actually have this
sort of functionality in in gmail
because it seems to be a fairly common
use case and the answer is that I guess
it wasn't as common as we thought it
wasn't so you guys instead added
emoticons that's that's cool so let's
say I'm sending this email to to a
friend that's visually impaired what I'd
like to be able to do is use the Edit
command in this case and a guy named
Jacob wrote this command for ubiquity
and it essentially is a full image
editor that just works by you select an
image type edit image and it goes so
right now I'm inverting an image click
done and there we go so we now have just
edit an image in place when I hit Send
it'll go off to the other person so we
think this is really really cool so what
does this do this change people from
being sort of helpless and as we know
from the study of happiness it's
helplessness which makes people feel the
most depressed and we try to make them
in control so that's what we call you
center computing and on the flip side
we're looking at how does this affect
developers how does this sort of
ties the ability to develop so right now
if you want to create a cool piece of
functionality you have to make a
destination website first right or you
make a service which other people build
on top of but you really need that
destination website to have people come
and this is we see startups doing this
all the time where they have a feature
instead of a website and they try to
build a start-up and it of course
inevitably tanks so if instead we can
abstract the idea of functionality out
of any particular web page and let it
float across the entire web then you
don't have to write that entire website
to have something compelling so in this
case there is editing an image and we
didn't have to first have a flow where
you take an image pull it into a website
edited it and try to put it back it just
floats wherever um so it opens up a
whole bunch of sort of new business
models I think for the web and breaks a
whole bunch of old ones which which is
totally fun because all of a sudden page
use doesn't matter as much just as an
aside one of the things I think is crazy
is that we've optimized our websites and
in fact the entire business model the
web to to maximize the number of page
views and so if you go say look at the
new york times they will split up their
articles they'll paginate and the reason
why if you go talk to any of them over
there coy vin it's because they want to
maximize pages which of course is crazy
since if you scroll down they could load
new ads in any way but we're actually
building in bad user experience with
their business models and I know that
that you guys here probably fight with
this all the time as you like well
here's one user experience which is
demonstrably better but is it
demonstrably better enough to get over
the revenue bump that will get for
having an extra page view here so how
can we start changing that I think that
by this sort of switch to functionality
that exists anywhere and then mapping
your revenue stream to matching intent
to action which is what you guys already
do with Adsense so I'm sort of preaching
to the choir and what happens if you can
do this well that means you no longer
have to go through that full app
development cycle to get really cool
functionality and you can have you know
people that work on
the XO in other places it lowers the
barrier to entry for making
functionality but you can share with
your friends and gets back to that sort
of visceral beauty of the old apple to
programming days we could just say plot
x y and having something pop up on
screen except for something that's
functional for friends so i think it
fundamentally democratizes the way that
we're going to write functionality and
software so that means we go from web of
nouns which is what we have right now
static to a web of verbs so one final
thought um and this is the one that sort
of leads into two jet pack and this is
about hack ability in the real world
when i'm looking at something I don't
know this thing um I can hack this in
any way I want which in this case I
don't know I could fold it up a little
bit and you know now no it's an eye
patch well not a very good one um this
is what happens when I don't have enough
sleep all right um in the software world
we can't really do this right if you
have the source code you can modify
something but you can't really modify it
in situ when you see it you can't change
it okay this is a little bit annoying
but in the real world of course we can
always destroy or modify and change so
how can we we bring this in so this is
what the real world looks like right if
you have a cell phone and you don't have
a bluetooth headset this is how you can
hack it up with you know ten cents of of
technology so we want to bring this back
to the web and here's one very simple
example here I am on google and I'm
going to use the Edit Page command and
let's say that I want to compete with
Google personally well I'm just gonna
come here I'm going to delete that and
I'm just going to say jaysus search so
this is a little bit toy of course but
the point being is that oh and this
works by the way you save it you go back
and it'll say that as long as you want
that the web is now yours because you
can modify the web in any way that you
like and this is I think the very
beauty of the web itself is sort of the
infinite canvas is that you can change
it so sort of in conclusion saying
perhaps by adding language by making
things hackable we go from interfaces
which are which work to our tour
availabilities right and our frailties
and instead are a little bit more human
and hence a little bit more humane
that's that was that talk so I think
then I mean we you can have questions by
the way what I forgot to mention when I
was doing this at Ted is that this is
how it's being used by around half a
million people and has a couple thousand
commands that people have written for it
so it's it's a little bit I mean it's
not a toy right if it was a start-up
would be pretty large for Mozilla and
Google it's still pretty small so are
there any questions there before I sort
of start talking about jetpack a little
bit
phrase was
yep
yep
bring this back to us
what you guys doing after I mean um I
mean this is open source right um so
we're working on getting that experience
right in our little purview but we I
mean I think we made a huge social faux
pas right we call this thing ubiquity
and we only work in firefox like if we
were Microsoft and had done that we have
gotten a lot of a lot of tomatoes flung
at us right so I absolutely think that
in the future these things should run
across all platforms I mean on the web
and we already know this is like there's
no sustainable advantage to to any
particular feature and the best features
move I think from one sort of originator
to all all browsers and we're certainly
looking forward to that it'll be an
interesting question to come back to
when we start looking at jet pack stuff
as well
I thought you're going to say it does it
blend that is a good question so um this
actually goes hand in hand with I think
security which is a little bit of an odd
answer but but wait I'll explain with
security a lot of the problems are that
it's really hard to explain technical
problems in people terms so what I sort
of think we should start playing with is
modeling the real world a little bit
more in this case when I have a mother
or a father or an uncle or aunt that
doesn't understand how to go out and buy
a new computer what do they do they will
ask me or the asking nephew or they'll
ask a son somebody or daughter somebody
who really understands technology they
will outsource that decision-making
process right and they will turn the
security issue from a technology problem
into a people problem i will turn the
the computer buying decision from a
technology problem into a people problem
so in security i think we can sort of
play with that same thing and if we know
who your friends are and who you're
close social net is you can start
figuring out interesting ways of
outsourcing and turning these problems
into people problems so how does this
help with discoverability oftentimes we
learn new functionality for say
Photoshop when we walk behind somebody
and we're watching them use Photoshop
you like how did you just do that right
it's sort of the over-the-shoulder
learnability what happens if we start
implementing things like that for for
the web so say somebody did that thing
with the photo manipulation and they
send it to me and there's a little flag
in there a little meta thing that says
oh by the way they use this command to
make it and my computer says oh or the
other person computer says oh I am I
haven't done that before maybe I should
prompt something in an odd annoying
click the sort of way like hey there's
something cool here that just happened
perhaps you want to learn how to do this
thing like yeah of course I do and now a
sudden it's a social problem right it's
a social networking virality problem for
how you make functionality take off and
not a pure sort of interface design
thing so it turns the tech
LG problem into a people problem that
said there's still a lot we can do I
think on the interface front to make
things more discoverable so in Firefox
between 37 and 4 will be adding this
kind of stuff to the awesome bar and as
you type starts typing Google it'll
probably suggest the Google verb for you
and as you start doing particular
actions it'll it'll jump in and be like
ha you might you might mean this and the
final answer to that is that I think
we're also going to have sort of a mouse
based addition or if you select
something on page and it says this is in
a different language well maybe you want
to translate it because we can detect
that or if it's an address maybe you
want to map it because others those are
the sort of the three levels of
answering that question
over the last 20 years they've been lots
of attempts do this for a personal
assistants or
why is this going to work any better
than
the menus
try to do
the work of admins
um one is that we know we're going to
cheat a lot we are not sending out sort
of ivory tower style and saying we're
going to start with NLP and work our way
backwards instead we start with use
cases and we say we want this to work
and we make it happen and we're fine
with that sort of like eighty percent
use case because that's already way
better than you currently are two is
that you know at Mozilla you know where
smaller not-for-profit company and you
guys can actually do something that we
can write you can go out and for your
labs you can you can hire you know
thousands or hundreds at least of the
smartest people out there I missoula we
can't really do that which turns out I
think to be a big benefit to us because
that forces us to work in the open and
work transparently and get other people
involved at a very early stage otherwise
we just we can't compete right not
saying that we're competing percent
we're working together to make the web
better so in this case like when we set
out to do a lot of like the natural
language stuff for how do you transit
across multiple languages we ended up
working with some of the smartest
linguists out there because they just
sort of jumped in and I thought it was
awesome and because it was being used by
real people already with 500,000 users
that adds a certain level of pragmatism
and so I think as far as I know and
please correct me if I'm wrong that
worthy this is the only project has ever
done sort of translatable natural
language processing that non-programmers
can do and participate in and the only
reason why we're able to do that is
because of that focus on pragmatism and
because we cheat and we're fine cheating
a lot because of the context that we
have so that's why I think we're gonna
be able to succeed because we're willing
to cut those corners or not doing it
sort of like ivory tower white room
style
just
the basis
oh yeah
so really simple it's a little bit of
JavaScript you essentially to show a
notification a little thing that pops up
you say ubiquity dot notifications Joe
in fact you can the shortcuts just
display message like hi to you you save
that as a J's file and now it'll run as
ubiquity script if you want to share
with other people you had a link rel
commands equals and you've now shared it
when you go to a page it shows so
perhaps this is a good time to start
showing off a little bit about jet pack
because it took a lot of the lessons we
learned in the back end of ubiquity and
applied it to to making this is going to
be interesting how do I actually do this
and applied it to making extensions
gather windows maybe
alright
alright
so here I am and this is this is jetpack
and this is sort of roughly the
equivalent of sort of the extension
mechanism you guys are working on for
for Chrome although it has has some some
differences so I'm going to come over
here to the tutorial or at least I'm
going to try to come up to the tutorial
and I don't have fire bug installed
that's just pretty good well it's going
to make things a little bit less
interesting let's open up the air
console instead
illegal character nice
this is what happens when you use
development builds
still with the illegal character
hmm
alright
um I think you guys should all just
tweet they're seeing the most amazing
demo ever and that way even if you guys
can't see it you'll make everybody else
jealous that they didn't get to all
right you know what we're going to do
you're going to talk amongst yourselves
and I am going to go start a new profile
that's how this going to happen you're
not talking all right
actually I feel like there should be
something I can do here
I probably entered something incorrectly
somewhere yeah
then probably well I'll try it once more
tutorial okay here we go um so we're
really big into sort of developer organ
onyx and this looks very similar to the
way that that ubiquity scripts work and
our sort of our litmus test here is that
if you can't write an extension in five
minutes or a hello world we've failed as
a platform and you can't do it in one
minute then we're probably on the wrong
foot so here is like the simplest thing
you can do which is to add something to
the status bar in this case I say
jetpack dot status bar dot append and I
just pass it some HTML so I'm actually
going to click the button and now it's
actually run this right in the browser
and you can see if I if I change this to
the bam zip pow try out this code where
we're actually modifying the browser in
real time and let's do something
slightly more interesting here I'm going
to come down and going to say jetpack
status parted pen HTML I'm going to give
it a width and i'm going to say on ready
i'm going to pass in the widget I'm
gonna say this is all jquery in here for
people that don't know when you click on
it I'm going to show a notification that
says booming I'm going to find the
currently focused tab jetpack the tabs
are focused I'm going to get the content
document so here I'm going to find the
body I'm going to change its background
color to blue I'm going to animate its
opacity to half there we go it says boom
down here or I'll just change it to BAM
because i want to show you i have
nothing up my sleeves and when i click
on the button we've actually modified
and what's cool is of course matter
where I go I now have this functionality
I can come back here unlike well
actually that's really annoying so I'll
change this to one
and let's change this back Dwight so now
listen we're trying to get an incredibly
fast prototyping environment for
changing the web to make the web yours
is sort of like taking the idea of
grease monkey and mashing up with
extensions and then giving it all
steroids so let's say I want to do as a
very simple example I want to do some
sort of flash kill application I just
want to get rid of all flash so here
we're actually this is much simpler
thing all I'm saying is that on ready
find the currently focused document find
all the embeds and remove them try out
this code and then when I go to youtube
and yeah that's exactly what I want to
be watching there we go sweet when I hit
boom it just kills it right which turns
out to be incredibly useful how do you
distribute it as as steve was asking
before it's one line of code you just
put link rel jetpack and it works so if
I actually go to jet pack mozilla labs
com and i want to get this sort of fun
functionality here so let's go to the
jetpack demos and now i'm interested in
installing this tab grapher which is a
little acute thing which shows me how i
can what my tab usage over time is i
click you can see that it says this page
contains a jet pack features like
install it please click the right button
so i click it it's been installed
successfully and now as i open up new
tabs you can see that it's graphing it
over time now the cool thing is that if
i come here and look at the source code
right you can see that in fact here is
the link rel right here i go to graph
Jas and here's the source code it's even
on this tiny monitor it's one line or
it's one page of code to do all of that
um because really I'm just I'm
doing some code which updates the graph
I do some hooks that say when the tabs
are open closed in focus to do something
I create the status bar widget and the
one bit of funk funky thing that I'm
doing here is that I have I'm embedding
entire web page into the status bar in
this case status bar HTML and whenever I
add a new thing to the Dom it's just
graphing so what makes this sort of
hoops what makes this fun is that when I
want to come back to I'm a jetpack here
um I can actually instead of having it
be a piece of HTML I can actually just
put ice to go home / / double W at
Google and I've now just embedded all of
google into the status bar right um why
this is useful i'm not entirely sure but
it is sort of fun so that sort of like
the the mentality that we have is just
like if you can do it in a web page you
can now do it in the browser and then we
start a little bit further you can start
saying like well let's let's do things
with libraries so Twitter certainly is
in sort of a core feature we should be
able to import it right now we have jet
pack that lived on Twitter that imports
things and you can just tweet you can
have email notifiers so here's a well
almost one page is like 50 60 lines of
code that is a at gmail com password i
will try desperately not to say out loud
and there we go so in just a very small
amount of code we have a full gmail
notifier which I believe will work when
i click on it so all of a sudden it
starts taking the things that you have
an idea and you can translate it into
changing the browser almost
instantaneously right it it's a much
shorter path and actually this is
something that I think we don't like is
that we started doing fun things with
with audio recording for instance so I'm
going to view the source here
essentially what this does it's a little
bit full of stuff but it adds the
ability to add audio recordings and
annotations to to the browser so the the
interesting things here are that we have
jet packed up future import because
these are things which are so advanced
they're coming from the future which we
stole shamelessly from from Python and
we have audio slide bar and storage
because we haven't finished doing all of
those things we have the ability to play
audio here jetpack the body to play and
then some place down here record we have
jet pack to do is recording and then
stop recording and then record to file
so these things are now sort of built
into to Firefox so when you install it I
can actually go to a page that I like
let's go to Google again actually let's
go to yahoo just just to make things
interesting I'm gonna make an audio
recording which is now according like I
am in your yahoo recording all of your
music I've stopped recording and as you
can see we're on yahoo and there's a
sound here let's give this a go
according like i am in your yahoo
recording all of your music so that's
worked and what sort of fun is because
we have something I mean this is the
slide bars it's like a sidebar but but
more slighty that when I come back to to
yahoo in the few know well apparently
when I my google it does then when i go
to yahoo in the future
apparently didn't do it this time this
thing will sort of say like yes I have
something to show I don't know why I
stopped doing that
no well
I don't know why it's deciding that oh I
know why okay there we go and now when I
come back to yahoo in the future it will
not notify me to change but anyway um
it's sort of like the concept which is
still like within 100 lines of code you
can have full voice annotations for the
web and you could clearly start taking
this to the next step and and sharing
them and doing all sorts of other things
so that's jetpack sort of in the in the
really quick sort of hacky form you can
go download it jetpack the mozilla labs
com and yeah play with it so yeah
yep yep um so I mean there's a lot going
on so one of the like the visions behind
jetpack is the what happens if any
eighth-grader that can write code can
now modify the browser if anybody who
has just a monochrome of ability to use
the web if the browser just was the web
right that's that's the vision and
that's cool because all of a sudden
we've I keep using were democratized but
we have democratized the ability to
write functionality and especially in a
world where in the next 10 years more
people are going to touch the web for
the first time that are online right now
that's really important I remember when
Mozilla in Taiwan just added like one
button which gave you a link to the top
news items for Taiwan we increase the
number of downloads by 2 million pretty
much overnight right so localization in
that sense of functionality is super
important but we'd have a definite
problem and that is this thing is shiny
it's new we don't have to write zool
it's really easy to get involved and
that means that every team looks at
jetpack at Mozilla is sort of like the
Savior like this is their chance to
start again and get everything right but
the second system syndrome like to the
team but one of the things that we know
we need to get right is the security
stuff and so we playing around a lot
with object capability systems right now
in the web there's sort of two security
models there's the you're on a web page
and if you're on the web page all you
can do is what web pages can do which is
pretty limited and a little bit broken
in the sense that when you import I mean
crockford can talk about this way better
than I can but when you import something
it gets all the privileges of the owning
page and you can get owned in horrible
ways and on the flip side you're in
chrome in which case you can do anything
like send all of your horn to your
grandmother which you might thank you
for later I don't know turns on your
grandmother so what we have to do is
figure out some sort of like in between
system and so we're playing around with
object capability systems we've been
working with with the car
here and what we've come up with is
something we call like a flexible
membrane which is essentially the idea
of membranes from from object
capabilities except that the
programmable in JavaScript so we can
iterate really fast and what we'll
probably end up with our systems that
have Auto determined manifests that is
you go use your program and developer
mode for a while it figures out what
sorts of capabilities it needs it
bundles it up as as a manifest and then
we can have people on our gallery site
review the manifest check it against the
functionality and if that looks okay
supply it to the end user with with a
like scary not scary sort of metric the
other cool thing that we're playing with
is the idea that libraries should be
able to have different permissions than
a jetpack writing it so i can write a
jet pack which has no ability to make
network calls but i can import a
reviewed twitter library and that can
make it with a library call but I I mean
so there's some leakage that is bound to
happen as you have to be careful but I
think it starts moving us a long ways
towards something which is a lot more
secure even if you're in chrome because
it showed you right now like even when
you're in chrome space like in the
status bar that's still HTML so we're
not actually doing zool
that's the true um in Jetpack you can't
there is no api to look at files yet
since we it's sort of a little bit
scarier and probably the way we're going
to want to do the record in the future
and actually in the next version of jet
pack those be coming out is that will do
a streaming version and you can modify
the frames as they go by in place which
is more fun anyway oh yes well I think
we're going to have to tackle that
problem eventually are there to the
questions
oh this
so one of the statistics that I was sort
of surprised about is how many users
have Firefox add-ons installed I was
guessing ten percent because we have a
pretty passionate user base that's it's
a lot of works go get an extension it
turns out that at minimum is
thirty-three percent but our estimates
seems to show that it's up higher
towards fifty percent which was
phenomenal I've certainly seen sort of
use cases from from Wow where there's a
big I East hole like a year ago people
starting to switch in droves to Firefox
and you could see people recommend no
script and adblock plus which was
bizarre to me because I I don't use like
adblock plus and yet people are out
there actually using it so I don't
actually think that especially things
like Jetpack have that sort of that that
small one percent use case what we're
going to see is that as people drive
adoption of a really cool new
functionality as more and more people
get involved you know that you get that
power law and you get certainly most of
everything is going to be really bad
functionality or not very useful for the
mass public but they're gonna get those
couple that are really useful we're just
sort of increasing the throughput and
then our job becomes how do we hook
people up to the functionality that they
need so you can imagine this to be the
exact same question is how do you take
bands and hook them up to the audience
that will love them so a lot of this are
going to be think is going to be
collaborative filtering when you go to a
site and you have usage behavior which
matches sort of generic usage behavior
of particular add-ons perhaps we should
start suggesting these things to you
maybe if all of your friends are using
something and use a similar site that
you do then maybe we should suggest that
to you so I think those are going to
start being the interesting cases of how
do we get you the functionality that you
don't know that you want
I mean the answer is yes so ubiquity is
is being ported to to Phoenix and
jetpack certainly as well so you can
just sort of write once and go anywhere
and I think right now I mean we we
talked to the chrome team every once in
a while about sort of like some of the
synergies I just used a horrible word
sorry some of the similarities between
our two platforms and the future we'll
see where as we sort of get further down
both towards the one point those of our
extension platforms where we can
standardize and then I think it's just
sort of run across all browsers because
in the end it should be phenomenal if
you can write a little bit of javascript
in HTML and it just ran everywhere in
all browsers
yeah yep
yep
how can you personally your grandma
right and so this is I think the cool
thing because if we can have instead of
right now we have eight thousand people
yeah eight thousand people that are
active firefox extension developers
which is which is huge actually that's
that's that's a lot and we passed the
1.5 billion i think download mark for
firefox add-ons so there's clearly a
huge market for it but if we can take
that 8,000 people and right now they
have highly specialized knowledge and we
can scale that so that we have 80,000
people riding it or even better 100,000
or maybe even a million given the number
of websites that are out there well then
probably if you as an end user if your
grandmother and as an end user is having
a problem with the site the likelihood
is that somebody else already had that
problem and probably wrote something
which is a decent solution to it so it's
sort of collapsing the space of end user
programming to search right which should
make you guys really happy so I think
that's sort of the division is that once
you have sort of this huge number of
things you have to start being really
smart about how do you then hook up
people to the functionality that they
want because simply thinking like oh I'm
at gmail I really wish it did x well
that's a sort of a dead end thing right
there or even worse i'm at gmail I do
open to things I just sort of find a
clunky what you really want to just sort
of bridge that next step and say well
here's your solution have at
people
oh where I want to be
right so a lot of it I think comes down
to sort of like learning pedagogy and
that is like where we really like the
thing where you can click and edit and
play I get these really really tight
feedback loops and if I'd had Firebug up
you can show that if I go console dot
log and seibel in the jetpacks it'll put
it into Firebug and you can introspect
right there which is which is pretty hot
I think the API is we're trying to write
the api's in such a way that it's fairly
obvious what they do so if you say
jetpack toolbar you're in toolbar land
or for your jetpack the status bar
you're in status bar land so it's not
too bad i think from a developer organ
aam extend point like if you know the
web then it's not too too bad to jump
into here and then we leverage things
like jQuery or dojo so if you already
have your favor and we don't do dojo at
the moment but eventually we're pretty
soon will enable the use of all the sort
of standard libraries so that to modify
the web you can just say you know jquery
dot find me this thing like i did with
the embeds don't remove and it's it's
not too bad right it's not like you have
to go click on things and then figure it
out so i don't really know if that
dancing your question
you said basically you're still
affecting people who are
yes
I mean we're certainly playing around
with that idea most visual IDs are I
mean it's like a WYSIWYG editor they
they're the leaky abstraction is so big
that you end up just getting your feet
really wet but I think in the future
they're going to be use cases which we
discover people do over and over and
over again like writing an IDE to create
toolbars although we want to get rid of
toolbars but that seems reasonable to
make a status bar which it that seems
reasonable to do more complex
functionality man maybe not and so I
mean the cool thing is that because
these jet packs are so easy to write my
guess is that some point soon we're
going to start seeing third party
websites would you go to and be like I
want to satisfy that does this and we
don't have to come up with everything /
AP eyes are pretty enough we build it
they will come which is not really true
but it might be
excellent
thanks very much I like Jetpack and it
gives me a glimpse of something that
maybe in the future could run
cross-browser so we can start building
extensions that would work for everyone
who's on the internet that would be very
cool way of thinking about that is the
the browser should just be part of the
web it should be of the web and then
you're just writing for the web and that
just happens to run across all browsers
because you know it's just a bribe
product of the future all right thanks
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
