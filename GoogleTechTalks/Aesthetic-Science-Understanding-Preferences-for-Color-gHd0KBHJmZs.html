pleasure to introduce Steve Steve Palmer
Steve Palmer was the first person who
has ever told me anything about
perception I didn't know anything before
i started at berkeley and I learned
everything from him I've been here for
many many years and one of the most
common questions that people come to me
with is your psychologist don't you guys
know what kind of colors people like I
dislike what kind of color combinations
of what arrangements of objects are good
for the page a bed for the page and the
truth is that very few psychologists
study that those kinds of topics because
I don't know why partly because most of
us perceive them as borean and partly
because there is no money in it so Steve
is one of the few who could us he's
probably most famous for his work in
vision science and a very famous
textbook called from photons to
phenomenology and I don't know what else
to say and he's a professor at UC
Berkeley and he's teaching classes in
perception if anybody is interested oh
that's a pleasure to be here Wow
everything just works it's great you
know it doesn't happen this way
universities so I want to tell you about
the research I've been doing this
research for about a year year and a
half now and it's a topic is aesthetic
science I think there is or can be a
science of aesthetics there isn't really
one but I think there can be and to some
degree i'm trying to get people
interested in doing this sort of thing
and i'm going to talk about essentially
three different research problems or
related research problems actually one
of which is people's perceptions of
color and color combinations in
particular another is about people's
preferences for spatial arrangements of
objects in a side of a rectangular frame
and the third one is actually about the
structure of a rectangular frame itself
some sort of these questions are all
sort of I think
as being sort of basic science questions
that you would ask if you were if there
were such a thing as a science of
aesthetics so I will introduce you to
those strands of research together with
a brief introduction which is supposed
to be motivating because when you talk
to University audiences about this kind
of stuff there isn't anybody who's
already motivated to study aesthetics
nobody does it so the first thing that
you want to do is find out what it is
that you're trying to study so what is
aesthetics you go to the dictionary and
it doesn't really help very much you get
these this long gobbledygook like thing
with the ugly the sublime the comic etc
that's the one that kills me as you go
in your dictionary and you find etc you
know you've you're not done the second
the second definition is a little bit
cleaners right the study of the mind and
emotions in a relation to the sense of
beauty that sounds great night neat and
tidy but of course then you go and look
up beauty and then the etceteras start
appearing again shape color sound etc a
meaningful design or pattern or
something else right so I think there's
a fundamental reason why you don't find
good dictionary definitions of this and
that is because it's not possible
anymore than it's possible to give a
dictionary definition of what redness or
pain or anything like that is and that's
because basically aesthetic is a
phenomenological concept it's something
about our experience and you can't
define it to somebody who doesn't have
those experiences it's really we can try
to point to it using words but as far as
actually getting a definition from the
words it's it's very difficult so what
I'm going to mean I don't have a good
definition of aesthetics but I think we
all know what it means it's this
analysis the experiential dimension it's
anchored on one invite oh wow yeah
that's great it works and anchored at
the other end by yuck that's awful so
this is the motivational part to try to
get people to believe that aesthetics is
very
an important part of almost everybody's
mental lives it's most obviously related
to our perception and appreciation of
the fine arts so painting photography
these are photographs actually by the
famous black and white photographer me
one of the reasons I got into this stuff
is because in fact I'm a photographer
and I want to understand why it is I
like the pictures I like why I take the
pictures I take and how those things
might be understood in a scientific way
sculpture of course over the ages and
architecture and not exactly a fine art
but one where everybody takes it for
granted that aesthetics is part of what
makes great architecture great but
there's lots of other places where
aesthetics is important and in what we
do how we spend money what we where we
like to spend our time we go to see
movies when you know they're
particularly aesthetically appealing
movies we pick out our clothes because
we think that they are aesthetically
appealing at least on us and we spend
enormous amounts of money trying to find
things that will produce aesthetically
appealing presentations to the world in
industrial design there are certain
designs that are generally acknowledged
to be particularly appealing
aesthetically even where we go on
vacations is very often driven by just
how beautiful it is and for you guys
this is a new page in the in the
presentation website design actually it
was very difficult for me to find what I
consider to be aesthetically appealing
website designs I looked at hundreds of
them I even went to websites you know I
did a Google search on award-winning
websites most of them they were very
ugly they flash a lot and they have you
know neat kind of graphic dynamic
effects and things but they aren't
really aesthetically appealing I find
that most of the ones are in fact
websites that are related to work that
is of artists or art-related
objects but that's not all of course
maybe most important of all how we spend
our time looking around the world what
we fixate on what we track and so forth
is largely determined by aesthetics now
I want to warn you that I'm don't mean
that aesthetics is the same thing as art
in fact it turns out that an awful lot
of the people things that people find
aesthetically appealing most of which
I've or many of which I've just alluded
to are in fact not art I mean art is
restricted to things that are man-made
and and usually that are intentionally
designed and created to be art but
there's all sorts of things to which we
have positive aesthetic experiences that
are not art so supposing that you
believe that aesthetics is an
interesting and important thing to try
to understand is it possible that we can
come to a scientific understanding of it
well a lot of people scientists in
particular would think not because in
fact science is objective and aesthetics
is subjective science is lawful
aesthetics is whimsical science is
clear-cut aesthetics is fuzzy I don't
have that on the slide but and we have
all of these sort of aphorisms like
there's no accounting for taste beauty's
in the mind of the beholder all of which
seems to imply that there's no such
thing or there can't be any such thing
as a science of aesthetics but I want to
convince you that that's not the case
and when I talk about taking an approach
to aesthetics there's really two basic
different ways you can do it a sort of
prescriptive approach which is the one
you usually find where an art critic or
an hour theorist says what it is that
you should like for example when we get
to the section about color I'll talk
about you know some of the ideas where
essentially the color theorists have
said what it is that people should find
pleasing rather than what they actually
do find pleasing and the alternative
being in an empirical approach
which is what we do we try to find out
with everyday people that is to say you
know by and large undergraduate at
Berkeley what they like aesthetically
when you say you know tell us which one
of these things you like better there's
actually a third approach that has has
become popular recently called neuro
aesthetics how many people have heard of
neuro aesthetics okay then I won't say
anything about it not enough of you have
it's not worth paying much attention to
so I'm going to tell you first of all
about the spatial composition a project
these are this is my lab and the people
working on this are primarily Jonathan
Gardner and myself the approach we take
is a psychophysical approach we show
people a pair of pictures like these two
and say which one do you like better
aesthetically okay so how many people
prefer the one on the left raise your
hands how many people prefer the one on
the right only a couple okay no there's
a reason for that okay and what we're
trying to find out is why that is all
right so actually as simple as this
comparison is it's actually too
complicated for our experiments because
I've not only changed the position of
whistlers mother but also the photograph
and her position relative to the to the
wall behind her has changed and so forth
so we do these experiments using what's
called a to alternative forced-choice
task in which we show them a pair of
pictures that contain just one object
and a ground line and in fact this
should disabuse you of the idea that i'm
studying anything that's remotely
connected to art per se because none of
these pictures that you're going to see
or anything close to art nevertheless
people have aesthetic preferences they
can tell you which one they like better
we have never had a single subject just
said what do you mean which one do I
like better hasn't happened so they do
it and they do it relatively quickly and
easily they have a gut level reaction to
these sorts of things and we have
impressed the left key if they like the
left one better and the right
ki if they like the right one better so
the first experiment we actually have
this single object at one of seven
different positions and one of two
different orientations that is facing
left or facing right and we give them
all possible pairs of pictures
containing the same object so we're
interested in spatial composition we're
not interested in people's preferences
for content so you might like teapots
better than you like rocking horses
that's not something we want to study so
in our experiments teapots are always
compared with pictures of teapots all
right and I should say the objects that
we use were defined by in this
experiment we had two objects at each
different aspect ratio from sort of tall
skinny things to sort of short fat
things because we thought that was going
to matter it mattered a little bit but
not very much so I'm not going to tell
you about it in the interest of time so
in this object in this experiment we had
the same object compared with itself
either the two objects two pictures were
facing in the same direction as they are
going across the rows or they could be
in the same position and facing in
opposite directions and we basically had
people do all possible comparisons so
the one on the left was compared with
all of the ones to the right of it those
are the so-called same facing
comparisons and we also had the
comparisons where they were in the same
position and facing in the opposite
direction and in each case we asked
people which one do you like better so
if we look at all this if we look at the
grand average over these data we're
looking here applauding the percentage
of the time that any given this has
collapsed over those different objects
the percentage of the time where the
image with the where the objects are
presented on the left most position say
is how often is it chosen compared with
all of the other ones we're looking to
the grand average over that okay and
what we find is this very regular curve
with a maximum in the center we call
this the setter bias where people like
to see the object by and large in the
center of the frame
but this of course is averaging over
both the left facing in the right facing
conditions so let's look at those data
here we have now the green sorry the
blue the blue ones are the left facing
objects and the red ones are the right
facing objects and what you find is that
for the right facing objects there's
still a center by ask people like it to
be in the center but if it's off to the
left they like it just as well if it's
facing inward we call this the inward
bias because this particular interaction
here where the right word facing ones
are preferred on the left side of the
screen and the left facing ones who
preferred on the right side of the
screen is a bias towards wanting to see
these objects facing inward rather than
facing outward and it's a very robust
effect we can also see this in the
opposite facing condition so here we've
got a pair of pictures in which the
object says in the same position they
have to pick between one of these two
and say which one they like better and
there's a very strong bias which is the
one there there's a very strong bias
toward picking the one that is facing
inward and to the right but of course it
changes as you go across the across the
screen so that by the time you get to
the rightmost position people much
prefer the one that's facing to the left
yeah
total number of subjects it's something
on the order of between 10 and 15 these
are very easy effects to get you get
them very quickly how many well you can
probably figure it out if you it's the
combinations of all possible pairs of
those things that I showed you yes yes
yeah this is average yeah the objects I
don't want to tell the difference
between the two ends of a dog but what
about a teapot well there's certainly
I'd say a front end of the teapot I
think if you asked a hundred people
which end was the front end of a teapot
it would be a hundred 20 it's the part
where the where the liquid comes out now
it's interesting actually that you
actually handle the other part and I
mentioned in a minute when we when we
asked people to take photographs of
objects that you might expect haven't
gotten to this yet but there's also the
third bias that we find is a rightward
bias and sometimes as big and sometimes
it's little I think that it's an
individual difference of some sort maybe
having to do with handedness and
hemispheric lateralization here you can
see it right there at the center
position there's a slight tendency to
prefer the one that's that's facing to
the right but it's not very strong in
the photographic experiment it's
actually quite strong yeah
yeah we are trying to sort out let me
say first of all about this right word
bias I don't know what everybody like
focuses in on the right word bias wow
it's really small it's it's very
variable you find it sometimes you don't
find at other times in this experiment
it's not there with you know this number
of subjects there have been it's the one
thing about sort of spatial composition
that has been studied a fair amount
before the things that we've done they
typically take pictures or famous
paintings or whatever and show them a
mirror reversed and and you find
differences and they do seem to be
related to handedness and they do seem
to be related also to the direction in
which your language reads there are
those kinds of things we only have 10 or
15 subjects we can't study those things
and actually I'm not particularly
interested in and in studying those
things like I said compared to these
other effects it's tiny yeah they just
don't care uh well if we do we usually
throw them out there aren't many um I
don't think we ever have in the spatial
stuff we've had in the color thing we've
had a couple of subjects who will
sometimes seem not to care about
anything and then they're not color
blind but they just seem not to care
very unusual yeah for these experiments
they're just undergraduates at Berkeley
who are taking some sort of a
introductory psychology class and
required to take a certain number of
hours to do a certain number of hours of
experiments in the color experiments
they're paid subjects and we get them
from a some campus service that finds
subjects so that includes older adults
and people from sort of lots of
different walks of life but but the
first two sets of projects that i'm
going to talk about their berkeley
undergraduates
well you know they're probably they're
mainly freshman and sophomore so a lot
of them haven't declared yet there's a
pretty wide group that takes
introductory psychology but of course
there's probably more people who are
going to be psychologists or social
scientists than there are people who are
going to be physicists and
mathematicians yeah in this experiment
no but but I'll get to that what you get
is a is a function that just shows the
center bias and it's more sharply peaked
than what i showed you before is the
center bias that's because we only got
it this way by averaging it over it in
order to squeeze this into an hour which
i'm probably not going to make any way
i've had to leave out experiments like
that of that particular one okay so we
talked about the right facing bias so
this is a very well controlled
experiment and the question we wanted to
ask next was well does it show up if we
actually give people more choice we do
the open-ended task which is give people
a camera and ask them to take pictures
and we ask them to take pictures of
three everyday objects a teapot a tape
dispenser in a steam iron okay and we
put it on a turntable and we let them
turn the objects orientation anyway they
wanted to and for the first picture that
they took we said take the most
aesthetically pleasing picture you can
anything you want to doesn't matter and
then after that after they done that for
each of the these three objects then we
asked them to take some more constrained
photographs she's okay take the most
aesthetically pleasing picture you can
but the object has to face to the right
of center it doesn't have to face
directly to the right it could be
slanted but just right ish or left ish
okay so when you look at what we did in
this case was we actually measured the
center the position of the center of the
object within the frame when people took
these photographs and then we
constructed a histogram essential
Lee of where the center of that object
was we had seven equal size positional
bins and just looked at the number of
pictures within which the center fell in
those in that position and here we see
our old friend this is the center bias
now in this case there was a big
rightward bias that when in that first
picture when people could do anything
they wanted to they actually had the
object facing right eighty percent of
the time and this actually includes both
the steam iron and a teapot where you
would typically use your right hand it
would actually just frequency wise if
most people are right-handed would tend
to be facing left most of the time that
you see it and yet the in this case
there seems to be a strong right word
facing bias but like I said there are
other experiments in which it doesn't
even show up if we look at the
constrained cases where people are told
to make it face right or deface face
left we find the same inward bias that
we found before they like to see the
right facing objects beyond the left
side of the screen and the left facing
objects beyond the right side of the
screen so um if we go back to the tasks
i started with this to alternative force
choice and we want to you know move up
to a more complex situation that's got
like two objects in the same frame one
of the problems that you run into is
this kind of combinatorial explosion
which is if you independently have these
two objects in say just seven different
positions you find out that in order to
do all the comparisons you need 2500
trials I understand that this doesn't
big numbers don't bother you guys at
Google maybe that's why you're called
Google but it bothers us a lot because
you can't get people in there to stay
for 2,500 of these trials so we look for
some other ways where we might get some
interesting data and we develop this
slider task where we put in a single
object and then we give them control
over the position of the object they
I the mouse left and right they can try
at any place where I want to and when
they get it where they want to they just
press the button and then we again take
the center that we measure the center of
the position of that object and again we
can do the same kind of thing where we
plot these histograms what's the
frequency and here these are actually
right facing these are forward facing
objects whoever was it asked that
question these are symmetrical objects
and when they're symmetrical you get
this very strong bias to have a place in
the center of the frame and it's very
sharply tuned I'm actually kind of
surprised these data came out even more
beautifully than the others if you give
them an object where it's facing to the
left are facing to the right you find
the inward bias again very strongly and
in this particular experiment in
addition to asking them to put it in the
best possible position we also asked
them to put it in the worst possible
position so they did the same thing they
slid it around and and what you find is
essentially the inverse of the functions
you found before that the forward-facing
objects they tend to put it over on the
side but they didn't care which side
whereas for the right facing objects and
left facing objects they put it on the
side but they put the right objects on
the right side so they're facing out of
the frame and so forth the only thing
that's kind of unfortunate here is that
little blip in the center and I think
that that's probably due to a couple of
people who take in a photography class
or in our class and somebody had told
them you don't put the object in the
center of the frame right they knew the
rule so they used the rule what's the
worst possible position their teacher
had told them I think that's what it is
because by and large people really like
it to be in the center of the frame so
the next experiment we wanted to go see
if we could go beyond the to the one
object case without the combinatorial
pain yeah
somebody thinks that's right I mean
somebody somebody think somebody who's
in a position of power or authority I
think has decided these things and and
says it and and it gets codified in a
way well I'll get two i'll get to that i
mean i think that what make compositions
interesting is when we start violating
these expectations these biases that i'm
studying now are sort of ground
background stuff and in many cases if
you want to do something interesting you
have to violate those expectations in a
sort of interesting way yeah
I don't know I mean you have to find
that out you sort of have to study what
is that our teachers do and and what
stuff already exists i mean there's this
problem there's the turtles all the way
down problem which is you know the
infinite regress that you get into
because well i like it because that's
what i've seen right i don't know you'd
have to go back and look at the cave
paintings i guess and try to figure out
you know why they put them where they
put them on there in the cave so we did
in this experiment was you took a
configuration of objects multiple
objects but we treated them as if they
were one object and we picked
configurations that had a structure they
were always a taller object on one side
and a gradient size gradient to the
other side where they were smaller such
that it formed this kind of triangle
which then i would say and if you do
look at what people say about these
things that it it points to the right or
it leads the eye to the right rather
than to the left and to the extent that
that's the case and these principles
that we were talking about before we're
general we should find similar kinds of
effects with where people put this
configuration of objects so this
experiment was done with exactly the
same design actually as the first one
where the configuration of objects could
be in five different positions and it
could be facing left or right or
whatever and what we find is pretty much
the same thing that we found before that
is to say people prefer the
configuration when it's leading to the
right to be on the left side of the
screen and and vice versa the same sort
of inward bias one other thing that
these data show us is that it's not that
the center of mass wants to be near the
center because these two configurations
would be in the same position because
their centers line up the center of mass
is farther away here and in fact that's
the one that people prefer when you give
them a choice between those two so um
you know if we're going to do like what
it is the photographer does when they
frame photographs then we have to worry
about things like vertical buzu
shahnaz well and also zoom right how big
objects are in the frame and so that's
what we've started to do we haven't
gotten terribly far on that here's the
first experiment that we did with
vertical position and here yeah it's a
little bit more complicated because you
have to worry about where the ground
line is going to be and you have to
worry about prospective effects on the
bowl you know do you show the lip of the
bowl or whatever but the important thing
is that or the most obvious thing is
that you the center bias no longer holds
here that people like the position
vertically to be much closer to the
bottom than they do to the middle or the
top and we don't know why this is yet I
suspect that there are multiple things
going on that this is sort of a
combination of a center bias because you
want to have the information you know
toward the center of the frame combined
with some principles like something
about stability or balance that that
this picture down here where the the
solid part of the thing is closer to the
bottom seems more gravitationally stable
it may also be that actually the top of
the figure the top of the object is kind
of like the front of the object that
people want the top of the object to be
near the center so we're going to study
that but you can make objects that are
tall and thin and stuff like that and
find out whether that matters or not is
there a question oh so where are we
going with this particular line of
research like I said we're going to look
at how big the object is in the frame
and and whether this depends on the size
of the object I mean it may be that if
it's a really big object that people
liked it to be fill up more of the frame
that if it's a really small object we
would like to know what kinds of
expertise effects there are and ideally
we'd like to know you know where those
things come from but just for starters
we want to find out whether trained
artists people who have been to art
school have different preferences from
the untutored people that we typically
study and whether there are cultural
differences or what kind of cultural
differences there are there's a fair
amount of
recent stuff that suggested that in
Western cultures we like to focus to
zoom in on like one object more and that
in Eastern societies in Japan and China
that they're much more likely to take a
more distant perspective to have more
context around it that this is part of a
sort of more general cognitive
difference between Eastern and Western
culture but they've never really studied
it with kind of well controlled
well-defined images like the ones that
we've been using and another thing I
like to find out that we're going to
head toward is why these biases happen
it could be Turtles all the way down
it's just that that's the way people
have always done pictures before but my
guess is that it's actually more that
the conditions under which people find
these things aesthetically pleasing
these biases are actually aligned with
sort of conditions for optimal
perception I mean if you think about it
that you want the objects to be in the
center of the frame or with the most
important part of it near the center of
the frame the front of the object the
top of the object it sounds like there's
almost an aesthetic heuristic which is
you know to try to make the most
important information most easily
perceivable in the frame and there's a
hint of this somebody actually scooped
me on an experiment of my very own a
long time ago Eleanor Rosch and I did
this work on canonical perspective
showing that people perceive objects
best from these particular hybrid
perspectives we call them canonical
perspectives and recently Mike Macbeth
showed that in fact these same
perspectives are judged to be more
aesthetically pleasing than other ones
as well so this is an instance where
what seems to be optimal for perception
also seems to be aesthetically most
pleasing but I think it's probably a
general principle and to do something
interesting sort of aesthetically
interesting very often what you have to
do is violate some of these things but
for some good reason because of course
you know what these kinds of biases are
going to do I mean I think you could use
these biases to maybe create
an automated photographed cropping
program or something like that where
somebody could indicate what the object
of interest is and then you could write
a program that would you know crop it in
a reasonably aesthetic way aesthetically
pleasing way but it's not going to get
you great art and I think a lot of what
happens is that you need to violate
violate expectations so here's a really
bad picture for all kinds of reasons but
the one that I want to focus on is that
the object is like facing out of the
frame assembly facing out of the frame
he's actually walking out of the frame
right and yet it was at least somebody
thought a aesthetically appropriate
thing it was actually the cover of Time
magazine but it works because of the
context in which it appeared it was
right after bush and his party had lost
the election for all the good that did
anybody and it was trying to indicate
sort of his the lone range of status
syria's walking I should maybe say
surging to the right on this cover but
the important thing is that the
composition the way in which it's been
violated fits the message that's
intended to be conveyed and this is
another thing that actually can be
studied and we're going to be studying
looking at how people's aesthetic
impressions of things change as a
function of say what the title of a
picture is yeah hmm that's right but the
focus yeah and and they weren't going to
publish it and this balance is that to a
degree and so forth but I think the
important thing is that the picture
itself the first thing that strikes you
when you look at this at this magazine
is not the time banner at the top which
is always there or this thing here is
the fact that Bush is halfway out of the
picture right so there are other things
about this design that ameliorate or
offset that compositional aspect but in
fact i think the crucial thing is that
there's a good reason for doing it
okay the second project I want to tell
you about is one in which we're doing
work on framing the frame that is what's
the internal structure I be all most all
two-dimensional visual graphic art like
websites and and as well as paintings
and so forth takes place inside of a
rectangular frame and the question is
what is the structure of that frame and
shouldn't that have some influence on
where what spatial compositions we put
inside it so in the first experiment
there's really simple experiment we
simply took a rectangular frame we put a
dot in it and we told people to make a
rating of how well that dot fits at that
particular position within the rectangle
on a scale from like one to seven I
don't remember actually what the what
the scale was yeah scale from one to
seven and it was in different positions
on different trials that made a rating
of each one and then we just looked at
what the average ratings were as a
function of their position okay and so
the data are actually very regular so
here we've got the data plotted where
the size of the circle here correspond
the area of the circle corresponds to
the how high the rating was and there's
some color coding as well and what you
find out is that the very best position
is in fact the one in the very center
that's where the dot fits best and that
there's a gradient outward from that
sort of a monotonic rating out from of
that that the further away from the
center you get the worse the ratings get
but there's also some articulation of
the space along these global axes of
symmetry if you think about this as
being the ratings of being plotted in a
third dimension here there's sort of
ridges along they are along those global
axes of symmetry and there are also
ridges along these local axes of
symmetry the angle bisectors of the
rectangle and we actually did an
experiment to find out whether it was
actually the angle bisectors or whether
was the global diagonal and it turns out
it's the angle bisectors not the global
diagonal that matters in fact you can
predict
Dean I don't have the number here I
think but you can predict something like
a five percent of the variance in terms
of what these ratings are simply by a
linear combination of knowing how far it
is from the center whether it lies along
the vertical or the horizontal or one of
the local diagonal axis well I'm going
to have the data right there didn't it
yeah eighty-two percent of the variance
you can count for using just the center
distance from the center and the
symmetries so we also wanted to look at
whether there were what that's just the
positional structure within the frame so
we want to look now at whether there was
directional and orientational structure
as well so we changed our probes from
circles two triangles because then they
the probe the probe shape has only a
single axis of symmetry itself and we
looked at a smaller number of positions
but we looked at eight different
orientations within the frame and we
made up so people made these ratings and
we were expecting that there would be
certain kinds of interactions between
position and orientation so that along
the vertical axes the triangles that
worry and it vertically would be judged
better and along the horizontal axis the
ones that were oriented horizontally
would be judged better and so forth also
along the diagonals and here's what we
found so what we're plotting here is
each of these is a polar plot of how
high the ratings were for the triangle
whose center was at that position and
that was pointing in the direction
that's given by these these angles here
so the one the T is top and bottom left
and right top right top left and so
forth so the first thing you know it
have to realize is that the area inside
each one of these curves is the overall
positional bias how much they like that
position independent of orientation or
across all orientations and what we find
is what we found before the center is
the best position there's a bias towards
things along these about these bisectors
so that these guys here
have the smallest area the other thing
you notice is that there were no
orientational bias it would be sir they
would be circles okay and they're not so
this is showing that in fact there's a
bias toward the horizontal and vertical
directions and we're actually now
replicating that with a rectangle that's
been tilted 45 degrees to make sure that
it's the parallel ilysm with the sides
rather than gravitational horizontal
vertical although it could be both and
the third thing though is to notice is
that we are getting these sort of
elongations of these things that is say
in this in this case that the along the
horizontal axis of symmetry that in fact
the horizontal directions of pointing or
in fact judged to be better or a better
fit to the rectangle oh I think this is
just what I was just I supposed to be
pressing this when I told you I'm
pointing out the things I just told you
and you can actually see the elongation
along the axes most clearly with in the
corners here because the actual shape of
these things changes fairly dramatically
and we did another experiment this is
but it's the the data are plotted in the
same way I'm not going to go through the
whole thing to look at biases toward up
down left and right and you find biases
toward upward pointing triangles down at
the bottom but downward-pointing
triangles up at the top and you find
rightward bias a rightward bias on the
left side but you find a slight left
word bias on the right side so this is
an inward bias this is the inward bias
with in this particular experiment that
I think corresponds to the inboard bias
that we saw in the aesthetic so people
are not being asked for an aesthetic
judgment here right they're just asking
being asked for how well does this dot
fit or this triangle fit in this frame
and i'll come back to what the
relationship between those two things is
because where i think we're going to
find the analogy for that is in the
color study which is what i'm coming to
next but we also started to look at what
happens if you add a second dot
how does it affect these ratings and
it's pretty interesting so we get
ratings for the single dot but also
ratings for a second dot the one that
flashes is the one that people were
supposed to rate so there's either an
empty rectangle or there's a rectangle
with one context dot in it the other dot
comes up in flashes and you're supposed
to rate how well that dot fits within
that configuration that Gestalt and what
we find is interesting because in fact
when you put a second dot in everything
changes that is to say so here the data
for the single dot sort of displayed the
way that I showed you before the center
is the best position the horizontal and
vertical axes and so forth but what
happens when we have another dot in
there I'll just give a couple of
examples so here's the context dog as
the ones shown in yellow all right and
then notice that no longer is it the
case that the center dot is the best one
the ones that are that fit the best when
there's a context thought there are the
ones that are symmetric with respect to
the vertical and horizontal axis and
also the one that centric Lee as is
called symmetric with respect to the
center so the center itself isn't judged
that a good place but the thing that
symmetric with respect to the center is
in fact and you also find elevated
ratings along the things positions that
are aligned with along these
distinguished axes and just to show you
this isn't the only oh this is the data
actually the single dot ratings matter
almost not at all you can predict almost
everything about these data without
knowing what the rating is for that
particular location by itself and this
just shows another case where now
there's the context dot and what pops
see what popped over here with these
kind of that's the most dramatic one
because those are the worst positions
normally what this pops are in fact
these corner positions which are
relatively good by themselves but again
the way you can predict a lot of the
variants here by knowing these
relational these kinds of relational
variables so the final project i want to
mention is the color composition
experiments
and this is work that was done by Karen
schloss and myself and the target really
what we were interested in was or the
thing I was most interested in which I'm
going to tell you about anyway is
people's aesthetic responses two pairs
of colors to color composition how well
the colors go together what kinds of
color combinations to people like and
it's part of a much larger project where
we bring in a number of people and pay
them to do an awful lot of different
tasks so not just you know what
individual colors do you like but what
individuals colors do you like in
different contexts for a t-shirt or wall
color or whatever you want to see
whether the people's preferences in fact
across different objects are relatively
stable or not we get them to give
preferences of color combinations
measurements of what's called color
harmony that's going to turn out to be
important lots of color metric ratings
like how red or green or blue or yellow
is this etc etc we also get them to give
us personality measures we measure the
Big Five personality scale for reasons
that will become evident at the very end
i'm showing you data from only a few
subjects we show them colors on a CRT
screen and we give them a topic to make
a rating on a on a line they just make a
line where it falls from say how much do
you like it not at all to very much or
whatever the dimension is we're having
them rate and the colors that we've used
we've used a particular set of 37 colors
where we've got the so called the for
primaries red green blue and yellow with
their angle bisectors orange purple cyan
and chartreuse okay and we have four
different combinations of saturations
and brightnesses so this is the
saturated ring that you're looking at
here there's the light ring this is
within embedded within color space for
those of you who know what a color space
is we have ones at the same at medium
saturation
the same lightness level as the
saturated ones and a set at the dark
plus the grace that's our 37 colors and
the power of this experiment is that we
have the same subjects doing all of
these tasks with the very same colors so
that we can look and find out you know
what is it that matters in trying to
predict whatever it is we're trying to
predict the Palmer lab 37 so let's take
a look at the hue preferences that we
get so here we're looking at average
preference ratings across hue so red
orange yellow the chartreuse they look
the same on this projector for some
reason but are almost the same this is
chartreuse green cyan blue and purple
and this is what we find and remember
that this is a cyclic dimension right so
it all repeats here and it's a pretty
regular function and it turns out
interestingly enough that it's almost
the same preference function that you
find with babies if you take you know 10
week old kids and you put them in a
situation where they can look at this
color they can look at that color and
you measure how long they spend looking
at the colors you find a function looks
almost the same as this I I don't know
what to make of that I haven't I would
like to study this sort of thing
cross-culturally to find out whether
there's something Universal about it I
suspect not but the baby date are kind
of interesting and in fact you can
predict a good deal of the variants here
I'm not that I believe it less than that
than i did when i made this made this up
so what happens when you break this down
by these these four different pieces
here are the saturated colors pretty
much the same function pretty much the
same function for the medium saturation
and for the light ones the only one
that's radically different is the dark
ones and the reason that it's different
primarily is that dark yellow and dark
orange are very much not preferred and
those are these colors right here I know
whether you can see or not but they're
sort of brown kind of poopie brown and
 brown which may in fact be why it
is that they're not generally liked
yeah actually I should go look see what
Crayola colors they are closest to have
you been to that website there's a
there's a historical site for Crayola
Crayons that gives you all the names of
all the colors that they've looked at
the names are the different colors that
they've used now those are the average
data so i just want to show you how much
individual difference there is
underlying this so these are the data
for some subset of our 27 subjects and
you can see that it's very noisy data so
it's a nice average but that doesn't
mean that that that that's actually
capturing very much of the individual
variation but I'll get back to the
individual variation business because
where I want to go is with this color
combination thing so what happens if we
present a color on a colored background
now and ask them how much they like that
combination of colors together and this
is what we find so what we've plotted
here is that sort of that same function
that I showed you before but now we've
got it with different background colors
so these are the background colors these
are the figural colors the small square
in the middle and although it's it's
it's looks kind of messy it's actually
very orderly because what happens is
that you find for example Purple's they
like best on a purple background next
best on a blue blue background then a
cyan background and so forth blue they
like best on a blue background okay so
they like colors combinations where the
hue is the same but the brightness or
the saturation is different and in fact
if you um if you then shift these curves
so that they line up with the figural
color cover color in the center at zero
or is this oh I forgot I had this okay
so this is just letting you know that if
you try to predict how much people like
a pair of colors from how much they like
the two colors individually you can't do
very well okay twenty percent of the
variants multiple are of about point
four is the best you can do that's not
terribly good so um what we think is
going on in fact we had people also make
ratings of how harmonious pairs of
colors were and we said what that means
is these are colors that go to go that
go well together I don't mean whether
you like them or not it's like in music
people would agree that Mozart is
harmonious Stravinsky is more dissonant
I might like dissonant music you might
like harmonious music but we could both
agree that Mozart is harmonious and
Stravinsky is dissonant relatively
speaking okay so we give them a little
talk like that and then we ask them to
make these color harmony ratings and
part of the reason is that color harmony
is actually very important in art theory
and in fact in when you look in our
Theory what you find is that typically
they talk about there being two
different kinds of harmony harmonies of
analogous colors and and harmonies of
contrasting colors so in terms of the
kinds of plots that I showed you before
this would predict something like this
that is the harmony of a gift for a
given Hugh like that one would fall off
as a function of similarity of hue but
then there would be some increase for at
some point for these faraway hues and
you'll find that we don't actually find
that so i think i'm going to skip
through this this is just gonna because
i'm running out of time here i may have
skipped the importance line well
actually this has the data in it okay so
so here the data for these for these
harmony reigns and this corresponds the
first corresponds to the figural color
and the second one to the background
color and basically what you find is
that harmony is a function of similarity
of hue similarity it falls off very
regularly and monotonically as the
difference between the hues gets larger
and in fact when you look at I think
I'll skip this too turns out that cool
colors are more harmonious than warm
colors
there's the Harmony data and there are
the actual judge similarity data for the
same subject for the same colors and
here the preference data so what you
find is that people do in fact prefer
harmonious color combinations by and
large but the differences are not as
great as the differences in harmony or
similarity are and the reason is that
people differ a good deal in terms of
how much they like harmonious
combinations so when you add harmony to
try to predict the how much people are
going to like a pair of comp of of
colors this is like averaging over
everybody you find out that it helps a
lot so instead of 20 percent of the
variance we can now get like over
seventy percent of the variance by
adding harmony it's much more important
than anything else that we found I'm
going to skip this there is something
about contrast of colors that we found
but it's not harmony it's that a color
typically particularly warm colors look
better on cool backgrounds than they do
on warm backgrounds but I haven't really
got time to go through that so although
maybe it's going to make me take time
this is just showing you that the warm
colors are systematically preferred on
the cool background and that the cool
colors are systematically preferred on
the warm background here people are just
judging how much they like the
individual color in the center they're
not saying any they're not making any
judgments of harmony or anything else
it's just how much they like those
particular how much they like that color
on that background against that
background and you even get reversal so
on the warm background they like blue
much better than yellow on the blue
background they like yellow much better
than they do blue anyway where I'm
trying to get to is no sorry
I talk too much
okay so we're trying to get to is this
relationship between a harmony and
preference and what happens is if you
actually look there's a lot of
variability across people in terms of
how much they like harmonious
combinations some people like harmonious
combinations a lot my mother did you
know her whole her whole lower floor of
the house was all done in beiges
everything was beige and brown and and
tan some people you know like a highly
contrastive non harmonious combinations
so we did was we looked at the
correlation for each person each of our
subjects we looked at the correlation
between their preference ratings and
their harmony ratings and those varied
from slightly negative two very positive
from a correlation of like made a minus
point one up to about positive point
eight and then we looked at that
correlation and found out whether it was
related to any of the personality
variables that are studied in this big
five personality index and what we found
was actually some pretty strong
relationships in particular you find
that people who like harmonious color
combinations tend to be somewhat
introverted and not very open and the
people who are extroverted and open tend
to either dislike or not be as fond of
harmonious color combinations so this is
where I'm going to link it back to the
spatial thing this is this is the way
the sort of big picture the way that I
think that this stuff this story that
I'm trying to tell goes look for is an
aesthetic domain there are lots of
variables that matter some of them are
simple things that we can just you know
measure straight off just by you know I
know where the center is I can measure
distance that's all very easy that turns
out to be important for spatial
composition sometimes there are
complicated things like in fact there
may be stuff like balance biases towards
things being ballot
balanced and so forth and but these
biases in fact have an enormous amount
of individual variation in them in the
sense that different people have
different preferences for things that
are say balanced or colors that are
harmonious in terms of the spatial stuff
you know the things with the frame that
they're these they're these positions
like the very center of the frame that
fits well along these axes of symmetry
and so forth some people are going to
like that and some people aren't going
to like that and we already found that
for the color stuff that that and there
seemed to be relationships to
personality variables we actually think
one of the things we're going to do next
is to get our color subjects back in
where we've got all this information and
we're going to have them start doing the
spatial tasks where we already know sort
of what the good fitting positions are
and we can find out do they like things
better when they're positioned in the
good places or not and the hope is that
the same people who like the harmonious
color combinations are going to be the
people who like things to be positioned
in the well fitting spatial positions
that there's some kind of an internal
consistency to people that they have
some sort of an aesthetic personality if
you will in which they either like
things that fit that go together that
follow these these biases or things that
don't where there's more or different
degrees of tension in the spatial
composition or the color composition and
that's one of the things that we're
going to be doing soon and I just I'm
going to skip all this stuff I just want
to get to the slide where we thank our
sponsor for this research well known
funding agency whoops there it was Amy's
frozen foods how many people know Amy's
frozen foods good stuff yeah it turns
out Karen Schloss as uncle works for
Amy's frozen foods and since we can't
get any funding for this project he was
nice enough to donate several hundred
coupons for Amy's frozen foods and we
pay our subjects in those coupons
so thank you very much for listening and
I'd be happy to you already willing to
take any kind of a shot of why like so
many babies like no I haven't got a clue
if you look actually say you can you can
look at baby preferences by measuring
how long that you can do the same thing
with monkeys and macaque monkeys have
almost identical color vision systems
two hours and their preference function
actually is a monotonic almost linear
function of wavelength from yellow at
the red end and high at the blue end I
don't know I mean hard to say I don't
know of any sort of i mean you can make
up sort of ecological stories about you
know staying away from the pooh pooh and
the you know that the stuff that people
really don't like and maybe the stuff
that's blue like water and and green
stuff that's good stuff i don't know i
haven't really got a clue yeah the back
okay go ahead
I don't know that's a very new data like
about a week ago so I don't know that we
actually know whether that's significant
or not but yeah we need to study that
with one of the things that was wrong
with that not wrong with that but needs
to be worried about is that we actually
had texture on the wall behind it there
was no texture on the on the ground
plane or the table or whatever and that
might have had something to do with why
we got the kinds of results you have to
track that sort of stuff down and kind
of figure out whether it matters or not
and I don't know the answer yeah I'm
sure they do I mean all the stuff
changes over time it's hard enough to
study it you know it is this is sort of
a snapshot approach right and take a
person and you find out you know what it
is they like this moment in time if we
get to the point where we start doing
the expertise stuff then will presumably
be getting people who are a little
further along the curve there's actually
in the 1970s this is one topic within
aesthetics that actually a fair amount
of work was done in this in the safe 50s
to 70s Daniel beuerlein did some really
nice work on the dynamics of aesthetic
preference and so basically what happens
is as you get exposed to something more
and more I mean if it's if it's not very
complex then you like it less and less
and less it because it becomes more and
more and more boring but if it's maybe
slightly too complex is sort of a
curvilinear relationship between these
things so that if it's slightly too
complex that you may actually like it
more and more as you see it because it's
kind of bringing it into your optimal
range but yeah there changes over time
and I can't say anything
about that from the data that I've got
ya well yeah we saw we have in that 20
subjects we have like I think it's May
through 13 women and and and seven men
we're going to study that but we don't
have enough subjects my memory of the
color work is that men actually prefer
saturated the saturated colors to the
others whereas women don't and I think
that dip down the in the brown range
doesn't show up for the men nearly as
strongly as it does for the women but I
don't know whether that's real or just
you know we only have their only six
guys in the in that data set but yeah
we're going to study that when we get
enough a balanced sample yeah
well not really okay there's there is
one bump we did find that for blue and
yellow I see if I can find the actual
curve here so I think for yellow this is
yellow here there's some hint of a bump
it blue I mean it's not a big bump I
mean I know it's probably not
significant pardon me okay well yellow
and purple I mean there's a question
about you know what exactly is
complementary it depends on the
particular yellow in the particular blue
or purple but but generally speaking
there isn't really any kind of bump that
comes up the thing I skipped over was I
think that that what the color of
theorists were talking about when they
talked about these peoples the harmony
of contrast of colors I think he was
talking about this effect that we found
which is that it's not that highly
contrastive colors are harmonious with
their compliments it's that that color
by itself that color looks better on
that other colored background than if
it's on something that's similar so
there's really it's like they've taken
two different things one of which is
sort of real intuitive harmony that they
really kind of go together and and and
tried to force into that this thing
about colors looking better on
contrasted backgrounds we're actually
looking at in natural images that have
been segmented into objects and we're
trying to looking at the co-occurrence
frequencies of different colors of what
you do is you find that similar colors
go together not surprisingly within
objects you're much more likely to find
similar colors within objects than
between objects and that that might be
part of you know why where are these
this harmonious pneus idea comes from
that they really do go together they go
together when you look at if you segment
the world in terms of objects that those
colors that are similar to each other
particularly similar in hue tend to
co-occur with each other within that
object and maybe that's where this comes
from yeah I what in which which yeah I
did what you mean with a daughter you
mean with the rector with a triangle
well there's a I think that with the
triangle I think there's a rightward
bias I mean there's an upward bias and
there's a rightward bias neither of them
are as big as the n-word bias but you
want to predict those data you need to
be able you need to know whether it's
pointing up versus down left versus
right as well as in versus out if there
weren't any rightward bias then you know
the left and right side would be
completely symmetrical but if there is a
lateral bias its toward the right rather
than toward the left in this culture
with the sort of you know groups of
subjects that we look at yeah i think it
probably has something to do with
handedness and it probably has something
to do with reading direction but you
know it's not something that i've
studied people who have looked at some
of those kinds of things have found
relationships to handedness and
hemispheric laterality also to reading
direction but i have no I have no
nothing more to say about that
