google i 18 n intergroup 'let for making
all this possible and for the food ok
that's that that's what gets the
applause thank you very much and also to
the google Tech Talk team that's making
me look good right now ok this this will
be on YouTube I don't know in 10 days or
so depends how long it takes and I
really want to thank you guys for
turning I'm ugh into such a professional
looking outfit you know it's pretty good
uh I'm Joe cats I my mugs volunteer
marketeer and one of the things I'm into
is mobile app marketing which is why I
keep staring at this no I'm not I'm
actually I got my notes here I'm not
tweeting Walia alright so so so Roger
Sherman our program chair asked me to
thank you roger he asked me to introduce
brandon this time because i invited him
here Rogers working on more programs for
us ok hi there's a lot of ideas in this
room i bet you ah and also want to thank
our volunteer yasmin Vanya over there
Desmond's the localization managers in
your software engineer and so on and as
an example of the kind of volunteers
that work with I'm ugh and we need more
volunteers as a matter of fact tonight
we need picture volunteers because text
x and our volunteer photographers not
here so if everybody can just snap
pictures with your phones and it there's
a place not a meal there's a place on
the meetup site at the bottom of the
comments area when the meetup is over
where you can just upload your pictures
or you can go to I'm ugh org slash
contact and send them to me and Roger
and we'll put them up and you know we
need we need volunteers for other stuff
too for helping us organize these
meetings for organizing our parties and
also we do events with other groups
sometimes so for example he hasn't been
represented us at or was it a lingo port
round table and we had a we had our own
table there but then that means you also
get to go to the event for free what she
didn't know was that the whole event
free but you know we still got her to
volunteer for that one so we need more
volunteers because Paris has has moved
to New York so you know we can always
use more help because you just leave it
to me Roger and nothing will go right
and that's why we need your uh what else
is like oh and we have a very special
guest that you know the original
volunteer we have chairman emeritus and
I'm ugh founder Yan ho amen and so you
know I have to tell the story now not
just because he's here but because a lot
of people are new you know yen in 1987
met this guy in an apple computer dealer
store guy's name was Seth Schneider who
went on to found multilingual computing
magazine now it's just called
multilingual and about a million and a
half other things eventually and they
got this going they agreed there should
be an international related computing
group they started out as part of the
Stanford Matt group s mug as the
international cig and you know even then
as a Mac group it was very clear that
this was about more than Macintosh
though so for a long time we always knew
the M really stood for multilingual and
and have just continued to grow from
there un spun the group off as an
independent mug in 1991 and it was
sponsored by apple and adobe and most
recently by google and just been meeting
almost every month ever since Roger
hates it when I say almost it's missed
at least one month one month since 1987
but I mean you know they were meeting
they used to meet these but like posters
up on real physical bulletin boards that
said there's a meeting about stuff and I
have one on the past events index on the
imag site where we've got our archives
there is a scan of a 1993 flyer that
says this guy named Lee Collins was
going to be there to talk about this
weird new thing called Unicode and
that's you know and they used to run
those around with sneakernet and
and people came uh now um tonight we let
me just stop this beast and get to a
specific slide this is keynote it is
keynote hmm all right here we go so the
so you know the official hashtag for
tonight's event on twitter is I'm ugh
408 we're always on look far away I know
we're in 650 they're going to put an
overlay on 408 I don't cares this is too
complicated anyway this is 650 but it
used to be 415 when it was s RI so you
know where this is I move forward and
want to make sure everybody knows about
the imma jobs board a couple these are
brand new and the last one that the
internships thing that turns into a
really long list if you click through of
all sorts of stuff they're looking for
interns in everything from terminology
management deep web development but we
also have some g11 engineer positions
and companies can post for just five
bucks as we're not trying to make money
on it just trying to provide a service
and that's a time ugh dot org slash job
these are our upcoming dates we spoiled
you last year Roger had people lined up
all year we had at least three months
out right now we got some things that we
think are planned but we're not sure
what the topics will be and if you or
someone from your company would like to
speak just email Roger there and we'll
be glad to hear from you also there's a
couple of other events coming up
localization unconference which is
instigated by another troublemaker from
Ireland Alton O'Brien and a bunch of
people from Oracle and Salesforce mostly
they're going to meet at Salesforce i
think in Silicon Valley I can't remember
where they're meeting in Dublin but it's
it's a really a non structured non sales
conference where you set the agenda also
the localization Institute has these
certification programs going on this is
an annual thing they do
since 2006 and the the current program
is a joint cooperation between the
localization Institute and Cal State and
I looked at their their site before we
met and noticed at least three pass time
ugh speakers are going to be teaching
there Anna Schlegel the senior
globalization manager at netapp Matt
Sanford the internationalization
technology manager at Twitter and
Stephen Loomis the CLD our tech lead at
IBM and a whole bunch of other people
will be teaching at those certification
programs and lastly I you know we're on
all these networks now and you know in
the past year we started doing this to
grow when we moved locations and I just
wanted to ask a couple questions because
you know we still have a presence on
yahoo groups we thought about going to
google groups but it would have been a
better same thing so we tried meet up
still not internationalized but that's
not what I'm going to ask about because
i'm i'm working on them they just they
messed something else up so they're
working on that now so the thing is I
post jobs when the jobs go on the I mug
jobs board I put them on all these
networks and when I send out an email to
yahoo groups I can see all this traffic
when I I'm trying not to send too many
emails to people made up already sends
you to to reminders before the event I
could use it to send email to you but I
don't want to do that if you're then
you're going to turn everything off
right so so what I've been doing is up
and putting it on the message board on
theirs and you have the choice of making
it digest or nothing and I notice when I
put the jobs on that board I don't see
much traffic I don't know if that's
because everybody has jobs or or not
because you know the yahoo group we get
we see a lot of people clicking through
so so I was just wondering you know
should I be sending these with a direct
email when I have a new job for people
that are on meet up or are you also on
the yahoo
group and so on I mean who wants more
email I ok hit kill him and I I know
because I really don't know what to do
but I don't want you to miss them some
of them are good I've heard that you
know we're staying we're still doing
everything mirrored on yahoo because a
lot of people do not want to come over
these new networks and and good for you
good for you change is bad I've you know
I've heard that um and and so you know I
every time I still send out the I'm ugh
i18n newsletter on yahoo and everybody
gets the same content eventually and I
try and stagger it so you don't get them
all in one day but it took me about six
months to figure that out so I hope you
didn't start turning me off about there
anyway that's fine let's go back to the
first slide because you're not really
here to listen to me i'm going to
introduce our speaker you have to
imagine that there's someone much more
calm speaking now and he's got an Irish
brogue and then this will make a lot
more sense because you know Brendan
Clavin is the co-founder and CTO of
Tetris he's originally from a house near
a crossroads beside the hamlet close to
a very small village beyond the
resolution of Google Earth Brendan
escaped cosmopolitan Ireland and planted
himself firmly in Silicon Valley he was
the first software engineer at Clara's
Ireland in 1990 set up the engineering
tools team at Iona software in 1995
built the localization department at
ariba 1999 and was the first higher into
the engineering team at some company
called google in night in 2005 and
apparently he fits right in with the
valley crowd with his collection of Oh
have bicycles and Hawaiian shirts you
weren't kiddin worry so now without
further ado I give you Brendan Clavin
thank you Joe just let me get sit up
here and do some mirroring and non
mirroring for a second so if nothing
else my shirt is gonna show up on this
video nicely bear with me here for a
second displays okay who's this one aha
almost there okay so thank you Joe for
the introduction and Roger for having me
here tonight um I think Joe has summed
it up my my career and hopefully you
know a little bit about my background
from that description but just a little
more to that I've been
internationalizing and localizing sulfur
for 20 years little over 20 years most
recently before starting this company a
little over a year ago I worked here at
Google and I manage the Gulf the Google
localization framework team where are we
were responsible for all of the
infrastructure that gets Google's
products translated into over 100
languages in some cases and we had 50 or
60 products so this was really an effort
of localization at scale if you like and
I to customers within within Google one
was the engineering team and make them
efficient in the processes and how they
do localization and the localization
team that people have managed the the
relationships of the vendors and the
translators and may make it efficient
for them as well and ultimately then my
customers are my customers were the
consumers of Google's products in all of
these different languages I did start
off my career back at claris I see some
of the guys for my first job are here
tonight that I work with many many years
ago back in the day I did the first
version of klaris works for Japan pre
Unicode pre Lee Collins talk and so to
buy text engines was where I cut my
teeth as an engineer and over the last
20 years I've worked for various
companies localizing everything from
enterprise software to desktop cell for
the games and multimedia educational
software so that's a little bit
of me i justjust want to kind of get a
sense in the audience who you guys are
many people here are our app developers
okay see if you and I presume there are
some localization folks localization
managers translators in the audience
okay all right very good ok so I'm going
to talk about app localization as a
service and the company that I formed
Tetris the genesis of this and we leave
in Google little over a year and a half
ago was seeing the change in profile of
the people that are developing apps and
this really was predicated by the
release of iphone and looking at the
profile of these developers and the
companies that are producing these apps
and them not doing localization so every
company that I worked at I was brought
in or hired you know as an engineer or
to start a group after companies had
traction in the domestic US market to
come in and build localization
departments and make things efficient
for them Google was all about doing
things at scale but the profile of the
app developers are there 1 2 3 man shots
and they really are not been serviced
and they don't understand the
opportunities and they're never going to
go out and hire people like me into
their organization because there weren't
too many shops so this is really the
change in profile of the developers and
me seeing that need and the gap in the
market that I started this company so
I'm going to talk about that I'm going
to talk a little bit about marketing
that M word that I shouldn't talk about
her a tech talk I'm going to talk a
little bit about the American market
opportunities and we get into some
process and how localization is done
within the iphone development
environment and talk about some of the
tools that we've built feel free to ask
questions at any time I don't mind being
interrupted and we can make this as
interactive as you like ok so if you
just humor me shows I gonna play a small
video here
okay who can tell me how many apps in
that ad were localized 0 okay the old
were this is a french apple TV iPad
campaign right there in the middle of
that ad was one of our products that we
translate it for a customer our
lighthouse customer i'll talk about that
in a little bit but Apple picked the
companies that have put into this ad
campaign because the apps were popular
but more so they were localized and
localized into a number of languages so
Apple did not put out and he put any
apps on this unless they were localized
at the time that their ad agency went
out to 22 bility at the ad campaign for
the international markets I'm not quite
I can't quite remember I know French I
think Korean Japanese Chinese were
definitely localization requirements um
so with that let me talk a little bit
what we do and it's not ad campaigns for
Apple so we turn this which is the app
that was in the middle of that that ad
it's a medical appt produced by an Irish
company lots of medical content in here
so we take this and turn it into place
the French version and so what you'll
notice here it's all localized that's
quite familiar to everyone in this room
I think everyone understands
localization and if I just build this
out a little bit you can see that this
app has lots of medical content and all
of this is translated we translated this
into six languages apart from the
engineering that our service provides
and the translation
and everything from professional
translators to translate the UI to the
medical experts that we had to go out
and bring into our network a translator
medic content we also kako SI no no I

Shirakawa hospital is a band to ship in
a band tuvalu la touche lickin the
pharmacy opava valla description to
share on the road or a description for
exact even to share on the autism and
poorly this active a valley called below
the shore okay I think we've heard
enough of this sorry so we basically do
we're recording studio as well so we
provide not only localization of text we
also do localization of graphics and we
have a recording studio that we've bring
the actors into our studio and do the
voiceovers for this so the app that I'm
just talking about that that app is
seventeen dollars and ninety-nine cents
I just happened to know that yeah I
guess it really depends on how many apps
are selling right this is a 1799 app the
last time I looked I think it might have
been down to 14 99 at some stage its
medical content rich yes he probably
sells enough of these apps that he can
forward he can afford to do it but I'll
talk about this later we've done
everything from someone coming to us and
spending a hundred dollars to get an app
into a language to a few thousand
dollars and its really predicated by the
amount of content that's in there on the
level of translation that they require
be it specialists and I'll talk a little
bit about that in a bit okay so why are
we doing all this why are we translating
this and we want our customers to turn
this their code their content they're
incredibly cool English app and we want
them to turn into loads of money so can
they go out and you know make some more
wine
en euros whatever the case may be so
let's talk a little bit here about the
market and the evolution of apps and the
space that that we're going after with
localization as a service so we look at
the app download market in 2009 it was
valued at around 800 million and what we
did here is we took the numbers of these
downloads and the revenues from these
downloads across across the globe broke
it down english-speaking versus
non-english speaking and in 2009 it
roughly broke down to about sixty
percent of the apps out there were
downloaded by english-speaking consumers
in the english-speaking regions of the
world the predictions for 2011 are that
this will increase to about two and a
half billion dollars and this is app
sales and english-speaking here as you
see is is reducing and is heading
towards half and by 2015 this market is
estimated to be worth about five point
seven five point six billion dollars and
you'll see here that the
english-speaking regions that these apps
are sold in is getting to about a third
so the proliferation of the devices
Apple talked about that a little bit
where the opportunities are are
definitely outside of north america and
the primarily english-speaking regions
of the world so there's definitely a
growing appetite for apps and i think
everyone here whether who has a smart
phone and iphone even a feature phone is
probably aware of this and so we looked
at some data and the average number of
apps that exists on the feature phones
of old was one in terms of purchases and
that's that's quite understandable
you've bought a phone to make phone
calls and not really browse the web and
in use apps and then i guess with the
advent of the palm and blackberry that
number increased up to about 22 and the
iphone today data out there says about
37 apps per phone and i don't find that
surprising at all given that Apple came
out with iOS four and created folders
because I think there
running out of screens for the number of
apps that people have installed on their
phones and couldn't fit them on there so
definitely it's on the rise in terms of
the move towards apps and so if we just
take a quick look then again this is
market opportunity but it's also what I
like to tell people why localize so you
can talk about the english-speaking
versus the non-english speaking but I
use this when I talk to developers about
Apple being a mature company in terms of
where the revenue come from where are
you in terms of your app sales and if
you just take a look at the numbers here
18.6 million iPhones in q1 that's up
from it I think about 16 million in q4
which is amazing given the q4 as your
holiday season the the other thing to
note here and I know from a nie moge or
an internationalization perspective it's
always good to see this apple's revenues
fifty-nine percent came from
international down a little bit from q4
2010 where i think it was about
sixty-two percent but still this is
these are great numbers and things to
note here in terms of growth in the apac
region that one hundred eighty-two
percent increase year-over-year in this
past quarter and China blew it out of
the water in terms of two hundred fifty
percent growth in iphone sales in china
and i was talking to some of the earlier
i don't know the price of an iphone in
china but somebody was mentioning it's
like three times more expensive than it
is over here relative to to earnings so
the gap the gap in the market as we see
it for these app developers is that from
our estimation about eighty percent of
the apps on the App Store to there and
available in English only we if you go
in and look at the top 100 apps and
drill down and look at the languages
that they're available in it varies from
about sixty to eighty five percent
depending on the genre that you're
looking at and the App Store has I think
about 22 different genres and the app
store runs across about 62 different
countries so we correlated update and
commode about eighty percent and also
apple sales and I mentioned this earlier
about sixty percent of iOS devices today
are in the hands of non-native English
speakers that's not to say they don't
speak English but they're just
non-native so a huge opportunity here
for the app developers to localize their
apps and get
the hands of the non-english speaking
consumers of the world so why is this
gap and I think I'm preaching to the
choir here I think a lot of people
understand this but I'll point out so
there are differences economic
differences and a lot of the app
developers today are English speakers
and the the the ground swell of apps are
produced here in the US and a lot of the
developers on the App Store our
english-speaking by virtue of the tools
and their engineering and their
education so they think English person
they go after the biggest market but
with the growth of the iOS devices and
the proliferation of them overseas the
opportunities are there for localized
apps I'll mention here too there's a gap
to in terms of you know why are
developers not doing this as compared to
a Google who is doing it or an Adobe or
a Microsoft these tend to be small
projects and they're developed by small
teams who build these apps and anything
from a few weeks to a few months I don't
think there's any mobile apps out there
that take more than a year to develop
and so they do these small projects then
the turnaround is a small amount of
content in that particular project and
and to go out and buy those services
from a traditional localization
companies a little difficult in terms of
the price point that the companies want
to do business with and the small teams
the developers not talk about this a
little more they're not the time really
to get into and engage process with
money language you know translators and
coordinate the delivery of their apps
into these different markets and so I've
mentioned that localization companies
are not really in a position to go out
and do business with somebody who's
going to spend a hundred or two hundred
dollars maybe every six months assign a
project manager to that and make that
work and the a lot of app developers and
there's a real long tail and talk about
that they're not making a lot of money
out there so they might be making pocket
money out of selling these apps and they
have a real job potentially to put bread
on the table but and what their barrier
to getting localization is high and are
the perceived barrier to getting
localization is high so they don't
bother doing that they prefer to
probably write another app and see if
that can be the hitch that'll let them
retire earlier so on and I think really
it gets down to the app developer the
profile of the app developer is time
consuming and the most valuable asset
an app developer houses his own time and
so this really gets down to you know do
you speak my language here's a person
looking at an iphone put the top apps
from Japan into in front of somebody who
doesn't speak that language is not going
to be there are going to be able to use
it and the same thing is true if you put
an English a pin or the only apps that
are available English apps for games
people can't buy them they can't use
them so it is about speaking the
language of that consumer I think too
and I'll allow this in I think that up
to now the app developers especially on
the iOS and the App Store have gotten
away because the profile of the people
that are buying apps tend to be people
who have more money to spend on these
expensive devices the probably third
level educated and they get away with
buying English apps and so that's
changing now the price of iphone is
coming down the data plans are coming
down I think the ipad is a change or in
this people that make the decision to
buy that ipod who make enough money to
buy it or handing it's their kids who
don't speak english to play with they're
also handing it to their parents and
putting them on it and in international
markets these people don't necessarily
speak english so i think there is a
change here about to happen with the
dropping of price and just who is
actually using these these devices and
in a position to purchase these acts so
talk a little bit here about the app
developer i've alluded to this already
but if we take a look at the app stores
about 80,000 publishers on the app store
right now people have come and gone
since the app store opened they're not
all active but there are more and more
people becoming app developers getting
into the game there are about 350,000
iphone apps the last time i looked at
the apple website about 65,000 ipad apps
an apple sort of Bambi's about over
400,000 apps i'm not quite sure what the
new apps that come on online every year
but it's probably going to be in the 50
to 100,000 range and we wait to see see
see what happens there I've talked about
the developer profile so i don't know if
you can see this on the x-axis here we
have the total number of app developers
and that really is a long tale because
people are coming in
I'm going out of the app store all the
time people give it a try they don't
make a living out of it they give up and
then more people are still trying to
make a living out of it and there are
guys that are really making a living and
up along the the y axis is team size
what our research has shown that about
ninety percent of the app developers
that are putting apps out there today
are in teams of five or less and even
has an even warrant that it's like teams
up 3 or less so there is a real long
tail here and this is why the numbers
are at eighty percent for the fam
localized apps in the App Store okay so
I'm going to get into sort of the meat
of the talk right now i'm going to talk
about globalization as a service and
particularly in how tetris has defined
this and what we're doing to provide
localization as a service to these app
developers so going to take a quick look
here at the traditional localization
model i'm going to insert the app
developer right here on the left-hand
side of this screen so typical
localization companies i refer to as
bricks and mortar companies you've got a
management you've got translation
management that manage you know the
translators if you've got audio or your
visual engineers graphic artists um
whatever the people that do the actual
localization so there's this big piece
here in the middle you know you may have
to deal with localization engineering
the sales guy going to call in you and
so on and so put the app developer into
this environment that it's very hard
from to work in this environment and
conversely i think it's very hard for
the localization company or the bigger
localization companies to work with this
app developer when a lot of them are
serviced in the likes of google and
microsoft and HP and BMW have in the
tens of millions of dollars in budgets
every year so this is what we've done at
tetris is we've moved a lot of these
services into the cloud and really it's
it's because of the profile of the
developer how they work how big their
apps are or should i say how small their
apps are that has allowed us to do this
and i'm going to demonstrate you know
what each of these pieces are as i go
through and my talk and i've got some
tools to show but really the process is
an app developer comes to our site
uploads his content we're very
integrated with
development environment we give them
back sudo translation for free we have
WYSIWYG tools that allow the translator
to translate in context and you know
there are there is no sales there is no
project management it's pretty much self
service and then we facilitate the the
routing or the routing of his job out to
our network of translators so what's the
same here is that in this graph and are
this slide and the one before is that
the app developer the graphic arts the
translator and the AV engineer on the
right of this screen haven't changed
it's still the same people so the people
that are on our network doing this
translation may work for localization
companies they may be freelance and
they're registering coming on doing this
work so we put this service right in the
middle of these two communities to
enable localization as a service any
questions ok so the question was what
languages do we support if an app
developer comes in to us we support all
of the languages that are supported
directly in iOS so I think that's about
39 or 40 233 ok thanks JJ I'm 33 and so
the resource mechanism within the iphone
allows for switching of the languages on
that so we we basically support all of
those languages yeah so the question was
do we do android supports oh yes i
realize that i'm very mac focused in
this talk we have done some android apps
but we're very focused on iphone and an
ipad today and our systems and i'll talk
a little bit about this can take any
format and so we have a very generic XML
parser that any xml content or
structured content can come to us and
i'll show this in the demo in a little
while it's a matter of how do we provide
WYSIWYG tools to the translators to
allow them to work with this small
profile you know the the form factor of
the iphone and the ipad and the mobile
devices is tricky in terms of text
expansion and so on so really it's a
matter of
wysiwyg tools but in terms of just
getting content out of your your app and
your development environment if it's an
XML format we can do anything yeah this
was another question okay so the
question is how do I guarantee the
quality of the localization so I'll show
this a little later in when I
demonstrate the tools and the WYSIWYG
nature but I may not have mentioned that
I should have the translators that we
humans we don't use machine translation
so it's not it's not automated
translation and we provide four levels
of translation service to our customers
we have a an ultra level translation
which is a professional translator
that's qualified by us it's a native
speaker and we'll do the translation and
then a second person will do the review
and they're a native professional
translator and that's one level of
service if a developer wants to come to
us and just by professional level
translation with no secondary review
they can do that that's a cheaper level
and then we have a standard or basic
level translation where a developer can
come to us and ask is for that and we
have on our network our native speakers
who we've qualified who understand the
iPhone the iPad whatever the device is
that they're translating for but they're
not professionals so we're we're trying
to enable cottage industry as a dirty
term in California but you know we're
trying to allow developers to buy at a
price point that's comparable with the
level of quality they want in their app
and also for people to come in who you
know maybe a student in Germany you know
it uses an ipad and wants to make some
money at night and rather than go i'm
working at starbucks for three hours
they can do translation for us for three
hours and make the same money and so
we're trying to facilitate that level of
on both sides so we're we're in effect
we're building a marketplace for people
to come in and do business
um I i actually just pulled that out of
the year i don't actually know what
students are getting to gate at
starbucks so you got me there JJ for
sure yeah i haven't done the comparison
oh wow i don't have those numbers it's
about 5050 I'd say from the customers
that we work for the app that I just
passed around and i hope i get my iPad
back later but play with it and have fun
and the that was high end that was
specialist and so we actually and you'll
see this when I want to show your
service that customer came to us and set
up a medical appt we said okay we need
to get medical professionals to do the
translation so we went out and source
them throughout our network now we
showed him their resumes so that he was
comfortable with that but then we told
him that you know that that's a certain
price point and that's our specialist
rate and so we told him then you don't
need these specialists to translate your
app so we differentiated the medical
content from the actual app so a medical
translator understands the heart the
valves how it works but they don't
understand you know swiping and
scrolling and whatever else so we we
allow people to split it up on a file
level that the translation so again it's
kind of murid in terms of what they're
specifically asking for because there's
a case of one customer who did
professional ultra and specialist and we
have some guys that come in and just do
the basic and they're happy to do that
so there it's it's a level I shouldn't
say is probably the wrong way of saying
it's a couple of levels of both machine
translation right for basic so they're
not willing to spend for a professional
and a review that's fine they want to go
out and put their toe into the market if
they get feedback that the translation
quality is bad we'll come back and say
now I need to fix this what we do our
best to make sure that we have the right
people on the network but no
professionals our professionalism two
eyes are better than one yes
the trick is teaching services for a
free maintenance and for revision
processing yes yes so the question is do
we offer maintenance and leveraging
going forward and actually that's the
core of our message on the core of our
business is that we really here and I
think it should be evident by the
demonstration the core of our business
is maintenance and it's the developers
time the value that we're presenting to
the developer is how literally he has to
do in order to procure translation build
it into his app and then keep developing
because that's what these guys do they
keep developing they want to get the
next app so if they spent three months
the only one to spend a few days doing
localization and so we support the
continuous development model along the
lines of svn we use svn but we're not
that's not the core of our our
architecture developers can keep
throwing their content to us after they
have given us the first time will tell
them what they have changed will tell
them down to the string what they've
changed and what they pay accordingly
it's not it's not translation memory
it's not fuzzy matching this is pure
resource reuse in their apps and I'll
get into that a little bit more and I'll
talk a little bit more about that when I
bring up the site and bring up the
demonstration yes another question so
the question is do we translate content
other than mobile apps such as web apps
and no we don't we're very very focused
on iphone and ipad right now we will do
android if asked and we do HTML content
so if there's some HTML within an iphone
app or a guy has some support pages that
he wants translated yes we have power
source and we can take care of that but
we're not advertising ourselves as a web
localization company maybe down the line
but but not today
okay so the question was how do we
handle text within images or how is that
how is that done we will take bitmap
files from a from a developer or
publisher and charged accordingly to do
that we encourage people not to have
text on graphics and so you'll see from
the demo that we're very focused around
the supported formats on iphone such as
dot strings and dot xib files and dot ni
be from from the mac side and then on
android it's the dot strings and the xml
files from that but we have no magic
we've no see our recognition we don't we
don't do any of that stuff so the
question is do we offer infrastructure
that allows a developer's friends say
from Germany come in and work on our
apps all i know i didn't pay you to say
this but i was a very quick question so
yes from day one we built this with the
app developer in mind and we know that
app developers out there that have done
localization have done it with big
companies they've done it with
individual translations that they find
on some website and they've done it with
their cousins their friends and whatever
that they can lay their hands on so
that's a long-winded way of answering
your question yes so we have four levels
of translator that I mentioned already
the four levels of payment basic
professional ultra and specialist and
you can name your own translator so you
can bring anybody you like into our
service no charge to the person to use
our service and they will receive
content just like our professional
translators and use our tools so you
don't have to send them emails zip files
whatever the case may be we do charge
for that we have a small four cents per
word infrastructure charge for that and
again we think that's well worth it to
the developer because again it all gets
back to his time is his most valuable
resource and I'll talk about that I
don't have that in my demo but I'll show
you where that works within our
infrastructure
that I see more question on the back
okay so any VC's in the room no I can
localize and provide an iphone and
mobile app localization service I don't
really know exactly how they take the
content in I think its form based or you
have a relationship with them and ftp I
really don't know so I'm not speaking to
that my django is japanese based
localization company in the cloud but i
believe they take in file formats but
again I don't know how they're
integrated into that service but I'll
show you where it we build me to say we
have no competitors we're always
supposed to have competitors but I think
some of the things that we're doing are
pretty unique and I'll demonstrate that
yes at the back okay so the question is
do we provide a service if the app is
not ready for localization or it's not
internationalized can we do that um the
short answer is no and the only reason
for that is that we're very focused and
we are a start-up in terms of building
out this infrastructure for the 80,000
app developers that are out there in
that number that's growing and some of
our lighthouse customers yes we have
taken their app in house and we've done
the coding so we can do that but we can
talk afterwards my quick answer I just
say this right now if anybody wants that
we probably don't have the bandwidth to
do it in our company but we can get
people who can do it and so I know the
people who can do this kind of work one
more question before I move on okay so
let's take a look at an iPad app and
here's a little app and I've got some
screenshots here because what I'm about
to present is just an overview of the
localization process and the
internationalization process within
xcode for ipad and iphone apps and it's
a little involved and there's a lot of
clicking so i'm just going to use
screens here to demonstrate this and but
we will look at this
app that I'm showing it right now which
is an iPad app on screen I will show you
the inner workings of that with in Xcode
in a little bit so this is just an app
that really does nothing we built it
internally a Tetris for some training
purposes we were training people and
also training some of our parsers and
our tools and it does nothing but I just
flicked through here the second screen
here just displays an image of an iphone
this could potentially turn into an
iphone translation app on the iPad but
we won't go there right now so let's
let's let's do some coding here and
let's take a look at Xcode and the
environment and how one goes about
localizing this app so here i am with in
xcode it's an integrated development
environment all apps on the App Store
iphone ipad ipod touch mac all go
through this particular development
environment so what I'm going to do here
is I'm just going to draw your attention
to these resources here on the left-hand
side and people that are involved in
localization know this well I've got
some PNG's in here we've got some JPEGs
and I've got these xib files which is a
I think xml interface builder format
from Apple I think it comes from the
next days and these are files that need
to be translated and so highlighted here
on the left is a file called home dot
XIB and over on the right-hand side is
the rendering of this within the editor
itself and this is where a developer
will go in and resize buttons or add a
button and hook it up with code and so
on so a WYSIWYG editor for developing
the UI for basic functionality within an
app and so will move on and I just
talked about that this is the the
WYSIWYG editor and you could potentially
go in here and have this file to a
translator and ask them to go in and
double click on the Sign In button and
translate that into French but to do
that that translator has to be running
on a Mac has to be running Xcode and
they have to know their way around this
environment it's not really the way you
want to do localization but it can be
done that way and so what I'm looking at
now is I've just jumped up to one of the
source files and I'm going to draw your
attention here to a hard-coded string
which
says Noah middle image loaded and
there's another little hard-coded string
down here at the bottom which I can
barely read I hope you guys can read it
you cannot load a project that is
already loaded so this is typical an app
developer comes in no matter what
framework you're in it can be a web app
it can be a dotnet up people tend to
inline their their strings and their
code so these are what are called
hard-coded strings and I'm going to show
you how these would be externalized in a
bit so let's jump out to the finder the
user interface on the mac and take a
look at the file system and here are the
source files that we just looked at
within the ide with in Xcode and you'll
notice here there's the different xib
files in this directory and they're all
sitting in the root directory groups as
that they're all sitting in the root
directory of this app called dog food
demo okay so typically these are the
files that get uploaded to a website or
sent to a project manager at a
localization company or submitted
through a forum for translation and so
I'm going to go back out here and just
show you how in Xcode you set your
project up for localization so over here
on the Left I've selected the home dot
xib file and I expanded this editor on
the right and you'll notice here that
there are no localizations present so
there is no the file home dot XIB has
not been set up for localization and so
simply clicking on the little plus to
the bottom left of the red circle that I
quickly got rid of tells Xcode to make
this file localizable and you see this
english is now sitting under the
localization section and by clicking on
the little expand button the developer
goes in here and picks all the languages
that he wants this app to be translated
in so this is I guess
internationalization are setting up your
Xcode project to be localized and so you
click on each of these languages it's a
clever menu if you've picked six
languages and you go to the next file
you can hip at all but the point is you
set up all of the individual files and
so right now if I look over here
at the home dot xib you'll notice a
little triangle has appeared to the left
of it and if I expand that triangle and
see that all of the home dot xib files
for the different locales have been set
up so this you go through every file
whether it's an xib file whether it's a
graphic that has text on it whether it's
a sound that has to play when somebody
does a good job you know playing the
game or whatever this has to be done so
it's a little bit tedious and I think
that Apple could do a better job of
making these tools you know one button
set everything up at once but so be it
will write some bugs and we give some
feedback okay so now i'm just i'm going
to jump out so all the files are there
just highlighted that so the files are
there ready for translation for that
file home dot x ib and a finite jump out
to the finder again I'm sure you won't
notice but home dot x ib is not in this
directory anymore for what is in here is
your en dar el proj which is your source
language Xcode I think sometimes calls
that English Tyrell project but they're
interchangeable and so I've got Ian
Liddell proj de dar el proj we've got
frl proj es for spanish and j for
japanese so so right now this file
system is set up and ready for
translation and if I look inside the en
dar el proj directory I see home dot xib
have I lost people is this making sense
okay good all right so now what i've
done here is i've just jumped right back
in and by magic i have taken all the xib
files excuse me and set them up and you
can see the corresponding language
versions of the different files under
the file name and if i jump out to the
finder and look in the en la del project
directory again I'll see that I have
four files in here ready for translation
so these are my layout files from I'm
halfway there I'm halfway there in terms
of internationalizing the product so now
I'm going to go back to the hard-coded
strings that exists in the bottom file
and these are literally zar string
literals and the code will pick them up
and display them but I need to
facilitate the localized versions of
these so in order to do that you got to
go ahead and create a file called
localizable dot strings you save this
file in the
the resources directory and then you
internationalize this file by setting up
all the languages for this file and
there they are so I've got the five
localizable dot strings file is ready to
be translated into the different
languages and so we're almost there so
let me see what happened here okay so
we're back to the hard-coded string
literals so you need to get rid of each
of these strings there goes one there
goes a piece of another okay so we've
just delete all of those strings and I'm
going to replace them now with the
appropriate call so in Xcode you wrap
the string literal with a call to NS
localized string and I'm not sure if you
can really see this here but I've added
a developer comment to the end the
indication to the translator as to what
this string means so this is very
important for developers to put this
because the layout and how this is
represented is driven by the code as
opposed to the xib formats that we
looked at earlier so it's really
important that you give the context this
is a noun is it a verb and if you can
give some indication as to how much real
estate you have when you translate this
so we're almost there I've marked up at
this stage every hard-coded string in my
xcode project and now apple provides a
nice little tool called jen strings that
you drop out into the terminal and when
you run jen strings it goes in greps
across all the files and puts the
localizable content into a dot strings
file and so that's we're looking at here
right now are the two strings that I
externalize so this is the format that
can be given off safely to a translator
and translated and so if i look out to
the finder now i can see that i have all
the files out here ready for translation
so that was internationalizing or
setting up your Xcode project this
directory here will contain as i said
earlier images and sounds if they need
to be translated as well zip up this
directory and off you go send it over to
the translator get a translator and
bring it back and you'll get back
translations for the es de el projects
were actually
for another project or actually
accordingly whatever languages is set up
populated in their build your app ship
it and make lots of international money
ok any questions on that ok yeah so
you've got to qualify that within your
comment to the to the to the the
translator yeah so you can you can
actually so ok that's a deep question
here so X the gin strings tool will grab
and will consolidate the same meaning
text into one string in the strings file
but you can go in and make it no you can
go in and make it explicit in the code
that it's key 1 equals read as in are
about to read something and key to
equals read also and that's a different
meaning and you'll end up with two keys
in the strings file so you can you can
differentiate between the two with the
next code yes no the NS localized string
is exactly the same but you can't use
gen strings to generate the strings and
the dust drinks file you have to go in
and explicitly named the keys yourself
and then you're into maintaining key
value pairs between your code and
between your strings file so you just
lose the nice functionality of gin
strings and I don't know maybe maybe
there's a parameter in gen strings that
I'm not familiar with that allows for
that but I don't think there is ok I see
JJ not shaking his head so he knows what
I'm talking about what yeah you can be
as explicit with all of your key value
pairs in your code and your gut strings
file as you want because you want yes
yes yes
correct okay so the question is um there
are times where German text gets really
long and it won't fit in the bounding
box or the button defined within code
for displaying that and also the
converse for Japanese where the text
gets so small it's hard to read at a
smaller font size these are problems
that come up through testing and you
know pseudo localization and I'll talk
about that in a few minutes goes a long
way to that it doesn't really address
the font size issues and the balding of
text or the italicize a shin of text
within code and then you put in an
ideogram character and it's just not
legible so QA is really important and we
had that problem in the heart pro app
that I showed earlier where some of the
font sizes were small and the Ilia
graphic characters of Japanese Chinese
and Korean just weren't displayed
correctly so we have to go in and
externalize the font size as a
localizable element and so it depends a
complicated apps you're just going to
have to get a little more clever as to
watch you put into the hands of the
translators and how you convey that
message to the translator to make sure
that it fits yes question over here so
that's a so the question is people are
hard coding their strings into P lists
and what should we do about that and
what should we do about those people
well I have to keep it keep it clean
here this is going out in YouTube and
soapy lists are actually localizable and
you can you can you can make them
localizable and pianist or structured
format they're basically XML and there's
a different various different is there's
not a standard p list you can define it
whatever way you want it's just like XML
once they make those files localizable
right the plist file is going to end up
in this direction that we're looking at
on the screen right now and it just
becomes another file for translation so
I can talk to you operas about this and
give you some pointers and other
questions before I brave the world of
life software demo
okay so just give me a second here while
I fumble about
I don't know what happened there we go
ok
okay so um I thought I was going to show
you the actual project that i had the
screenshots of and here it is i'm we're
going to work in this directory here dog
food demo and you notice here that here
are the xib files that i showed you
earlier i'm going to just go ahead and
launch this project in Xcode and here i
can see some of the the screens and if i
wanted to edit that i could go ahead and
edit that or i could resize a button and
so the different xib files are sitting
here and I'm just going to go ahead and
run this very quickly just to show you
that it is an actual iPad app this here
it is running in the simulator it
doesn't do anything I told you that it
does come down here okay there's no
image loaded I'll load an image and I'll
try to load it again little error
message will come up oh i think there's
some remnants here of some pseudo
translation that's an Xcode problem but
i'll talk about that in a little bit and
the eagle-eyed viewers will notice maybe
i need to scale this up to one hundred
percent that i'm running in French so
this simulator is running in French
Julien can confirm that and the accent
is the correct one and JJ was probably
responsible for translating that so it's
all good i'll be very careful i say here
there's too many people that have had
their hands on all of these apps and all
of these environments okay so um so what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
close this project here and I'm going to
go out and I'm going to demonstrate for
you and a quick tool that we've written
and this is pre-release software this is
not available these api's are not public
but I'm going to run a tool here that
will set up that project that we just
looked at and do all of the clicking for
me if you like it's not clicking but it
will set up the project file for
localization so I have a little tool
here called Tetris sh and so it's just
asking me now for the source the source
script that I'm going to run to do this
I'll pick that it's in this directory
here and now it's going to ask me what
languages i want to add to the project
so this is getting a little bit out what
I think Apple should be doing with in
Xcode themselves not necessary this UI
this is pretty rough but you get the
idea so I'm going to say yes the project
that I just launched a second ago I
wanted I want to translate this into
German i want to add french i want to
add Spanish yes and I want to add
Japanese ok and now i'm going to stop
adding languages now it's going to ask
me this is a little bit reverse logic
but it's going to ask me where is the
actual project and so the project is
sitting out here in this directory
called dog food demo and you'll notice
all the xib files are here at the top
level of this directory and so on so i'm
going to choose that i'm going to
confirm that that's what i want to do
and so what happened was this script
just went right in took the project file
added all those languages set up all the
directories did everything and then it
gripped through all of the code to find
all of the string literals within the
code and it's prompting me here now for
these five strings so if you remember
from the dentist from the from the
screenshots earlier we had no image
loaded and I showed you how that ended
up so it's prompting me here right now
so I'm just going to go ahead and do yes
I want to externalize this this is a
string and I'm going to provide a
developer comment very important so this
is the default message when no image
loaded okay the linguists here would
that be good enough for you to translate
this should I say what else no good
enough I just need to make sure I'm
telling people the right thing to do
when I have these demos okay so the
second one was I want to add this string
to localize it with our strings you can
upload a project that is already loaded
yes I want to externalize this i'm going
to say alert when project already loaded
okay i'm going to have that localize it
without strings okay the next one is
okay the text i tell people don't bother
externalizing okay it depends on that on
the phrasing of the question is whether
the answer is okay or not but for the
purposes of this
demo I'm going to say no so I don't want
to externalize that no image to unload
yes I want to externalize this and this
is an alert when no image to unload okay
and i want to add this string and the
last string is okay and i'm going to say
no that's it I'm done now if I spin
right back out to the finder you'll see
that all of the xib files this script
has moved all the xib files into the
appropriate English tile project
directory jrl project directory and if I
go ahead and launch this project yay
everything's done so the everything has
been set up so that this is localizable
and I've got places placeholders if you
like for the localized files when they
come back from the translator let me go
ahead and close that and if I look in
here now to my English tell project
directory I'll see I have the xib files
that it just automatically picked up and
it went and created the localizable gut
strings file if I open that I see no
image loaded and the developer comment
that I provided the context to give to
the translator and so on so this app is
now ready for translation any questions
on that they don't and so that's that
that's exactly the point is that
everything an apple has a really good
infrastructure for this and as does
android and as those dotnet everyone's
doing what Apple whether i guess the
forerunners in all of this in terms of
localizable resources and script support
and so on way back in the day so that's
exactly what we've done here we have
taken all of these files put them into
the english develop project directory
now localizable got strings it's very
easy to give this to a translator they
know that the key over here shouldn't be
translated and they can translate here
accordingly these are pretty
straightforward strings are no
placeholders in here I didn't put in any
complicated strings but if I if I decide
to open this file here right outside of
the apple tools the apple development
environment it's a big old xml file and
there's only a few strings in here so
that's part of localization engineering
i guess and processing and I'll show
that in a second is it's the extraction
of
localizable content from the format that
it needs to exist in that's where
localization engineering comes in and
the right tools and the right power
source and can you deal with these file
types that make sense sorry correct
correct okay so now what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to run another script
that basically um takes the contents of
this English Darrell project directory
and it's going to send it up to the
tetris service so I'm going to go and
and send this project up there I guess
before I do that I should spin out here
very quickly and go up to the site and
this okay so this is our site it's
actually a test server if any of you
have gone to Tetris com you'll notice
that this is quite different this is
pre-release software and I decided to
take it take a chance on this if it if
it burns if it dies and burns here we're
going to go over to production but I
never liked running and I never liked
running demos on live production and
because I'm on video my team will see me
and if they see me doing demos on live
production then I'll never be able to
tell them not to do it again so um so so
basically pre-release as a mouthful
pre-release software here we're working
with it a great designer called max
shows up in San Francisco knees done a
ton a really good job here on this so
I'm going to go ahead and login to to
Tetris and I'm going to use my username
I hope I'm connected to the Internet ok
so I've been playing with the site today
a few times and I've added a few
different projects here but in my app
section or my dashboard I have four apps
in here so what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to go out and rather than use
the site to go down and zip up the files
or put them into svn and grab them from
within the tetris aight i'm going to
send everything from my disk or for my
project up to tetris i'm using this
script here so forgive the UI this is
very pretty release by the way these
tools that i'm showing here in the
terminal the previous tool that did the
internationalization we're probably
going to open source that there's
there's nothing in there I'd love to
work with Apple to to integrate
something like that into Xcode we're not
building our business on these types of
tools we're really just trying to
facilitate a marketplace for translators
and developers to work together and so
anything that makes it easy for the
developer to go and procure these
translation services this one here again
we probably open source this but what
this tool here is actually going to talk
through an API to our server so a few
options here i'm going to go ahead and
connect to the same server that i just
logged into in the browser okay so it's
going to go and connect to the server
hopefully okay so i'm connected i'm
online and i'm going to choose the
project that i want to send to Tetris
and sending this to Tetris for for two
reasons one is I want to purchase
translations but the main one I'm doing
right now is I want to receive back
pseudo translation for my files so that
I can verify that my app is localizable
and everything that I think I have
externalized designed is localizable and
I'm going to go through that process
with you so I'm going to go ahead now
and pick this dog food demo so this is
the project that we just prepared with
the other script a few min
to go so I'm going to go ahead and
choose that and now I'm just going to go
ahead and upload it to Tetris so I'm
going to choose number four here and
what is prompting me for now what's
prompting for is how do I want to send
this content to Tetris and so as a
developer i can pick svn or zip so if i
had this project under svn source
control with in xcode i could tell this
script could tell check in your english
Darrell approach into your svn location
and then it will tell Tetris that the
svn location is over here prompt you for
the username and password and so Tetris
will pull your content from svn so this
is getting back to the maintenance and
the supporting the continuous
development process for the developer
we're trying to make this as easy for a
developer to get his content over to us
so if he's an svn jockey and he works
way in the terminal all the time and he
finishes writing code and he builds his
appt in life is great all he's got to do
is make sure that in svn and we're ready
to pick that up in process and translate
accordingly so i'm going to do zip file
here so I'll choosy and now i'm going to
go ahead and upload the project so it's
going to go ahead and zip up so it's
just telling me here that it zipped up
the contents of the english style
project directory from that from that
xcode or from the root directory of the
project and now it's asking me which
platform am i using iOS or Mac and this
this has some relevance on our site from
a linguistic perspective but also from
the handling of the file formats and so
on so I'm going to tell if that I'm an
iOS app I'm going to a project name so
just to prove this is life somebody give
me a name I mug 40 ish
ok so the project name is I'm look for
weight so what it's doing right now is
it's taking that zip file and it's
sending it off up to tetris tetris is
receiving it and it's going to start
processing all those files and it's
generating pseudo translation the pseudo
translation method and you'll see it in
a second is we take every vowel in every
string that you present was for
translation and we accent it including
wise and then we elongate the text by
thirty percent and our algorithm is if
it's a single word we add the digits 1 2
3 up to thirty percent to the end of the
string to make it stretch and if it's a
sentence we add the words o NE TW o th
ree out to a thirty percent in terms of
characters so we're just simulating the
translation process when we started out
with the company we were going up to
google and pushing everything through
google translate and doing pseudo german
and we decided not to do that because
sometimes google translate doesn't give
you back it gives you back the same
English so that's a false test in terms
of looking at the app so so really what
our suit of translation process does is
it just touches every string so to prove
that your app is localizable because
what a developer does not want to do is
think he's ready and then send us his
content get it translated and find out
that his app is half translated so the
the issue is not so much a cost issue
it's a time thing so if this guy expects
to do his translation in three days and
comes back after three days in a spent
you know X amount of money and realize
that he's half translated he's going to
come back and spend X again but he's
gotta wait another three days so it's
really a time thing ok so the server is
responded and told me that pseudo
translation is done now what is
prompting me far and I'm not going to do
this it's prompting me do I want to
purchase languages from within you know
this environment and I haven't done
pseudo testing yet so I wouldn't go on
and translate these purchase these
languages i'm going to do that for you
on the server in a little bit so i'm
going to go ahead and say no I don't
want to purchase German and no I don't
want to purchase Spanish no to French no
to Japanese
and that's fine so we leave that sitting
there so now let me spin out and refresh
my dashboard fingers crossed ah there's
the project called imag 408 so what I'm
going to do is click on that now this
site is pre-release we are skinning it
right now so the page i'm about to show
you is not skinned it's fully functional
if it crashes and burns I'll go out to
our production server to demonstrate
another project but the graphics are not
there it's really just a wireframe so
hopefully it's going to go there yes why
didn't I I guess we got some people in
the audience that could take it over
okay so quick okay alright so again this
is not skin but the functionality is
there so what you'll notice here are all
of the files under my English section
which is not properly label because we
haven't scanned it yet and the number of
words that exist in those files so to go
back to what you a scream so let's take
a look at the actual home
hopefully this logo to network here yeah
so there it is so basically sitting on
our server is the actual XML file but
that's of no interest to our translators
and it's no interest to us from a
business perspective if you like so how
do I close this window there we go so
but the thing that's important here is
that there are seven words in this file
and when I click on this little link
here I'll see the set sorry seven string
seven words across probably two or three
strings so this should pop up right now
by the way I guess I should say while
this is happening and this is this is
not a blame question or a blame comment
and everything you see here is running
on Google App Engine so we've built our
business on Google App Engine so
everything here is written in Django all
the code is written in Python our
integration with paypal and everything
it's all running on Google
infrastructure and I'm not making that
comment as an excuse for being slow but
I just wanted to mention the
technologies that we're using and so
here I can see okay I've got a weird
screen resolution here but basically I
can see welcome to dog food username
password and signing so these are the
four strings the seven words out of that
morass of XML so we've done the
localization engineering if you like or
the extraction that's nothing that
Apple's tools can't do like I be tool
will kick out these strings but but we
we have our own parsers to take care of
this and we've also extracted out the
width and height information and what
I'm not showing here is we have font
information as well and this all is part
of the translator experience I'll talk
about that in a little bit yes question
yeah I so I i I'm gonna scroll down and
talk about that right now unless it was
one more question before I go on yes
um no and I guess this was an eternal
debate when I worked here at Google
because I was pressure for a long time
to come up with a good scheme for Arabic
and Hebrew and I used to say well you
know what's a good scheme and so I'm not
knocking the question at all but it is a
difficult one so the pseudo localization
scheme I'll reveal this in a second is
self service to the developer who
doesn't speak the language so you could
add i worked at adobe and we had a great
pseudo localization scheme there and
where you know you put a couple of the
gb 1803 or characters at the beginning
of the strings the one that caused all
sorts of problems and made sure that
they at least displayed but you you
couldn't really affect every every
character with an asian carriage because
you can get lost in your user interface
right format c colon yes or no I mean if
I if I if I take that if I sudo
translate that you can't read it you
can't actually get through your app so I
don't have a good answer to that but you
could we could stick strings at the
beginning of the end and we haven't
created a customizable interface for
this and I don't think we ever well but
if people ask for this we can it's a
simple script because we've done all the
protection of the placeholders we've
done the extraction out of the XML so
now we just we can touch if you like or
affect the actual strings that are going
to be presented to a translator
ultimately okay so
correct correct and so so the question
was are there strings in the xib or dot
ni b files from mac and the answer is
yes and this is a good debate when i go
to developer conferences i have guys
that have absolutely no content
whatsoever in an xib file and everything
is in there doc strings file because
they don't want the hassle of having to
maintain them and that's true because
the tools on Apple the interface builder
does a great job of extracting out all
of the strings but then you lose some of
the layout information you've got to go
in and hand tweak this so guys try right
yes yeah so so what we're doing here and
you'll see in the well we about to run
out of time I just realized that it's a
quarter to nine how we doin Joe okay all
right so let me let me go through this
very quickly so so I go down here and
look at my pseudo translation and I can
see the files and this is machine as in
snot machine translation it's it's it's
a code generated and so if i look at the
strings file for the localizable dot
strings pop this up here we'll see the
the scheme that i was talking about
running a little slow okay what i'll do
is while it's trying to pop that up and
just going to head coil head oops there
I messed it up okay let me just let me
just download the file that might be
quicker okay so the file is downloaded
let me just try this really quickly okay
there we go so no image loaded is
translated to no image loaded with all
of these accented characters and then
the extension 12 and here's a longer
string that's extended by one two three
four so what I did and I'll do this very
quickly is i just downloaded here let me
just do this oops i just downloaded the
pseudo translated files am I going here
I'm going to pick these up
copy and i'm going to go ahead and drop
these into the I'll do the French I'll
do the German locale I'm going to
overwrite all of these files ok so I've
just pseudo localized and so if i go
back now into the project and take a
look at this and if i look at the value
German or French mime just German ok so
here's German so I've sue to localize
these strings ok if i look at the german
for project x ib I'll see the same thing
on load image one on limited to and so
now what we need to do is and what it
xcode can be tricky I'm going to delete
this i'm going to set my locale to
german ok what it switches I'm going to
clean the build sorry I've got to do all
of this is a slight bug in Xcode and
similar in the simulator so now I'm
going to run this and hopefully it will
launch in the German locale and I'll see
all those accented characters so the
idea is that yeah here we are welcome to
dog food 12 so right now I'm looking at
this and I can say yeah my button seems
to you know expand ok I'm not running
off the screen here I'll go into the
project x ib i see no image loaded so
I've touched all of these things tetris
isn't translate it because it's an image
we wouldn't do that for a product name
I'm going to hit load image it load and
I'm going to hit this again and I see oh
now it's externalized so you would play
with the app and if i came across any
string in here that's still on accented
I said wow I forgot that file I'm
pulling something from the database and
so on so basically it's a way to it's a
way to test your app before you actually
go and purchase any translations
yes and and it because it's not accented
and we made that conscious decision in
the script aired its they don't
externalize this so I'm okay with that
but upon sorry it's getting late yes so
um the question was do we have support
for applications that are localized
already I hear myself speeding up
because I know we need to get out of
here at nine o'clock and we can talk
about this afterwards if anybody is
interested yes we built our
infrastructure from day one to allow
people to migrate from you know other
from transit to upload translations they
have already so we will soak in your
English Dowdell project directory was
soaked in each of the language
directories will will align everything
and then we'll put that project into a
state of needs review and so we asked
people to pay for a review of that if
they don't want to with it that's our
own risk but if we're going to engage a
translator who's ultimately responsible
if the quality of the app we want them
to do that review so yeah we have that
facility and there's a nasty bug in
interface builder prior to 3.1 and it
misaligned IDs and so we're dealing with
that for some people but it's fixed now
thankfully example okay so i'm just
going to really really really quickly go
back out here to the server and let's
imagine i uploaded all my pseudo
translated files i tested everything's
good now we'll come back into the site
if i don't have to reload my files i'll
just come in here and add a language and
so i'm going to come in and i'm going to
purchase german add language so it's
going to go and calculate the costs of
translating that and give me a quote
here and i can see it's forty four
dollars by the way this app is not
reflective of a real app I mean it's
like screens with nothing there's two
error messages and four buttons I guess
there could be apps that small but this
is this is not reflective of any
business that we've done and we've done
apps are about a hundred dollars so what
you see here is each of the individual
files and there's a level of translator
that can you can assign and we've got
the standard level translation
professional ultra and none meaning you
can say I don't want this file
translated I happen to upload it but for
this particular language I don't want it
I might need it in another language for
whatever reason so we've full
flexibility what's not in this pop-up
menu is my translator or my group of
translators that I have worked with in
the past like my cousin in Germany or my
friend in Japan or whatever the case may
be and you go in you can add them I
don't have time to show that in the user
interface right now but we do provide
that facility and anything that any
traffic that goes through the site with
that particular person we charge i think
it's four cents a word for that um you
get a break down on the price here and
so if I click on this number it's going
to tell me my papa okay it's going to
tell me that I've six words here the
rate for profession aries 12 cents a
word 72 cents this is the first time
I've done this this project so there's
no leverage words there's no previously
translated words now I'll make the
distinction this is not translation
memory fuzzy matching this is exact
match strings across your projects so if
you're an app developer and you do a nap
with us today and we translated entirely
new put up another appt tomorrow we
leverage the strings from your app from
your first step into your second app
will mark them as such and will advise
that you get them reviewed if you
translate a string today in a button and
and present your say map again in six
weeks and you've changed the string
somewhere else in the app that button is
it's it's it's leverage it's not it's
not leverage its it's actually reuse of
your translation so that doesn't want to
review okay so I realize we've got to go
but I'm just going to very very very
quickly is check out and so I agree to
terms of service and we kick you out to
paypal and you pay before we put the job
into the hands of the translator this is
stubbed out on this service it's not
it's not enabled but I should get to the
next screen
okay so transferring to paypal it's not
actually doing that it's processing and
i'll come back to my apps page see it
processing and then it will hit our
network straight out to our translator
network and while it's doing that I'm
going to launch our translation too so
let me just get rid of this for a second
I hope it's going to work because I do
want to mention this tool here so it's
the tetris interactive localization tool
this app is built on flex and deployed
in adobe air so we built a translation
front end to our server that works
cross-platform and most of the
translators in the world the
professional translators are on windows
because they use travis they may be
iphone owners but they may not have a
mac so we built a tool that's that's
platform independent it's a matter of
switching this to a flash-based deployed
in the browser if we want but what we've
built it as an installable tool so i'm
going to log in here very quickly
because i want to give you a quick look
at the translator experience so i'm
logging in as a master translator here
that should see all the jobs that are on
the server just quickly yeah oh let's
see maybe maybe not yeah there it is so
there's imag 4-week project appeared on
the network it's an english to german
translation for files there the number
of words so as a translator I go and
take that off the network comes into my
inbox it's taken out of circulation so
somebody else can't grab it and then I
basically have a WYSIWYG translator in
here so if i open up let's see a good
file here so here's yes here's a file
load image so I'm going to basically
type in de underscore load image as the
translation that is complete and my
order scroll is not really working but
there is the text and so now the onload
image if I have the e unload
and as a translator if I see that this
is not going to fit I can actually let's
see if I can do this oh there it is like
poop okay it snaps not working but I can
basically resize images over here and
this is independent of the Mac
development tools so i mentioned earlier
that if you want to use xcode you've got
to have a Mac you gotta run x co what
we've done for all the layout files all
the xib files we built this WYSIWYG
editor to allow the translators do in
effect the localization engineering for
those files so this is kind of the
debate if you don't put your files if
you don't put your localizable content
into xib files we can't empower the
translators and we've got contacts
issues so you got to give good developer
comments so it swings and roundabouts
well I'd like to say the developers is
use XIV as much as you can the context
is there the layout is there the flow is
there and so on ok I am I would
ordinarily submit this back to the
server release it to QA and then the
developer downloads is build it into his
app and away he goes and again if it's
an svn he gets a notification that is
back in svn he just sinks to svn and
downloads so really what you know what
I've tried to show here is that we were
very simple interface at the front end
to get the content into our service and
then we very quickly get it over to our
translators there's no file handling
there's no files back passing back and
forth that no uploading and downloading
there's no emails and so on it is all
truly in the cloud and you know this
this overhead is what allows us to do
things that the price we're doing and
hopefully at the efficiency and the
expediency that developers want for
these small projects so we do projects
in anything from 48 hours to you know 72
depending on the number of words but not
too much back and forth just go to the
network and take it down so let me just
grab very quickly my closing slides and
then I'll get off the stage yes and so
we flashed by it very very quickly there
and I should have pointed it out on that
screen we charged thirty nine dollars
and ninety-nine cents to initiate a
language on our service so if you buy
four languages that's four times thirty
nine dollars and ninety-nine cents we
have different word rates comparable
with any localization company out there
in terms of the
price per word that we charge and we
have a minimum nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents per job so if you
purchased three words from us today with
a thirty nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents initiation fee it's thirty nine
dollars and ninety-nine cents + 3 x 12
right if you come back in a week's time
and you've got two words that need to be
translated that's going to be 24 cents
we pay us nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents so we can't bring translators in
for anything less than nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents so we have a minimum
so where we try to encourage developers
to be disciplined about when they get
updates and compare now building
everything up into a job that's sizeable
so let me just get the closing slides
and then I think we're done okay so I'm
not going to belabor the solution I
think it should be pretty obvious from
the demo as to what we do here are just
some of our customers today I'm not
going to talk about them because we're
stuck for time but I just want to leave
you with a couple of closing closing
remarks so developers and developers in
the audience you know sign up for a free
account with Tetris there's no charge to
create an account there's no charge to
get the pseudo localization and an test
to localize ability of your app we do
offer today and we've been doing this
since we started free french for your
first appt up to about 1500 words it's
not because we think french is a cheap
language we just happened to have people
on staff who can do this and and it is
one of the i'm careful there's a French
person in the audience right over there
and you know and come along then and
purchase languages and like we say in
our little tagline we do want to unlock
global sales for the translators no come
in and join our network start
translating get out there and get those
apps into the non-english speaking
consumers of the world we hope to build
an ecosystem where you know we put the
kudos out there for the people that do
the translation i think a lot of times
translators are the unsung heroes in
jobs nobody knows who translated googles
apps nobody knows who translated
microsoft apps but i think the community
and the environment that people live in
today and the apt eval
first we'd like to we'd like to go out
there and give them the kudos for that
and so so jump on board and then I
didn't really talk about this but a
quick one for localization companies so
we'd like to talk to some small
localization companies who might see the
value in using this service come in and
partner which is with us we have
enterprise level pricing for use of this
service and so we're interested in
talking to people who might have people
they translate websites for or bigger
content but the apps they're small it's
may be hard to make a dollar out of
those apps because of the process that
you use but I think that we've got a
service that will allow people to link
the small app developers with the
translators in an efficient and
cost-effective manner so that's it I
hope you enjoy the thought thank you and
