going to be try to be short because
we're running a little bit late and then
there is a talk after us so today we're
going to have a talk about I don't know
alternative energy I think it's
important I think if we really want to
make a dent in co2 we need to be looking
at some serious stuff as well
and for this purpose we have today
doctor job remedy and he is a NASA chair
professorship he held that NASA chair
professorship position at the Naval
Postgraduate School he worked at NASA
for 10 years as a technology manager
lead systems engineer nuclear specialist
and propulsion researcher it's basically
a rocket science guy he there managed
managed the emerging propulsion
technology area for in Space Systems the
Marshall air launch team as well as a
variety of other power and purpose
propulsion assignments after earning a
doctorate degree in mechanical
engineering from University of Alabama
in Huntsville he spent several years as
a research scientist and senior research
engineer at the UAH propulsion rizal
Research Center where he served as a
principal investigator and manager for
the solar thermal laboratory he has
worked as a senior mechanical designer
at Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney supporting aircraft
engine manufacturing and at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory within the
laser fusion program his graduate from
the United States Military Academy I
think you'll find out that he knows what
he's talking about and I am eager to
hear what he has to say so please give
him a warm welcome
thank
thank you that was a great introduction
it's a blessing to be here I have a lot
of material to go over so I'm going to
suspense with some of my normal comments
and jokes and go right to it
I planned to be talking about this in
context the fusion but I'm going to hold
back some comments for there to get
through the material and get to
questions one note in the beginning I'm
come here as an individual I don't
represent any agency or organization
there's a loose-fitting group of people
around the country mainly specialists
technologists that are interested in
this field both in energy in particular
thorium and that we all have day jobs
fortunately good-paying jobs for the
most part and so we come to give this
information out freely and examine this
idea and the use of thorium as an energy
source outline just going to mention
that I talked about systems engineering
as I've taught that as well as my
thermodynamics and nuclear background
you'll see a little bit of that some
assumptions I'm assuming that most
people understand that in any crisis its
global in nature it's nobody's got a
quick fix at least nobody would agree is
what the quick fixes thorium is not
going to be commonly known especially as
an energy source increased electrical
capacity is very important to the
overall energy consumption and the last
thing is energy equates the state or the
standard of living and one of the last
green energy forms I was at listening to
they equated to 58 slaves if you will
working full-time at hard labor 365 days
a year
for each person United States you can
see that that level of energy is what
gives us a standard of living this light
comes from Lawrence Livermore
Laboratories it's one that I would spend
a long time on I think it has a lot of
great points to be made I just say that
if you don't know what a quad is 10 to
the 9th BTUs
it's a blot of energy and if you just
take all the energy we have in the
United States and break it up into a
hundred you get 100%
you can see oil is around 40% and that
line is the thickness equivalent to that
you can see that most people would say
we want to increase these Desirables
okay and notice the Desirables are
pretty thin and it's kind of hard to
increase them these are the ones we
probably want to phase out more as well
as less oil and we have huge energy
losses and electric tricity production
about 25% efficient overall conservation
is great do it at home most engineers if
they don't have to create any entropy
increase interpreting the universe they
would like to minimize that but at the
same token you can see that we've paid
the price up here and that conservation
as much as we want to there's not a
whole lot of gains there in these two
areas the other thing is if you notice
right here you can't make that line go
to zero thermodynamics says you always
have to have a cold sink you always have
to move energy one example I talked
about is wind that you can put up a
windmill and you put another wind male
behind it and you can extract a little
more energy and slow that air down but
there's a fundamental limit if you put
too many of them in there you not only
get the last one to not move because
there's no airflow okay you've actually
affected all the windmills in front of
it until you get no energy so there's a
fundamental limits to thermodynamics you
always have to have some loss there and
of course most people will consider that
you want to increase the the electricity
flow into cars or transportation areas
as well so what you really want to do is
if you can't grow these things fast
enough on the the order of this size you
really want some new energy source
something big something you know it
comes in can be readily built and
provide that that very big wide line
something like fusion right everybody
would like to see that well I'm here to
talk about thorium and whether thorium
can be that line and also what's the
best way to extract that energy
now without getting to a lot of details
you can take a little bit of thorium put
it in a normal reactor and you get some
benefits out of it okay
but it's not an end all and it doesn't
extract all the energy out of that that
thorium that you'd like to and it
doesn't mitigate all the problems you
have with today's nuclear power
thorium just for background is an
element 1828 was discovered it is
slightly radioactive got a very long
half-life that's why it's around and it
provides a background radiation along
with uranium most of it comes from that
just a little bit of thorium that's
always around in the soil and in rocks
and minerals the only thing I'm going to
say here is that thorium is not really
commercially used for for anything of
much these days it is a metal it's got a
very wide liquid rain some other
interesting properties I'm not going to
go into any other details to know that
commercially it's not a big deal now
this is a log scale of what's available
in europe's crust and you see that the
beginning you have oxygen silicon
aluminum down here at 100 parts per
million in this box here you have copper
in the middle and towards the bottom you
got lead and thorium and you can see
expanded this little area out uranium is
about four times less than four in boron
which some talks have even at google
have talked about fusion using boron
alright it's there it's readily
available but what's interesting is the
uranium that you're really interested
the one fissile material actually split
is way down here orders of magnitude
less so thorium on a theory a
theoretical basis United States at about
20% of the world's reserve to put this
in perspective one would say if you
replace all the energy electrical energy
generation United States that you saw
before and I'm not suggesting we do that
a lot of other energy sources will play
but that's about 400 metric tons one
mine can produce about 40 hot 500 metric
tons per year you can see that's ten
times the amount the United States is
actually the government is buried a
bunch of
thorium they didn't know what to do with
it after paying for it and storing it
they just put it in the ground literally
in these casts you can imagine that's
even at this this huge amount energy
usage that lasts 8 to 10 years in a
practical sense this would last this
probably 25 to 50 years and you
certainly have plenty of thorium
available around the world that's not
enough like fusion we can go to moon
difference is there we don't have to
mine the entire surface looking for it
thorium gives a nice signal and you can
detect that from space and so we can map
it and where the hot spots are you know
that there's a pretty good thorium
deposit there same with Mars so we know
that's out there in the asteroids
thousands of years worth of power now
because my systems engineering
background a little bit of the flavor
I'm going to give you is in the vein of
how do you select things or systems
engineering criteria and this comes from
the aerospace that about 80% of a
project's life costs and benefits are
going to be locked in the first initial
decisions you make and that that pretty
much for all technology especially
high-tech tactile technologies that
holds pretty well true 70 90 percent
somewhere in there and the reason is it
sets your theoretical limits it also at
the time you have your least real-world
knowledge of how you're going to build
or how you're going to go about doing
this project so you the thing I try to
teach is you look for the inherent
Barron says something untouchable at
least true reasonably untouchable and a
growth factor that your concept will
will gain and exceed what your goals are
so let's take nuclear technology receive
today you know list the pros and cons if
I shown here most people recently have
looked at you know no greenhouse
emissions and that's because in this
case about third comes from electricity
and the far majority of that is coal
nuclear doesn't have that now to be very
honest one would have to and analyzable
how much resources does all this make
when I go to build a plant and how much
co2 do I produce in the case of a
nuclear energy there is some but over
the lifetime and the amount of enter
you nuclear plant produces this is
probably pretty a fair game to say it
produces no co2 but it's something you
need to be honest about and compare what
if you could take some of the cons out
of the air the safety fears and long
terms de nobility and terrorist or
proliferation issues and make them go
away or at least minimize them sounds
like what fusion wants another thing on
systems engineering is a concept of
power density and efficiency can't go
through all these but obviously land
usage you know the maintenance costs
anything that you have to deal with the
overall cost of the lifetime of project
smaller is not just convenient
it drives ninety percent of the time it
drives the cost and therefore at least a
social cost maybe not in a particular
market but across the board it usually
does and you'll see that that's very
important for power density and
efficiency an example that comes into
mind is the cost material labor and then
had the distance from the end-user and
all these other factors that factored in
not going to go into a big detail that
this is you know information that's
available and then readily been talked
about natural gas turbine engines is
about one tenth the amount of Steel for
example a nuclear plant the nuclear
plant is actually pretty good compared
to some of the others but you see that
in recent years what are we building
we're building these very very expensive
difficult gas using machines that are
pretty high-tech yet we're building more
of those why well because overall the
resource is necessary to produce that
and to meet the demand now makes you go
for these things and that's what that's
what's been happening
so in the light of the what Fusion
wanted to be safe
alliteration resistance etc that was one
of the jokes today we have basically
large plants although there were a
couple of google talks that talking
about making fusion in a way that's
smaller I I would love that to happen
but basically we've got these very large
plants and of course they use a lot of
they produce a lot of energy but they
also absorb a lot of energy and
producing the energy so your net gain is
not as good as you would want kind of
get into the history as well as the
physics at the same time and talking
through a little bit about thorium and
why we ended up with the lifter concept
three basic nuclear fuels everybody
should know you know uranium-235 is
what's naturally found that's what we
can start with these two have to come
from fertile material we have to make
them they're not found in nature and in
history everybody was working on weapons
and so you have an enrichment facility
you need a weapon design you need
fabrication techniques for the uranium
238 you need a neutron source which also
usually starts with the uranium-235 you
chemicals separate you need a new weapon
design new fabricating techniques get a
slightly better bum so I will say on
that and thorium
well they've discovered you need the
same thing you need with the uranium 238
chemical separation but then there's
some contaminant in this usually in
which go to an enrichment facility but
it's a hot enrichment silly you need a
new weapon design and new fabrication
techniques to get the same kind of bomb
well obviously these two are what the
world has chosen to work on well at the
same time most of the people that worked
on those projects also were good people
trying to say what good Queen do besides
weapons and electricity production was
one of them early on and they had the
same problem they had the same materials
to start with you need a rich Mint or
heavy water production a new fuel design
okay a little bit different but it's
still solid fuel fabrication and then
electrical power I say short term
electrical
power because at the time they really
underestimated how much uranium-235 was
in the world there was a little bit more
than they actually are counting for
originally but at world usage at the
u.s. levels it's still a very true
statement to say you know there will be
peak uranium if you if you base
everything on your rhenium to 35 well
you can go with breeders fast spectrum
breeder reactor you need some
sophisticated controls we'll talk about
that in a little bit more of some fuel
design and you get electrical power but
you also get a whole lot more production
of plutonium which can use for a nuclear
power and run other reactors reduce
electricity or of course you can use
that for weapons
thorium on the other hand looks a little
different each time thermal spectrum
chemical processing and you get
electrical power very hard to get any
extra out of it you know explain that
here Enrico Fermi argued for the Petone
ium based economy essentially and one of
the reasons you get three neutrons on
average per fission and the real key
number you want to look at is this blue
line and that is the number of neutrons
that come for absorption and you need at
least two you need one to split and one
to breed your next fuel and so in
reality you need a little bit more than
that because losses through the reactor
got to make it reasonable so you have to
work this thing it doesn't work here at
all in the thermal spectrum you have to
work up here in the near the what I call
the bomb spectrum okay you're using the
fast neutrons coming off off the reactor
from the Ephesians you're not slowing
them down in a thermal in a thermal
sense and you can see that this number
really climbs very good which means you
get a whole lot more than two which
means you get production of plutonium so
you can use it for production between
well Eugene Wigner at the time argued
well you know it's great for weapons but
we really want to base our economy on
thorium it's more available and more
important it runs on the Neutron
spectrum the thermal spectrum such that
it's a lot safer a lot easier to control
you
can you know use these reactors this is
a very difficult reactor a very touchy
reactor to work but of course it doesn't
produce much because you see the average
from the fission is only two and a half
and the actual absorption averages a
little bit below that okay so you're
above two which is enough but with real
real losses
you're not going to breed a whole lot of
extra material out of this out of this
system well historically what do we do
we went from weapons to the Nautilus
there is a Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace
program which was trying to say well we
spent all this money we want to look a
little bit better and eyes of the world
let's produce electricity but you're
using the same infrastructure the same
people the same needs and desires you
pour it into here to at shipping port
was our first electrical plant and sure
enough that is the base product for our
surface ships so a little bit of
entangled air wasn't exactly Atoms for
Peace and conventional sense of what's
the best way to produce electricity well
is that a good a bad decision well I'm
not sure I want to sit here and debate
that but you know at the time urgency a
war the fact that the weapons were
unsophisticated designs you needed a lot
of material for it
the delivery systems were horrible okay
and so you needed a large number to be a
credible defense safety environment
those kinds of things weren't considered
as much compared to today obviously with
very efficient designs ICBMs are highly
accurate the need to scale down we
almost have too much material for
weapons and of course safety environment
proliferation issues are the big
concerns maybe it was right then maybe
wrong today people can decide that well
in the tail of the nuclear reactor
thorium engineers don't want to give up
when they see a good idea they dog it
even though programmatically and the
money and the funding was completely cut
off they went around they said look
airforce you don't you don't have ICBMs
yet you need a credible defense to get
your weapons out there something they
could fly a long time how about this
nuclear airplane now the only way that
this would ever do normal reactors if
you have a liquid reactor
and so they started a program I sold the
air force on it as crazy it is and I
understand that somebody recently has
said something in England I believe
about this I would not like to see
nuclear planes as our base of commercial
flight I can talk about that at some
other time for the reasons for that but
this reactor program started out they
did 100 hours a high-temperature I
believe that maybe the the still a
record certainly for the overall reactor
running that long that hot and that's
1,500 degrees Fahrenheit very much
hotter than most reactors can run two
things that came out of this one of the
fission products were naturally removed
as you were pumping at it which was
really nice and get rid of the poisons
and to the load following capability
which was essential for the airplane
application in the fact that you wanted
to throttle something without control
rods have instant response from the
reactor and then throttle back if you
needed to to get your power this reactor
in the fluid
method was able to do that
unconventional or conventional reactors
well that program guide pretty quickly
as soon as the Air Force realized they
could do the job much better with
missiles missile program was went full
ahead and and that one was canceled the
engineers still wouldn't give up okay
they hunkered down in Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in a small program but they
ran a small program from 65 to 1969 and
the main thing I'll say about this when
I go to great details of the molten salt
reactor experiment was the fact that
they ran it 24 hours a day three shifts
every day but nobody wanted know the
engineers wanted to stay for the weekend
so they shut it down on Friday night and
they started up regularly on Monday
morning something that's totally you
know not even thought about today and
nuclear power plants it is a base load
when it goes down it goes down for a
long time you don't get to restart it
the end result today most people think
of molten salt has this gigantic reactor
something very large they even have some
control rods and so large single fluid
which means
your thorium is thrown in with uranium
and in the reactor itself and you do you
do have a processing system you have a
freeze plug which I'll show a little bit
later and you have this Brayton
closed-cycle turbine system unlike steam
that that is a an advantage this idea
well if this was so good and the common
question is why wasn't it done well
hopefully I kind of hinted at that along
the way the establishment of the
plutonium industry and and the needs
there the fact that this is a liquid
system it's daunting it's it's different
than just nuclear energy it's a lot of
chemistry involved there's an existing
mindset that had to be broken and dr.
Weinberg who also hones the patents for
the reactors we have today who helped
basically train Admiral rickover and
suggested what the reactor for the
Nautilus was he was hoping that this
reactor which he worked on for a long
time would be the eventual power reactor
technology that would use for
electricity another person is memoirs
deputy director at Oakridge also pointed
out that it was a no bridge project and
therefore it was considered just their
own pet project it was very hard to
break out of that mold again the
existing bureaucracy I've heard a lot of
talks on the fusion as well the same
kind of mindset we're trying to break
what the common large program has in the
government all right why is it so
different liquid core I mentioned that
the fact that is thorium and that you
have this chemical processing system and
you can see at room temperature this is
a crystal it is a salt and when you heat
it up it becomes a liquid a little bit
thicker than watering pump it around
last thing on the history at rickover in
his program he managed to put together a
gigantic organization to build not only
the Nautilus but the whole nuclear Navy
and it stands today he's done a very
good job as far as establishing safety
record the Navy
excellent than that would understand
heron tea it's not found in the reactor
it's found in the very strict rules the
blind obedience the very well trained a
long long trained process that you have
to do with the sailors that run these
reactors so here's the path that we take
in the typical nuclear reactor with this
giant vessel the question is if we made
the best decision then are we making the
best decision now and I'm going to then
propose that lifter is something that is
what fusion promises some technical
details lifter is a technology or
architecture of a technology I should
say it's not a specific design but it
has certain design characteristics two
fluids the fact its atmospheric pressure
very low pressure on the vessel it's
going to be high temperature it's going
to have chemical extraction I'll explain
why that's necessary thermal spectrum
and then the closed cycle Brayton system
instead of steam the reason why you have
this is the chart of the nuclides the
reason why we have to have extraction is
that thorium with this is protons 90
absorbs a neutron becomes thorium 233
which beta decays in 22 and a half
minutes everybody know what beta decay
is a ghost protactinium protract inium
27 days half-life it also beta decays
and becomes your fizzle full fuel
uranium 233 that's what you want to get
in your reactor for your now what if we
leave the thorium I mean the the
plutonium in the reactor this is what
happens you get the same beginning you
get thorium beta decaying to
protactinium but now you have the
problem of absorbing in a second Neutron
which is fairly highly likely and seven
and a half hour or seven hour half-life
it will also debate a decay to uranium
234 which is not Fazal now you could
absorb yet another
Neutron here and jump to 235 and with
another neutron split the 235 but
obviously that chain is using way too
many neutrons and the reactor would stop
under that of those conditions and
there's all these probabilities of how
much absorption and there are other
decay methods that you have to take into
account so that's the main reason why
you want to take out the protactinium
out of the reactor so the architecture
for lifter starts out with the minimum
core of fissile material that's that's
hot the four corners just kind of
reminded the the basic print is what are
you trying to the goals you're trying to
get to which is a safe compact reactor
or something that proliferation
resistance waste reduction covers that
amount of electricity you need that
great big blue line and do it quickly as
well as cost-effective being effective
connecting to the grid so the core is
just hot you pump it in and out drive
the turbines understand that the blanket
around it reflects the neutrons back in
or the thorium that's in the blanket
absorbs and becomes your protactinium
you have to take out the protactinium
here's the chemistry and then let it
decay and then that produces the u-233
and you can actually extract the
products the fission products and other
things out of the reactor as it's
running in this liquid state look at the
inherent advantages again systems
engineering everybody has desired goals
and you kind of specifically list or one
of those goals were the cost well it's a
low fuel price low capital costs long
life low maintenance those kinds of
things transportation you break those
all down and you trace out what your
inherent properties are to those and you
see whether they're you're matching up
or you're getting what you really want
to so if we pick a couple of these
here's liquid core you've got
homogeneous mixing which means you
nanami hot spots which is real concern
in conventional reactors one spot gets
hotter and it continues to get hotter
until you have a melt them you get to
burn up all fuel because it's constantly
being moved around
in the reactor and no fuel shutdowns
because you can fuel this continuously
the expandability of the fluid gives you
a large negative temperature coefficient
which is where your safety is at no
separate cooling system that's one less
system and big thing is the safety the
fact that if your there is no coolant to
get rid of in order to have a meltdown
or a problem and of course drainable and
I'll give you an example of that if you
have this very small reactor core and
you leave a tube out there and this is
very hot liquid as long as you keep that
at room temperature by blowing some air
across that or in this case helium for
stealing tubes that salt will freeze and
it'll make a plug if you got a crack in
this thing actually it will leak out and
probably seal itself depending on how
the design of this is but the point is
is if you lose power if anything happens
somebody throw a grenade in this thing
this or this gets hot too hot for any
reason that plug will always melt and
drain into a passive pan which is going
to hold the heat and the radiation if
everything is okay just heat it back up
or or even turn it right back on and
it's liquid say it takes a little while
for that heat to dissipate and you can
pump it back in startup so instead of
being like really cautious about
shutting down your reactor because
you'll blackout half the neighborhood or
whatever and take days or months if not
years to restart you can go ahead and
and shut things down and go I it was
just a mistake and immediately go back
online so actually there's an inherent
safety in there because you can use your
safety system all the time actually I
need to go back all right
no thorium thorium Vantage's here that
it was abundant mentioned that and the
fact that it's not fissile okay it means
it's not weapons usefulness in which
case the less terrorist interest again
goes to cost and safety security can't
explode look at the uranium cycle
compared to the thorium cycle you start
out with a whole lot more mining with
the uranium cycle you have a whole lot
of yellowcake that you make everybody
recognize that but then you got enriched
that and then make these pellets very
expensive process the security to do
this process is very expensive much less
the actual process you end up with a
whole bunch of depleted uranium still
useful in some ways and and not useful
in others so i don't know what people
are doing with that other than letting
it sit on the ground it doesn't go to
Yucca Mountain you need a very big plant
you as I saw before you a very large
reactor with a vessel that can hold up
all the steam or any explosion that can
happen here is a very high pressure big
turbine plant next to it and you produce
a whole lot of spent fuel and you need
Yucca Mountain for 10,000 years the
thorium cycle you need one ton this is
for the same amount of energy one
gigawatt for one year much smaller plant
low low pressure the Brayton ZAR much
smaller much more efficient as much as
50 percent efficient or better compared
to about 35% best you can do for steam
one ton of fission products but the big
deal here is that in within 10 years
most of that 83% is going to be back
down to safe radio background levels
which means you can take those products
which actually produced in the reactor
there's some very interesting things you
can get out of that and you sell some
high quality materials and the remain
air only needs 300 years approximately
for storage which you can imagine that
the finding in many places around the
world that can handle that and you can
imagine making storage vessels that are
you know caskets second last 300 years
well proliferation risk one of the
things that happen with this particular
process with the lifter
process as we see it there's going to be
a little contamination of uranium-232
you just can't help it I'll show you
that in a minute and it has a decay
chain gets down to thallium 208 which
has a hard gamma emitter which makes it
very nasty stuff to deal with this is
where the uranium gets in the 232
becomes there certain reactions that can
happen I don't have time to go through
the details if you have one percent of
rhenium 232 in the material and you're
holding it you have about 30 or 3
minutes I believe with less than 3
minutes before you get your full 5 REM
dose which is considered you know your
top level I think it's within a half a
note within a half an hour you're
feeling the effects of radiation
poisoning and a couple and within two
hours you're probably likely to die so
it's very hard to handle
it also means separation if a nation
wanted to use this was material for
weapons it would be a hot enrichment
environment to deal with the radiation
hurts the electronics as well as the
explosive material within the the weapon
so they don't there long not very
long half-life as far as the the
shelf-life of the other react of the
bombs so on the fluoride salt itself
ionic chemical stability is very
important and I'll show that in a minute
the fact that it's very high temperature
and low vapor pressure means you run
very high temperatures and again each
one of these things room set temperature
solid like I explained before leak
resistance etc so look at the radiation
damage and a conventional nuclear
nuclear reactor it's going to have
cladding all the temperature and heat is
built up within that cladding and that
cladding can't break so or you lose the
noble gases the Krypton and other things
which are radioactive and so you end up
having to pull out this this
or all the time and not burn up all the
fuel because there's physical damage
being done to the solid whereas if it's
ionically bonded in a liquid the ionic
bonds don't care they're going to move
around as they need to and reassemble
and you always have that ability to to
withstand a lot of punishment in the
reactor another point of this is that
the salts are actually very low
corrosion and the way to briefly
demonstrate that here's a typical salt
in the reactor and the larger the number
the better - 104 and this is the free
free energy Gibbs free energy here
chemists will say you need a difference
of 20 between it and let's say a wall
material or a vessel material such as
here's iron and you can see that's about
double the difference between those two
so it's pretty chemically stable
considered almost a noble chemical
reaction in the reactor
internal processing we have a minimal
physical inventory so the reactors small
there's no fuel fabrication obviously
that drives a lot of your cost and a big
thing is you can extract both poisons
and valuable materials out of the
reactor
there's a little more detail than the
one I had before what you're doing is
you're pumping out of the core and you
fluoride just for a gas through this
salt and all the uranium products are
going to come out as a rhenium
hexafluoride which means it's a gas and
you pull it out and reintroduce any of
the reigneth not burned into the reactor
the rest of the salt goes through you
get back some distillation get out the
fission products and what's left here is
you can separate this and this would
probably take an economic analysis of
how much time and effort would you do to
separate these things do you do them in
a central location plant when you take
little bottles every once in a while out
and essentially process or do you
incorporate it like you do the actual
breeding process within the reactor
itself this is what all be
self-contained in a reactor vessel the
blanket on the other hand comes out and
I like to think that is it's a reactive
extraction column if chemists it's like
a catalyst but they say that's a bad
word so don't use it and well to me it's
a catalyst than in nature in fact that
you put in the thorium up here and the
thorium will go back into the blanket
salt and replace the protactinium which
can be extracted out and put in a
decayed tank same thing here you just
flow gas through that floor on gas all
the uranium that's produced whenever
it's produced is able to be put in back
into the salt and back into the core
and very quickly on the close cycle
Brayton just to say that it could be
air-cooled heat rejection as well as
variable in prep pressure allows you to
play with the size and the efficiency of
the system and this just shows this is
the advanced boiling water reactor
typically looked at and again very large
building and how you do these things the
lift of concept would be very much
smaller the whole reactor core would be
something that size with the tire
Brayton system not much bigger a
magician shows again the difference in
size of a comparison of a Brayton system
versus steam plant and some of the
listing of reasons why you would think
that the cost of this whole system would
be a significantly less than existing
nuclear power plants well the
disadvantages I think I explain some of
these it's unknown it's going to be
different from what the existing
infrastructure is going to support it
does need a charge of uranium 233 or
some other physical material we suggest
doing that because they keep the whole
reactor clean and here's a comparison
basically I've covered most of these
everything from the waste relative waste
130th 10,000 years versus a 300 years
the fact that you can burn almost 100
percent versus 1 1 percent the best
reactors are planning a couple of
percent maybe 2/3 of the total fuel
usage as well as being higher efficiency
lower pressure air water cooled and the
unique applications this should scale
down as well as scale up if you want to
make large plants but it also could
scale onto the back of a semi-trailer
that size typical it would obviously be
very advantage to the Navy because even
in their smaller vessels they can't
build these their existing reactors to
fit into the littoral ships that they
have we like to talk about submerged
units because they're really not seen
you put them in rivers and they're very
small very vulnerable to attack or other
things and then if you really want to
use other processes high temperature
directly from the reactor is very useful
for one is mobile it can go to a site
for shale oil extraction it's a couple's
very well with desalinization for water
processes hydrogen production as well
because of the high-temperature nature
of the reactor core so hopefully I've
covered a brief background these are the
main things that we try to achieve with
the technology those are the driving
goals and then how you actually put the
react together so the specific details
are driven by by what you're trying to
get out of it and the the primary reason
why most people look at thorium is
because of the unique nature of being
able to produce a huge amount of energy
for very small amount of resources per
megawatt being produced and can readily
be put together fairly quickly so this
time I'll I'll take questions yeah
reinjection report how do you keep the
232 other than I mean it seems it to
introduce 232 and something you don't
want to go anywhere near the the what
happens to the core when you introduce
the to 33 and the 232 in the in the
reactor core well first of all a reactor
any reactor is very very hot you can't
go near it
it's going to have a lot of radiation
going on so adding the 232 in there is
not making any significant difference in
the overall radioactivity in the core
itself technically it is a small poison
it's it's in there but it's very small
trace amount it's when you take it out
that unless you separate it out you
always have a hot uranium and the
difference is the separation is chemical
separation versus the uranium 233 which
is what you want for the weapon and
uranium 232 which produces this gamma
all the time and it's the k chain has to
be done with separation techniques that
are more common to weapon development
did I get the question right and three
is actually part of the process so
materials you would use for example as
part of the plumbing we run into
problems in particular plant becomes
contaminated with some 232 know again
the question it was is there a issue
with the 233 232 in the reactor core or
as it comes out through the piping
because of this radioactivity the decay
products in the reactor overwhelm that
there's just one small source the reason
why it's significant for proliferation
issues is the fact that it's hard to
separate because it's from the stuff you
want because it's still uranium
chemically as far as the reactor itself
any of the pumping the pipes and
everything else is going to see some
level of radioactivity just because of
the decay products those decay products
what's nice about this reactor are
always kept at a minimum because you can
take them out
the gases anything like Krypton or
whatever comes out in the pumping
process so it's actually a cleaner
reactor if you want inside the reactor
and where's antair radioactivity wise
less yes
estimated cost for the consumer say
wholesome price or retail prices
what are the barriers to pursue what is
the price at the meter at the end of all
this we haven't gotten that far in
economic development of what that would
be the argument here is that the
technology and the research has been
done and there is a systems engineering
point of view that you will say it will
be less expensive exactly we're
estimating 22 I think I said 30 to 50%
less a more specific design remember
everything's being done on everybody's
own time this is a grassroots effort
that you know we hope that somebody
whether the government or somebody else
wants to pick this up it's all free
knowledge but that's a great question
they answer the other part of the
question was cost electricity and then
you're very basically well
oh what a merit to put this together a
couple of them one of them would be that
you know you nuclear industry is run by
the government you're gonna have to get
government blessing on something unless
you leave the United States or whatever
there are other countries that are
looking into thorium but again not
significantly and so I think the barrier
is a you know those type of things it is
a nuclear process and you're going to
have to deal with the proper regulations
to meet that
negative read yeah we go back this time
the basically it's it's the ability of
the reactor to respond in producing less
power as the temperature goes up so as
the reactor core a normal reactor when
the temperature goes up okay
there's usually the the core temperature
would II call it is moderated with the
water and you get less power being
produced okay
maybe you flow more water through the
reactor for example this expands itself
the core being liquid squeezes out the
less density you have the less fuel you
have in the reactor therefore the less
energy you can produce so it's thermal
is it's based on thermal expansion and
how much fuel you're actually having the
reactor the same token if your
generators are producing more
electricity because there's a higher
demand it sends back that fluid colder
which is denser and therefore it will
have more energy and it is a natural
process within the reactor itself that's
a common nuclear you know I guess
determination how safe a reactor is is
how how good that coefficient is yes
what are the engineering challenges are
called like it strikes me that you know
puffing extremely hot and both senses of
the word solve through pipes and pumps
and such
to do that we built one of these great
the engineering challenges I guess is a
question pumping hot salts to pipes and
and those kinds of things we do that on
a regular basis in industry a lot of
processes a lot of industrial processes
use the same kind of hot salt a chemical
industry uses so there's precedents
there pump manufacturers that do that
kind of thing
the temperatures are hot but but not you
know something that's not done every day
in commercial industries the obviously
the safety requirements for everything
you are talking about a nuclear reactor
it's going to have to be really good
pumps and and the paperwork is a mile
high to make sure those pumps are you
know adequate but again even if the pump
failed it doesn't it you can drain the
tank and it will naturally get hot if
the pump stops pumping the core will get
hot overheat pour out into your tray and
and stop it for you so if there's
nothing inherently that industry can't
do it is a big systems engineering
problem to make one that's
cost-effective that's safe and meets all
requirements and that all the little
details were taken care of but nothing
that we've seen yes getting for reactor
development thing
this is one of them but tell us a little
bit about what that is like 20 times
this get funded or the involving say
thicker you know okay the question being
what is a Gen 4 or how that play in with
this Gen 4 is a Department of Energy
Initiative it's probably a good one in
some ways they're looking for what's the
next generation reactor technically
molten salt not lifter which is slightly
different is under their their category
of gen for my personal take on it when I
look at the amount of money they're
putting in I'm not I'm not sure they're
very serious I think it's in the realm
of and don't quote me but $40,000 which
is enough for one person to go out and
and write a paper and go to a conference
where as the other projects are getting
much more serious money you know I'll
let other people decide what the track
record of Department of Energy is and
and you know solving energy problems at
this point so swords guys
that's one sort of Nexus kind of thing
yes yes Kirk Sorensen and I are you know
that this is our lifter is is that and
that Thor thorium forum is probably the
key repository in which people all get
together and work on France
and then there was her Peter Singh up in
Berkeley work on this stuff and there
are several people that you're asking
who else is working for iam first up
working on this stuff pretty like bosons
funding and go to something else I think
he's kind of moved on to two other
things he was department of the energy I
believe and so I don't I don't really
know
total status everybody's got their
little ideas of how you use thorium and
some of them are just add thorium to a
reactor the existing reactor and qualify
that fuel a qualification of a fuel for
any reactor is a long expensive process
and the question is is if you're going
to spend a lot time and money and put it
into the commercial reactors that are
running fine and are safe I would say
maybe that's a little too much money a
little risk you're doing trying to try
to add but that's that is a solution for
thorium thorium in a pebble bed is
another one that people have talked
about it's a little bit better than
maybe the conventional reactor it's
looking more and more like a liquid
system my point is I think you should go
to liquid system and burn all the fuel
because in a pebble bed or these other
concepts you don't burn all the 4m and
you still have a lot of waste that you
have to get rid of yes design-build
through private but something
you have to have government funding
involvement
private or government funding well
that's up to individuals again the
organization loose organization that I'm
really representing or working with
doesn't have an answer to that it is it
would be daunting for private funding it
could be done private funding certainly
the Navy would be a prime example of
wanting something like this yet the Navy
has the same problem
that Department of Energy does they're
kind of fixed in a certain pattern it's
very hard to break that so if somebody
wants to take it to the next step which
is maybe demonstrating the chemistry
without the the nuclear material a
private company would have to have some
backing from the government to say yes
you can use uranium-233 which there's
actually a lot of stored and they want
to blend it down throw it away that's a
sad way the government is looking at
this they haven't done it yet but there
are plans for it so if I was a private
company or private funds the first thing
I would make sure is I had somebody in
the government side saying yes we will
hold that fuel and yes we will let you
utilize that because that you need some
kind of seed fission material in order
to start the process
okay any other questions all right up
one more you're always in any invisible
district three paths you know
getting the government going on this
again research here are efforts I guess
your question is is you know what are
the paths that we're pursuing or paths
that could be pursued to get this going
other than the education process that
they were attempting to do right now yes
there is there's a attempt to talk to
people both in the government when I was
in the Naval Postgraduate School the
students did a design project and found
that it was very interesting what it
could do for the Navy as far as
capability and ships we need to do some
more studies like that I suspect that is
going to come out I think in the next
six months because of all the energy
research that's going to be done or
analysis is going to be done to find out
which way we want to go the thorium will
be and lifter specifically will be
thrown in that mixed what comes out or
who stands up and says yes let's do this
or provides funds to do this that
remains to be seen and I talked to other
people you know privately about you know
what specific paths we've done you know
and share that information okay no one
less minute question one more
problematic mine you know mindset Road
water going to the top and you know
Obama has said it is not anti-nuclear
go to the administration and say look we
need to consider this we actually think
it seriously yeah going to the top again
not really a question but a statement of
going to the top all the way the the new
administration and getting them to look
at this and and you know point the
agencies or money in that direction
certainly what it would help I mean that
that's the easy path if we can do that
people are working on those kinds of
things like I said I think it's a
credible story enough to keep it in the
mixed and us to look at it seriously
and enough to seriously look at why is
it not been promulgated to this point
what are those roadblocks and is it just
you know the bureaucracy that we have
that's a good question okay thank you
