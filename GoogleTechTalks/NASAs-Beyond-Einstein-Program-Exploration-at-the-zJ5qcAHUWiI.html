he's an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins
University and NASA Goddard and we've
known each other for many years now and
that's meant many great late-night
conversations about cosmology and x-ray
telescope II those same things that he's
going to tell you about today thanks
very much and thanks for the invitation
to come and talk to you about this now
in preparation for this I of course
looked at a couple of previous things on
videos Google and notice that the the
folks from Hubble showed up with a
really cool video that they had put
together a various Hubble shots so I
come from the x-ray group at NASA
Goddard and couldn't resist therefore
showing a homegrown video this is
actually the singers are from local
people if the music comes up yeah not
going no sound now let me know where we
start it's a shame x-rays gamma rays
high energy bottle pop stars heavy stars
high density but a quasars black hole
super novae powerhouses lighten up two
galaxies and attaching bursting pulsing
objects we could see if we had x-ray
eyes if we had x-ray
going on the spectrum repeat after me
radio infrared visible UV keep going all
the way what do you see that x-rays
gamma rays high-energy x-rays full time
as a half liquid see which means a
shorter wavelength in you could ever see
x-rays come from various prophecies like
and clavicle 5050 magnetic field to 10
electrons warm in my shoes or even
neutron stars and hit like everybody's
and you get exercised objective ears to
challenge you a black hole's
gravitational potential word
if we pull all the atmosphere and my dad
on this guy and if we could do it in
x-ray eyes what's emo flashing in time
you can you realize objects we get on
and off my fire blasts x-ray skies and
calm and quiet it's more like a rocking
high energy right yeah
x-rays gamma rays high-energy hot start
any stars high density quasars black
hole super novae our house is landing at
the galaxy matching bursting faulting
magics we could sing if we had x-ray
eyes if we had x-ray ah sweet can show
you the river UT Shannon through your
body see the bones underneath but don't
go thinking that we get ray the Stars
has the billions of miles away much too
far we collect all the x-rays that they
sent to the earth telling tales of star
death giving hints to starboard here's a
story on a Perry start-stop Cygnus x1
was a black plain man attends the mess
over sir with the district yes around
its power such from the companion stars
out almost get we see the hospice
your rhiness casa flatten a one-way trip
beyond me Yvette
cosmic light flashes in space it's an
x-ray pulse on with the regular voice a
neutron stars spinning around its axis
once a second or less then way beyond
the Milky Way the active galaxies call
the furthest biggest single x-ray eyes
want your x-rays guys store the sun's
location you'll notice that along with
its low rotation you'll see active moves
and class haha in a solid up producing
x-rays box x-rays son is it Serena
smooth is a dynamic and change in
high-energy grew x-rays gamma rays
high-energy hot stars heavy start
identity wait on black hole super novae
house is mine than the galaxy flashing
bursting causing magics we could see if
we had x-ray eyes if we had x-ray
okay that was actually sung by a group
of acapella vocalists in my lab
collection of astrophysicists and other
other folks and you're both excellent
singers and excellent astrophysicists
but today I'll be talking to you about
the steps that we're hoping to go on
beyond the video talked about rxte which
is a previous generation NASA satellite
still orbiting and doing a great job but
we have big plans to go beyond that and
build a whole new fleet of telescopes
looking at x-rays gravitational waves
other kinds of things out there that we
have now learned that we desperately
need to know about some of you a quick
review of a lot of cosmology and a lot
of the universe that we've learned about
in the very recent past and I do mean
recent I actually went back and
complained recently that the entire
cosmology course that I took when I was
in graduate school is now out of date
and I wanted my money back but here's
one of the things that we've learned
this is a a baby picture of the universe
taken by the Wilkinson microwave
anisotropy probe these are the residual
fluctuations left over from the Big Bang
we've we've taken away the DC component
of this and this is the part that's down
by a factor of a million from that
showing you the fluctuations these are
the little tiny dots and bubbles and
each one of these things here is
eventually going to grow up to become a
super super galaxy cluster the little
tiny dots here are going to become
galaxy clusters and these voids are
going to grow up to become giant voids
in space so this is sort of a picture of
the early imprint of what the universe
is later going to become as far back as
we can possibly look in optical light
we've also been taking deep x-ray images
this is a picture from the Chandra x-ray
Deep Field deep here means that I think
this is two million seconds worth of
observation which is approximately a
little less than a month each one of
these dots here is actually a black hole
usually at the center of a galaxy
so this is some supermassive black hole
that's sucking in matter at the center
of the galaxy and here is a simulated
image in x-rays of what that might look
like you can see that it's brighter on
one side and dimmer on the other that's
simply because of both Doppler shifting
and the effects of relativity so that
the part that's coming closer to you
gets relativistically beamed and becomes
brighter while the part that's going
away it gets dimmer we've also been
working on and this is a lot of work has
been coming out doing on this in
California Caltech and other places on
measuring very distant supernovae but
not just any supernova specifically type
1a supernovae which have this amazing
quantity that they after you do some
fudging of the numbers they all seem to
be about the same brightness or at least
you can scale them so they look like
they have the same brightness so they
are very good standard candles so-called
so we know how bright they are and if we
can then measure how far away they are
in terms of redshift we can then
calculate how bright they are and we can
get an idea of how the universe is
expanded since the time when they went
off that's given us some real surprises
but I which I'll get into just in a
moment now this is a shot from the
Hubble Space Telescope and you can see
here two galaxies that are in fact in
the process of merging which is a really
dramatic process now one of the things
that we know from both optical and x-ray
observations is that most galaxies and
quite possibly all although we don't
know that yet whether or not all have
supermassive black holes at the center
of the galaxy we know that our galaxy
has a supermassive black hole it's
actually about a million times more
massive than the Sun it's called
Sagittarius a star because in the
constellation of Sagittarius and a and
then star because it was some weird
object was first discovered nobody knew
what it was we now have a really good
idea that it's in fact a supermassive
black hole probably the only one in our
galaxy well you might ask the question
that if you have two galaxies that merge
what happens to their black holes and in
fact now with Chandra we can image that
and we can in fact see places where we
see two black holes orbiting each other
at the very center of a galaxy you can
imagine what happens when those two
things
at each other I'll get into just that I
have a simulation to show later on what
that might look like so the titleist
talk though is beyond Einstein and and
to those of you who've heard marketing
ploys before this might sound like one
and to an extent that it is but it is
also a very realistic description of
what we're trying to do Einstein was you
know 1905 came up with special
relativity then just sort of blew us all
away with the following years work on
general relativity we have been you know
in some sense you could read modern
physics the last hundred years is
catching up with what he's done but
three of the things that he predicted
was the expansion of the universe now he
actually predicted it worked out the
calculations and that said well that's
that's probably wrong so he he put in a
fudge term called lambda in order to
make the universe stable of course a
couple years later somebody actually
showed that the Hubble actually showed
the universe was expanding and therefore
Einstein would have been perfectly
correct leave that in there he was
always kicking himself calling his
greatest mistake to put in this extra
term and you know we've always thought
less of it because of that really it's
it's really hurt his reputation he also
predicted the theory general relativity
comes up with black holes although he
was neither the person who worked out
the original mathematics of them it was
a short shield North person who named
them that was wheeler and this Cosmo to
a constant was the term that he came up
with in order to stop the universe from
expanding all over the place or
collapsing now the great thing is here's
Hubble's discovery of the expanding
universe and you can't really see the
dots on that but they really do line up
very nicely what Hubble came up with the
the idea that the more distance you are
the more the higher your recession
velocity is going to be it worked out
very beautifully the data sort of
demanded an explanation and here's a an
artist's conception unfortunately that's
all we have right now for what the black
holes the center of our galaxy might
look like this is the accretion disk of
material that's feeding into the black
hole that's obviously the the surface
so-called of the black hole itself these
are all things you
coming out of the black hole or they're
actually just sort of optical Luke not
optical illusions they're bent by the
the gravitational field of a black hole
itself so this is sort of the back half
of the accretion disk that has been
pulled up into our line of sight as a
result of the massive black black hole's
gravity and finally we now have evidence
for an accelerating universe which is I
got to say one of the strangest things
to come out of cosmology in some time
and that's saying something the
accelerating universe is something I'll
talk about in just a moment but it's
strange it's it's really really weird
but with all this we really don't have
the complete picture Einstein gave us a
lot but we've learned things especially
this accelerating universe stuff that
have made us question whether or not we
know the whole picture as a matter of
fact we're certain we don't know the
whole picture that's the goal of beyond
Einstein program is to sort of figure
out what it is we're missing the series
of missions will hopefully answer the
questions down here what powered the Big
Bang where did it come from what happens
at the edge of a black hole and what is
the mysterious dark energy pulling the
universe apart what is doing that where
did that come from who you know in in
the words of the physicist Robbie who
ordered that when told of a new particle
the question about what powered the Big
Bang there's the Big Bang we're not
gonna learn anything about the Big Bang
itself it's too far back too many weird
things happen in between us and it this
is the Big Bang plus three hundred
thousand years that's the so-called
surface of last scattering as far as
optical photons are concerned as a
matter of fact photons of any kind
x-rays gamma rays radio waves anything
beyond this point the universe was
basically ionized it was a dense ball of
hot ions electrons and protons and so on
the photons were scattering all the time
so we have no chance of ever seeing back
before this point of the universe
because the universe was optically thick
at that point it was as though there's a
was dropped in front of us between me
and you you wouldn't be able to see me
no matter how
hard you look with how big a telescope
there just is no data optical from from
photons that comes here however
gravitational waves do come from beyond
before that we can look back well before
this period if we can use gravity waves
to do it all we have to do is build a
detector that is sensitive to gravity
waves okay so it's a big butt but it's
doable next question is what happens at
the edge of the black hole this is the
picture I already showed here's a
different simulated black hole image we
would very much like to know what's
going on at the edge of a black hole
largely because it is very very
difficult to test Einstein's theory of
general relativity here on earth you
need to have in order to test what's
called the strong field limit the very
extreme areas of Einstein's theory of
general relativity you need to have
something like a black hole going on in
there very hard to get into the lab I
mean OSHA standards and requirements are
really riff bad with it with a black
holes so as a result we need something
that we can look at general relativity
in sort of its natural habitat around a
black hole that's what our real goal is
here and finally this dark energy stuff
that I've already mentioned once and
here's the part that's just strange I'll
just read this in the standard
cosmological framework the acceleration
of the expansion of the universe is
caused by dark energy that makes up
seventy percent of a mass energy density
of the universe today now here's a
couple of weird things about that if we
went back a bit in universal time say we
want to head back to when the universe
was half as old as it is today dark
energy would make up a very very small
parched portion of the mass energy of
the universe it would be almost totally
undetectable if we go forward in the
universe a couple of foldings you know
if we wait for another say ten billion
years 20 billion years dark energy will
totally dominate the mass energy of the
universe basically all of the energy in
the universe will be in the form of dark
energy an actual matter like we know
that the day will be negligible so we
for some reason are living at a point
where dark energy is a significant
portion actually probably the dominant
portion of our universe but it isn't
totally dominant nor is it totally
negligible this is some
that has people a little nervous any
time you have a theory we're a include
stuff that you have no idea about and it
seems to be needed to be tuned in just
the right way in order to work right
suggest that maybe you don't have a
total grip on the theory and I would
have to say that almost all of the
people who'd work on this as a for a
living I'm not a cosmologists I simply
talk to people who are think that well
okay this theory is working well for us
and we're certainly not going to ditch
it now because it explains a lot of
things but on the other hand putting
seventy percent of the mass energy of
the universe into something we don't
understand anything about is disturbing
it's an opportunity for somebody to come
up with a new idea that works better
there are some possibilities the one
explanation for dark energy is Einsteins
lambda constants you can actually work
it up you can you can get it to work
that way everybody sort of agrees that
would be the most boring fashion boring
way from dark energy to work because
there's no theoretical reason why there
should be a lambda that's that is this
particular value and if it turns out
that it is just that value be very I
think people call that disappointing
what we're really hoping is that maybe
it varies with time so if we look back
we see changes in the acceleration of
the universe or that maybe general
tivity is wrong the standard cosmology
is wrong something so I'm talking about
seventy percent and so on so what
exactly am I talking about it so here's
sort of a census this is an audit of the
material in the universe so if anybody
ever asks you where the laptop is going
it went you can say oh that's part of
the point oh three percent of the
universe that's made up of heavy
elements heavy elements means anything
heavier than height then helium to an
astronomer metal is anything heavier
than helium there's hydrogen there's
helium and there's metals and that
counts for point oh three percent and
that's why we don't make any much
division between the different ones
because when something is that small who
cares anyway then there's neutrinos and
that's point three percent so not
trivial I mean there are some neutrinos
out there there's billions of them in
this room they're passing through our
bodies as we speak although I didn't
notice that it was not a sign warning me
about that in the one I entered the room
that may be the state of California has
to determine their cancer-causing yet
stars half a percent so there is a fair
amount of material in stars that's
helium and then there's free hydrogen
helium that hasn't made it into stars or
maybe made it into stars then it came
back out again that's four percent so
you know you total all this up we got
like five percent here in stuff that we
would recognize as matter Dark Matter
dark matter is not one of these above so
it's not hydrogen it's not helium and
it's not anything a regular matter
that's heavier than hydrogen or helium
it's not part of the periodic table it's
not an electron this is some something
totally different it doesn't interact
via the electromagnetic or the strong
force and interacts via the weak force
and gravity so far as we know we do not
know what this particle is we do know
from lots of different observations in
lots of different contexts that it
exists and there is dark matter out
there there's dark matter holding our
galaxy for together for example our
galaxy would not rotate the way that it
does if there weren't dark matter and so
for a long time people were sort of
moderately unhappy about dark matter
there lots of dark matter searches going
on trying to find out what the dark
matter is and so that was the goal let's
find out what the dark matter is and
then suddenly somebody comes along and
says whoops we just found this dark
energy stuff that takes up seventy
percent of the matter which relegating
the Dark Matter problem to a minor
little correction term it also means now
that you sort of invoked the Tooth Fairy
twice this is always a problem in any
physical theory you're allowed to invoke
the Tooth Fairy once okay and that's the
dark matter now that we've got two in
there all bets are off now I've been
talking about this how do we actually
know this stuff exists this is the
advanced version this is the the Hubble
diagram on steroids it's the most one of
the most recent ones that we've got this
is a on this axis of the graph here and
this is just a blown-up version of this
one down here this is the redshift or
linear scale of the universe larger red
shift further back in time so redshift
of one means that all wavelengths have
doubled in scale by the time they get to
us redshift of a half means that they've
gone up by a one and a half times so a
photon at with a wavelength of a
thousand angstrom would become say
fifteen hundred angstroms or two
thousand angstroms that if it came from
a redshift of one so this is going back
in time here's sort of nearby stuff and
here's its brightness
those type 1a supernovae that I was
telling you about these are the things
whose brightness we think we know pretty
well and so we can then therefore say
how bright they should be forgiven how
far back they are just distance because
things get dimmer as they go back from
time so here's the plot and you can see
that basically it's working just great
out to here working reasonably well but
now we're leaving the sort of standard
the lines are diverging the red line in
here top red line is a universe that
will expand at the critical density and
doesn't accelerate lines down in here
are universes that will eventually
collapse again into what's something
called the Big Crunch universe then
finally collapses and turns over and
falls back into itself then these blue
curves here are the accelerating
universe and this is the stuff that
nobody understood that somehow the
universe is not only getting bigger it's
not just sort of coasting and getting
bigger it's accelerating something is
driving the universe to bigger and
bigger sales and the only thing that
really do that is what's called vacuum
energy which means that the vacuum of
space itself has a pressure of its own
so you make an empty piece of space and
it's trying to press to make more space
and as you can imagine that's a process
that becomes exponential obviously
immediately which is one of the problems
with that seventy percent number I told
you about if in fact the universe is
filled with stuff that has vacuum energy
and it's every time you make some more
space it's filled with more stuff that
we don't know about that's not trying to
make more space well that's going to
take off and somebody and very quickly
dominate the entire mass energy of the
universe everything else will be totally
negligible we just don't know what that
stuff is we very much like to know
here's another graph that curve in case
you are little not totally convinced
here the data points on a different way
here's today here's nearby stuff and
then you can see that the super novae
that we're seeing are much closer lying
on this curve where initially the
expansion the University celebrates but
then suddenly this vacuum energy takes
over and just starts blowing the thing
up so the universe seems to be in the
process of blowing itself up we just
don't know why be online program is in
part design
to answer that question and some others
the program consists of a whole series I
mean this is this a beautiful diagram
just admire that I didn't make it this
is the two big projects one is called
constellation X and I'll talk a bit
about that that's a new x-ray telescope
designed to look at black holes other
x-ray sources this is Lisa a
gravitational wave detector series of
three telescopes with lasers going
between them I'll talk about how that
going to be able to detect gravity waves
there are three sort of smaller projects
one is called the inflation probe that's
designed to try to look at the very
earliest part of inflation in an
indirect fashion it's not by measuring
the gravity waves themselves but but in
an indirect way of by measuring a
polarization of the light that comes
back from the Big Bang and hope to get a
grip on the gravity waves that way one
called the dark energy probe that's to
actually try to get some group to get to
grips with that what that dark energy
stuff is and a black hole finder probe
in order to get a good idea of whether
or not black holes are the center of all
galaxies and if so why what's making
them what are they doing what's going on
in there those then lead to two sort of
what are called vision missions that are
more distant future but we'd very much
like to do something for example we
theoretically know how to build a device
that would actually image a supermassive
black hole in another galaxy and when I
say image I mean take a picture of it
you know an actual you know four by six
snapshot you know send them home to
mother picture of a black hole now we
don't have to make it today give us 30
years and we probably could and the
other one is to actually do a big bang
observer to do an even better job of
this inflation probe to get it to come
to grips with how the universe was
actually born so the constellation
xmission this is the one that I'm
directly involved with so I know the
most about this but I'll try to give
equal time to all the other missions as
well x-ray observations must be in space
the reason is x rays don't travel in the
atmosphere if we set up an x-ray
telescope here on earth the x-ray simply
wouldn't come down to us so we need to
put it into space we needed to be as big
as we possibly could make it so what we
decided to do was to build four
identical telescopes and bunch them all
together
you might ask why not build one
telescope and it turns out that it's
easier to build for smaller ones that it
is to build one big one we orbit the Sun
at the second LaGrant this is a bit of a
race the second one garage point is
becoming a very busy intersection lots
of you lots of countries and satellite
builders want to put things there
because it's it's near to the earth but
it's not too near you know it's like the
suburbs you know it's a good location
commute isn't too bad it's quiet this
will allow us to do x-ray imaging and
high-resolution spectroscopy so we'll
actually be able to tell with really
good precision where that light is
coming from will be able to tell Doppler
shifts up for example like coming from
the very edges of a black hole it's
substantially more sensitive than the
current facilities and we'll do those
things here are some examples of the
kind of stuff that we're going to be
looking at here is a plot of the x-ray
energy versus flux and it turns out that
the accretion disk around a black hole
that that bit that you saw swirling
around has a certain amount of iron in
it and that iron emits what are iron
fluorescent lines there are six point
four ka v they just happen to be the
line that emits from iron when you heat
it up to a server when you hit it with a
hard enough electron well if that's
normal and it just emits a normal
everyday spectroscopic line just you
know think there what's happening here
the reason it looks so funny is because
it's going around a black hole very near
the swartz shield radius the black hole
it's orbiting very very close to the
black hole itself and if the black hole
were just a normal Newtonian object you
were just you know some massive object
that didn't have all this special
relativity and general to be going on
this curve would look sort of like this
look at the double horn shape just
because of the Doppler shifts involved
now because it is does have general
relativity and special relativity
involved the part that's coming towards
us gets enhanced a bit the part that's
going away from us gets decreased a bit
and you end up with this sort of funky
little shape here so if you think about
it what this means is that this is this
is data from the Oscar satellite and it
was a very difficult observation to get
when you make a telescope that's a
hundred times bigger you can
this kind of data much much easier and
if you think about what this is used to
prove that that's what we were seeing
but if you imagine getting a hundred of
these you know every hour or something
like that that means that you can start
to map where this iron is going around
the black hole and this is the iron
that's about to fall into the black hole
so this is basically telling us what's
going on right there at the edge of the
black hole right before it falls in just
another thing that we can learn about
black holes this is sort of a strange
place to talk to have it we're also
gonna be looking at black holes merging
with each other in the process of
spiraling in merging and then so the
final reading down this is a process
that we can't we don't know that we can
observe this yet in x-rays although we'd
very much like to we can see the massive
numbers of gravitational waves that come
off of that process and I'll talk about
that in just a moment so one of the
goals of contacts is to look at these
black holes spiraling you no matter
spiraling into the black hole we'd also
like to know how black holes evolve in
time because we're not quite sure where
all the different masses of black holes
came from do they come from our black
holes created sort of small and they
just accrete over time or do they get
bigger over time or do they start off
big we don't really know if we could
take observations at a series of
distances we would learn a lot more
about how they actually come about we're
hoping to also do some work on dark
matter and dark energy with
constellation X this will be done via
other techniques looking at for example
clusters of galaxies to trace where the
matter is coming from what the masses
are and thus figure out how far away
they are and finally look at things like
the origin of the elements look at super
novae stars exploding because with
constellation X will be able to look at
all the different elements coming off of
a black hole at once sorry black hole
now all the elements coming off of a
supernova as it explodes leaves a black
hole in the center possibly then all the
material coming out we can look at
elements as they're forming so here's a
picture of what that accretion disk
looks like so here we have you know the
various matters swirling around the
black hole this is what's called a hot
spot a flare we don't really know why
they occur but we do see them things
just sort of get brighter and then
dimmer writer
dimmer and so imagine tracking these as
time goes on and it's a little hard to
see down here but this is the line shape
that comes out and you can see that it
varies all over the landscape as these
things fall into the black hole we can
make a map over here of energy versus
time and here we have time in seconds
that's ten seconds fifteen twenty and
you can make this sort of waterfall
diagram this diagram will tell us things
like how fast the black hole is spinning
what the mass of the black hole is this
is how we can actually test to see
whether or not Einstein's theory of
general relativity works or not at its
most extreme case in the center of a
black hole as things are falling into it
moving on to lisa lisa is brand-new
technology we have built x-ray
telescopes before this is a
constellation x is a much bigger
telescope it has new facilities new tech
detectors new ways of doing things but
in some sense it's a bigger version of
things that we've already built lisa is
brand-new Lisa the way it works is it's
got three spacecraft one two three they
are separated by five million kilometers
apiece it's a three armed interferometer
with a baseline of five million
kilometers nothing like this has ever
been built nothing like this could be
built on earth it has to be run in space
it's got each one of the spacecraft here
is sitting there pointing at the other
two and they have six free-floating
proof masses they're called and now you
might wonder what that means and really
all it means is a proof mass is a little
tiny square of a metal alloy that is
going to be free floating in space it's
not actually connected to the spacecraft
the point of the spacecraft is to signal
data down from about the position of
that little piece of be a piece of metal
and to stay out of its way so that it
doesn't actually touch the walls because
if it did it would throw off the entire
measurement the goal is to measure the
positions the distances between all of
these proof masses here and here as a
function of time to a precision of five
pico meters over a hundred seconds
so this is substantially smaller than an
atom much many atoms are something like
point 1 nanometers so this is 5
picometers we're we're way down there
inside scale the idea is that you can
see a gravitational wave coming through
distorting space and time as it does
changing the distances between these
proof masses as it goes so if for
example a black hole meets another black
hole somewhere halfway across the
universe and sends off gravitational
waves as a result of its merger this
system would see the ripples in space
and time that came halfway across the
universe and change the distances ever
so slightly as you can imagine the data
analysis product on this project alone
is quite an effort we haven't launched
it yet they've already gone through two
rounds of analysis of simulated data to
try to figure out how to do all the data
analysis in order to pull things out
from this if you'd like to get involved
actually they're looking for anybody
who's interested the data sets by google
standards are pathetically small that I
think the entire thing fits on 5
gigabytes is the entire missions worth
of data but all the data you get are the
links between these three arms and a
measurement of the error in that
measurement and you're expected to D
convolve the entire universe as it's
going on around you so the goals of Lisa
besides just the show that you can do
this this will be the first actual
measurement of gravity waves in the that
humans have ever done is to determine
the role of massive black holes and
galaxies evolution will be able to see
the massive black holes as they start
merging in things precision testify
Stein theory of relativity it doesn't
get more more precise than this we're
measuring the gravity waves that his
theory predicts will also see ultra
complex valued binaries in our galaxy
that's sort of the background radiation
for us for this is a series of small
Gallic binary systems in our galaxy
we're going to see things like
supermassive black holes
intermediate-mass black holes maybe as
they're there
going to become super massive black
holes intermediate-mass means like a you
know a hundred times the mass of the Sun
maybe and if we're very lucky we might
see the cosmological background so now
one of the big things about this and
this just happened about in about the
last year and a half this was a huge
advance in the theory of ground general
relativity numerical calculations is
you're building a detector whose main
point is to see the merging of two black
holes that's the real goal of Lisa so
you'd sort of like to have a theoretical
calculation of what it's going to look
like it would make everybody feel much
better if you actually had an idea what
you were hoping to see well the problem
was that problem the so-called two-body
problem of general relativity solving
two equal mass black holes rotating
around each other until they merge had
been an ongoing problem for at least 20
in probably 30 years i'm not sure the
exact number people have been working on
this problem for a long time and not
just a few people mean hundreds of
people have been working on trying to
solve this problem with very little
success it got thrown on who computers
very early for a while the computer
simply weren't adequate to do the
problem then the computers got to be
adequate to solve the problem they would
put in everything that was known about
general relativity into a mesh code they
would run it numerically and it would
crash and then they would sticks the
crash and they'd run it again it would
go a little bit further and then it
would crash and about a year and a half
ago they solved it via a series of
really clever techniques and if you'd
like to know I know a little bit about
it you want to know more than just a
little bit I'll do it directly to the
person you should invite but to come
give a talk about it this group here has
been doing a huge amount of the work so
this is a movie of what two black holes
black hole and black hole look like as
they merge with each other and see this
works and what you're seeing are the
contours of constant gravitational
curvature so these these black holes are
spinning which is causing them to be non
symmetric now you're seeing them you're
sort of going back a bit and you'll see
the red waves of the glove the
gravitational waves coming off of it
and that's time and space distorting as
you're looking at it and then you come
back in and you can see the residual
what's called ring down of the merged
black hole emitting a couple of
gravitational waves coming off the
amount of power that's coming out of
here is immense you get approximately
three to four percent of the total mass
of the system coming out in the forms of
gravitational waves that is during the
time that it's happening for
supermassive black holes brighter than
all the galaxies in the universe
combined the amount of power coming out
of these things I checked and you know
you might imagine for example how are
you going to do this data analysis
problem for the Lisa data you know it's
going to be amazingly hard everything is
adding together well the answer is if in
fact one of these happens which they
hope to see maybe about somewhere on the
order of tens per year they'd really
like to see it's going to look like this
in the data you know basically from what
I was told the data analysis of an
actual supermassive black hole merging
in the Lisa data can be done by I you
just look at the data stream oh yeah
there's one so the dark at the the
Einstein probes these are the smaller
missions context and lease are the two
big missions that are part of the beyond
lines then program the joint dark energy
mission arc aka the dark energy probe is
designed to determine the evolution of
dark energy with time this is trying to
map out is it constant in time is it
changing in time give us any idea as to
why it might be this seventy percent
large number that we have today that we
don't understand this is a partnership
between NASA and the Department of
Energy it turns out the Department of
Energy funds a fair amount of this sort
of basic physics research narrative in
the problem as well this mission doesn't
have a design yet there are actually
three competing designs right now for
this mission doing the problem in
slightly different ways so I can't tell
you how it's going to be built because
it's not actually known yet the same is
true actually for all of the probes the
inflation probe is designed to look at
the early imprints of Leah the period of
inflation when the universe of blew up
to group two it's sort of semi present
size and to see the imprints of that
were left on the cosmic microwave
background radiation which is that that
blurry picture I showed you at the very
beginning
the idea is that if you look at the
polarization of that you might be able
to get to grips with some of the
gravitational waves that were created
earlier on and to sort of get a lever
arm to see back further into time
understand how inflation happened and
finally the black hole finder probe and
in some sense it sounds very simple
because all we want to do is use this to
find black holes to identify them in
galaxies but there's a lot of work that
just needs to be done statistically we
just need a large enough sample of black
holes in order to answer some basic
questions about them how do they grow
why are they always in the center of
galaxies do you ever see galaxies sort
of our black holes at the edges of
galaxies that are moving in are they
mergers where do they come from all
these questions in order to answer them
we really need statistics we just can't
look at one or two and answer the
question that way so they the three
methods I three possible ways of doing
the dark energy probe is the first idea
is well we found dark energy by looking
at type 1 supernova and measuring how
far away they were and how bright they
were and thereby learning about the fact
that the universe seems to be
accelerating well one method is to
simply do more of that it worked before
let's do more of it another one is that
the the the very early universe had
acoustic waves basically sound waves
that were bouncing back and forth back
at the earliest days when when the
universe was a giant soup of plasma hot
electrons and protons that we couldn't
see in it it still had variations it
still had things bouncing back and forth
and those would lead to acoustic signals
and those would suddenly die out when
the universe went from being an ionized
plasma to being a neutral plasma so you
go from this this big ionized mess which
is bouncing back and forth and ringing
like a big explosion and then somebody
it dies out well that leaves you with
the acoustic signature those sound waves
leave stay in the signal and those sound
waves end up being the things around
which galaxies and galaxy clusters
formed so if we measure simply where
galaxies are in space and position then
we can invert that using a Fourier
transform base
sick leave simply enough to come up with
what that acoustic signature was and
thereby learned something about what
dark energy was doing we learned
something about how the universe was
made and finally we can measure galaxy
cluster masses and then figure out how
far away they are by using something
called weak lensing this is using the
fact that that large masses themselves
actually bend light and you may have
seen big picture famous pictures of like
of galaxies that bend into big what are
called Einstein arcs which big circles
around some galaxies there's also a
process called weak lensing which is
just looking at the signal from distant
quasars as they go around galaxy
clusters and you invert this process and
you can get an idea of what the the mass
of the cluster is and thus invert the
entire problem and come up with a
measurement of dark energy three
different techniques and basically there
are three different probes you'll be
shocked to hear that one probe is trying
out each technique there'll be a
competition and somebody will win and
we'll launch that probe the inflation
probe I'm not going to go into too much
basically the idea is as I said to
measure the polarization on this map and
thus to go back even further and learn
more about what's going on in this map
and then here is the black hole finder
probe the problem that we have with
looking for black holes is that most of
them we think now are surrounded by
these disks of stuff accreting onto the
black hole and that's pretty straight
forward we have a what's called the
unified theory of AGN which says that
all black holes look basically like this
the problem is one mostly of geometry if
we're seeing for looking down the jet
then we see what's called a blazar and
the black hole can't be missed it's
incredibly bright we're seeing this huge
jet of material coming straight at us if
we're looking at the side of the
accretion disk though we don't see
anything at all and most in most wave
bands because it's absorbed by the
accretion disk about the only thing that
we can see is if we look at very high
energy x-rays which can penetrate this
thick disk of material and then we can
get an idea of what's there so strangely
enough actually we think the problem
with understanding that galaxies the
center of galaxies of what's going on is
purely one that sometimes the black
holes are pointing towards us and
sometimes we're seeing their edge and as
a result we only learn about the
that are pointed towards us are the ones
that are easy to see we don't learn
about the whole sample of black holes
out there what's going on with them so
the question is will we do this well
unfortunately each one of these missions
is sort of pricey now I mean I'm not
talking like Palo Alto house expensive
but they are sort of pricey the probes
by themselves will cost somewhere
between 500 to a billion dollars to
build the bigger missions constellation
X and Lisa are in the two billion dollar
range so the entire suite would cost if
we want to build all of them and start
today and we probably need to start to
put aside about six billion dollars and
it's possible there could be cost
overruns I won't swear to you that
everybody would come in on budget but
right now there is actually been a
number of reviews of this stuff and
other scientists like it in other fields
there have been a number of Nobel prizes
including one to my friend John Mather
just last year three and so this is the
kind of stuff that probably will get
done we're right now we are actually
waiting for a report that will be issued
by the National Academy of Sciences on
September fifth so next wednesday is a
real nail-biter day for all of us
involved in beyond Einstein that report
will indicate which one a panel of
senior scientists members of selected by
the National Academy thinks should go
first and that will probably then decide
for NASA which one of these missions
will go ahead and hopefully start launch
to start preparations for a launch
probably in the middle of the next
decade so the answer is that yes we will
probably do this although we could
certainly use support so if you ever
find yourself talking to a senator or
congressman please let them know you
think this is cool or if you didn't
think it was cool don't say anything
about it at all so if you'd like to know
more about it here is the website that
has links to practically everything we
that I've given today plus lots and lots
more and I'd be happy to take any
questions
I know it's all with sir role in the
universe they seem to be the things that
that are the final entropy buckets for
the universe black holes have the most
entropy of anything in the universe so
if the universe is going to end in
anything other than a just expanding off
into nothingness then we're probably all
going to end up in a bunch of black
holes as to purpose we don't really know
they're interesting objects they're
incredibly simple that's the weird thing
about a black hole is that black hole
has two parameters it has its mass and
it has its spin it sort of has a charge
too but you can basically ignore the
electrical charge so you know that's
incredibly simple hydrogen atom has a
lot more degrees of freedom than a black
hole so black holes are these they're
just mysterious objects we just don't
know very much about them in something
in some senses and then we hope to learn
a lot of Moore's with all of this right
so the question is you thought nothing
you come out of a black hole that's
correct once it falls inside the
Schwarzschild radius the black hole it
cannot come back out again however the
things that you saw coming out of the
black hole weren't in fact coming from
inside the Swart shield radius they were
in fact coming from just outside it so
well it's true that nothing once you
fall in you can't ever come back I mean
we're never going to have for example a
black hole sample return mission to come
back and bring a piece of one but it can
come from just outside it that's even
the theory behind for example something
called Hawking radiation where you can
have particles and antiparticles one
falls in and the other one falls out it
is possible for things to sort of come
off of a black hole but they don't come
from inside the sword shield radius they
come from just outside and that's where
the gravitational waves are formed that
are
coming off of this thing so there's
another question here yes effectively it
is it is a fifth force and as 11 if you
if you do a search on recent papers on
this field one of the things that's
often used to talk about it is called
quintessence or fifth force it it
doesn't really totally blow up modern
particle physics to include it it's just
that modern particle physics can't
answer the question what is the energy
of vacuum I mean vacuum is not in modern
particle quantum in a quantum mechanical
concept vacuum is not a simple stuff I
mean I've got a little square here with
nothing in it well if you look very very
closely you'd see particles and
antiparticles that are created and then
disappear all in very very short time
skins and so in order to calculate what
the total energy and that is you have to
calculate all the total energy of each
one of those little particles and
antiparticles that are constantly
forming and then disappearing and you
might say well it area to average out to
zero and effectively that's what
everybody said was oh that must average
out to zero largely because if you do
the calculations sort of straight you
end up with it coming out to be an
answer that's so much larger than is
allowed that the universe wouldn't exist
if you do that if you do the problem in
a sort of a naive fashion a
back-of-the-envelope calculation you end
up proving that the universe can't exist
so since it does you might particle
physics have just assumed for many years
that oh well there must be another term
that makes it just all go to zero and
therefore the answer is zero so it's the
answer is sort of like infinitely large
or zero and now it turns out the answer
is sort of like very small but very but
greater than zero and particle physics
haven't a clue as to why what was what
would be doing that but it's a complex
question and nobody has a calculation
that shows why this answer should be the
way it is nobody really knows what it is
right
very much so yes you're exactly right to
the the sensitivity curves of what Lisa
can-can is looking at changed
dramatically as it moves and so actually
the entire system is designed to orbit
in a tumbling end over end method in
order that it scans the sky and gets
roughly equal measurements in all
directions I think three is cheaper than
than 60 you're right rotundity sorry yes
you're right I actually dick and I were
just telling this concession I haven't
checked with the guys yet but I think
that the the rationale behind three is
just the getting three to work it's
going to be hard enough they have to
with Lisa the biggest problem is the
systematic the noise sources because you
know they're trying to measure something
too much smaller than the diameter of an
atom anything can contribute noise to
this calculation I believe the number
was something on the order of 50 for
noise terms potential noise terms that
they were following that had potential
to be significant I think 30 of them
they thought actually we're going to be
really important the other 24 26 they
were tracking just to make sure they
didn't become important but you can
imagine how complicated an engineering
problem that is when you've got to worry
about all the different terms
yeah you're only the one thing that
that's helping you out is that you don't
care about absolute measurements it's
only a relative measurement so you're so
so long as things aren't changing
internally on your little metal alloy
cube too much on the span of a hundred
seconds that it doesn't matter too much
basically you can get away with it
making an absolute measurement of this
precision is just impossible it couldn't
be done for the kind of reasons you're
talking about but you can make a
relative one over reasonably short
timescales again all the long timescales
you'd end up with similar kinds of
problems so any final questions okay
well thanks very much for inviting me
I've been very nice enjoying seeing
