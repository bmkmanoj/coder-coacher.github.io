out we have Manish Gupta I was the
founder of handmade expressions which is
a fair trade company into its fifth year
of existence he's here to talk to us
about fair trade and a discussion about
that so without much ado Manisha
good afternoon everyone thank you for
taking the time to come for this
discussion today we'll go through a
brief agenda I'll quickly introduce
myself we look at the bigger picture of
trade in perspective we'll talk about
why fair trade is important and then
we'll get into how does fair trade work
its impact and challenges and how can we
contribute my name is Manish Gupta I
founded handmade expressions we are a
Fairtrade
wholesaler based out of Austin Texas I
founded the company about four years
back and we currently work with over
5,000 marginalized artisans across India
we'll keep the presentation very casual
feel free to stop me at any time only
two rules you cannot throw food at me
and you can't ask me hard questions ok
I'll let you guys read through the code
so dr. King's code does a really good
job at bringing out how interrelated
different parts of world are on each
other and we'll go into a brief
introduction or not introduction I look
at wise globalization and trade
important trade really keeps us going it
brings us the products we need services
and information there are a lot of
things that we cannot imagine our world
without and most of them have been
brought to us through trade it creates
wealth it develops our skills so why do
we need to question this trade today
what has gone wrong traditional value
chain and some of its assumptions that
lies there is consumers that needs goods
and services and shareholders who strive
to provide those services we have
operations and manufacturing partners
that work with businesses to create
those services and products and then in
the end we have the producers who
actually make produce things the
traditional economics assume that each
player in this value chain has equal
access to resources and they can take
care of themselves
it doesn't really play out like that in
many parts we as consumers when we make
a demand of cheaper and faster Goods it
creates a pressure on the entire value
chain the businesses and shareholders
take this pressure and pass it on to
operations and manufacturing
and what is manufacturing operation does
pass on that pressure to the producers
the producers are at the bottom they
have no way to pass this pressure on so
they continue to get squeezed and
squeezed and this is what we call the
race to the bottom so here is the
question why does the producers continue
to get squeezed why can't they say no we
will not agree to it I can do a quick
roll play can I get any volunteer for a
small role play and I have a chocolate
come on in I love chocolate second I'm
Stefan thanks for participating I role
play what do you do at Google I'm a
systems engineer awesome so let's do a
hypothetical scenario where Google comes
and say you know we need to be more
profitable and we'll go ahead and cut
your salary in half without cutting your
R's you do the same work but we pay you
half what would you do I probably see if
I can automate my work make it make it
happen faster so I spend less time on it
great awesome
and you are actually able to do that so
you put half the amount of work but then
they increase your workload because they
want you here 9:00 to 8:00 or 9:00 to
5:00 but they continue to cut your
salary and they keep pushing you what
will ultimately happen well I assume at
some point I will just look for another
job so you will say no at certain point
of time and what helps you to say no why
why are you in a position that you can
say no I won't do it
because I think I I would be able to
find a similar position somewhere else
that was claiming the same amount of
money that I had previously for my
skills and Stefano said he'll share the
chocolate with all of us
thank you so Stefano said that he will
say no to what he thinks are unfair
practices because he can find a better
job with the skills that he has so he
has the knowledge of what is the value
of his work he has all he knows of
alternatives where his work would be
valued he has a support system where he
can say no and and be okay those are all
of the things that many producers around
the world don't have they're an extreme
poverty they need to earn every day to
bring bread to their family they don't
have any knowledge of what's the value
of their work they do not have alternate
options there there is one or two buyers
and if they don't sell that produce or
products to them they have nothing else
to do so these are some of the things
that continue to push these producers in
in that position and corporations are
not evil businesses strive to fulfill
our demands
and sometimes our demand for cheaper and
faster products can lead to all of these
things and these are the things which
actually cause poverty so here is the
big question are we responsible for this
any questions so far okay so this is
where fair trade comes in we look at the
same value chain in a fair trade model
so we have all the same four players in
this chain consumers make a demand but
they make a conscious demand using that
the businesses and shareholders put a
demand to their operations and
manufacturing practices but not only the
demand products they set standards they
give them the resources and feedback
using this the operating partners
provide resources fair wages and
development opportunities to producers
in return producers make good products
which are passed along the chain and
ultimately businesses and shareholders
provide these products to consumers but
the only difference is they also do a
big part of Education they explain to
consumers how their demand their choices
is making a big difference in the entire
value chain how a conscious demand by a
consumer impacts the producer in another
country or another world
so what really is fair trade it's an
alternate trade model it is not aid it
focuses on how it focuses on how a
product is being made how are the
resources of a country being utilized
what's the social and environmental
impact of any of the production
activities in a community it's based on
respect and partnerships there's a lot
of education and awareness not only in
the consumers but through the entire
chain companies understand how does
their products are being made what's the
impact of a factory that they run in
China has on the environment on the
socio-economic conditions the farmers
are aware of what's the value of their
product there are many producers who
make coffee
who who farmers who produce coffee and
they don't know how coffee is being used
there's been a study done where a number
of farmers think coffee beans are used
as blood it's also about taking
responsibility
there is no invisible hand out there
taking care of everything it is we who
drive the market and we have to take
responsibility of what we demand I'll
let you guys read through some of the
values
and these are basic human values none of
them is rocket science so why are we
going back to them how did we miss them
take a quick look at who benefits from
fair trade the producers and farmers
businesses doing good is a strong
business when you take care of your
employees the employees take care of the
business as consumers we get healthier
products we create a sustainable system
and we get a wholesome feeling and this
is a very basic comparison between
conventional and Fairtrade I'll let you
guys read through it
the point that I want to stress the most
is the last point in conventional trade
businesses work on fulfilling the bare
standard the minimum standards and
wherever the standards don't exist there
is no bottom whereas fair trade
businesses their decisions are based on
what is good for people and planet
so why should we care because it makes
our planet sustainable we cannot
continue the race to raise to bottom
from one place to another from one set
of people to another set of people from
one set of lower standards to other set
of lower standards it is not sustainable
for us we get higher quality products it
preserves culture and art also because
we are humans it is our moral
responsibility to support fellow human
beings
so how does fate really work we see the
scenario where there's an individual
producer who doesn't have knowledge
cannot have cannot access resources so
he is very prone to be exploited usually
you've seen farmers that produces group
into a cooperative which is farmer or
producer run and as a group they can
improve their productivity they can
share the risks their lot more resources
they can get access to technology better
market their products and can say no to
exploitation and I'll give you a small
example here of how cooperatives really
help individual farmers in the coffee
trade the average value of normal coffee
sale is a dollar twenty-five a pound and
usually we buy coffee in in market for
seven to twelve dollars a pound this is
the farmers get about ten percent of the
of the cost coffee that we pay the if
the same coffee if it can be roasted and
sold the farmers can fetch up to six to
seven dollars a pound roasting is
actually in terms of time and technology
it's a much smaller process but it
increases the value of their coffee by
three to four folds so it is important
that we get farmers to do more part of
the value chain but it's very hard for
individual farmers to afford the coffee
roasting equipment for them to get the
technology on how to do that but if they
group into a cooperative if one hundred
farmers group together they can actually
buy that equipment they can get a loan
they can get the technology and many of
the farmers are starting to do that and
it makes a huge difference in their
lives many times the cost of the trading
cost of coffee is below the cost of
production of coffee which drives the
farmer into further poverty but doing
something like this actually helps them
a lot
here are not the organizations that
govern our support feted production so
on the left you see two logos the first
one is a fellow and the second one is
transferred to USA these are certifying
agencies they set standards for fair
trade produce and whichever produces our
companies qualify for those standards
their product can get this certification
so if you're ever looking for Fairtrade
products specially produce you can look
for these two symbols on the right the
two logos
the first one is Fair Trade Federation
and second well second one is WFD which
is world fair trade organizations these
are governing organizations they're not
certifiers but they have a list of
business policies and standards and
whichever business qualify for those
practices they get membership in these
organizations so and you will find these
two logos on all the company information
on their websites or on the product you
can say they're members of these
organizations so again these are not
product certifications but there are
their company memberships and this is
usually available for non produced
company for example a clothing company
if if that organization is a part of
Fair Trade Federation any literature of
that company will carry that information
so so far there is no certification for
products added for non for fair trade
products other than produce I'm going to
take you guys through a small video
which we made in one around the trips to
India and this is Gujarat the Northwest
region of India
freedom is your car turning them okay
look into car turning them hi this is
coach Northwestern desert region of
India
so kind righted us to this beautiful
village suka is a very talented artisan
and very well respected in her community
she practices the art of fine metalwork
and employ tree in olden times this kind
of fine artwork who was used to make
dowdy textiles to give to the brides the
artwork was thus considered very sacred
and was not allowed to use for any
commercial purposes in 2001 a strong
earthquake shook this region everything
was destroyed houses land vegetation
everything the only thing that survived
was this age-old art it was there that
the art was shared with the world for
the first time suka has used the income
generated by this art to rebuild her
community and support her family
support producers around the club and
help them innovate in global poverty he
didn't show us no child labor and a
bright future for Addison's kids our
next destination will be hookah a nearby
village we will meet Kishore there he's
a natural dye drop pinching artists
with the model with a meaning demo scare
me meeting them okay I see for you so
are we really making a difference I'll
quickly take you through some of our
artisan stories this is suka that you
just saw in the video she is from the
culture region they had a massive
earthquake in 2001 almost 80 percent of
the community was destroyed one of the
ways they have been able to rebuild the
communities through the income that they
generate through this art this is Marie
one of our tribal artisans in on the
border of Gujarat and Maharashtra when
she joined this cooperative she was a
she was a widow and in her community
being a widow doesn't give us give her a
lot of voice in community being a part
of this cooperative she was able to make
a sustainable living not only for
herself but for our family and slowly
she gained more respect in our community
and ultimately she was able to remarry
which is an achievement for our
community this is a group very close to
our heart on the right you see a picture
of the founder of an art cooperative
these guys are in a slum area around
Delhi and there were four years there
have been in jewelry making but they
have always been exploited by local
middlemen and they were being pushed to
a point where they were they were a bad
they were about to abandon their art and
move to cities and and find whatever
they could get his daughter who's in the
picture below learned internet she found
us somehow and order wrote us an email
saying we really need some support and
we had no idea who they were we had our
team in India actually found them when
two
them and realize that they are a great
set of people they have amazing art we
were able to work with them create a
line that is really successful for us
now and we are proud that we are able to
give them good employment and and now
the whole community is booming they are
able to involve the entire community and
we can slowly see a progression we're
slowly they become economic
self-sufficient then they are able to
open up to send their children to more
schools so there is a whole progression
that happens over a period of years just
because there is economic
self-sufficiency these are pictures of
some of our artisans in northern India
and this cooperative supports many women
who have escaped child marriages or
abusive marriages this cooperative gives
them a safe home teaches them vocational
skills and gives them independence these
are some of the development projects
that that we are involved in
but there are a lot of challenges for
fair trade there is very limited
consumer education sometimes doing
things the right way doesn't make them
the cheapest which is a big challenge
also there is a lot of fair trade
washing consumers have to differentiate
between what is marketing and what is
mission and I can give you guys a simple
example there's a company that says if
you buy a red car or a red cellphone we
give a certain amount of dollar to a
certain charity in Africa and a lot of
time people think that is a responsible
company but we don't question how is the
product being made what are the core
practices of that community are these
sweat Adie
is that cellphone being made in a
sweatshop so that is as consumers we
have to understand where there are
companies doing something good for the
marketing part of it or is the core
principle of the company looking to make
sure they are respectful of people and
our environment there is a lot of lack
of resources within Fairtrade businesses
within producers there is lack of
materials training and logistics and it
is not convenient to adopt Fairtrade we
as consumers if I want to go and buy a
favorite pair of shoe there is not much
available I have to wear a Nike athletic
shoe because there is no other option so
it's not easy for us to adopt Fairtrade
even if we want to
so how can you help the most important
thing is educating ourselves
understanding the purpose of theater and
why it is important
educating and promoting in our community
weed in fellow Googlers be in your faith
group meet your family or friends
supporting Fairtrade products wherever
possible it could be as small as
Fairtrade coffee in the Google cafe
there can be small steps that we can all
take to slowly make a difference by
volunteering or working with Fairtrade
companies these are some of the some of
the Fairtrade products now available
every day then more and more and better
fitted products being available some
facts and figures it is one of the
fastest growing market segments so it is
a good business model and majority of
crafts are made by the middle half of
the resources to learn more about fair
trade also these resources will tell us
places where to buy a Fairtrade products
from and the choice is ultimately ours
questions simple ones I'm joking
please
do you have much experience outside of
like a skilled craft crafts person or
artist in how to help people that are
working in a factory or that type of
situation to improve their situations my
personal experience well you asked me
five if I personally have experience
either or just information this one
thing that like you said it's very
difficult to know like right now it's
very difficult for me to know where the
things I buy come from and to make a
choice you know something might cost
more but that doesn't mean the people
that produced it were paid more so I'm
curious if you have any knowledge or
experience with and thank you it's a
great question
it is very hard right now to really
understand where your product is coming
for from and how it is made the the most
important I think turning point at this
at this stage is to ask to ask the
producers and to ask your local store if
you if you do grocery at Safeway
sometimes ask them hey is your coffee
coffee producer do you know if they were
paid a fair wage do you know there was
no child labor involved the more you ask
your local stores they will ask their
producers and it will make a difference
it is as I said consumers drive the
market the practices and the standards
so the more we go and ask the more it
makes a difference I have a really good
example I recently gave a talk in Norman
Oklahoma they're trying to make it a
fair trade town and one of the
professor's they have a school for peace
and justice and she actually gave a
project over class to to go to a coffee
shop in their area which was the popular
cafe and in the university and asked him
about Fairtrade coffee and if they
offered Fairtrade coffee in a month
about 10 to 20 people went and asked in
manager do you sell Fairtrade coffee do
you know where coffee come from the
manager had no choice but to look up
here he was it was very cute he didn't
know what fair trade was he looked up
Fairtrade coffee and he's even strong
believer that he wants to serve good
coffee that was his first parameter he
learned there are fair trade coffee
vendor
in the city he actually tried that
coffee and figured out that coffee was
better coffee than the coffee he was
serving he brought that in now he serves
100% Fairtrade coffee people go there to
that cafe just because the surfeited
coffee and the manager is happy there is
more business people are happy they get
better coffee and they can drink it with
proud they know that coffee does not
involve a child label so asking is is
the biggest thing and not to say an
example I wanted to get the chocolate I
bought I wanted to get a fair trade
chocolate and I was California being
California I I was under the assumption
that every big grocery store will have
fair trade chocolates that was not true
and it is not a critic but the fact that
if in California where their most
conscious people in the country are not
demanding Fairtrade products then we
have a lot of work to do does that help
in a lot of times going to companies
websites will give you a lot of
information a lot of companies will will
have a lot of claim of social
responsibility but when you ask for
details or go on their website you will
find nothing so many times just sending
a giving an feedback on their website
saying we need to understand where your
products are coming from a lot of big
companies have made changes after there
has been communities and nonprofits who
have started big organizations are are
activism to to not do certain things
Nike has made a lot of change a lot of
oil companies have Lord made a lot of
change after people have asked them it
makes a big difference
are there any exemptions given by
countries for fair trade goods to for
Paducah import and export duties such so
if I am trying to import fair trade
coffee from Brazil say into the USA are
there any discounts or exemptions on
import and export duties unfortunately
not if anything it will be harder fair
trade market is such a fair trade
trading is so small right now that it is
not even scratching the surface the the
biggest importer of fair trade coffee in
u.s. Starbucks and within Starbucks one
percent of their coffee is fair trade so
it is miniscule amount and the
government's are the governments of the
country cannot there is such strong
lobby of non feted organizations that
the governments of poor countries can't
afford to take a stand against
convention trade so we have a long way
to go before there can be incentives for
fair trade at a at a government level
this actually touches what you just said
about four countries because I am
originally from Romania and I doubt
Fairtrade would have a very large
adoption rate over there because when
you have quite a small salary every
month what you're looking for is buying
the most of what you need not
necessarily seeing that that's going to
benefit other people so having said that
I currently live in Switzerland where
there is a huge emphasis on buying local
home or natively made products which
means things like ranging from steaks to
local paid shoes to locally made clothes
are given preference both by the
customers and by the stores which make a
big selling point out of the fact that
this has been made in Switzerland
everywhere you look you'll see labels
that saying just made and so I think
that plays a big role in helping the
local producers so I think what fair
trade is a good start in the end to keep
this sustainable it helps a lot more if
the people in the country that this is
this these products are being made them
would actually buy them themselves and
give them preference over things made in
a factory that you know employs children
or that just makes a thousand of them
very low quality absolutely locally
locally goes hand in hand local has the
same values as Fairtrade if there is
something which is available local you
don't have to buy it from outside
absolutely buying things from outside
has a much bigger environmental impact
the carbon footprint is really high and
when you buy things made local you are
I'm sorry
you're strengthening your own community
which makes it powerful which makes it
do better and bigger things
so absolutely thank you
so no questions means is everybody
agreeing to we need Fairtrade thank you
for coming this is great I just ran
across an interesting counterpoint to
this I want to hear how you responded
which is the idea that if a store offers
a fair trade item at a higher price than
the conventional item then it creates
more market segmentation which would
drive down the price of the the standard
item which would reduce the living
quality of living of the people
producing that lower quality product and
potentially just transfer the the wealth
from one set of poor people to another
set of poor people not really changing
the net so how would you respond to that
position
thank you that's a really good question
it is you are true you are correct that
if we think that fair trade product is
premium the non fair trade product we
devalue the non fair trade product and
it can potentially drive down the price
but at the same time we are hoping that
as fair trade demand increases more and
more people will be more and more
producers will form their cooperatives
and move over to the fair trade segment
so though there is less demand of non
fated products
the demand for fated products will
increase and slowly the producers will
shift from this part with that part and
we have to go through this chain this
change in process before we can
completely move all producers in the
fair trade section so we have to go
through that cycle but the faster we
make a transformation the more and more
people support fair trade practices
easier that transformation will be and
hopefully companies when when you see
more demand of fair trade products
corporations will get inspired to change
their practices and it doesn't companies
don't have to change their sourcing
partners they can work with the same
factories they can work with the same
producers but do it better make sure
that the the farmers in that in the
factories are sorry the producers in the
factories are given better conditions
it is it is it is a hard step but every
company who's tasted that has seen a
strong inspiration in its producers and
its employees and when they communicated
well the market responds to it so I'm
hoping that there's a time when people
can think yes fated for it is better
that'll be a great step and fated is not
against capitalism failure is not
against efficiency fated wants to make
sure that there are environmental and
social boundaries it is it wants to make
sure that the group of marginalized
people who cannot protect their own
rights are given a platform where they
can where they can engage in global
trade equally
Oh No have you been involved at all with
things like government legislation to
actually help because it seems like also
that there are people who will buy the
cheapest thing regardless of what they
know about how it was made and it's some
level of all the people wanting to make
money it might come down to someone
saying it's not legal to do the things
that the are being done so is that
something you've been involved in no
we've we are honestly at this point we
as an organization we don't think we can
be very effective at that as individuals
so for me I've taken my journey as to
support a set of producers and to create
awareness in the North American consumer
market but there are a lot of
organizations who are who are doing that
and we support them in many ways there
are fair trade collisions in most
chapters there is also a big coalition
of sweat-free apparel which is which is
big in California actually so there are
many organizations who are working on
the government level to make a
difference or to set basic standards of
operation in the factories a good just
to add to it a good resource for making
changes at that level would be global
exchange it's a nonprofit based in San
Francisco and they have done a lot of
work on government lobbying and activism
in in fair trade so if you go to a
global exchange exchange at OIG you'll
find that information they also have an
online fair trade store and three
brick-and-mortar favorite stores in in
Northern California do you think fair
trade and the drive to basically the
drive to basically consume less and the
fact that it almost seems to me like the
current system is basically driven
towards volume where and you basically
the amount economics of skills comes
into comes a lot into the picture where
and you basically want to produce more
and more and I guess to me it seems
almost like fair trade would be almost
do really well in a market where there's
less to basically consume overall and
it's almost like okay if you basically
start do less wastage consume less
consume more it almost kind of seems to
go that way so my kind of question is
does this kind of so what about all the
people who are in that supply chain who
basically kind of live off of the
existing system and it's almost like
it's can go either way in terms of the
impact of going towards a Fairtrade kind
of model you right in your observation
that it is fair trade has been more
successful in more niche markets because
for a niche product people put more
attention on what they're buying and
people are willing to to pay more for a
product the the downside is that
majority of producing farmers are
involved in commodities so even if we
have niche markets that are serving
Fairtrade products it will not make a
big difference on producers and farmers
so and these second downside is that
every time you you make something on a
bigger level there will be dilution so
as more and more organizations
participate in fair trade fair trade
standards will become lower we cannot
change that that is a law of nature but
the only way to to make a bigger impact
and to reach most people we have to
accept or acknowledge feted in in
commodities and it will happen slowly
one of the things one of the another
reason of working for feted in commodity
is that it touches more consumers most
people know about fair trade just
because fated coffee is very popular it
is it is one product that many people
buy every day it is easy to support and
it makes a big difference
so niche markets can only sometimes
reach niche audience which is what is
happening in crafts
products up apart from produce there it
could be it could be clothing it could
be baths it could be stationery they are
they've become a speciality market there
are stores that sell Fairtrade products
but they are not serving the masses not
many people know about it not many
people support them and because there is
lack of education so we cannot ignore
the masses and and and make a difference
in a very small market it will not be
enough another thing that is happening
is because people have started to care
more about where that product is coming
from there is a huge amount of marketing
focus we call it Fairtrade washing and
hopefully many companies are changing
their practices but there is every
product that you that you see in the
market now has a claim of sustainability
if you buy a detergent it is helping
somebody
if you bias you know kind of salt it has
a pink ribbon on it so it is also more
important at this time that we start the
education process otherwise every
company will have a small claim of
social responsibility and for consumers
that is good enough does that answer the
question
so again I want to thank you all for
coming and for the discussion I'll be
around for some time if anybody has any
questions I'll be happy to to give my
contact information
I want to thank Archie and Fran I for
arranging this discussion if there's
anything I can do to to answer any
questions I'll be happy to do that thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
