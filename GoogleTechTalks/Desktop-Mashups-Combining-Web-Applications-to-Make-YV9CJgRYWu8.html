here CEO of a startup in England called
export net and I've known mark for the
last few years through my work on xforms
and the nice thing about what marks
built that he's going to show you today
is um he's taken a set of fundamental
technologies like X forms in the browser
and the fact that you can do XML HTTP
requests and there are nice things like
Google web api's so he's staying in all
of these things and put together what is
a very nice framework for both authoring
web mashups and then deploying those my
shops in a number of ways including as
little applications that show up on the
sidebar or the system tray or whatever
mark first showed me this about three
years ago this notion of communal being
able to take a little web application
and then host it outside the browser on
the system tray and of course today
everybody talks about that in the notion
of dashboard widget said gadgets so I
let mark described in greater detail
what he does and show you you know show
you the details of his work rather than
trying to summarize it myself sir thank
you very much I just turn off
okay thank you very much ramen hello
everybody thank you for having me so as
ramen said the space where we're
particularly interested in is trying to
build applications using standard
languages like XHTML xforms JavaScript
trying to build trying to sort of blur
the distinction between the desktop
application and the web application
which obviously that's what everybody
says they're doing so luckily I've got
some time now to explain what I mean by
that as opposed to what I think other
people mean so too oh by the way if
anybody feel free to interject at any
point and ask questions and everything
because it's it's probably a lot easier
than trying to hold everything till the
end assuming there are questions to ask
it's probably easier because i'd like to
show code and you know source and stuff
like that so feel free to just shout out
and ask questions so where are we at
today in terms of applications well
obviously there's a lot of stuff going
on here we are in Google you know home
of a lot of it where people are building
web applications or what people call web
applications applications that run in
the browser that sort of take on quite a
lot of the functionality a great deal of
the functionality of a traditional
desktop application that's not the only
thing that people mean by web
applications but there's a there's some
applications that don't necessarily have
a have a mirror in the desktop world but
generally a lot of very clever very
clever things are going on in this space
where people are creating applications
that run in the browser so that's sort
of what we mean by web application I
think then obviously as well people are
getting very excited about the idea of
gadgets what people are calling gadgets
these generally though run also inside
the browser but many to a page so you
have this idea of a number of different
gadgets sitting on some kind of home
page and for those gadgets to break out
of the browser you generally need some
kind of framework that gets installed
and there are a number of these
increasing number of these appearing
where people are creating desktop
frameworks that you install allow you to
run different types of gadgets ranging
from you know the ones that are in the
Mac the dashboard and this all the way
through to the Google Desktop API and
the different kinds of things so I think
the the web applications is for me
perhaps the most exciting because it it
starts to solve a problem not because
the functionality of the web
applications themselves starts a mirror
that on the desktop although obviously
they're improving and different
applications are getting more and more
powerful particularly with a with the
server taking on more and more of the
roles so we have applications now where
you can do image processing are you
constantly sending the files back to the
server getting them rotated for you and
red eye removed and then coming back
again so there's some quite clever
things going on but I think the the real
strength of these applications the
reason I myself for example use them is
because they they put your data in the
cloud they put your data out on the out
on the on the net so you know if every
you've had a hard disk go on your laptop
or anything you'll know the advantages
of that the ability to just move from
machine to machine laptop the laptop and
and find your data in the same place and
obviously the whole question of
collaboration the ability to share
documents with people without having to
first start to think where am I going to
place this document send somebody a link
or whatever so things like Google Docs
you know excellent in this in this
regard and because of that to me it
doesn't really matter whether they ever
achieved the complete functionality of
something like word or whatever because
the the benefit is not in the
functionality the benefit is in this
additional set of tools which don't
really have a parallel in Word and Excel
prior to this so I think I see that as
exciting
but Owens really see that the moment the
gadget the gadget space is fairly boring
it's that they tend to be siloed gadgets
not talking to each other you have a
little weather gadget and you have a
stock gadget and there's no relationship
between them they look great you know
there's loads of really nice flash
applications knocking around but there's
nothing there that's very interesting in
the same way that the web application
space is interesting however what are
the limitations of where we're at now
will the the web applications that we're
talking about it the browser isn't
always the right model the right
paradigm for dealing with these kinds of
applications so the number of times I
don't if you're the same as maybe the
number of times you're sitting there
with your spreadsheet in Google Docs or
your your document and you sort of go to
the file menu to press save you know
that kind of almost instinctive from
your use of desktop applications almost
instinctive way that you use sort of the
mental model that you build of how
you're interacting with this application
but of course it doesn't really fit
because you know you're actually still
in the browser you're still in a web
browser the the idea of having your
calendar in the way that you would
traditionally something that just sort
of sits there on your desktop all day
long now it's in the browser you've got
the possibility of accidentally closing
in this kind of thing so that so the
browser although it's great that the
these things are being pushed forward
and the these these kinds of
applications are really pushing the
browser to its limits I think as I said
before the the limitations of the gadget
space is that they they're siloed they
don't really talk to each other and then
there's a broader limitation that i
would say which is really where my
interest in this whole space comes in
which is that building traditional
desktop applications is far too
difficult so if you see it as a sort of
spectrum there's
the web applications coming from the web
increasingly coming onto the desktop and
I'm saying that the the browser model
isn't quite right to host them but then
from the other end of the spectrum I'm
saying that it applications that you
would normally break open your C++
compiler for get java out and start
building those kinds of applications
shouldn't really need to be built in
those languages it anymore there is a
possibility now particularly
applications that what i call
internet-facing they shouldn't really
need to be using those kinds of
languages this it's a it's a heavy
hammer to crack a nut so I'm throwing in
there another limitation of the current
state of of development which is that
not just web applications points to be
made on those but also desktop
applications that are too difficult to
build at the moment so what is it that
we're trying to do in this context and
this isn't really about sort of here's a
piece of software go and buy it because
actually is not for sale so this isn't
meant to be like a product pitch as such
this is this is a kind of discussion
about some of the ideas that we're using
and come some of the sort of I guess
philosophies that we're applying to try
and solve these problems so goal number
one we're trying to we're trying to make
it so that any any document whether it's
flash or HTML XHTML can be turned into a
desktop application even if you don't
control that document even if it's
somebody else's document out on the web
or flash application or whatever you
should be able to make that into a
desktop application on your desktop we
want to give web applications when
you're writing a web application we want
to give it the same kind of features
that you would normally expect when
you're writing a C++ program on the
desktop so we want to be able to have
windows that dr. the side of the screen
and auto high transparency opacity we
want to be able to write to the system
tray I wrote a document a few years ago
for a w3c
then called good question coming what it
was called actually but it was along the
lines of towards a standards-based
virtual machine and the idea here is to
have a virtual machine that sits above
the operating system and not in this
sort of Java way not in the sort of bits
and bytes virtual machine but a virtual
machine in the sense of a set of
languages like HTML XHTML declarative
markup that can sit between your
application and the operating system so
that's what we're talking about here
that that language having access to the
OS in such a ways to produce
slick-looking applications at the same
time it's it's using standard
technologies that are well established
on the internet so we want to be able to
build internet-facing desktop
applications faster than we would be
able to do with say C++ or Java we want
to get a lot of reuse as a very
important goal we want to be able to
make it so that somebody's application
built say with HTML can become a desktop
application as I've said but then can
also become a widget in some other
application so something like Google
Maps can become a small widget on
another application and if I if I need 5
maps on a page I've got five occurrences
of the google map so you take something
which is a sort of page size and becomes
a widget size you want to get reuse from
the from the coding effort and then all
of this we want to be created using
standard languages we want to want to
make it so that if certainly by building
on XHTML we're building on something
that people already very familiar with
so we want to be able to get that kind
of power out of the the the language
that people are used to normally just
for sort of basic marker okay so
Sidewinder is our framework that tries
to take us towards some of these goals
so we have this application called
Sidewinder we actually have 22 pieces of
software one is called forms plan which
is an X forms process
conforms to the w3c's xforms standard
and the other is a sidewinder which is
responsible for trying to do the things
that I've just described and it's mainly
Sidewinder that I'll show now as I try
and illustrate some of the points that
that I've been making so at its most
basic Sidewinders a host remember I said
that we want any document to be able to
be a desktop application it's a
sidewinder at its most basic is a host
for for these well for anything let's
let's have a look at one so I don't know
if you people have come across your
minis I'm sure you have your minis is a
site where you can go and get flash
widgets gadgets so here I just show you
the source of this first here we've got
a basic XHTML page can you see that is
it sort of legible sorry about that
looks a bit small but basically the
structure is it's it's a it's an XHTML
page can you hear me if I'm turning
facing this way listen it's an XHTML
page a little bit of CSS at the top and
then these three or four lines at the
bottom here are just the HTML that you
would get off their site to embed in
your blog or whatever you know the score
these kind of gadget widget things that
are all the rage at the moment you go to
the site you choose the one you want you
can figure it to say i want the weather
in palo alt or whatever and then you
take the markup and then you go and put
it into your blog so that now is
something that Sidewinder can deal with
and so there we have a desktop
application containing the weather okay
big deal I mean obviously you can see
that it's HTML and it's it's it's HTML
being hosted inside sidewinder what we
do next though is if we take the same
widget but this time we add
some metadata at the top when we say
that the position we want this widget to
be in is the top right we want it to
auto hide we wanted to anchor itself to
the top right position the width of it
will be 250 pixels the height 100 and we
say chrome false so we turn off the the
menu and the and the system flows but
you saw in that in that thing if you
look down the bottom you'll see that the
widget is exactly the same as it was
before there's the little bit of markup
embedded there a 1-1 of the meta
property we've said the transparency
color to use is 123456 and then I've
just made sure that I've set the
background on the HTML element to be one
two three four five six so I'm sure you
can guess what's supposed to happen we
got the same widget now dr. the top
right you see that it's transparent the
the the one two three four five six of
the background has now been replaced
with the transparent if I move the mouse
over you can see that it's still the
same widget the cut all the
functionality is still there as they
wanted if I move the mouse off it auto
hides move the mouse back it reveals
itself again
so the idea is that two things really
one is that we're using standard
languages to try and achieve our goal of
creating applications the second is that
we're using other people's applications
to create applications I'll give another
example this one runs Sidewinder from
the command line what it's going to do
here all of the properties that you just
saw in the meta tag in the meta sitting
at the top of the document the meta
properties at the top you know position
top right transparency this kind of
thing all of those are also available
from the command line so here we say
open Sidewinder we give it the URL of
actually an Adobe demo so so that I can
prove that I have no control over this
application it's it's the Flex store
demo that they that they do on their
site so you see the URL there HTTP /
examples blah blah blah all the way
through to the to the hash then it says
hash meta and then this is a technique
we devised which is basically the x
pointer like we've done if you've come
across x pointer but it's x pointer like
in the sense that you can put extra
information into the URL and then we say
right we want the width to be a thousand
pixels height 600 we want the position
to be at the bottom auto hide same as
before auto hide and we're saying that
the title the title that should appear
in the in the application title position
should be flex door ok so now run that
from the command line ignore a few
script errors if you would
but basically we now have their
application running inside Sidewinder
again does everything that you would
expect it to you can see the title there
at the top left is flexed or if I move
the mouse off it auto hides to the
bottom because that's what I told it to
do I told it to auto hide and I told it
to dock itself to the bottom for move
the mouse down the bottom OOP up it
comes again so again same principle use
somebody else's application to make your
applications or rather using web
applications to make desktop
applications and as you can see what i
mean by desktop is i mean i don't mean
that we're trying to mimic Microsoft
Word or whatever I mean simply that
we're giving the desktop experience to
the user outside of the browser and
using applications that are are on the
web you know web applications so
creating desktop applications with web
applications but try not to touch it
well we in this case we can't touch it
there's nothing we can do to the
applications on somebody else's server
so we've had to introduce this kind of
packing information into the URL itself
when we invoke it in order to sort of a
hostess application that's on the web
but give it the look and feel and the
and the features that we want so that's
the first goal any any document can be a
desktop application Snow's a spelling
mistake there apologize so
the second thing was that I said before
my initial list was that we want to be
able to provide desktop like features to
to web applications when they're running
in the in the in this framework so once
they're running inside sidewinder we
want to try and provide the application
with with as many features as possible
so I've seen some we've made it so that
it can doctor the side of the screen
auto-hide this kind of thing another
thing we've done though is we've made it
so that when a web application requests
a new window in the way that it often
does with with IE over with the browser
you know whatever we made it so that the
application developer can get a hold of
that create whatever window of whatever
type they want before then giving it
back to the application so to illustrate
if I say let it go
okay so there's a gmail running inside
Sidewinder dr. the side if I open an
email and then navigate to a URL and
normally that would open a new tab or a
new window I'll show you the code in the
minute that that does this but actually
i'll show you that first i'll show you
that first
so that's what we what we've done is
we've made JavaScript into it into a
first-class language within our
framework so JavaScript isn't just
something that's now inside the HTML
document javascript is something that
you can use to write so that you can use
to write desktop applications so if I
show you this so that window that was on
the right hand side was invoked using
this JavaScript here I start at the
bottom work backwards so the main
function is called the first thing that
the main function does is it creates a
new renderer we call these renderers
there's a just the generic term for all
of these windows that are flying around
this particular render has been told to
have a title of Sidewinder Google Mail
which you can see at the top left there
said all sorts of style on it which
which indicate you know title bar and
you know close checkbox and that kind of
thing again same parameters as we've
seen twice already we've seen them once
in the meta information that's inside
the document we've seen them once in the
URL that we can give in the meta x
pointer syntax once again same
parameters here auto hide is true width
is 512 we create that renderer which
we've told to be of type XHTML see at
the top there we can have plain text
renderers we can have different types of
renders we tell it to create it and we
tell it then to load a google mail into
it and then what we do is we register an
event listener and because sidewinder is
hosting gmail sidewinder can do all
sorts of things I mean it could it could
do anything it could get the mouse
clicks first or whatever it could do
whatever you like in this particular
case when a new window is requested by
that application we get in there first
because we've attached an event listener
here and when and we've said that the
handler for that event listener is new
is the function new window up here the
function new window will create another
renderer object
that render object has got all the same
parameters as the as any other of our
render objects its position auto hide
whatever we can dock it and then we pass
it back to the event through the event
object so again this illustrates again
we're an application that we can't
control gmail is not our application
obviously but we're trying to augment
the functionality almost like aspect
programming effect you familiar with
that concept where you you're able to
get in at various key points in the in
the application lifecycle and kind of do
things what we're using here though so
that's the first thing this illustrates
second thing illustrates is again once
again the way we're using standards so
you mentioned that we're using XHTML
xforms here you can see that we're using
Dom two events the Dom two events
standard is being used here to to define
the interaction between these documents
so even between these windows so even
though we're running on a window system
here but we could be running on a map
could be running on Linux we've
abstracted away that interaction between
the windows and we've used Dom two
events a nice w3c standard dumped two
events most people familiar with it from
their work with the dome itself in their
kind of contained enclosed environment
we're using the same standard to define
the interactions between various parts
of the of the environment I showed you
all that first just in case anything
goes wrong now when I try and show you
so here now I go to somebody sent me an
email or this is on on the X forms list
at the end of John boys email he has a
link to his blog so if I click on that
now there you can see that that's the
window that gmail would have opened we
got there first we gave it a window as
you can see there with the title at the
top sidewinder Google Gmail window
there's John's smiling face in there if
I now move my mouse off you can see that
it is one of our windows it's auto
hiding it's docked to the right-hand
side as you can see
because we had JavaScript over on the
left-hand side we could have done
anything we could have said if this is
the third window that you've opened
today put it in the top left so we've
got complete control over the over the
environment the kind of thing you would
normally be doing in C++ or Java the
kind of control that would normally have
in a you know those kinds of
environments we're trying to make it so
that we've got that level of control in
in JavaScript so they've seen another
way that we are able to create
applications
so and they're similar principle applies
we want to be able to open in google
docs we want to go in and when you say
create a new spreadsheet or open one of
my spreadsheets we want to be able to
open that in a window of our own control
and our own devising positioning it on
the screen again increasingly turning
into a like a windows MDI style
application but something that's still
very the technologies used to build it
is still very web oriented so
so we're trying to build so this is the
spectrum that I said coming from the
other side we're trying to build desktop
applications using web technologies
we're not just talking about the the web
applications that sit on the web and how
we can improve them we're saying that we
want to actually build desktop
application if I want to build a chat
client now our suggestion is that we
wouldn't go out and like I said crank up
C++ or Java or whatever to write the
client we would have some kind of
convergence with the very clever clients
that are written running on the web but
we would put them into her into the
container such that it looks like and
feels to the user like a proper desktop
application so another so I've shown you
some some of this JavaScript I'll show
you a couple more applications that make
use of this technique here that you that
you can see this where i showed you how
the windows are created there
so this example again pretty
straightforward these these functions
here just make it easier to create the
windows so that they're pretty can be
pretty much ignored but basically what
this all this one does is it creates a
host window so this is so we're now
starting to move more towards
applications that we've got more control
over you saw before that we created an
XHTML window or renderer and then
dropped into it google mail gmail in
this particular case we've written the
pieces that make up this application but
we we've done it in such a way that we
want to be able to reuse them so
difficult to explain really without I'll
just illustrate it so take for example
this simple
this is a simple xforms application so
ramen I'm not being very good at telling
you what's happening you've got to guess
what's happening okay so this is a NEX
forms application that it's loading a
video it's a NASA video right so I'm
just I'm just letting the video load
first right so this is this is you know
the video that's just all streaming all
the time out of NASA so that's running
in that window now if we look at the
actual source for that we see that it's
got the stuff that i showed earlier it's
got anchor true position it to the right
all of the meta tags at the top that i
showed earlier then if we go down that's
the application you can see there that
that's an X forms output element and the
ex forms output element has a value of
the URL of the video stream coming from
NASA and then it's got an attribute
called media type this is a new addition
in the X 4 and 1 point 1 which is the
ability to say that this output control
should be an image or this output
control should be a sound file or a
video or whatever so you see there that
I've just got one line of code I've got
the the URL for the video I've got the
attribute that says please show a video
and I've got some style in there that
says how big the video should be so
that's nice and simple nice and easy you
know somebody could have gone off and
written this and not that I would obtain
them very long but it you know they
could have written that and and there we
go it sits there now what we're trying
to do is say well that's that's
something that we want to reuse that's
something that we don't want to create
an application now that's lots bigger
than that unnecessarily ideally we want
to just reuse that maybe have a couple
more windows that have some RSS feeds
may be coming out of NASA and look at
the the news so if we go back to our
JavaScript we can see here that we
create these four windows one of
Windows is a is a host window that's
going to contain our application and
then well actually this loads an HTML
version of that file but it's the same
file the web app that i just showed so
you can see the first window just simply
loads that video the next two windows
are X forms again and this time what
they hold is RSS feeds and again if
you're not familiar with xforms it's
very very simple to do things like this
in this particular case we load some
instance data with an rdf feed you can
see there the URL at the top we have an
action handler to refresh which happens
you know periodically on a timer and
then the actual displaying of that it's
just that repeat there repeat iterate
through each of the items and then
output the title and the description
that comes from the feed so all of that
together so you can see we've got a
video we've got one far holding a video
got two files holding an RSS feed and
then if we then run the javascript file
it's now running in Sidewinder each of
those three components is now running
and I can you know interact with the RSS
feeds or the to RSS feeds down the
bottom if I'd have plugged in the sound
and ever thought of that then the
streaming video would have would have
played so again so you can see we're
trying to make it again so that you you
you that's a simple application to me
that's sort of moving on a little bit
from the although it doesn't look as
good as these widgets that that
everybody's you know they're your minis
and this kind of nicely designed you
know where I'm not a designer but it's
kind of moving in terms of functionality
it's moving I feel beyond the basic
widgets that are out there except but
but with only a few lines of marker
wouldn't necessarily say that anybody
who knows HTML could could use xforms
straight away but certainly it's not
that complicated and that difficult to
move to this to creating these kinds of
applications sorry I knew I shouldn't
have docked it to the right side let me
just get rid of that and then you can
see the inside
I messed it up but anyway that you can
see that I can move the windows around
yeah i have just messed it up so
Sidewinders you know giving you the
different windows inside that you can
the user can then interact with so each
of those windows could have been you
know auto hiding within its own presence
opaque transparent all of the different
attributes that we had before so I've
explained pretty much how we've got one
of the features that I was describing
earlier the ability to reuse different
pieces which is one of the key design
goals that we're working towards in what
we're doing here and I've Illustrated
that there the ability to take a video
that somebody's created or a web page
with a video on take a couple of RSS
feeds that somebody's used they could be
used many times again on different
applications and in this particular case
they're all brought together to create
this particular application
similar example
we have again an X form that's reading
an RSS feed this time it's reading the
RSS feed well as yes reading RSS feed
and then
this RSS feed contains travel
information you know from the UK you
know like a trains are derailed or
whatever and then it's using the
Microsoft maps to overlay the travel
information on the top now again not
particularly difficult obviously there's
lots of places where this has been done
on the server and everything but the the
amount of xforms markup that's required
to do this is very little so they go you
know the usual stuff but in terms of
reuse that I was describing earlier if I
then go to the back to the samples page
and go to the one above you see that
we've got the same form exactly the same
form this time running in a standalone
sidewinder application and this time
using google maps instead of Microsoft's
mount so again the idea all the time
keep keep reusing you write the
application a small number of times not
obviously not want because we're we're
not using it exactly the same but by by
putting so much functionality into the
framework itself you get to to be able
to reuse the the code
when it comes up
I'll let it load come back so so that's
at the application level we've been
talking about things happening at the
the level of applications that are
running within the framework within the
sidewinder framework but where we also
want to get a lot of reuses down at the
what you might call the widget level so
as taken ages to load must be the feed
so
so that was basically the same form this
time running in inside a sidewinder
application looks like I still went for
the data to come in so now I'll just
show a few things going down to the
widget level
mainly to illustrate not not so much how
clever the widgets are because they're
they're fairly basic these ones but just
more to illustrate the power again of X
forms as a way of creating these things
so here we can see a simple X form we've
got an output member before we had an
output which was the video URL and it
was showing a video this time the output
is as tagged up as geo position and the
input to it is a longitudinal attitude
and it just gives a very basic
very basic map centered on that point
this is running inside Sidewinder
running inside the browser this time and
Sidewinder has the ability to show the
the progress of the loading it would
show errors there if there were any
validation errors and it also allows you
to edit the source inside so this is all
sitting inside Internet Explorer there
to make that a dynamic map in X forms
all that requires is that the output
control is bound to some dynamic data
so in this example we've still got an
output control creating a map but this
time the map itself is bound to some
instance data internally and in a kind
of spreadsheet like manner you know if
you do if you change the data you can
see the code on the Left there's nothing
in there that says when the data changes
do this xforms gives you for free the
fact that the two are kept kept in sync
so that's a key component of the
architecture is this idea of widgets
being built on top of this xforms model
because xforms itself is keeping
everything in sync is is managing
changes in that input control that I
just edited automatically updating the
map then your job is then to basically
produce the widget that reflects the
data your job isn't to get involved in
the actual underlying wiring of the
application in the way that we would
traditionally have to do with other
languages our job here is when we're
when we're programming here is to just
get into the nitty-gritty of the actual
widget that represents the particular
piece of data that you're you're trying
to represent and you've already seen a
video widget given a URL plays a video
but we you know we have maps clocks all
sorts of different kinds of things that
can then be reused on the form so final
thing that we're we're working on is
is something is to extend the platform
so that the underlying architecture also
then has access to metadata about what
about everything really the idea is that
it's got access to any kind of metadata
that you would want and this I think is
this to me is the most exciting area
that were that we're starting to well
this is where we've been trying to get
to for a number of years and we're now
starting to get close close to being
able to do this so what I mean by this
the reason I find this interesting is
because at the moment the general sort
of mashup model that people have is you
take data that's distributed externally
and you just mix it together which is
which is great that's all very well what
we want to be able to do though is to
take that data externally and mix it
together with your own data so if you're
looking at a site that contains listings
of or not listings but a list of events
then the events that you're not able to
attend because you're on holiday we
would like to be shown maybe in a
different color or to not appear in the
list so in other words we want to be
able to you may still call that a mashup
if you want but we want to be able to
mix data that you're accumulating as you
go about your daily life and your daily
use of the web and we want to be able to
mix that with the data that you're
interacting with over the over the net
so this is very very new
part of our framework is not just the
standalone applications that I've been
describing docking to the side of the
screen and all this kind of thing but
also we can run xforms applications
inside the browser in like sidebars
footer bars toolbars explorer bars that
sit at the bottom on the on the system
tray so this particular one is just
simply looking in the web page to the
right for any microformats or meta or
rdfa I don't know if people have come
across rdfa but it's a syntax for
putting structured data into HTML pages
so if I pick somebody who's who I know
has got some rdfa this is running really
slowly though I'm not sure if it's going
to work
huh
so as you navigate around the idea is
that you accumulate data so in this
particular case this looks like it's
loading but it doesn't seem to be
loading very quickly this particular
case Ivan's page should come up he's
it's an ordinary HTML page he writes in
there you know description of himself
meetings that he's got coming up but
whether he's also done is then put
various bits of metadata in there to
further describe more exactly the
information that he's that's in his page
so for example he might use a micro
format or rdfa to say this meeting that
I've said I'm attending is actually at
this longitude and latitude very very
specifically the job of the bar on the
left is to as the pages as you navigate
the pages it just simply grabs whatever
data it can find and then gives you the
option of then storing that into a
triple store database I'll leave their
loading and the other side of that is to
consume it so that's you collecting data
as you go about your or your business so
is an event that you think you might
want to attend you just say add this to
my data store there's some contact
information about a person you say add
that to my data store and then on the
other side this is now bringing together
really everything that I've been
describing these little applications
these the ability to create very quickly
small applications using X forms using
sidewinder docking to the side of the
screen all of these features coming
together the ability to then create
applications that consume that data in
different ways so in this particular
case it's just a simple simple X form
it's it's another version of the travel
map that I showed earlier this
particular window will dock to the top
of the screen it will show a map it will
then periodically check in the triple
store to see if there's any information
that it should be displaying
so the two sides are joined together in
our minds obviously because it's not
working but some
I know why there's any reason I wouldn't
be able to get this on the network the
one on the left anyway I mean it's that
one's loaded because that's getting data
off my machine so all of those flags on
the right-hand side are events and
meetings that have been previously
stored so the ones in red are events
that I've grabbed from upcoming org and
the ones in blue you'll see some in a
moment our meetings that I've actually
grabbed from eivin's page so Ivan has a
w3c meeting wherever that pin is so so
that to me is the is that is the real
next phase of all of this work that
we're doing is we've now got the
environment we've got the architecture
that allows us to create these kinds of
applications in a few lines of code
we've got the framework that allows us
to embed things inside the browser we've
now got the ability with rdfa and
microformats to actually go and grab
stuff from the web and so the next phase
of what we're doing is is to me
everything everything that we've done up
until now is in order to now build these
small applications these sort of nimble
applications that can start to bring
everything together and make our sort of
calendars and maps and contact
information much more powerful and
flexible so I'll leave it there I'm
apologize that I've overrun in terms of
question time but feel free to ask
questions if you want last couple of
minutes
consider obliged to ask questions
and again
a 19
what
well initially the sort of thing I've
been picturing is obvious business
oriented kind of things you know the
sort of salesforce com style things you
know so that that top right-hand corner
I would be looking at you know meetings
that I've got coming up with you know
cross reference with you know my
holidays and all this kind of thing but
eventually i'd like to get it to the
point where it's it's everything about
you it's everything that you've you've
stored and it doesn't you see this is
this is to me this is fairly a crude
manifestation of your data you know go
to the database and find every point
where you've got a meeting coming up
well that's that's pretty obvious really
what you ideally want is that data to be
reflected to you at times when you're
not expecting it so I'm about to sort of
agree to go out for dinner with my wife
and say no problem darling you know see
you there and actually I've got a
meeting on that day but because i'm
using sidewinder in inverted commas or a
framework to have my IM chat with my
wife because everything is being
funneled through this common environment
then you've got access to the metadata
hopefully you can then start to improve
the interactions all the way through bad
example but the idea being that you know
because you can squeeze all these
applications through this through such a
framework you've got the ability to do
clever things all the way down the line
