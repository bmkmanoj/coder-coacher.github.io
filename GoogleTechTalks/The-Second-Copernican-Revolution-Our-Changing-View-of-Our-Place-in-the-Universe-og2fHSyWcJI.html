months ago John had reached out to us
about potentially hosting a operation
session for one of the Mars rover our
new auditorium he was kind enough to
have some of us out there to kind of see
one of them it's actually really
interesting the you know I think a lot
of people in here were fascinated with
NASA as a youth and you know they the
little twelve-year-old boy and we found
it really interesting the it's very
accessible to the layperson I'm
obviously not a rocket engineer so the
hope is once the auditorium is open some
of the team will come out here and
present a kind of we'll be able to see
what goes into planning a day's activity
in the rover kind of leading up to that
John was also interested in coming out
and giving a tech talk as a work I also
had a little bit about John's background
he's been project manager for the NASA's
Mars Exploration Rover project since
March 2006 previously as science manager
and then as deputy project manager he
has helped leave the rover project since
2000 John grew up near Boston he
received his bachelor's degree in
engineering from Tufts University and 81
and his master's and PhD in physics from
Brown University in 83 and 87
respectively he joined JPL to work on
advanced spacecraft propulsion which
included such futuristic concepts as
electric nuclear and antimatter
propulsion and 89 he began work
supporting the exploration of Mars with
the Mars Observer mission and has since
worked on seven Mars missions pretty
impressive in addition to his Mars works
John is involved in the development of
instrumentation for astrophysics and
planetary science and teaches teaches
mathematics at Pasadena City College as
an adjunct faculty member please welcome
John
thank you thank you very much it's a
pleasure to be here what I hope to share
with you today is this tremendous
revolution that's going on in in a world
of exploration and I think it's
appropriate because Google is also
engaged in a great revolution of how we
do things here on the surface of the
earth and beyond so let me begin by
talking about the first Copernican
revolution before much of human history
this is how we thought of the universe
that the earth was the center of things
and things like the moon Mercury and
Venus and even the Sun here the third
one out all revolved around us that we
thought we were the center of things and
actually the observational information
supported this because you know apples
fell down to the earth
you know the thinking was that
everything is sort of just gravitating
towards the earth itself and so why not
have bodies in orbit around us but
Copernicus and then later supported by
the analysis and observations performed
by Galileo said then oh no we're not the
center of the universe we're just one of
the minor planets orbiting the Sun and
that the Sun is the center of our solar
systems now this was heretical you know
the Catholic Church put Galileo under
house arrest for several hundred years
it wasn't until the 1990s that the
Catholic Church got around to absolving
Galileo from house of Wrath but the
whole idea was that if we were not the
center of things
then what's special about us that for
all this time we thought that we were
the center of the universe well since
the time of Copernicus and Galileo we
have clung to the notion okay we're not
the center of things but maybe we're the
only place where there's life and that
has been sort of the the the anchor of
our own arrogance the elegance of our
species that were somehow special
somehow special in the universe
so the second Copernican revolution is
that even that concept is being
challenged and we are no longer the
center of the universe and we are no
longer special in that way so let me
talk a little bit more about the
universe and
so if we look at this oh I'm sorry
that's upside down let me fix that there
we go now it's right up most of the
universe is this thing seventy over
seventy percent of the universe is what
they call dark energy and we still don't
know what dark energy is
and then another twenty twenty four
percent of the universe is dark matter
and we still don't know what that is so
the stuff that makes up you and me
baryonic matter protons corresponds to
about four-and-a-half percent of the
total mass energy of the universe and
even of that only about half a percent
of that is in the form of stars so
really I could say we all have an idea
about you know four or five percent of
the universe I mean if you only have
four or five percent about anything well
you know in school that's an F so we
really do have a very limited
understanding of our universe so the
stuff that we're particularly interested
in is this stuff this is the Hubble
ultra-deep field survey so this is like
holding out you know a you know a small
pea at arm's length of the sky so it's
only about one ten-millionth of the
total sky it's captured in this image
and in this image you look at you go wow
there's a lot of stuff here but actually
in the Simmins very few of these things
are stars let's see that's a star that's
a star that's a star and there's one
more and I never could even find it
everything else in this thing is a
galaxy in fact in this image alone they
counted ten thousand galaxies so if this
is you know of the order of one ten
millionth of observable universe and
there are ten thousand galaxies in this
you know you can do the arithmetic and
you get a hundred billion galaxies and
these galaxies are things like this
this is m81 so this is a nice spiral
galaxy very much like our own Milky Way
galaxy and it's
the galaxy of the size of the size of
our Milky Way is of the order of a
hundred to four hundred billion stars
okay so you a little bit of arithmetic
here Java you know a galaxy has 100
billion stars and then you have a
hundred billion of those galaxies and so
you get numbers in excess of 10 to the
22 and I know Google there's about ten
to a hundred so it's a very large number
a very large number of ordinary stars
because most stars are like the Sun
they're your main sequence stars they're
very much like our own planets I like to
show this image because this is two
colliding galaxies so here give two
galaxies of 100 billion stars and they
are actually literally passing through
each other in this collision no stars
will collide it is purely a
gravitational effect and they will
distort and alter each other as they
pass through but the result of this
collision will be the stimulation in the
birth of stars out of the gas and dust
which makes up most of the galaxies
because remember that only about half a
percent of the four and a half percent
is in the form of stars the rest of it
is in gas and dust that's in between the
stars
so with these huge number of stars out
there the question is well you know how
many solar systems out there and when
you went to school is when I went to
school there are nine planets and then
settling we went to eight planets and
they were saying well gee that's going
in the wrong way today we have now
thousands of observed planets around
other stars this was one of the first
objects of a the first observation of a
compact object around a star so here's
the star and this is actually a brown
dwarf here's is taken by the Hubble
Space Telescope but this was in 1995 so
this is the first time we were able ever
able to resolve an object in orbit
around a star it was also the time in
which Geoff Marcy a
up in the Bay Area and his team we used
the what's called a radio technique
looking for a wobble in a star because
something is in orbit around it so they
what's really like make they were able
to identify planetary systems today we
have another technique by which we look
for potential planets around other stars
and that's well what's called the
transiting technique this is as you're
staring at the star and a planet comes
along and as the planet passes in front
of the star the planet being dark the
star being luminous is you've got a dip
in the brightness of the star and this
repeats with every orbital period of the
planet so it's a very well-established
signature and so by using this technique
we can then identify other stars and the
great thing about this technique is not
only do you detect the star and its
period
you also get an idea of how big this
planet is rather relative to how deep
this occupation occurs now in the case
of the Sun is an on planet Earth this is
a very small effect about 10 to the
minus 4 so there's actually an
opportunity for everyone here to
participate in the observation of a
transit this is a simulation on June 6th
at zero hundred dtcs when the simulation
demonstrates the planet Venus is going
to pass in front of the disk of our Sun
and so this is how big Venus appears on
our solar disk and Venus is very close
to the earth in size so with a pair of
safety glasses ones that are designed
for being able to stare at the Sun you
too can observe this it'll probably be
visible via the naked eye through the
filter but pair of binoculars or
telescope or solar filter and will
clearly be able to resolve this it's a
little take several hours here in
Southern California the transit will
start about 3 p.m. local time and there
will last until sunset
so you
in about four or five hours of observing
that transit but it's a difficult
measurement to make because this is a
picture of the Sun taken through solar
filter this is what I took with my
digital camera and this is of the
transit mercury
that's a sunspot right there but if you
look at that little dot there that's the
planet Mercury as seen from the earth so
you can get appreciation for how
challenging this measurement is and you
have to account for variations due to
sunspots and stellar instability so what
nasa has done is we've put a spacecraft
in orbit called kepler and Kepler's job
is to stare at a region in the sky so
here is you can see the band of the
Milky Way here here's the constellation
of Cygnus here is the field of view of
the Kepler telescope it's a 91 megapixel
focal plane array and it's just going to
stare at that one place in the sky it's
about 10 by 10 degrees on the sky and
its first air it is staring at that and
it's just looking for blinks in a
collection of about 150,000 stars so
it's looking at all these stars
simultaneously looking for those subtle
signatures so this is some early data so
this is say just a cartoon of the focal
plane array in these colored dots are
all the planetary candidates that Kepler
has found and the number is down in the
thousands that Kepler found on just this
one set of stars that it's been staring
at simultaneously and you can see here
there are several though there are many
many earth candidates so using this data
and others we know there are now
estimates as to how many stars have
planetary systems and right now the
average is based on one set of analyses
is there's 1.6 planets per star in our
galaxy 1.6 planets per star meaning that
practically all stars have planets so
clearly there's some that have multiple
planetary systems Kepler seen several
candidate
where you have multiple planetary
systems and now the estimates are how
many of them have earth-like planets
small rocky planets like the earth and I
did an estimate based on some of the
Kepler data and I came up with that 3/4
of stars have earth-like planets or at
least there's the the rate of earth-like
planet occurrence is about 0.75 earths
per star in our galaxy and now you can
extrapolate that to say okay well laws
of physics and our galaxy of the same as
the laws of physics and other galaxies
as we understand things and so it's
reasonable to say that other galaxies
form the same way our galaxies form
other stars form the same way and so
planetary systems form the same way and
so you could expect that other galaxies
have the same kind of occurrence of
solar systems of planets so we'll go
back to that 10 to the 22 member of
stars in the observable universe
multiplied by 1.6 and you get a very
large number of planets well divided by
0.75 to get the number of Earth's out
there so there's a huge number of
candidates in the observable universe so
we are very much in a in a universe that
there are numerous planets so though so
we're at the point where they're now
more planets or the estimates are there
are more planets than there are stars
okay so what we're interested in are
things that look like this I want to
draw your attention to this little dot
right there that's the earth seen from
deep space this is you I've taken by the
Voyager 1 spacecraft back in 1996 as
voyager 1 left our solar system looking
back and it just shows how insignificant
we are again you know we thought we were
the center of the universe that was a
true so now we're clinging to the notion
that we'll really don't were special
because we're the only place that has
life and so the question now is is that
really true with so many potential
earth-like candidates in the observed
the universe now what is the probability
that we're really special we'll just
come back to our own solar system and
ask the question about life in our own
solar system so back in 2006 this is
comet but not seen in the southern
hemisphere is spectacular object
comets are of great interest because our
analyses have shown that they have four
organic materials it is the theory is
that the water here on earth was brought
to this planet by comments bombarding
and leaving behind the icy payloads in
2005 NASA had a spacecraft called deep
impact we've sent it towards a comet
this is a combat temple and what we did
is we carried a little impactor with
that spacecraft so as we flew by they
comment we released this impactor and
then slammed in at hyper velocities into
the comet making this great explosion
and by studying the plasma and the
ejecta of the spectra of this of the
admited signature from this so it gave
us an idea of what comets are made of
how they're constructed what is the
inventory of material and yes in fact
they are these big icy balls that carry
a tremendous amount of liquid water and
trace amounts of organics well one
question is will comments the seeds that
brought life here to the earth did life
originate on the earth is it special and
unique to the earth or is a common
elsewhere as it carried elsewhere and
even if life started here could it start
somewhere else
so these are questions we want to try to
answer by examining other places in our
solar system
so if we stop by Saturn on our cruise
through the outer solar system you can
see the on edge plane of the Rings and
this is Titan the largest moon in the
solar system Titan is larger than the
planet Mercury it's so large it supports
its own atmosphere you can see here this
brown smoggy atmosphere but it's mostly
methane and nitrogen and those dynamic
processes at work in the atmosphere
things like lightning and certainly a
circulation pattern
and so expect that there are very
complex organic molecules that are being
manufactured out of the basic materials
of methane and nitrogen we have the
Cassini mission in orbit around Saturn
and it does flybys of Titan and uses its
radar to look down at the surface and
this is a radar map of Titan and you see
flow channels here and you can see a
shoreline to a lake but this is not a
lake of water this is a lake of liquid
methane so it's very cold there of
course but it doesn't preclude that
Titan is producing very complex organic
molecules and at this point you we can
only imagine the range of molecular
chemistry that's ongoing right now on
Titan but Titans not alone in this
distinction again it's at another move
this is new mrs. Enceladus here seem
just above the ring plane and when
Cassini did a image of Enceladus backlit
by the Sun it saw these geysers spewing
out emitting out liquid water so this is
actually the first observational
evidence of liquid water someplace other
than the earth I mean we know there's
water elsewhere in the solar system and
in the universe but it's either thought
to have been a vapour or ice this is the
first direct evidence of liquid water
it's liquid because Enceladus is
influenced by the large gravitational
field of Saturn so it's interior it's
wrenched by these tidal forces that keep
it liquid and they erupt as geysers but
what this tells you is that you have
liquid water you have a source of energy
from this tidal energy so you're not
dependent on solar energy that could
drive a potential ecosystem on Enceladus
so this would be an exciting target so
this is potentially a habitable
environment within our solar system if
we move on to Jupiter this is a picture
taken by
your spacecraft so back in the 80s and
you have the moons Io Europa and
Callisto down here and if we take a
closer look at Europa we see that it's
an ice-covered role that it's fractured
and broken and looking more closely at
the ice it's actually floating these
icebergs if you will are moving about on
the surface there's a liquid ocean
underneath that ice-covered surface of
Europa they say that this is the first
ocean to be discovered since Balboa
stared on the Pacific Ocean many many
centuries ago but this is also
significant because it is liquid water
it's liquid because Europa is influenced
by Jupiter's gravitational field so
there are tidal forces there as well
that are keeping this water liquid
keeping it warm warm in a relative sense
and providing the an energy source that
could drive a potential ecosystem from
other measurements we know that this
liquid is briny it's salty because it
exhibits some level of conductivity but
once again who knows what exists
underneath this ice pack you have an
environment that supports liquid water
with an energy source and the fact that
we know that the organics around because
Jupiter certainly has nitrogen in its
atmosphere I mentioned for Titan that
Saturn and so it's reasonable to
estimate that there are inventories of
organic molecules or compounds here as
well so you have these pieces that all
do together for a habitable world in our
own solar system now well I've been
spending most of my time for the last
several years is exploring this world on
the planet Mars and Mars of all places
in the solar system is the one that's
the most earth-like this is a
ground-based telescope of image of the
planet so this is how the world knew the
planet Mars until the dawn of the space
program well which you would say is that
Mars has a polar cap has two polar caps
it's tilted on its axis by 25 degrees
very close to the Earth's 23 degrees
which means that Mars has four distinct
seasons just like the earth the Martian
almost two years in length and over the
course of the Martian seasons these
centrist teachers would change these
albedo features this they had personal
oil 100 years ago to postulate that
there was an advanced civilization on
Mars that was planting crops tending
soil and the changes as you saw the
foliage changes with a season he went
further to say that they were building
canals to bring water from the polar
caps down to the parched equatorial
regions their resident till the dawn of
the space program that we really got to
answer those questions about Mars about
whether it supported a civilization and
this is a picture taken by one of the
Viking orbiters in the mid 1970s and you
can see here that Mars is a very barren
place you can see craters just like you
find on the moon but notice they are
eroded the wrong way so clearly there
are processes that have been playing
here on Mars it has an atmosphere but
it's a very thin atmosphere it's only
about 1% of the Earth's atmosphere
and it's mostly carbon dioxide but the
question is what's been going on on Mars
and the Viking missions were intended to
look for life they found no evidence no
conclusive evidence there was about 20
years before interest resumed in Mars
and the exploration so in the mid 1990s
on a mission that was part of cold Mars
golden severe we started to take a
global perspective to studying Mars and
this is some of the data that came from
that mission this is outtttt imagery
data so red and wide a high elevation
you can see the volcanoes over here blue
and purple a very low elevation and
what's striking is that Mars has not
only a very low northern hemisphere but
a very smooth northern hemisphere fact
it's one of the smoothest surfaces in
the solar system the only area that's
smoother than that is the bottom of the
ocean here in the earth so coupled with
its elevation its smoothness and these
very curious channels which may look
like flow channels has led some
scientists to postulate that Mars had a
great northern ocean at one time
also from global severe was this image
one of many images give you a sense of
scale that's about three kilometers
across the field of view here this is a
canyon system carved by flowing water
they know it's water because they can
estimate the density the viscosity from
the topology and geology of this but
what's important here is that is this
narrow channel down the middle of it
which tells the geologists this was
carved by slowly flowing water okay
we've always known that to do in water
on Mars actually from the very first
days of exploration but we have you
don't know whether Mars had persistent
water up until now because the
atmospheric pressure on Mars is so low
water can't exist as a liquid you
remember your phase diagram from high
school chemistry below certain
atmospheric pressure water is no longer
liquid it's either an ice or vapor well
that's where we are on Mars today so the
fact that we see that liquid water
existed on Mars and existed for an
extended period of time because this
canyon system doesn't form overnight it
takes hundreds of thousands of years to
tens of millions of years to make a
feature like this and so liquid water
persisted on Mars for that kind of time
scale and so here we now have
tantalizing clues that Mars must have
had a habitable environment because you
have liquid water you have persistent
liquid water the fact that it was liquid
means that Mars has to be warm ah
the surface temperature has to be warmer
than it is today and you had to have a
thicker atmosphere than it is today
something that is more earth-like well
the way we answer some of these
questions is to go back down to the
surface with the Mars Exploration Rover
and this is one of the two Rovers that's
part of my project Spirit and
Opportunity and this is a picture taken
of the rover at JPL while it's being
developed and so you can get an idea of
the size of this vehicle it's six wheel
drive so each wheel is independently
driven we have small motors in each
wheel with two front wheels and the two
rear wheels independently turn its solar
power so we're these deployables solar
arrays so there's no consumable as long
as we can get sunlight we can power the
rover it carries everything
it's communication antennas here that
can communicate directly to earth or
with orbiting spacecraft this white mass
supports a set of cameras up here and
you notice the cameras are pretty much
at human height through the images it
takes have very much in human
perspective there's another pair of
cameras down here in front and another
pair in the back and these cameras
aren't stereo pairs so the rover sees
like the way you and I see stereo
optically it has depth perception so the
data that we take is inherently
three-dimensional and the rover uses
that to navigate and operate on the
surface there's also a robotic arm here
tucked up underneath about the size of
your own arm and it has a set of devices
on the end one is a walk blinder which
is like the geologists walk camera and
another is a microscopic imager which is
like a little magnifying glass and what
we are doing and have been doing for
over eight years now on Mars is classic
field geology with these Rovers so
here's where we went and here's where
you are with the rover's the first rover
spirit land it in Gusev crater so this
is a crater that's about a hundred and
sixty kilometres in diameter this is our
entry ellipse our bull's eye on the
surface we chose this because we see
from orbit evidence of a great flood
channel the great river you can even see
the remnant of the River Delta here you
can see where the water breached here to
the north and float away so there's
evidence if this were one time there's
ponded with water so we're expecting to
find sedimentary material here almost
completely on the other side of the
planet is where opportunity went and
that's shown here with this coloring
that's laid on top of the image and that
color corresponds to the presence of a
mineral called hematite hematite is an
iron oxide you might you might know it
as the silver gradually it forms an
aqueous environment so this is chemical
evidence that there is water here on
Mars and this is the only place on Mars
where we see this signature from orbit
so we have visual evidence and chemical
evidence of water playing a role at
these two sites and so that's where
we've sent our Rovers so here's a
picture taken by Spirit after landing
you can see this is a what's left of our
on the surface where the airbags have
brought us safely down and you can see
the robe has been driving these Rovers
were designed for 90 days of exploration
and a traverse capability of about a
kilometer so the time was ticking and we
went on exploring these rocks and what
we discovered is all these rocks are
volcanic now this is Gusev crater we
were expecting to find sedimentary
deposits evidence of ancient water and
all we're finding is volcanism so that
was kind of a monkey wrench in our
exploration opportunity on the other
side here's where opportunity landed
this is a small crater just a little
crater called Eagle and here's our
lander system and you can you see the
exposed bedrock here and you can see
where the rover has been exploring that
and here the rover hit a hole-in-one
right from the get-go as we went up to
these rocks you can see the wheel tracks
here and no that's not a boot print if
it's the real track you can see the
laminations in the rock these are
sedimentary rocks these were laid down
in water so this was the aha moment this
is evidence that the bedrock of Mars
contains direct evidence that at one
time there was liquid water here these
rocks formed in water they don't form or
not overnight so water was persistent on
geologic timescales surface water on
ancient Mars how long the very well the
best we can estimate right now is
somewhere around three and a half to
four billion years ago now on earth
three and a half to four billion years
ago life is just starting so we know at
that time in that epoch there were at
least two places in our solar system
that were earth-like the earth where
life started and Mars which exhibited
many of the same earth-like features
liquid water warm temperatures thicker
atmosphere so life showed on earth why
not Mars and even if life started on one
of the other planet we know from meteor
analysis the two planets have exchanged
material over time so the question is
you know was there life on Mars can we
find evidence of past life is there life
there today
well these Rovers are not
have life detection capability it's a
geology mission and that's what we've
been doing you can even see what we
found into the rock here we've measured
the geology and this water this ancient
water was not only liquid of course but
it was salty
there was acidic and was evaporating
here's a walk that we found and it's not
a Martian rock this is a meteorite this
is a rock from somewhere else that
landed on Mars since this stony iron
meteorite and you can see the
characteristic fusion crust so this is
further evidence of not only the
exchange of material between the planets
but also that Mars had to have had a
thicker atmosphere because you wouldn't
find a walk like this lying on the
surface that a meteorite would have
immediately would have just ended its
entry in a huge crater on the planet so
this probably had a very glancing angle
when it hit the planet but there must
have been a thicker atmosphere not only
to create the fusion cross but to land
this meteorite onto the surface of Mars
so further evidence of this notion that
Mars had a thicker atmosphere and then
was more earth-like well the others last
of the 90 days spirit actually went on
to last for over six years
opportunity is still going at over eight
years but because these Rovers last
longer were able to drive them we are at
this point really drive spirits several
kilometres to a set of hills and
climbing up the hills this is where
spirit found the first evidence of
water'd altered rocks here so this river
as well has found evidence of ancient
water on Mars there one of the other
significant discoveries that Spirit made
is this outcrop here which turns out to
be made of somewhere between 30 and 40
percent weight carbonates calcium
carbonate so this is a big deal this is
Mars lost its atmosphere the question is
ready to go where one theory is that it
was a carbon dioxide atmosphere and that
over time that atmosphere became
geologically sequestered in the surface
materials key rot that happens here on
the earth that happened on ancient earth
but we have these things called
subduction zones and
quino's which tend to break that stuff
down and put it back into the atmosphere
so it's accessible to living things like
you and me but on Mars there are no such
processes and so one theory is that we
would find evidence of an ancient
atmosphere in the geology of Mars this
is not conclusive but it is compelling
as to what might have happened to the
atmosphere on Mars no but it also
requires that you have liquid water for
the co2 to dissolve and then to
eventually get mineralized so it's
further evidence of not only the
atmosphere but abundant liquid water on
the surface well you've been driving
opportunity and you can see the the
distance to move distances we've paddled
we came across another highly rated
crater and once again we found evidence
of sedimentary rocks but this is a
little bit different notice these
laminations are not parallel they're
wavy these are rocks that were formed in
a dynamic environment this is either an
ancient shoreline or an ancient
streambed so now we have even more
compelling evidence of the earth-like
characteristics of ancient Mars now I
feel about two years on the planet we
had a failure in one of the wheels on
Spirit again these rotors were designed
for two months and you know six tenths
of a mile driving at this point we've
driven an opportunity about four now
excuse me a spirit about four and a half
miles and one of you has failed and as a
result of the wheel failing it doesn't
really spend because it's got a large
gear reduction on it and so we drive of
the remaining five wheels so we drag
that one wheel like a ball and chain but
there's a benefit to that there's a
significant scientific benefit because
it tends to scrape up what's just
beneath the surface and this is
something we were just driven right by
we would never notice it this right tone
material you see here is amorphous
silica you know they said they soak in
dioxide in and openly in a hydrated form
but this is evidence of a precipitate
out of a hot aqueous environment so this
is evidence of an ancient hydrothermal
system something like a a geyser a hot
spring or or even a deep ocean
invent we know here on earth that those
hot springs are those geysers or even
the deep ocean vents are thriving
ecosystems because not only do you have
liquid water but you have an energy
source that can drive that ecosystem so
this is evidence that there were energy
sources on the surface of Mars that
could further drive a potential
ecosystem well spent had a to of the
real sail and she became embedded in
this loose fine material you see here
this is the robotic arm in the front of
the rover and this is where spirit came
to rest and we've since lost
communication with the rover because we
weren't able to position it for the
winter but even in the in the last act
on Mars
she made yet another discovery this this
return you could see that variations in
colors and textures
these are unconsolidated sulfate
minerals hydrated sulfate minerals this
is evidence of more recent water action
on Mars something may be of the order of
a million years ago so not ancient water
more recent water on Mars so again this
is tantalizing bits of information and
there's even arguments there's liquid
water on Mars today so still this
compelling question about ancient life
on Mars or even current life on Mars
opportunity is still driving and I
wanted to give you this map this is
where we landed in Eagle crater this is
one of the large craters endurance we
explored and then we drove several
kilometres down to this huge crater down
here Victoria this is about a half mile
in diameter and we've driven about
twelve kilometers to this point so
twelve times farther than it was
designed to go and we like to explore in
craters because the holes in the ground
there like time tunnels because it's the
rocks of the bottom of the crater are
older than the rocks are the top of a
crater so by going down into a crater
you're going back in time so we're
reading the chapters of the Martian
history book in sequence but we spent
about two years exploring around
Victoria crater and we wanted to say
okay well what's next for the rover
because it's still in good health we
could still drive this thing so just
keep this distance in mind and as I
later the next slide that's this
distance
this is where we landed a here's
Victoria crater we have since over the
intervening three years to have an
opportunity over to this giant crater
and so we are now at 34 kilometers old
dama Tree more than doubling the
remarkable 12 kilometers to here and we
are here because this room mature you
can see this is a ancient crater
it's highly eroded it's giant in size of
course where we see in the rim of the
crater from orbit from one of the
orbiting missions is the evidence of
clay minerals and this is yet another
piece to the story about ancient Mars
because clay minerals are minerals that
form in water and they tend to form at a
neutral pH environment a neutral aqueous
environment further clay minerals have
this tendency to preserve what was ever
in the water when they formed so here's
the question if there were ancient
organic molecules though organic
molecules on ancient Mars they would
probably not be around today because the
ultraviolet radiation from the Sun that
sterilizes the surface would have broken
down any of the organics that might be
present on the surface however they may
be sequestered and protected inside of
minerals like these clays so these
represent a potential time capsule to
explore and this is where opportunity is
today here's a photograph showing the
rim of this giant crater you can see it
appears like a mountain range we're in
winter time right now actually Friday is
the winter solstice on March or
opportunity so we have the rover
stationary right now because of our
limited energy but as soon as the spring
season comes we'll be again driving over
going and exploring these hills looking
for these clay minerals and seeing what
clues they hold about ancient Mars the
one in more recent discoveries is this
vein of light material this is gypsum
gypsum is a hydrated sulphate so an
this is just a little armed here so we
know at this spot there was liquid water
it wasn't formed somewhere else in the
minerals were transported here whatever
we know for a fact now that there was
liquid water percolating up through this
fracture in the rocks forming this
gypsum that survives there today
opportunity though it is fairly
challenged right now this is a
self-portrait of just I take it about
two months ago you know much like you
know when we update our Facebook page I
mean I'm sorry a Google+ page we hold
out our cell phones at arm's length take
a picture where you did that with the
camera on the mass and you can see it's
a mosaic of several hundred images but
you can see how dusty the solar rays are
when this picture was taken about fifty
percent of light is obscured by the dust
on the solar rays and you can see we're
almost camouflaged against the
background we have experienced some dust
cleaning events from the wind we
seasonally there as we move into the
spring
there had been occurrences of these dust
cleaning events in the past they've done
a pretty good job of cleaning the road
rover off so and that's really the
explanation for why the rover's have
lasted so long because the dust was what
we thought would live with the life of
the Rovers the dust cleaning allowed
them to be able to survive the winter
but surely spirit actually shortening
opportunity we'll begin our exploration
of further along the rim of the
démocratie but surely on August 5th
opportunity will be joined by another
Rover and that is curiosity the Mars
Science Laboratory and this is a much
bigger Rover you can see here how large
this vehicle is the wheels are twice the
diameter of the wheels saw an
opportunity it's five times the mass of
opportunity so this is almost I know the
nine hundred kilograms of mass this
Rover is going to be nuclear-powered it
will have a radioisotope thermoelectric
generator a nuclear battery so it won't
have the complexities of solar arrays
but a larger over a bigger over can
carry a lot more instrumentation this
hair carries over
the kilograms of instrumentation ten
times with opportunity carries and one
of the important instruments on this is
called Sam which stands for surface
analysis at Mars it's a mass
spectrometer and it has the ability to
detect not only elemental and isotopic
compositions throughout the periodic
table but it also has the ability to
detect organic compounds up to about 400
Dalton's 400 atomic mass units so it can
look for complex organics it can
actually uniquely identify amino acids
or nucleic bases so if there are
organics of Mars and it has is a very
large robotic arm on the front with a
drill that it could take core samples
from beneath the surface only a few
centimeters down but deep enough to
where things might be protected from the
ultraviolet radiation and it can extract
those samples and introduce them into
the instrumentation which is in the
belly of the rover and look for the
presence of these complex organics and
so that would be a very exciting
discovery because we know geologically
that Mars was a habitable world it had
liquid water it had warm temperatures
that had energy sources of energy to
support an ecosystem the next question
is is there the inventory of organics
that could be the building blocks for
life now this is not a life detection
mission we would only be able to detect
whether the building blocks to support a
biological system and I'll take future
missions
perhaps a sample return mission to
answer the questions about Mars so the
the expression of Mars continues this is
sunset on Mars seen by opportunity we
can see the Sun is smaller because we're
further from the Sun and on Mars the
sunsets are backwards Mars has a pink
sky and blue sunsets were on earth we
have a blue sky and pink sunsets but
this goes back to the
question is are we alone we've seen in
our own solar system that there are
several places where there are habitable
environments whether it's Titan Europa
Callisto the planet Mars and the earth
and then we know that there are numerous
planets out there in the observable I
mean in countable number of planets in
fact there are more planetary candidates
in the observable universe than there
are grains of sand of all the beaches
here on earth and that we know that in
our own solar system there are several
places where habitable environments
exist so the question is how special is
this place here are we alone or do we
share the universe with others and the
other great question
in addition to searching for life is
what happened to Mars how did it lose
its atmosphere what happened to its
liquid water
what changed on Mars and could have
happened to the earth and is it
happening today you know to be good
stewards of our own planet we need to
understand how planets evolve and change
and studying other worlds like Mars and
the other planets helps us to understand
our own world and so we can make the
right decisions for ourselves on this
world so I will end here that you can
find all these images at the JPL website
the adventure continues and I hope that
you will follow along as we continue
this great exploration and addressing
these questions thank you very much
I think we have some time for a few
questions so lesson back some people
think that the Viking actually might
have discovered life in 76 but we
weren't looking for the right kind of
life do you have any opinions on that
well I'll tell you that there were
Viking each Viking Lander had three
experiments and three control
experiments and they found in one of the
experiments a signature and the question
is was that due to something living or
was it due to another reaction the
conventional explanation for that
signature was that it was due to a
peroxide interaction in the Martian soil
but it's compelling but not conclusive
and so today we have a better
understanding of what life is like and
we also have an understanding that there
are extremophiles life-forms here on
earth that can live in extreme
environments so people are revisiting
that question I think the general
consensus is that Viking did not find
evidence of life but it's it's by no
means close the door on that question
other questions yes what's your take on
the Fermi paradox why haven't we seen
any signals of life from elsewhere
ji-ae let's say first of all there's a
lot of space in space there's a lot of
distance between the other world so if
and the other part of it is we're just
beginning to open our eyes to to seeing
these things you know in the case for
example of Planet detection the first
planets we discovered were these very
large jupiter-sized planets that orbit
very close to the star why because those
are the easiest to see with the
techniques that we're using the radial
technique Kepler now using the
transiting technique is finding even
more planets and the planet it's finding
are the short period ones because you
have to stare for a period of time and
look for the blame
and the shorter the period the more
blinks you get in in a fixed amount of
time and so the stronger the signature
as kepler continues to walk we're
finding longer period orbits so all that
is to say that we're just starting to
look and we're very biased in our way
that we're looking because our
instrumentation is insensitive to
everything it's only sensitive to a few
things so as we expand that envelope the
discoveries will will flood it so
perhaps that's why we haven't heard or
seen anything yet yes okay let's see
first of all it's all about angular
momentum you know when planets form
around the star you get material that
collapses in this accretes to the center
to become the star but other material
forms a disk around the star because you
need to conserve angular momentum it
forms in a disk and it stays in orbit
and and then the planets form out of
that and so they tend to pick up the
angular momentum story that's part of
the disk which other and so they spin
so naturally you would think there would
be aligned with the the disk plane but
they're not and part of the reason is
that they experienced torques planets
aren't exactly spherical they had their
kind of squat and chubby and that
results that a torque be implied by not
only the star but other planets and that
torque causes a procession of that spin
axis and so that's why I'll move all the
case of Uranus is almost completely on
its side and we think that's because
Uranus was I was hit by some other
injured planet interstellar object that
knocked it over life on Earth be able to
survive is a magnetic fields as weak as
Mars oh they were a great question about
that magnetic field you and I here today
because we have a magnetic field here on
the earth the magnetic field creates a
bubble that protects our atmosphere from
the ravages of the solar wind
because without a magnetic field you can
literally blow the atmosphere of a
planet much like blowing the seed pods
off a dandelion and that's one of the
things what happened to Mars Mars is a
smaller planet it did have a magnetic
field at one time but bless its core
solidified freezing out the magnetic
field losing the magnetic field the
solar wind blew some or all the
atmosphere off the planet and of course
to being a smaller planet means that the
atmosphere is less gravitationally bound
without that atmosphere the liquid water
is broken down by ultraviolet radiation
to hydrogen and oxygen hydrogen drifts
into space the oxygen oxidizes surface
materials and that's how we end up with
Mars today so let's be we should all be
appreciative that we have magnetic field
here on the earth
so the question is can life survive
without it well you you're more subject
to you know solar wind radiation in that
instance yes up here in front it seems
to me that the the building blocks that
we've identified water organic compounds
a source of energy may be abundant but
I'm not convinced that the genesis of
life the it seems like it has to be a
very improbable event and since we
haven't seen any intelligent life it
must be so improbably that you know it's
hard it's it's hard to fathom how
improbable so maybe that it's actually
compensating for the size of the
universe in mmm-hmm maybe there's only
an expectation one other life form maybe
none you raise an excellent point we
don't have that information yet we
haven't found life elsewhere some people
argue that life is that could quite be
could be abundant that the transition
from a nonliving environment to a living
environment could actually readily occur
we found here on earth that you could
form complex organic molecules in a
variety of environments but how do you
go how do you make the leap from amino
acid to live a living system we don't
have the answers to that yet and so
you're absolutely right it could be that
maybe we are still special in some way
but we don't know I will just caution
that you know we are just beginning to
peel back the layers of the onion as we
look to the outer of these outer walls
and you know as missions like Kepler and
others start just revealing the the in
countable number of words out there that
having habitable environments or
potentially habitable environment you
know you start to run into some pretty
you know they're tough mathematics as to
the possibility so even though the
possibility is really low because we
know that happened at least once at
least once so you know you said you know
you know you don't have to have a very
high batting average if you if you get
10 to the 22 those are excellent points
and those that's part of the the
discussion debate and exploration that's
ongoing right now I have only know about
what's here on this planet so okay well
how do we think well I'm glad we stay
around for more questions but I know
some of you need to get back to office
so we take one more question if there
were say a planet ten light-years away
with the same outgoing radio
transmissions as Earth would our
equipment here even be sensitive enough
to detect that III the answer is yes you
know about setting the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence
they have had a campaign for decades now
looking for that signal and that the
argument being is that if someone has
the kind of communication technology
that we have that it should be
detectable on interstellar distance
scales and so yes all right and then we
know and then we could ask them whether
they have Google - there - and go from
there okay well one more question that
great just quick follow-up so what then
would be the limit of the detect ability
with the strongest clearest signals that
we can transmit how far away could we
detect if 10 light-years we can detect
100 light-years how far I don't know the
answer to that but what we are trying to
do is see if we can detect the spectral
signatures in these planetary candidates
that we find that are you know 10 to 20
light-years away see whether we get we
already have the ability to detect the
atmospheres on some of these worlds
through very exciting techniques but
what we want to do is we want to look
for essentially chemistry out of leak
equilibrium we want to look for abundant
oxygen or ozone we want to look for the
president's water and methane if we if
we see a plant if we if we can resolve a
planet and we see the spectral
signatures for oxygen and water and
carbon dioxide methane you know there's
a pretty good chance that something is
making that chemistry out of equilibrium
because here on earth we have an oxygen
atmosphere because Yahoo is you know all
this damn life that keeps producing
oxygen all the time and fills the
atmosphere with it otherwise the oxygen
would have combined with the surface
geology so if you find oxygen as one
visit that's a start to become a strong
argument that there's something going on
there that's out of the ordinary and and
we feel that today we have we were close
to having that ability to go out 10 or
20 light years on thanks well thank you
again for having me I hope you've
enjoyed the time together big jump
