Kerry Anderson for asking me to come
over and talk to you
the Boris said I'm in NASA Ames just on
the other side of the creek and I want
to point out first of all that this talk
is a review talk based on many people's
work over many years I want to start
with talking about why is the search for
life interesting and I'll give two
reasons
one is that if we find evidence of what
I call a second genesis of life here in
our solar system
that will allow us for the first time to
be able to do comparative biochemistry
as you know all life on Earth has the
same biochemistry the same genetics we
only have one example of life if we
found another example we'd be able to
compare and contrast our life with
another type of life also
philosophically you would tell us that
life is common in the universe if right
here in our own little solar system life
started twice independently then we'd be
pretty sure that life is widespread in
the universe and this is interesting and
I've added my own little editorial
comment yeah that'd be a great thing to
know to know scientifically I guess some
people think they know it in terms of
alien visitations but in terms of
scientific evidence we have no evidence
that there's life beyond the earth and
finding it in our solar system would be
the first step in a sense let me
elaborate on that a little bit in a
sense it's comparing apples and oranges
this is a diagram that Scott Sanford put
together for the Journal of your
producible results comparing apples and
oranges and I like to think of searching
for another example of life is doing a
study about fruit and only having
oranges it'd be very nice to have apples
if you had apples and oranges you could
do a more elaborate study and of course
you'd want to have bananas and
pineapples and even tomatoes as well
Tomatoes biologically are obviously
fruits even though the Supreme Court
declared them vegetables and you want to
compare them all so in a sense what we
are in a position on earth of having
only one example of life only oranges we
want something different to compare to
so that we able to understand life at a
broader level where are we going to get
a second genesis of life there's three
research programs aimed toward the
second Genesis
first is making in the laboratory what
is now called synthetic biology a second
is find it on Mars or Europa that's the
program I'm interested in and finally
there SETI as you heard from Seth listen
for them to call the it's not clear
which of these will work which one will
succeed first but my own interests are
not in waiting for the phone to ring or
playing around the laboratory but going
out in the field and seeing if we can
find it and when we say go find it we're
really restricted to our own solar
system and that means we're looking at
the other worlds in our solar system and
which ones are possible places where
life could have started and trying to
find evidence for that and that's what
it's going to be the focus of this talk
and I'm going to very quickly go through
the world the best world in our solar
system that might hold example for life
talk a little bit about what we're doing
and how we're approaching it Mars is
number one always Mars is number one for
three reasons
here's an image of Mars as it might have
looked in the past today and in our
imagination Percival Lowell's map of
Mars Mars is the number one target and
search for life on Mars for three
reasons the evidence of past liquid
water presence of an atmosphere with the
elements needed for life and importantly
the potential for preservation of
evidence of life if there was life on
Mars billions of years ago there's a
good chance that there's a record of it
there in contrast consider Venus Venus
might have had a liquid water past it
certainly has the elements needed for
life but if there was life on Venus
there's very little chance that we're
going to find a record preserve would
you rather keep your sample in a hot
sulfuric acid bath or in a cold vacuum
conditions well obviously cold vacuum
conditions Mars is where we might find
preserved evidence for life very quickly
what do we know about Mars
most of what we learned let's vote we
know we learned from Viking Viking found
water on Mars in the terms of Frost and
found flows that indicated passed water
water now only as ice and vapor clouds
snow no liquid anywhere in the planet
now but evidence that there was liquid
in the past that in a nutshell is the
fundamental story of Mars that we've
learned from spacecraft exploration
and as I mentioned earlier the elements
needed for life in the atmosphere here's
a co2 dominated atmosphere on Mars the
same sort of atmosphere we see on Venus
the same sort of atmosphere we think
characterized the early Earth this is
the original atmosphere of the earth the
oxygen that's in our atmosphere now is a
fairly recent pollutant it's only been
around a couple billion years of course
humans and their wisdom are getting rid
of that pollution and bringing back to
co2 restoring the earth to its
environmentally correct initial
condition and many species on earth in
fact will thank us for doing that
there's nothing wrong with this
atmosphere it's a perfectly good
atmosphere for life the problem on Mars
for life is not the elemental
composition it's the pressure here's the
pressure on Mars over three Mars years
see it varies from seven to ten mil of
ours on earth the pressure at sea level
and these same units would be a thousand
so the pressure on Mars is a hundred
times thinner than the pressure on earth
and that has important implications for
the stability of liquid water the triple
point pressure of water is six millibars
the triple point pressure is the
pressure below which the liquid state
doesn't exist
the reason dry ice on earth never forms
a liquid which is why it's called dry
ice I guess is because the pressure on
earth is below the triple point pressure
of carbon dioxide well on Mars the
pressure in most places is below the
triple point pressure of water and here
at the Viking sites which are in lowland
sites the pressure is close to the
triple point as a result of that liquid
water doesn't exist on Mars water goes
directly from vapor to gas today to
solid solid to vapor sorry solid to
vapor
with no liquid phase water on Mars
behaves like dry ice does on earth now
that's bad news for biology because all
organisms on Earth the one ecological
requirement they all have for life is
liquid water we know of no organism on
earth that can grow or reproduce without
essentially being a bag of liquid water
so that's the story of Mars very quickly
bringing you up to date what are we
learning right now from the missions
that are going on around Mars there's
four missions operating one recently
lost they're giving back more data you
can go on the web and see it's streaming
in there basically reconfirming that
story that we got from Viking
or more and better evidence for water
this is right now I would say the best
picture we have from orbit arguing for a
liquid and arguing that that liquid is
water the canyon the DD Canyon a couple
kilometers across a channel that looks
like the river the car of the canyon
snaking back and forth
all evidence of flow repeated flow over
a long period of time evidence of water
ruling out volcanic wind ice and other
alternative models for what car the
liquids where's the water now it's
frozen in the polar regions as we
thought
direct evidence from the Mars Odyssey
mission shown here this is the maps of
hydrogen and by inference water in the
ground frozen in the ground and the two
polar regions so Mars essentially has a
frozen ocean in the polar regions of
both poles that ice is very interesting
we'll come back to it later the two
Rovers landed also found evidence for
water in the layered rocks in the salt
distribution and in these concretions
so-called blueberries
so all pointing toward the notion that
Mars had more water in the past and if
we put that all together and take the
geological estimates for how much water
Mars must have had we can paint a
picture like this this is obviously an
artist's conception of what Mars might
have been like three billion years ago
when it had a layer of water 500 meters
thick which is what the geologists
estimate is implied by the floovio
features well this looks familiar this
looks like Earth this is the Mars that's
interesting this is why this picture
shows why we send more spacecraft to
Mars and all the other planets put
together in fact we crashed more
spacecraft on Mars than we send all the
other planets put together it's because
of this image because that Mars once had
a wet history it was once a Waterworld
it was once like Earth we once had at
least two blue marbles in our solar
system we want to know or I want to know
was there life when Mars had water what
kind of life was it a separate life from
life we have here on earth and what
happened to him are they still around
what are they doing let me start by why
is Mars not look like that today if we
once had two blue marbles why did we
lose one and the answer is not that Mars
is further from the Sun that is
the incorrect explanation for why Mars
is a frozen desert world today the
answer is that Mars is too small here
are the planets shown to scale Earth and
Mars Mars is one-tenth the mass of the
earth the factor of ten in mass matters
and it changes the properties of the
planet significantly as a result of its
small size Mars has no plate tectonics
less gravity and no magnetic field all
three of these factors tend to cause
Mars to lose its atmosphere as a result
of losing its atmosphere it freezes and
everybody dies if Earth lost its
atmosphere it would also freeze the mean
annual temperature on the earth global
temperature on the earth is plus fifteen
centigrade if earth had no atmosphere no
greenhouse effect at all the average
temperature of the earth would be minus
fifteen centigrade now you guys know the
difference between of plus or minus
makes a big difference
earth needs its greenhouse effect now we
humans are augmenting the greenhouse
effect which is probably not necessarily
a good thing but the fact the planet
needs a greenhouse effect Mars had a
greenhouse effect and lost it because of
these factors all the trace back to its
size here's the I listed those factors
in the order of importance that I
attribute to them although there's still
some debate in the planetary science
community I think plate tectonics the
absence of plate tectonics is what makes
Mars
what primarily caused Mars to lose its
atmosphere Venus also lacks plate
tectonics this is the cycle of the long
term carbon cycle driven by plate
tectonics on the earth that we think is
what keeps the earth habitable Mars
fails in this long-term cycle because it
has no plate tectonics to recycle
sediments and carbonate Venus fails
because it has no liquid water to pull
the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere
this concept of plate tectonics
maintaining habitability is what you
might call the master idea in planetary
science and when we look at other
planets around other stars we look at
their size because we think a planet
must be at least half the size of the
earth to support this kind of cycle so
we an earth-like planet then by
definition is a planet that's half the
size of the earth not more than ten
times the size of the earth and is that
the right position of a
star to have temperatures between 0 and
40 degrees centigrade and just FYI is a
little footnote we discovered the
astronomers discovered the first
earth-like planet that fits in that box
outside our solar system there's now we
imagine a diagram of mass and
temperature in a box for earth-like
conditions Earth is in that box sort of
by definition we now have another point
in that box first time that'll be I
think that's very important back to Mars
Mars is not in the habitable box Mars is
too cold it's too cold because it's too
small it lost its atmosphere and we see
on Mars evidence that it's been cold for
most of its history this is images of
unweathered rocks on earth and these are
images of Mars Mars looks like a fresh
volcanic flow that's not been weathered
these results from the test instrument
on Mars Global Surveyor it looks like a
planet with its geological history
dominated by cold dry climate in which
mechanical weathering was the dominant
form of erosion reading directly from
that quote unlike the earth where
chemical weathering promoted by water is
the dominant form of erosion
so even when Mars was wet even when we
look back at that picture of Mars three
and a half billion years ago with lots
of water it was still very cold and I
just list some of the evidence for that
low erosion the sporadic distribution of
valleys the unweathered
surface materials and so on Mars was a
very cold place and so if we're going to
places on earth that are analogues for
Mars we want to go to cold places and
investigate how life survives there and
then this image showing one of the rover
landing sites this red X is a graphic
illustration of this phenomenon what I
call the paradox of early Mars that it
was very cold and very wet at the same
time here is Gustav crater a large
crater lake we think this was full of
water 160 climbers across we see what
looks like a large river that flowed
into it couple kilometers large this is
large the size of the Sacramento River
you can even imagine whales stuck here
swimming the wrong way I'm being chased
by flotilla of boats and helicopters
large river large lake all dried up now
but evidence have considerable flow of
liquid we can even see what looks like a
delta deposit where the rivers enter the
lake and yet in the same frame you see
ancient crater terrain that looks like
the moon you see a moon scape of craters
which is completely inconsistent in
terms of our terrestrial experience with
large rivers and lakes those craters
indicate a terrain that has never seen
rain so we have a paradox of early Mars
which is rivers and lakes without rain
even when Mars was wet it was cold and
the best place on earth to illustrate
that the only place on earth where we
see rivers and lakes without rain is the
Dry Valleys of Antarctica here's a
Landsat view looking on the coast of
Antarctica this is about 2,000 miles
south of New Zealand here's the coast of
Antarctica here is Ross Island Mount
Erebus the active volcano and here is
McMurdo Station the main US base in
Antarctica if you look closely you can
see the Icebreaker track carrying
essential supplies candy bars and
powdered milk into the into the station
they won't bring whole milk this region
here the Dry Valleys is the largest
ice-free region in Antarctica it's the
most mars-like place on earth it's
average temperatures are minus 20
centigrade it never rains in these
valleys it snows but it never rains the
biggest difference between these valleys
and Mars is that in these valleys the
pressure is well above the triple point
of water but the temperatures not that
much warmer than Mars and it can the
absence of rain is characteristic of
Mars we think this is a model for early
Mars when the pressure might have been
higher but it was still a very cold
place this is a place where we see
rivers and lakes without rain
this is the mighty onyx river flowing
here it flows a couple weeks each year
during the Antarctic summer on a cold
summer it might not flow at all and
during a very wet summer it might be so
wide you can't even jump across it it is
the largest longest river in Antarctica
it flows into this lake Lake Vanda one
of the largest lakes in Antarctica five
kilometers across 170 metres deep
completely ice-covered the ice covers
about twice as thick as this
but that's what you expect when they
have annual temperature is minus 20 so
we have large lakes rivers in an
environment where it never rains if you
are a little organism sitting on the
side of this lake here you would see
snow falling down in the summer and then
it would sublime or be blown away you
would never see the liquid phase just a
few meters away in the stream bed you
would so along the sides of these
valleys is essentially lifeless lifeless
with very low erosion rates because of
the absence of liquid water water is
only produced during the summer when
these glaciers melt during a few weeks
each year when average air temperatures
get above freezing and flows down to
power these lakes so we go down there
every year because this is the most
mars-like place on earth and study the
ecology of the system the system which
has very little ecology at all this is a
picture of our camp this picture is
taken on Halloween which is why we're
flying the Jolly Roger of course we were
trying to invite trick-or-treaters to
come to our camp we had a bowl of candy
and everything we didn't get any
trick-or-treaters that Halloween we
think they were they were waiting for it
to get dark so we set up camp here and
we go out on the lake and we melt a hole
through the ice cover a couple meters
across as we drill down through the ice
cover it's dry it's frozen ice beautiful
views looking up inside the ice cover we
get through the ice to the water the
water comes up into the ice this ice is
floating so the water level comes up to
90% of the thickness of the ice as
expected we then have an access hole for
getting into this water and so we get
some volunteers lower them in the water
fortunately NASA's a federal lab and we
have a lot of non-essential federal
employees and so we lower one down we
can't afford the rope we do we do have
rope so we tie them to the rope so this
is me getting ready to do a dive a
couple years ago going down and it's
this is the view going down and
hopefully also the view coming up follow
the rope back up you can't you literally
can't just free ascent up through four
meters thick ice cover you've got to go
back out the same hole you came in in
that sense it's like cave diving
well why do we do it we're not swimming
in this cold water just because it's
it's fun
although swimming and freezing water
does have its charms the reason we're
exploring this lake is because on the
bottom of this ice cover or underneath
this ice cover in the bottom of this
lake we find a thick mat of organisms
growing remember this valley is
essentially lifeless this valley walls
contain no life essentially it's all
cold and dry but underneath this thick
ice cover in this cold water we find
abundant life just microbial life just
let's use the technical term green slime
there's no fish there's no tadpoles
there's no anything just in
microorganism that's right the question
is is it looks green and it is green
these are photosynthesizing the light
the ice cover freezes so slowly that its
optical properties are remarkably pure
and through that 4 metres thick of ice
the transmissivity is about 1% so the
light level in this lake is about the
light in this room right now we do not
need flashlights when we swim in this
lake and the organisms can easily grow
at that light level just like that plant
over there which hopefully is not
plastic is growing at the light levels
in this room algae can't photosynthesize
at these low light levels so this is a
photic system underneath 4 meters of ice
who woulda guessed flying over these
lakes that's the system that we think
could have been alive in this lake on
Mars so imagine now 3 billion years ago
on Mars
very cold an environment where it's not
raining an environment like the Dry
Valleys of Antarctica which is why these
craters are preserved because rain is
not eroding them but like Antarctica
there is seasonal melting producing
copious flow which fills a river and
fills a lake in an ice-covered lake and
Antarctica is showing us that cold wet
environments are perfectly good for life
they may not be good for human
warm-blooded life but for green slime
that's ideal so we have a good scenario
to go and drill in lakes like this and
try to find the evidence of that green
slime that might have lived in this lake
on early Mars when it was a cold and wet
place and that Arctica provides the case
study for how for the logic for doing
that what we might find intellect like
that on Mars is a fossil
but remember I said we were searching
for a second Genesis and fossils are not
enough what a fossil tells us is merely
that there was life on Mars right but it
doesn't really tell us the nature of
that life or its relationship of any to
life on earth and that's the question
that I'm really interested in in another
way of saying it is Martian life on our
tree of life here is our tree of life as
first elucidated by carl wolves based on
ribosomal RNA we can show that all life
on Earth is genetically related we all
share a common ancestor shown here and
divided into three major domains the
Eukarya the bacteria and the Archaea
this is life on Earth this is the wiring
diagram the family tree whatever you
want to call it of life on Earth there's
a fundamental unity to all light we see
an apparent diversity we see blue whales
and trees and tadpoles and bacteria and
it looks like there's a wonderful
diversity of life but that diversity is
all superficial saw a morphological the
bricks from which those organisms are
built are all the same the same amino
acids the same nucleotides in the DNA
and RNA there's one blueprint for life
on Earth shown here what we're asking is
is Martian life also on this tree are
they related to us is Martian life just
another branch on our same tree do we
share a common origin or is it something
completely different not mapable on our
tree at all it could be that Martian
life did share a common origin with life
on Earth for a long time we thought that
life on another planet by definition had
to be alien life but now we realize that
Earth and Mars are not necessarily
biologically isolated there has been
exchange of material between Earth and
Mars we have on earth
some almost 30 rocks that we know came
from Mars here's a picture of one of
them the famous alh84001 that rock came
from Mars how do we know they came from
Mars well they have a little plaques on
the bottom it's a made on Mars not
really what they have is inside the
rocks they have little bubbles bubbles
of gas and the composition of the gas in
those bubbles is this
the composition of the atmosphere is
measured by Viking and that's different
from the atmosphere of Venus or Earth or
the moon which has none or Pluto or
goofy or any other world you wish to
consider which tells us that these rocks
came from larch there's other lines of
evidence as well it's it is accepted
that these rocks came from Mars we also
know that these rocks got here by being
kicked off Mars flying through space and
landing on earth and that this process
of ejection and then landing did not
heat the interior of the rock hot enough
to sterilize it and we know that from
magnetic domains with inside the rock
which are have not been reset and they
would be reset at temperatures of about
40 to 50 centigrade so if there was a
little bug inside this rock on Mars and
it got ejected into space and landed on
the earth it could still be alive
question pardon this rock landed on the
earth tens of thousands of years ago in
Antarctica alh means Allen Hills it was
ejected off Mars a couple million years
ago it formed on Mars four billion years
ago so the history of this rock is it's
a lava flow on Mars four billion years
ago it sits on Mars about two million
years ago an impact occurred which
knocked it into space spent a lot of
time orbiting the Sun and then by chance
landed on earth in Antarctica and then
in 1986 some explorers were down there
and found the meteorite and brought it
back so back to imagine that scene
several billion years ago when Earth and
Mars are exchanging rocks we know that
this process goes from Mars to earth we
assume that it could go from Earth to
Mars
imagine Iraq being kicked off Mars and
organisms sided landing on the earth and
breaking open and a bug crawls out and
says you know one small step for a
Martian bug one giant leap for Martian
bug kind and earth is colonized by
Martian bugs so we now realize that
Earth and Mars may have exchanged
biological material to use the technical
term they may have been swapping spit
early in their youth when the impact
rate was much higher and that's bad news
for astrobiology because it means that
if we go to Mars and find life that life
may be just related to
it's not we can't take for granted that
that life represents a separate origin
life could have started on Mars and been
carried to earth or it could have
started on earth and been carried to
Mars and so the burden of proof is on us
if we find evidence of life to determine
that it really is a separate Genesis so
I want to now turn to that fossils are
not enough and we're calling this a
forensic investigation we need a corpse
we don't want a fossil we want a corpse
we want a dead body
anybody who watches TV knows that dead
bodies are a lot more exciting than
fossils that's what we want to find on
Mars well where might we find the dead
body well I list the possible sources
and the one that I'm going to talk about
today is very subtly put in boldface
underlined and has an arrow pointing at
it which is that I think our best chance
of finding biological remains of Martian
organisms is preserved in the permafrost
on Mars permafrost is a good place to
find organisms on earth you all know
about Siberia this is a cross-section of
Siberian permafrost here's the surface
and then a meter down is the active zone
and below that is frozen ground in this
particular image this ground has been
frozen for three and a half million
years we find things frozen organisms in
the permafrost a lot question this is a
pipe from a drill that the Soviets put
in back in Soviet times and is about
five inches in diameter so this this is
about a meter this distance here and the
entire cliff is about 10 meters high and
this is a cutaway there's a river
flowing in front of the image here
cutting away at the cliff which is why
there's such high rate of erosion here
in this permafrost we find organisms
frozen for three-and-a-half million
years and still alive bacteria we find
things that have been frozen for shorter
periods of time and are dead like
mammoths and horses but bacteria frozen
for three and a half million years still
alive in Antarctica we find what may be
even older permafrost here is ice
underneath our camp here and underneath
the metre of till there is ice that some
geologists think is 8 million years old
if so this would be the oldest ice on
earth
and it's temperatures - 25 it also
contains viable bacteria that have been
frozen for 8 million years if this ice
really is 8 million years old so we're
trying to develop the technologies to
drill in these permafrost conditions
aseptic aliy so that we get a sample
that's useful for biology and we want to
then fly that technology to Mars and we
use tracers you can't sterilize the
drill rig but we can trace its
contamination with fluorescent beads
that track the contamination from the
earth from the core and here is an
example where the core interior is clean
the beads have contaminated a very thin
region on the surface and here is the
drill with the beads in place now let's
go to Mars we want to find the oldest
frozen organisms on Mars so this is a
map of Mars showing several things it
shows the crater distribution on Mars
each crater is marked by a green circle
and you can see that the southern region
of Mars and the southern plains is
heavily cratered this is the presumably
then the old part of Mars the North
region of Mars is smooth and presumably
has been resurfaced we don't know what
resurfaced it but presumably the north
end is younger than the south so if we
want old would go south we want ice rich
these blue lines show the distribution
of ice as determined by the Odyssey
probe and the deep lines show the
distribution of deep ice has inferred
from crater morphology so if we want old
and we want ice we go south of this blue
line but this map also shows one more
thing it shows the crustal magnetic
features on Mars this is a surprise
discovery Mars has strong magnetized
rocks on its surface and they're shown
in polarity Bluebird - and red plus and
you see they cluster around here or some
here and here what's interesting about
the distribution of this magnetic
material is that there's none around
Alice the giant impact or around our guy
it appears that these impacts erased the
magnetic material around them whatever
created the Northern Plains erased the
magnetic signature there which tells us
that two things it tells us one that
places that still maintain the magnetic
signature have been relatively
undisturbed
and to that they're very very old
because they predate Alice they predate
our Geyer and they predate the
north-south dichotomy so places that
still have the magnetic signature are
very ancient and relatively undisturbed
so if we want to find ancient cold ice
rich ground that's been relatively
undisturbed it's this yellow X that's
our target zone now it turns out we've
already landed in the yellow X we
crashed in the yellow X when Mars Polar
Lander was sent to Mars in 1998 at the
time Mars Polar Lander was targeted we
didn't know about the magnetic features
we did not know about the distribution
of ice is somewhat serendipitous that it
was targeted right where I would like to
go to find the ancient ice but this is
where we'd like to go drilled deeply and
search for frozen organisms that may be
3 billion years old will they still be
alive
remember on earth even in the oldest ice
we find on earth the organisms are still
alive but that's only 8 million years
what determines how long you can sleep
in ice and still be alive this is a good
science fair project you can do this at
home the answer is probably billions of
years there's two factors that limit
survival in ice one is just thermal
decay what I call KT this is not a big
deal on Mars because it's so cold
the second one is radiation just from
natural crustal uranium thorium
potassium at low levels deep below the
surface it's not cosmic rays or solar
radiation this is natural radioactivity
from the crust and Siberia it's point to
rads a year which is not a lot organisms
that are alive can easily repair that
level of damage but an organism that's
frozen and inert it's going to
accumulate a lethal dose even the
champion radiation survivor Dino caucus
radio dorrance would would accumulate a
lethal dose in 100 million years 100
million years well that's much longer
than the age of ice on earth but it's
much shorter than the age of ice on Mars
the conclusion the profound conclusion
is it's dead Jim well of course it's
dead Jim but dead is actually okay we're
not interested in a live organism we're
interested in a dead organism and in
fact we'd have to kill it to do the
analysis anyway we want to look at its
genetic in
biological materials right we don't the
the important distinction here is not
between live and dead it's between a
dead organism and a fossil what we'll
find in this permafrost we hope is a
dead organism this search will start in
a few months when Phoenix launches to
Mars and starts landing in the polar
regions digging down to the ice and a
few centimeters into it that hopefully
will be followed by a deep drill going
down maybe ten meters and then an even
deeper drill going down a hundred meters
into this ancient old ice so that's our
best chance for finding evidence of life
on Mars I want to now quickly talk about
the number two candidate for searching
for evidence of life which is Europa
this is Jupiter and here's its four
Galilean moons Io Europa Ganymede and
Callisto Europa number two the brightest
one you can look through a small
telescope well if you stare at the
Galilean moons long enough you can pick
out Europa because it's obviously
brighter than the other four other three
it's an ice-covered world we think it's
got a layer of water underneath the ice
maybe 100 kilometers deep underneath
maybe 10 kilometers of ice what's the
evidence for the water there's two lines
of evidence for the water one is
morphological we see what look like
icebergs on the surface of Europa
well icebergs float in water so this is
morphological evidence that this terrain
was associated with liquid features but
this could have been an ancient terrain
that's frozen solid if you have icebergs
and then you freeze the ocean it's still
gonna be icebergs this is not evidence
for an ocean today this is evidence for
an ocean at some time the evidence for
the ocean today actually comes from a
very interesting application of what I
call airport technology which is the
metal detector technology you know as
you walk through the metal detector
there's a time-varying magnetic field
going on the metal detector creates a
time-varying magnetic field which
induces currents in any metal or any
conductor and those currents create a
magnetic field which then disturbs the
imposed magnetic field and generates a
disturbance in the imposed magnetic
field which is detected by the
electronics which is why a metal
detector detects not just magnets but it
detects any conductors at all well that
same effect is going on with Europa
moving around Jupiter Europa is in orbit
around Jupiter Jupiter has the strongest
magnetic field of any planet in the
solar system Europa is moving through
this varying magnetic field as it moves
it's creating a disturbance in that
magnetic field which indicates that
Europa has a large conductor on it now
presumably Europa doesn't have a bag of
dangerous nail clippers with which it's
going to hijack the Jovian airplane
what could the conductor be on Europa
the only answer is a global salty water
ocean that's the evidence that Europa
has an ocean today it's it's the effect
on the magnetic field of Jupiter as it
moves through it the same effect that
you induce when you walk through an
airport detector so next time you fly
think about Europa as you go through the
security line and the alarms go off
of course what if the question is could
this be explained by a liquid core of
metal the answer is no because we know
the composition of Europa is dominated
by ice and silicate from its density and
that even if you separate out the core
it just be a little tiny thing what we
need to explain this signature is a
large global conductor and it doesn't
have to be high conductivity it could
just be a slightly salty ocean it can't
be pure fresh water but it doesn't need
to be as salty as Earth's ocean for
example so that's the evidence Europa
has water given water does Europa have
life well it has to satisfy two
requirements one is that it has to have
a plausible origin of life and the
second is it has to have a plausible
ecology well we don't know how life
started we don't know we do not have a
consensus theory for the origin of life
we have a bunch of theories and on
timescales of roughly ten years the fad
the theory in fashion changes while the
current theory in fashion is that life
started as a chemosynthetic organism
that is organism getting its energy from
chemicals deep below the surface in a
dark hot vent of hydrogen and sulfur
well that is a theory that would work
well for Europa
so it's dere exists at least one theory
for the origin of life which would work
for Europa
we're not on firm ground
there but at least it's not it's not
ridiculous to speculate that life could
start separately on Europa in terms of
an ecology for life an ecology for
Europa life has to have no light no
oxygen and no organic input we know of
three ecosystems on earth that meet that
requirement shown here so we do have a
plausible ecology and here's the details
of the one on the subsurface of Africa
where the energy source comes from
radioactive decay dissociating water all
occurring below ground miles below
ground often people talk about deep-sea
vents as a model for Europa not a good
model these organisms require oxygen not
expected on Europa so what could we do
you think well we'll go into that ocean
and go scoop up some water that's not
practical there's 10 kilometers of ice
what is practical is getting a sample of
the surface and so here is what we think
are cracks on the surface so if there's
an ocean if the ocean has life and these
surface features may contain organic
material or biological material from
that ocean deposited on the surface and
so the mission concept that we've been
working on is what we call ice clipper
which is where we fly a spacecraft past
Europa and it releases a small round
copper ball which smashes onto the
surface and kicks up a plume and the
impact occurs with a velocity of about
10 km/s the total energy released is
about equivalent to to a car bomb a
convenient modern unit of energy so one
car bomb of energy is released the NOx
projectiles and particles of ice into
the atmosphere the main spacecraft flies
through it scoops up those pieces and
bring them back to earth that's our
second possible way of getting material
that might contain frozen remains of
microorganisms the third possible way is
more recent is from Enceladus Enceladus
is one of the small moons of Saturn it's
got a jet of water coming out of its
South Pole that material is spewing into
space presumably it's coming out from a
pressurized pocket of liquid water below
the surface on themselves we can fly
through that plume same spacecraft
design that we talked about for Europa
scoop
those materials so we now have three
places in our solar system where we have
a chance of bringing back the dead
remains of alien microorganisms I
emphasize that it's going to be dead and
it's going to be micro these are very
small and dead organisms we now want to
determine if that stuff really is
biological in origin so we've got
organic material that we've gotten from
Mars roper Enceladus how can we tell
that it was alive you know if I shoved
in front of you a bunch of dark brown
stuff and said this came from the
subsurface of Mars was it ever alive or
is it just non-biological organic
material how would you tell how could
you tell well if it's like us if it's
related to us if it's on our tree of
life it's real easy
we just amplify its DNA using PCR we
look for specific molecules that we know
that characterize all life on Earth like
ATP and so on it's easy but then that's
not the interesting case if it's not
like us if it's alien then that's the
hard case we don't know how to amplify
its DNA we don't even know if it has DNA
we don't know what it's got but that's
the interesting case
so our job then is to develop a general
strategy for search for alien life given
that the sample is going to be dead and
microscopic right well we could go back
to the literature and look at what are
the standard ways to search for life
here they are a standard way to search
for life one and use a tricorder this is
my favorite method and I would be happy
to use it but unfortunately science
doesn't know how tricorders work even
more unfortunate science fiction doesn't
know how tricorders work if you go to
Larry cross this great book the physics
of Star Trek and look up tricorder
nothing so grim grim for trekkers the
other approach is what I call the
justice Potter Stewart approach to the
search for alien life which is we can't
define it but we'll know it when we see
it well that works if it's alive or an
even better if it's alive and it's big
and chasing us or we're chasing them but
remember what we're gonna find in our
solar system is going to be microscopic
and dead it's not clear we're going to
know it when we see it so what how would
we analyze that material to determine
whether it was alive I want to make a
suggestion which is based on the rather
mundane observation that life on Earth
is Bill
stop on a small number of components
stacked up what I call the Lego
principle and those the Lego blocks of
life on earth has a twenty al amino
acids the five nucleotide bases and a
few D sugars the giant polymers of
biology are built from these units
stacked over again the proteins the RNA
and DNA and the polysaccharides the
scaffolding molecules and I've argued
that this is likely a common property of
biology as well as mass-produced
children's toys throughout the universe
for obvious reasons of efficiency and
specificity the lego principle that life
selects molecules and uses them only is
going to be general feature here is the
Lego blocks of life on earth the 20 al
amino acids the purines pyrimidines the
sugars and few fatty acids these are the
basic building blocks of everything we
see in life on earth the point here is
that alien life could use a different
set and still satisfy what I'm calling
the Lego principle you need to build
with a set maybe not the exact same set
that we use here's a the most obvious
example of the selectivity life on Earth
uses amino acids but life on Earth only
uses left-handed amino acids in making
proteins we do not use D amino acids in
proteins you can imagine a complete
biology that uses the D amino acids it's
an example life has to choose one or the
other can't have it both ways that
selectivity is needed for efficiency so
how does this translate into a
measurement strategy imagine taking that
sample of Martian goo and analyzing it
and mapping the results on some multi
dimensional phase space where you plot
concentration versus all types of
organic molecule and this is in a sense
of schematic cut through that phase
space if that organic material is
non-biological that distribution will be
statistically smooth it won't be flat
but it'll be statistically smooth
molecules will appear in there based on
their chemical properties molecules with
similar chemical properties will be in
similar concentrations the Allen D amino
acids will be at equal concentrations if
that material is biological for example
life from Earth the distribution will be
anything but statistically smooth it'll
be a series of Delta functions 20 al
amino acids
no D amino acids certain molecules and
very high concentrations way out of
statistical equilibrium it does not look
like a normal distribution of molecules
what might we find on another world a
similar pattern but hopefully different
molecules this would say life but alien
life not to say if it's the same as ours
well that's life but it's the same old
same old
so that's what we're hoping to find and
this turns it into a specific
measurement strategy that we can apply
to dead microorganisms I want to end by
just the observation that what is this
based on this is optimistic search that
we're gonna find something that looks
like this where we're gonna find life
but with a different chemistry it's
based on a view of that go back to that
image that I constructed of a
thermodynamic phase space of organic
molecules think of it as a infinite
dimensional space or semi infinite
dimensional space of all possible
organic molecules we know that at least
one point on that phase space is
suitable for life and that's the point
where we are at so we are at a well you
could call a maximum of complexity or
biological complexity in the landscape
of organic chemistry and obviously we
are at the maximum of that point
evolution would force us to be at the
maximum so from our vantage point any
direction we look it looks like it goes
downhill in the fitness landscape and
that leads many chemists and biologists
to conclude that that's the only way to
do life because they see in any
direction you go things get worse but
that doesn't preclude there to be a
completely different maximum somewhere
else which is also above the threshold
for complexity for life and the question
is can't we find that then maybe they
will never find it by starting here and
looking because it's too far away but we
might find that nature invented it over
here and it would argue that depending
on where a system starts it might end up
in a different complexity maximum and
there may be many of these there might
be a whole zoo of possible biochemist
trees that are suitable for life out
there we can only wait and see and hope
to discover them let me stop there Boris
and maybe we still have time for a few
in the backyard you know Star Trek a
shaman you could have a life without
carbon oxygen water and you say you're
looking for different forms of life
different from us along white
well that's a good question I wouldn't
rule out that there could be yeah the
question is why search for carbon and
water-based life could there be other
alternatives there could be other
alternatives but still what we're going
to search first carbon and water-based
life because in a sense that's what we
know how to search for so we could put
together a plausible strategy that life
found in places in our solar system with
water we could find life there and
that's a justifiable strategy what we
might hope to find his life that's
different from ours and not the same and
we begin to start understanding at a
general sense carbon-based life and
maybe fund that we can develop a
strategy for non carbon-based life but
right now we would have no defendable
strategy for non carbon-based life the
closest we could come I think to a
defendable strategy for exotic life
would be searching for life on Titan
Titan is rich in organic molecules but
the liquid that's there is not water the
liquid that's there is liquid methane
and literally last week I was involved
in a committee trying to define what
would be the science objectives for the
next titan mission and the question came
up should we make the search for life
carbon-based life in liquid methane a
goal for the next mission to Titan and
the consensus and I agreed with this was
no we don't have a plausible and
justifiable science scenario for why it
makes sense to search for life in liquid
methane we have no arguable basis that
we can go to an on advocacy review board
and say we're going to search for life
and here's why
exactly we don't know how to search for
it we don't have a defendable strategy
arguing for it so we in a sense we need
to take baby steps and I think the baby
step is search for life that's close
enough to Like us that we know how to
search for and how to recognize it
with this approach find it maybe but
maybe not with this approach detect life
on Titan that it could because it's
based on organic chemistry and we would
certainly do this kind of measurement on
Titan so we might indirectly discover it
but we can't say that we're in a good
position to argue that there's life in
liquid methane on Titan and that should
be the basis for a mission we can't say
that there's interesting organic
chemistry on Titan let's go check it out
and if further analysis of the organics
lead us to suspect something like this
is occurring then that would then change
the scenario significantly the prospects
for past or current life on Venus
current life the prospects are I think
pretty slim people speculate about life
in the clouds but I'm not optimistic of
that because on earth clouds are
specifically or generally devoid of life
in the past Venus may have had more
earth-like conditions water on the
surface and maybe had life I think if it
did we have very little chance of
finding any evidence of that it goes
back to the argument from Mars there if
there was life early in its history we
have a much better chance of actually
assessing accessing that record in terms
of frozen organisms or fossils or what
have you
question in the back we find evidence of
life and it turns out it's earth-like
life how do we know it's not
contamination that's a hard question and
the the way you do that is by having
sterile technique you made sure that the
probe and the arms and the scoops are
sterilized it's the same problem we do
fieldwork on earth we go out and we take
a sample we want to make sure that that
sample is not contaminated when we drill
in the Arctic we pull up a core we're
not interested in finding bugs that came
from us in that core and but
microbiologists have developed
techniques for doing sterile sampling
and aseptic technique and we would apply
them in space as well but what I'm
interested in is stuff that's
recognizably alien so there we'd have no
issue of whether it was contamination
question here based on our experience
how much of a time window does life need
in order to get started in other words
if the planet is only habitable for us
you know a few million years when is it
possible you know on the earth how long
did it happen between the time that life
was possible and the time that life was
detectable right the question was how
long does it take to the origin of life
and what does the earth record tell us
about that the oldest evidence for life
on Earth is in rocks that are three and
a half billion years old and there's
real good evidence in direct evidence
for life at 3.8 billion years old well
the age of the Earth Moon system the end
of the formation of the Earth Moon
system is 3.9 3.8 so it appears that the
earth finished its accretion and then
very rapidly life began but and so you
might argue that maybe the time window
required for the origin of life is only
tens of millions of years but that's a
very hard statistical argument to make
based on one data point you know if you
show up in California for the first time
in your life and it's raining you might
conclude that it rains here every day
but in fact that wouldn't be correct or
if you showed up here your first day and
bought a lottery ticket and won the
lottery you might think that every day
you buy a ticket you'll win the lottery
so it's hard to do statistics based on
one example and that's why it's such a
powerful result to find a second example
in our solar system the difference
between one example of life and two
example of life statistically is very
very important more than it does more
than just double our understanding
sorry man oh and hard you know what warm
in the pet when the green you have
another event did you yeah the question
is about Antarctica which was indeed
warmer in the past the green goo we see
there though does not arise is not
isolated in Antarctica
it is in equilibrium with the rest of
the biosphere Antarctica is not isolated
with respect to microorganisms it is I
say with respect to large organisms but
the algae we find in that lake is the
same algae we find out in the pond here
near the bay algae are distributed
globally so that it is not an isolated
environment in which life originated so
it's its application to Mars is only
ecological in terms of the origin of
life and arctica is not telling us
anything about the origin of life on
Mars we don't know how life started on
earth we don't know where or how it
started and that really limits our
ability to predict where and how it
would start anywhere else
oh yeah the question relates to these
recent images from Mars Global Surveyor
where they took pictures of certain
craters and then five years later there
were streaks on the side of the crater
that looked like water stains and one
explanation for these streaks is water
which is very surprising because we
don't expect water on Mars today there's
other explanations for these streets
they could just be the movement of dry
material downhill so-called mass flow
and mass wasting but and then the report
that was published lists all these
different hypotheses of course the press
focused on the liquid water as the
explanation so we really have not found
in controversial evidence unkind on
controversial evidence for liquid water
today there's lots of hints that it
might be there but it's not it's not
solid okay I think maybe we should quit
there since we're close to our ending
