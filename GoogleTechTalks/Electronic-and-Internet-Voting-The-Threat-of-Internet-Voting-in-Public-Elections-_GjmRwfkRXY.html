Internet voting since about 2009 1999 so
dozen years anyway I'm here from
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory but this
work doesn't this is not what I do at
the laboratory
I do supercomputing simulations there
however I have this side interest which
the laboratory allows me to pursue in
election security because it's part of
u.s. national security and then a major
cybersecurity issue so let's see so
first I want to make the point that of
course voting in a democracy is a matter
of national security the legitimacy of
government at all levels depends on free
and fair and accurate and open and
transparent elections and so we have to
consider this as of the highest security
issue this we're not talking ecommerce
security here this has to be considered
a national security issue
here's what I'm going to be talking
about today first of all I'm going to be
talking about what's so complicated
about voting and elections most people
think that it's that it's got to be
simple all you have to do is gather all
the votes from the clients to the server
sum up all the ones and zeros decide
which you know which candidate has
largest number of votes declare the
winner you're done that's about 1% of
the task I'll show you what the other
99% is I'm not I'm going to talk about a
little bit about how electronic precinct
voting is done and give you some horror
stories about that because the theme
here is going to be that all electronic
voting of any kind internet or precinct
based is a bad idea
we need something stronger than the
capabilities of all electronic voting
I'm then going to talk about a key
requirement that has been identified in
the last few years called auditability
of electronic voting and why it's
important then I'm going to talk about
internet voting and explain to you the
additional layer of complex security
problems that arise there and then I'm
going to tell you the most recent and
fascinating horror story about internet
voting that just occurred last October
so first of all why is voting so
complicated again most people think of
it as a relatively simple application
it's a distributed application in which
the votes are collected at precincts or
various other sites funneled into a
County central location where the votes
are just counted and summed and that's
that's all it appears to be but in fact
there are a whole host of technical
requirements that are associated with
elections and I'm going to go through
these somewhat quickly because it's not
the main part of the talk but it just to
give you an idea of the complexity so
first we have to be concerned with voter
authentication because all eligible
voters should be allowed to vote but
people who are not eligible to vote
should not be ballots election means
that voters have to get the correct
Vallot that is to say the things and
people that they are allowed to vote for
in their jurisdiction they are they're
shown on their ballot and the things
they're not allowed to vote for are not
on their ballot of course people are
multiple vote prevention you're not
allowed to vote twice and in a given
election accuracy of capture that is to
say the voters intent from his head to
the digital form of the ballot however
that happens has to be done accurately
ballot integrity that is to say
throughout the process and to end
ballots cannot be lost more corrupted
nor phony ballots inserted into the
process anywhere accuracy of talent
tally of course the votes have to be
summed and and reported and counted
accurately according to law you would
think this is easy but I'm going to show
you an example where that failed there
are two kinds of privacy issues involved
privacy one is that it should not be
possible if you if you get your hands on
a ballot you're a county official to
figure out who cast that vote and
privacy to is the voter also although he
knows how he voted and the voter is free
to tell anybody how he voted the voter
is not free to have any proof of
how he voted it's very important that he
not be able to prove it because if he
could prove it
he could be coerced or he could sell the
vote that's very tricky security issue
there you can tell anybody how you vote
but you're not allowed to be able to
prove it more on that later
there are many kinds of ballots of son
ordinary voting countywide voting system
has to handle all of these different
kinds of ballots simultaneously and
without loss of privacy of any of the
categories of voters system
certification a County voting system all
parts of the software has to go through
a certification process in all 50 states
and most of them recognize voluntarily a
federal certification process it will
come to later which is to say that the
software has to meet certain standards
and has to be tested to meet those
standards I have to my opinion is that
these standards are relatively weak and
the testing is relatively weak and this
is not a a high barrier but it's still
required and it's a model of the way
they think about security in the
elections world the software integrity
issue the object code derived must that
is run on the voting machines in the
precincts and on the county election
servers that object code better be
derived from the certified source code
and distributed without modification and
those nobody should be tampering with
that code availability the the voting
system must be up for at least all of
Election Day on any other time that is
required by law reliability all these
properties the voting system should have
even in the face of partial failures of
the voting system security it should
have all these other properties even in
the face of at least a certain amount of
deliberate conspiracy of election
officials programmers or others to
undermine the election obviously it's
not going to be possible if there's a
large conspiracy involved but at least
see you know single points of failure of
insecurity you want you wanted to to not
have transparency now this is a trans
fancy means that the entire system is
end-to-end simple enough that ordinary
citizens can understand it so they can
have confidence the election is called
correctly and also that it's observable
enough that the citizens have a right to
follow the votes and the ballots from
the moment they're cast to the moment
they're counted they're counted and and
check the results this is not an
operation that is supposed to be done
black box this is this balances with the
security issue this is one of the things
that makes election security so much
more difficult than in other security
problems because of the requirement that
it be observable by ordinary citizens
from end-to-end learnability
the human interface on voting machines
has to be cognitively simple enough so
that somebody who has never voted on
that machine or hasn't voted on it in
the last two years can come up to it and
use it immediately and learn it as he
goes this turns out to have been a major
problem that I think caused a
congressional race to swing the wrong
way as I will describe you later in 2006
verifiability each voter wants to be
able to verify that his own vote was
captured correctly not so much a problem
when you vote in a precinct a serious
problem though if you vote remotely
either by mail or god forbid by internet
auditability the system should produce a
tamper-resistant independent record or
audit trail that can be the basis of an
audit of the the software in the system
in other words that that all these other
properties have happened the problem is
of course you can't
you really can't verify that the
software does its job and when something
as important as the outcome of the
election is at stake you need another
way of being sure that the that the
system worked besides trusting software
manageability the system has to be
administered by citizens in their 70s
that's the average age of a poll worker
in the United States
accessibility to disabled voters mission
criticality the election has to happen
on time and the
defined by law no second chances and
finally speed the public has an
insatiable demand for fast results from
an election once the Election Day is
over and and that of course undercuts
all of the other requirements that we
have so I make no claim that these all
of these requirements are fully
consistent and they are certainly much
more complex than most people understand
yes yeah you're absolutely right that's
one of the difficult contradictions to
resolve it does that and so in fact
absentee ballots when you are allowed to
verify that your ballot was cast or for
that matter even if you're not there's
very little to prevent you from selling
an absentee ballot even today a paper
absentee ballot so again contradictory
requirements okay now I want to talk a
little about precinct electronic voting
before I get to internet voting by
electronic voting I mean when the the
voting machines on which you cast your
ballot are in effect are our computers
running software and they don't have any
paper record associated with them in
other words the ballots are cast all
electronically those machines are called
d-r-e machines direct recording
electronic machines they usually have
touchscreen interfaces but not all here
are three different brands of them that
are in use in the United States the
Diebold machines the NS the S&amp;amp;S machines
and the heart machines two of these are
in use in california dr es and
electronic voting became a kind of
national priority or fad depending upon
how you look at it after the infamous
2000 election in Florida with its
hanging chads and stuff the vision of
electronic voting that was that the
vendors who sold the idea believed and
that the election officials who bought
it believed and they honestly believed
it
is that it would first of all allow
votes to be captured straight from the
voters head into digital form without
going through some ambiguous form that
might be quasi digital like either marks
on paper or partial punches and a punch
card that that the election would be
administered in a clean reliable
efficient secure and paperless way the
results would be uncontestable there
would be over vote protection which is
to say if you vote for two separate for
two candidates for the same race you'd
be told you can't do that nothing in the
punch card world prevents you from
punching too hard to cards but in the in
the electronic voting world you can be
you can be given an error indication
that voting could be made much more
accessible to the to the disabled
especially the blind with computer
interfaces that it's a whole lot easier
to manage the plethora of non-english
language ballots there would be
potential support for more complex
election systems such as Instant Runoff
voting fast reporting of results lower
cost and this was this appeared to be a
a sea change and an important
technological improvement in the
management of Elections it was honestly
believed by all parties to be so in the
early part of last decade what actually
happened was this I think and of course
you're getting my opinion here but I
think it did not turn to turn out to be
clean reliable efficient or secure the
results are certainly not uncontestable
there's been no diminishment of election
contests or disputes in the since the
advent of this the results are not
reported any faster than than they were
before and the costs are certainly not
much lower and there are other problems
as well that I will get to all right I
want to talk to you now about oh just as
an illustration before we get to the
subject of internet voting which is the
that we say this year's major issue in
voting technology but I want to give you
some of the experience that we had
in the last decade from say 2004 to 2008
in struggling by we I'm talking about
the dozen or or 20 computer scientists
in the United States who are steeped in
the security issues of electronic voting
the stories that we have gathered and
the battles that we have fought and
about this issue just with electronic
voting in precincts so here's the first
story this is in Broward County Florida
in 2004 and this has come to be known as
the counting backward story because the
election officials and the press saw the
behavior of voting machine this
particular voting machine as counting
backwards the voting machine in question
was a high-speed scanner made by es &amp;amp; s
and what they saw it was that the
scanners output as it counted batch
after batch after batch of voters it
would votes it would add add more to the
sum of ballots counted or woops sorry
and you can see you know the count would
get up to 31,000 95 then again up to
32,000 something and then suddenly it
would go deeply negative and then
continue counting up except they saw it
as counting down because they kind of
ignored the negative sign because no
such thing as a negative number of votes
so it was the elected officials
interpreted that as counting up and then
counting back down I don't have to tell
this audience what happened this is just
a dumb unchecked 16-bit overflow bug but
it took years to fix that bug why
because the software has to be certified
and there's any change in election
system software has to go through an
elaborate national and state
certification effort which generally
takes over a year and 100,000 dollars so
instead for a long time there were work
arounds published to get around this
basically no no collection of batches
should-should encountered encounter more
than 32,000 votes or you'll see this
behavior but this is the kind of thing
that happens and and and election
officials don't recognize it because
election officials in the world are not
all that computer
and while they may have some IT staff
the IT staff is also not the not the
kind that you are used to okay they
there their training is not at the level
that you are that you're used to in most
counties in the United States there are
a few counties of course that have
really high quality staff but most can't
afford it San Joaquin County California
just over the hill here in 2005 this is
a bug that I investigated at some length
here and the problem was that voters
would come up to a touchscreen machine
and every once in a while the machine
would crash for reasons unknown just as
the voter was about to clear to cast the
vote so the voter would see this final
screen saying click below to cast your
vote they would touch that button and
boom the system would crash you wouldn't
necessarily know whether the vote had
been counted or wouldn't DeBolt had a
heck of a time figuring out what was
wrong with this
in the end what was discovered is all
right this touchscreen interface was was
made from a from a a web interface which
was intended to be used with a mouse of
course the mouse supports dragging
operations but touchscreens don't
support dragging operations everyone
said at least at least in the codebase
that they were using every once in a
while however a voter would touch on
that that would cause an exception and
that's what crashed the machine it did
it was a stack corruption thing but only
like one out of a thousand voters did
this and so testing took forever to find
it in the meantime thousands of voting
machines all over the United States
because this is a widely used machine
would crash but of course there was no
statistics on this because it's 3,000
different counties in the United States
they don't talk to each other so it was
a this was an incredibly difficult bug
to find and a serious one because it
causes crashes and you don't know
whether to
the voter to vote on another machine or
to tell him sorry go away new jersey
2008 this is a case where the ballots
were not even counted properly this is
the Secoya advantage machine that had
the this particular bug this was the
primary in New Jersey
precinct what actually happened was that
one voter was four for purposes of one
path in the software counted as a
Democrat and for purposes of another
path was counted as a Republican this
was a miss miss count this was a bug in
the procedures that the precinct workers
were to use to set up those machines in
a primary election this came from
Professor
Edie Felton at Princeton who was who
investigated this Florida congressional
district 13 Sarasota County 2006 very
important mystery this particular
congressional district cost crosses five
counties in Florida
but only one of the counties was
affected by this problem Sarasota County
Sarasota County is a relatively
Democratic County the other four
counties are relatively Republican
counties that made a difference in this
case this is a picture of the essi vote
Roenick machine that was in use in
Sarasota County
that election and what happened was this
was the single hottest congressional
election in the United States that year
it happened to be a seat being vacated
by Katherine Harris the famous Katherine
Harris who was running for the US Senate
so she was vacating her House seat
Republican and Democrat Vern Buchanan
and Christine Jennings were the
candidates at the end of the day mr.
Buchanan won the election by 369 votes
out of 280 230,000 cast
however in Sarasota County only of the
five counties 18,000 voters failed to
vote in that race at all in spite of the
fact that it was the hottest election in
the United States as measured by a money
spent had those votes been recorded and
if they have split the same way they did
in the rest of Sarasota County that
votes that that that were cast christine
jennings would have been sitting in
congress instead of Vern Buchanan so
here is a case where arguably an
electronic voting issue changed the
result of a congressional election now I
want to make it clear the software in
use in this issue was investigated in
great detail by people that I have great
confidence in no one found any bug or
any malicious code that could be
responsible for that problem and so I
don't think that this was a software
error even though that it really looks
looked suspicious here are the election
returns by the way you'll see in the
United States senators race there was
1.1 percent of the people who failed to
vote in the governor's race they're 1.3
percent of the people who fail to vote
but in the congressional race 12.9
failed to vote I mean that's way out of
scale that's how we know that this is
and by the way in the other four
counties in that election nowhere near
twelve point nine percent of failed to
vote so we know this is anomalous anyway
I don't want to spend my time on
explaining what I think the problem was
here except to say that I think it was a
ballot
layout problem I think this was a case
where voters could not learn couldn't
visually parse the ballot fast enough to
see what happened and I'll be glad in
the question period or later to go over
that if you want to see why I think so
Leon County Florida 2005 the famous
Hearst e hack this involved DeBolt a Vav
OS machines these are optical scan
machines they happen to have for holding
memory and that that's that card slot is
suppose that that card is supposed to
hold the election description the
candidates the office is the precinct
number that kind of thing and also the
voted record of the votes as they are
cast and the counts of those votes so
what Harry Hearst II discovered is that
they also hold code they hold bytecode
scripts that were used to customize
report generation and they have to be
customized because these are used in
many different states and states have
different laws and so on and so but but
but they hold code and what he was able
to do is to take one of those memory
cards and with a third party writer for
that kind of card he was able to modify
the reverse engineer that script and
modify it to cause in effect a transfer
of votes from one candidate to another
simply by modifying the memory card
never touching the voting machine it was
not a disclose it was never disclosed
publicly that these memory cards had
code on them but they did and he was he
demonstrated his ability to do this in
the climactic scene of an M&amp;amp;E of an Emmy
nominated documentary called hacking
democracy which I recommend to you it
was a remarkable demonstration of how he
was able to
show that just by touching a memory card
never getting near the voting machine
you are able to hack that election the
last example I want to give is from well
I'm calling an Emery County Utah and
Princeton New Jersey this was a case
where we discovered that it was possible
to infect voting machines by a virus now
of course these are not PCs they are
these are custom architectures but still
it was possible to create a virus a
viral attack on them this is a picture
of Harry Hearst II by now a very famous
man he's a first-class hacker and has
devoted a lot of his life to hacking
voting systems he's finished but he he
works in the United States and what he
did was in on on the vault ESX machines
the touchscreen machines not the optical
scan machines this time he discovered
that those same memory cards if you put
a boot loader or a copy of the voting
application on that memory card and then
put the memory card into the Machine as
you normally would the internal copies
of the operating system and/or voting
application are silently overwritten by
the copy on the card ok now if you hear
that the first thing that you that
should come to your mind and the first
thing that came to my mind was virus
because of course you can you can create
a modified version of the code silently
injected into one voting machine
sometime later somebody puts a different
memory card into that machine and that
card is then transferred to another
machine and can affect that machine and
so on so by the casual exchange of
memory cards among these voting machines
you can get a viral transmission of of
malicious code in voting systems now
this attack was actually demonstrated by
by Edie Felton at Princeton and his
colleagues
and so this just a fantasy this was
actually demonstrated in laboratory
conditions
I hesitate this I mean I hasten to say
we have never seen an actual we've never
documented a real hack attack on a
precinct election in a real in a real
context the ones we've been able to
document are in laboratory context but
because of the importance of conducting
secure elections we we go to all this
trouble so this is this is a just a
picture of the machine in question and
it's used in California and accidents
actually used in a lot of places in the
United States the viral attack the D
vault and most election officials were
under the impression that it was in
place you know it's impossible to
conduct a virus attack on on voting
machines because hey they're not
networked guys I mean they're not snot
that they're not connected to an
Internet they're not connected to any
network they're isolated in precincts so
the saying goes and and of course that's
wrong they are networked in the
warehouse when they are initialized
before an election at least briefly but
they are also slowly sneaker networked
by the casual exchange of memory cards
from one machine to another in the
course of doing business and of running
an election so here's what we've learned
about election security over the over a
course of about four years it was
possible to for the security community
the independent security community to
conduct studies various studies of
voting systems in various locations it
either takes a court order or it takes
the highest election official in a state
to threatened to withdraw certification
if the vendors don't submit to this
because this of course this is all
vendor proprietary software they don't
just make it available for the security
community to study and cause trouble for
them if they if they can avoid it
nonetheless a whole large number of
studies have been done and in every case
every single case multiple severe
security vulnerable
these have been documented I can give
you URLs for these studies if you really
want them so how do we resolve the
problems
the security problems of voting systems
well one important concept that we
promote is what we call software
independence that is to say we would
like to be able to be confident that we
can correctly call an election without
having to trust any software why do we
not want to trust software because too
much is at stake because no amount of
testing can demonstrate that the
software is bug free or is is secure
fortunately in this audience I'm sure I
don't have to make that point
but in lay audiences this is a very
difficult point to accept they always
think in terms of let's just test the
system and see if it works and and and
it's very difficult to get the idea to
penetrate then the testing is not a way
of demonstrating the security or
correctness of any system let alone a
vote a voting system so you want it to
be the case that even if the voting
system has bugs in its software even if
it has malicious code there is another
secondary way of determining that you
know what the correct outcome of the
election should be and and using that to
audit the software that's where the
subject of the concept of voter verified
paper trails comes in what you want is
not an all-electronic election you also
want at the time of vote is cast for a
paper copy of that vote to be written a
copy which the voter looks at and
validates as that as is correct intent
and you want to collect those two now
you may not want to use them as the
primary means of counting because it's
it's slow but you do want to be able to
use it for auditing you want to be able
to take a sample of those ballots hand
count those and compared to machine
counts of the same ballots and make sure
that the that the machine counts in
spite of bugs or in and possible
malicious code are correct and if
they're not then you want to extend your
audit or you
to do a hand count and throw away the
machine counts the paper is not just an
old technology it has actual security
properties it's a right once medium and
it's readable and writable by both
humans and machines and it's the only
medium that has those properties so it's
actually not a 1950s retro technology
that we don't want to go back to it's
got I think important positive security
properties if we want to take advantage
of paper
however election officials tend to
regard paper with some contempt they do
not wish to continue the management of
the vast amounts of paper that they have
traditionally had to manage in either
the punch card or the paper ballot world
so we have the security community has
come up with a concept called risk
limiting post election audits in which
you do something like this you select a
desired confidence level at which you
would like to check that the election
was correctly called you select a sample
of the paper ballots cast in that
election in a closer race it's going to
be a larger sample in a small
jurisdiction it's going to be a larger
percentage sample you hand count that
sample and compare it to the electronic
counts and if they match you're fine if
they are sufficiently few disk distant
differences you can certify the election
if there are a number of differences
that that do not reach the 99%
confidence level that you chose at the
beginning then you increase the size of
the sample and you repeat until you have
you can either do reach that confidence
level or you've 100% counted all the
paper ballots that's the kind of process
that we would like to institutionalize
we the security community and voter and
verified voting the nonprofit
organization that I am the chairman of
the board of that's the kind of process
that we would like to institute across
the United States yes sir
yes it so the question yeah so the
question was even with paper ballots
there will be some ballots that are
difficult to interpret and isn't it
always the case that there will be some
elections that are too close to call yes
with hand marked paper ballots it there
are ambiguous markings and the the laws
in most states direct election officials
to be very liberal in interpreting voter
intent so if it's pretty clear what they
intended even if they didn't follow
directions they are supposed to be make
a judgment as to judgment call as to
what the ballot meant and if they can't
do that the ballot doesn't count or at
least that particular mark in that
particular race doesn't count but these
it finally boils down to human judgments
and in those cases yes
so you you point out that paper ballots
can be after the fact marked you know
marks can be added to them and wouldn't
it be a good idea to have some kind of
checksum on them to to catch that so
there are there are a lot of procedures
to to prevent that or to detect it they
don't amount to a checksum and they are
not foolproof you're right usually what
happens is you you know if you if you
can add a vote mark to a paper ballot
you either have to add it to a to a race
that the guy didn't vote in at all or if
you do add it to a vote race that he did
vote in then you in fact double double
vote in that race and that invalidates
his vote in that race and that could
have been your goal too yes so it's
different there's the main guard against
anything like that is what's called the
two-person rule which is which is
required in almost every jurisdiction in
the United States which is that no
person is alone with voted ballots or
for that matter blank ballots but always
two people are involved so at least it
takes a conspiracy of two people in
theory to get away with that but you're
right you have to think about those
things even with paper ballots but
another big advantage of paper over
electronic is that if you're gonna even
have an attack on electronic ballots it
can be automated you know in
milliseconds invisibly thousands of
ballots can be infected affected that's
not true with paper ballots it takes a
lot longer and a lot more people have to
be involved and have to be either not
looking or not paying attention so the I
think the reduces the risk of that is
greatly reduced with paper but not
eliminated okay yes sir
the big technology companies are not
involved in this market
they are generally companies that
specialize in voting systems you're
right
do I you ask did I see a political
consequence of that fact I don't want to
speculate about that and the reason is
that since I write and speak about this
a lot you know if I were to make any
irresponsible speculative comments you
know people would use those comments to
undercut the rest of my message so I
never make comments on on that kind of
thing let me move on to internet voting
now because this is you know this is the
hot topic this year it comes in waves
every two or four years of course I
first got involved in in 1999-2000 when
I wrote a report for the secretary of
state of California recommending against
internet voting in those days the case
has only gotten much stronger since then
by internet voting I mean any voting
system in which voted ballots are
transmitted over the public Internet and
sometimes we include fax and telephone
and other telecom based or mixed systems
as well but voted ballots are
transmitted electronically over a
network I call that internet voting now
there are lots of internet voting
architectures there their various client
types personal PCs and mobile devices or
secured kiosks controlled by election
officials various protocols there's web
application voting email voting some
kind of election specific voting
protocol the ballot itself can be
represented in many ways you commonly
it's PDFs
sometimes it's XML sometimes it's some
special other special-purpose
representation there are various
authentication mechanisms and there are
various other issues in the architecture
of internet voting systems I'm going to
make comments that are generic to all of
them because they have enough in common
that you can say a lot of
generically first let me note that in
the United States in 2010 there are a
lot of states that allow some form of
internet voting at least by Americans
who live overseas or are in the military
and that's what this map describes if
you look at the at Colorado and West
Virginia that have the orange color they
actually used that they actually tried
web application voting in this last
election and and so I got a lot of
attention for that I'll come back to but
most of the states that allow enter the
internet voting of any kind typically
allow email voting and in my opinion
that is the worst of all forms of voting
invented from a security point of view
and I'll make that case in a minute all
right fundamental problems with internet
voting that really are generic to all of
the architectures
first of all internet voting is a kind
of electronic voting and it inherits all
of the security vulnerabilities of
electronic voting it's as though you
took one of those electronic voting
machines opened it up took one of its
data paths and stretched it across the
entire internet creating an attack
service that is as big as the Internet
but in addition internet voting systems
can be attacked by anyone on earth
that's not true for a precinct based
electronic voting system but insiders
and disaffected individuals from
Bulgaria and foreign criminal syndicates
from Russia and nation-state agencies
from Iran and China or anywhere else can
attack a US election and they can do so
from the safety of their own soil and
out of reach of United States law any
number of attacks can be conducted
simultaneously independently without
knowledge of each other either possibly
interfering with each other who knows
it's a completely uncontrolled
environment when the Internet is
involved many of the attacks in question
are silent and they are uncorrectable
and not even detectable
certainly privacy violations if if I if
I collect all the votes and published on
the on the internet how you guys all
voted you're not going to be able to
correct that and if I if I do some other
kind of attacked of the votes before
they arrive at the election server
either in your client or or as in
transit the election officials are not
even going to detect that let alone be
able to correct it
the internet of course the threat
environment is constantly changing and
as a result and internet voting system
unlike a classic electronic voting
system isn't even a closed system it
changes every two years every election
cycle you know the browser's change the
PDF changes or the PDF renderers change
the the crypto systems change you guys
know all of this of course but the
election officials of the world
typically don't understand this at all
and so the idea that you can freeze a
voting system and then certify it and
then use it safely for many years while
that ideas at least conceptually might
work for a closed electronic voting
system it doesn't work at all in the
internet voting world no electron no
internet voting system has been used in
the United States twice every instance
and there have been a dozen or fifteen
in the last decade have been one-offs
and I predict that that will remain true
because the environment changes that
quickly
all right here's a genetic internet
voting system generic one sorry
the purple up above that's the vendor
development network the vendor transmits
eyes code to the county that is running
the election and if you want to have it
and so these are the counties let's say
private pcs or or Wireless clients and
if you want to attack an internal the
internet election you have abundant
opportunities to attack it you can of
course attack
server-side let's say the vendor side
you can attack the vendors code in
development and insert malicious code in
principle we have no examples that this
has ever happened mind you but this is
but I don't have to tell Google about
the threat of external attacks to your
own internal development efforts I do
use you as an example to try to explain
to election officials that the little
vendors who are trying to sell in these
systems are not more secure than from
this kind of attack then Google is if
you want to attack it in an election
election you can attack the server side
you can have a penetration attack on
that server you can attack there are
many kinds of networks attacks that you
might engage in while the while either
the blank ballots are being transmitted
to the voters or the voted ballots are
being transmitted back or of course you
can attack the clients themselves with
some kind of malicious software attack
or other attack on clients the number of
attacks in legion here is a list of
attacks that that we have identified in
one or another publication but to people
who understand the architecture of PCs
and of the Internet
this category of attacks is all pretty
obvious except perhaps presentation
attacks and vote privacy attacks which
are more specific to election but the
others of these are classic kinds of
attacks that you know at least in this
audience you would all be familiar with
so I don't need to dwell on this too
much now I said I made this offhand
remark earlier that email voting is in
my mind the worst form of voting there
is because of course it is an Internet
voting architecture so it's subject to
all of those kinds of attacks on the
previous page and all the general issues
that I brought up but in but but worse
at least with email voting you know
voters and election officials they don't
have support for encrypted and
authenticated email so an email voting
your
balint is sent in the clear over the
Internet along with your name because of
course since it's a remote ballot they
have to know who has voted as well as
how you voted so they can check you off
to prevent you from voting twice so with
with email voting you transmit both your
name and your email address and the
ballot all in the clear so there's
nothing to prevent somebody for
modifying in transit or throwing it away
or forging your ballot or I mean this is
really nothing I mentioned because your
name must be transmitted in the clear
you are subject to vote coercion you're
subject the the system is subject to
vote buying and selling it's it's a
nightmare if you're concerned about
those issues which I at least am anyone
any administrator who operates either a
mail forwarding server or a router or
some firewall anywhere in the path from
somebody voting in Japan in a US
election all anywhere in that path from
their to his County election server can
can trap that ballot modify it send it
on or throw it away you guys know that
but a lot of the people who talk about
internet voting systems don't understand
enough about the architecture and the
limitations of Internet transactions
don't don't understand this other
problems are that email addresses are
frequently shared among people in a
household they're changed frequently so
email address let's go out of date etc
it's just and it's not really intended
to be a reliable communication medium
you know that email is occasionally
delayed sometimes by days it can be
duplicated it can be lost in transit
it's it's not a high assurance
communication medium it's not the kind
of medium that you want to rest a
national-security
activity upon all right now yes
yes okay so let me the so the question
was she notes that Oregon is is entirely
vote-by-mail Washington State is moving
in that direction California is 40%
vote-by-mail and of course paper mail is
transmitted hand to hand and subject to
delays just as I criticized email for so
am I saying that email is is less secure
than vote by then vote by mail and yes I
am and the reason is while you're right
all those things are true of paper mail
you really have a hard time conducting
an automated attack a remote attack
against paper transmitted in the mail so
because of the ability to automate it
and the ability to conduct the attack
from Tibet Oregon voters who vote by by
email arm are in principle much more
vulnerable to manipulation than who vote
by paper mail but otherwise you're
correct yes go ahead
so he asked do I think that the problem
with email voting could be addressed if
there were a public key infrastructure
in which voters got called the keys at
the time of registration okay one time
one time pad sorry at at the time of
registration voter registration and I
guess my concern about this is no voters
don't understand key management they
don't understand the necessity of keys
they don't understand most citizens in
the United States make no deliberate use
of encryption whatsoever
they it works for an HTTP communication
because the voter has to doesn't have to
do anything to make that work it
wouldn't work with email so I would say
no that this is outside of what most
voters are going to be capable of
handling that would be my guess remember
a voters register possibly only once in
their life and then that that same key
would be used what for every election
for the next thirty years for that voter
go ahead well so people have talked
about many ways of delivering software
to voters for use in elections right now
we have no infrastructure for doing that
that software itself would have to be
certified you would have to trust that
software all of the problems with
electronic voting and certification and
trust of that software would arise you
would have to worry also about malicious
software that look like that software
circulating and be having people use the
wrong software so I would say as best I
understand it now and the best of
security understand it now the security
community understands it I would say
that problem is would be unmanageable
did you have one more follow up there
yeah
right so she she says that the
government of course is encouraging
people to to do important transactions
like filing their taxes online and
people do that and it appears to be safe
people also you know do high-value
financial transactions like paying
multi-thousand dollar mortgages a month
online and that appears to be safe and
so how do we compare that to the
possibility of voting why isn't voting
look like that and there are several
levels of answer to that but it's a
really good and important question so
I'm glad you asked it
number one is financial transactions
online are actually nowhere near as safe
as people generally believe they are and
there are now special-purpose
botnets whose job it is to infect
computers and either business computers
or personal computers and detect when
they are connecting to their bank and
steal their credentials and move money
and there's enough there's nothing to
prevent that from happening in the
online world as well and sorry in the
online voting world as well so I think
people overestimate the security of
financial transactions and transactions
like tax filing now the main security
issue in tax filing is authentication
privacy and integrity but they don't
have the other dozen or so secured
requirements that I put up at the
beginning they are not for example
required to be observable by everybody
in the country and be able to and be
checked and a financial transaction and
and a let's say a tax filing transaction
is a private two-party transaction but
an election even a single
is not a private act between you and the
election official there's the structure
the security structure of an election
problem is really different I care just
as much about your vote as I do my own
if you and I are going to vote the same
way then it does its much damage to me
if your vote is is changed as if mine is
or if I know you and I are going to vote
oppositely then it doesn't much good for
me if your vote is damaged as it is if I
get to vote twice or something like that
that's not that property doesn't that
collective property does not apply in
the world of financial transactions if
if you lose a hundred dollars in a
financial transaction it's no skin off
of my back okay but that's not true in
an election your vote weighs as much as
mine and is symmetric to mine in a
collective transaction in an election
not in the financial world yeah I'm
gonna yeah let's take that let's take
this offline just noting that she that
she questions whether that what I said
applies at least in the tax case and
I'll come back to that offline let me
fin I want to tell you the final story
here which is a really fascinating story
and it's the one that I want to leave
you with Internet voting has been around
for a decade it comes and goes it's been
trying it's never been institutionalized
it's been on a trial basis over and over
in the United States but in spite of the
security community's many complaints
about the danger of this we have never
had an opportunity to actually
demonstrate it until last October the
District of Columbia was preparing for
the general election held last November
and they wanted to offer internet voting
to overseas and military citizens of the
district to vote in the general election
what they decided to do was to have
developed for them an Internet voting
system
it was a virgin in
voting system a web application it was
never tested by anyone on earth except
its developers and was and was to be
used one time in a mock voting testing
environment in which a mock election was
held on the Internet and and it was
allowed to be attacked by anyone for at
least a few days in a in a testing
period five weeks before the election
and the idea was that if it survived
that test period it was going to be used
in the actual general election November
second the system by the way was
actually built by people here in the Bay
Area the open source OS DV is the name
of the company here was their
advertisement for the election was
online and over on the right there was a
link to the voting application when once
it became live in the test period so
remember this was a test election but it
was called testing purposes like the
real election so the first thing that
happened with when this became live was
that I discovered a horrendous bug in it
the way it was supposed to work was that
the voter would connect to the system
request the proper ballot for his
precinct that ballot would be downloaded
in PDF form through this web application
then in the web application you would
with a mouse mark in a PDF overlay layer
your choices in the election you would
then save that PDF to the desktop as a
file and then the last step would be to
upload that ballot voted ballot now back
to the server through the same web
application okay what actually happened
though was when the ballot got back to
the server
in most cases it was blank no matter
what you marked on it it was blank and
the reason is that in the save step when
you save that ballot most browsers and
most PDF support in most browsers except
for Adobe's own throws away the overlay
layer leaving a blank PDF
and when you upload that you don't know
it but you sent a blank ballot if you
let it later discover it it's too late
you've already voted it that's what I
discovered now fortunately I discovered
it during this test period but it was
astonishing to me that it even got to
this level of tests without this having
been detected and corrected this would
have been a horrendous problem for
hundreds of voters I say hundreds out of
there were only 900 voters in the
population eligible to vote in the real
election but most of them would have
cast blank ballots now that was just a
bug
a bad one but now I want to talk to you
about the most important test because
what we were really interested in doing
was demonstrating the security problems
in in Internet voting elections now the
District of Columbia allowed that if you
wanted to do a penetration test on them
you were free to do so there there were
no no legal consequences to that lots of
attacks we couldn't perform we couldn't
attack the vendor we couldn't attack the
district's ISP we couldn't attack mock
voters machines those would still all be
illegal but at least server penetration
attacks were open to us this is
University of Michigan professor Alex
Halderman who was testifying at the DC
City Council after hacking the trial
election in a way I will describe in a
moment and if you have further detailed
questions please contact him at the
University of Michigan he'll be glad to
talk to you
here was the hack the first thing they
did sitting entirely sitting in Michigan
a remote attack only they penetrated one
of the switches in the DC data center
because it was using the default
password okay
what do you expect they were able
through that switch to capture photos
from the DC data centers own security
cameras and here are some of those
photos courtesy of Alex Halderman you
can see on the left is the is the the
Board of Elections vote app server in in
a cage and on the right is the door to
the data center with people coming in
the next thing they did was to venat
rate penetrate the vote collection
server via a very simple shell injection
attack here is the code that contains
the vulnerability that was used that day
note that I've circled the name false
ten Lorne his name will come up in the
last slide
he is the I'm not sure his exact title
but basically the chief of IT in the
District of Columbia at least for the
board of elections and ethics Bo EE that
was conducting the election this
particular you this runs on the server
but it is using a file name that came
from the users client machine it the
file name had been validated at least
the the main part of the file name had
been validated but the extension part of
the file name was not validated so they
they injected shell code into the
extension part of the name and were able
through that device to take over control
of the entire election server at that
point they had control of the web server
so they modified it so that future mock
voters who wanted to cast votes would if
they waited for 30 more seconds or 20
more seconds I forget which after they
voted without moving the Michigan fight
song would be played to them through
their browser and and I can verify this
I saw it happen or I heard it happened
it happened in my house and this was
their signature that they had control of
the server but the election officials
running election didn't understand that
in they didn't notice it for at least
and it's not clear when but at least 24
hours possibly 36 hours after this they
also replaced all of the accumulated
ballots up to that point with with fake
ballots that were write-ins for movie
robots in addition they install the
trojan that captured all subsequent
ballots most of which were blank I might
add
with the same write-in ballot for movie
robots but that wasn't all
they also rummaged around the server and
they found they were looking for files
to see what was there and it turns out
that there were test scripts that were
testing the validity of the PDF files
that came in as as votes and one of the
tests was is it too big to be a PDF
rejected is it too small to be a ballot
rejected and and so one of the test
files that they use to see if the
testing if the filter code worked was a
big file that happened to be 900 letters
written to the real voters telling them
what their voter ID and pin number
should be used in November 2nd real
general election so they captured that
entire file which I will show you a
picture of a little bit later here is
what is Haldeman testifying for the DC
Council after that and that box to the
right that I've circled contains the
printout of the nine hundred pages that
were to be mailed to the real voters now
finally it turns out that remember this
this mock election was open to anybody
in the world to attack we didn't know
who was going to attack it like if
nobody had attacked it well then the
system would have just been used in the
real election or if nobody had
successfully attacked it but in fact
there were other attackers and so
Halderman steam defended against those
attackers by actually inserting rules
into the firewall to to exclude those
peoples IP addresses and here's the
clinker those two separate sets of
attackers were from Iran Iran and China
IP addresses in Iran in China now I've
made the point that this is a national
security issue remember this was a a
mock election held in one city really
announced only only three days in
advance
I think there would have been a lot more
attackers if they had announced it a
month in advance but they really only
announced the date that they were gonna
bring it up three days in advance and
still hackers in Iran and China we don't
know if this was you know their first
class hackers or not we don't know who
they were so I don't want to make any
more of it than there was but these were
people fooling around trying to
penetrate the system may be other people
penetrated it we don't know now the
reaction of DC election officials well
they finally did catch on that they had
been that their network had been owned
so the first thing they did quite
properly was to cancel at least the
voted ballot return part of the internet
election for for November second they
still allowed and I think this was okay
the sending of blank ballots but then
voters had to print those blank ballots
mark them by hand and mail them back
they were not transmitted back
electronically yeah I retained the blank
ballot distribution part and then of
course they vowed never to run an
Internet election again until they and
independent experts agreed on its
security after extensive testing oh wait
no that's not what happened
they actually pledged to repeat it and
be more aggressive about solving the
problem in exactly the way they have
chosen in the future in fact this is
what they did they said in response to
the hacking of the digital vote-by-mail
public examination software David
Jefferson of verified voting me
wrote let there be no mistake about it
this is a major achievement and supports
in every detail the warnings that the
security community has been giving about
internet voting for over a decade now
after this there can be no doubt that
the burden of proof in the argument over
the security of Internet voting systems
has definitely shifted to those who
claim that the systems can be made
secure of course I thought it was always
that way in the first place their
response was and the response was from
Paul Stegman the guy who's whose name I
circled on the page that contained the
bug that that allowed the penetration
his response was
all due respect to mr. Jefferson the
lesson learned is not to be more timid
but more aggressive about solving the
problem in exactly the way we have
chosen meaning web application based
Internet voting at least that's what I
believe he means our task is to continue
pursuing a robust secure digital means
for overseas voters to cast their ballot
rather than resorting to email or fax
now to give him credit I want to make it
clear he understands that email and fax
are terrible means for voting and so
their intent was to provide something
less bad than that and so at least in
that respect they had he understood the
problem properly and he goes on as faint
as Thomas Edison famously said etc he
added the burden of proof will always
rest on election officials to ensure
integrity and transparent the computer
science community has a heavy burden as
well the computer science community
needs to understand that tooth disk
toothpaste is already out of the tube
and no volume of warnings can put it
back no toothpaste is already out of the
tube even though no Internet voting
system has ever been used twice and not
value of warnings from the security
community can convince them otherwise
now I think he probably overstated I
don't think he really believes this but
this was the response the PR response
that he gave and this is what we face
all of the time election officials in
the United States in the United States
by and large do not understand computer
security they do not have high-powered
technical and security staffs and
unfortunately however they also do not
like listening to the technical
community because a dynamic of shall we
say I don't know there's a difficult
dynamic between the security community
and election officials because they
think we're trying to tell them how to
do their job
they don't like the they don't feel we
understand their job sometimes they feel
like we're trying to cause trouble for
them it's it's not yet a healthy
situation but I still maintain that
election security is a u.s. national
security issue and in any country it's a
national security issue for that country
and that internet voting is an example
of something that I just I don't see for
the next decade any way of resolving all
of the issues satisfactorily that will
allow us to run an election safely over
the Internet
okay I think I'm going to stop there I
don't know I probably way over time I
don't know but if you have any further
questions I'll be glad to take them
otherwise you're free to you're free to
go
thank you any more questions yes I'm
trying to repeat the question I wasn't
quite sure I'm not sure got it all but I
think I'll imply it in my answer I'll
apply it in my answer overseas citizens
do have and especially overseas military
have great difficulty voting there
they're serious barriers there is say a
week of latency in every communication
from overseas to home and and at the
very least you may have to request an
absentee ballot get the absentee ballot
returned to you fill it out send it back
that's at least three trans
transmissions across the ocean and
through foreign postal systems or
whatever and that doesn't encount boater
registration so you're right there are
barriers what what those of us who are
trying to resolve this issue suggest are
a large number of of ameliorating
measures that do not involve the return
of voted ballots through the internet so
the security problems of the
transmission of blank ballots through
the Internet are shall we say
considerably more manageable and so what
we are encouraging election officials at
federal and state levels to do is to
develop secure means of transmitting
blank ballots to overseas voters that
will instantly get them the blank ballot
and then which they will then print and
mail back but they'll be able to do that
transaction in one transmission across
the ocean and then if you if you get
those ballots to them earlier and this
is a matter of state law and practice
and County law and County practice as to
when absentee ballots are available for
either mailing to citizens or
transmitted electronically to citizens
if you can extend that that deadline or
and/or allow ballots to be counted even
though they are returned after election
day as long as there's a time stamp on
them says they were cast look I said
when I mentioned speedy results
I mentioned first of all these were
contradictory requirements and secondly
that's I put that last on the list
because I think it's the lowest priority
the personal opinion other questions yes
sir
so many people make that point that no
system is perfect there the question is
how imperfect a system are you willing
to accept and if the alternative is that
lets say overseas is don't get to vote
at all or you know can only only vote in
small numbers because their votes are
see the too much trouble for them or
they come they arrive late and don't get
counted or whatever wouldn't it be
better to provide them some kind of
imperfect system instead of a you know
letting the the requirement for
perfection drive this argument well in
my case in my personal opinion is in
this case no the argument is against
internet voting because in in every
election is usually one congressional or
US Senate election that's decided by
only a few hundred votes if you only
have to swing a few hundred votes in a
state then the place to do that would be
through an internet voting attack I
think remember anyone on earth not even
US citizens but foreigners can attack US
elections this way I just don't want to
take a risk that that let's say five
million votes cast by citizens either
temporarily or permanently residing
overseas become the prime target for
election manipulation in the United
States by foreigners or criminals or
insiders again this is not the ability
to automate or or attack silently and
remotely doesn't apply to by male votes
it does apply to electronic votes so or
to internet votes and so
in my judgment at least at the four
federal elections presidential electors
United States senators United States
congressman
that's too high a risk to take for my
for my view and I if I thought that it
was possible to confine internet voting
only to overseas military and I this is
being videoed and so people out there
gonna see this video to hear me say this
and I'm gonna regret saying this I know
but if I thought it was possible to
confine it to that small population who
needs it the most I I could live with it
the risk but I don't think it's possible
to do that I think once it's
institutionalized for any small
population the large investment in
servers in 3,000 jurisdictions around
the United States will have to be
justified somehow and confining that
that that investment for the benefit of
a small fraction of people living
outside the United States temporarily
that investment would not be justified
you divide the number of voters by the
divide the number of voters in to the
cost of that it would be hundreds of
dollars per vote per election as opposed
to a couple of dollars per vote for
election for the rest of us so what
would end up happening is that there be
more and more pressure to allow larger
and larger groups and eventually
everybody to cast a ballot on the
Internet at which point all of these
dangers become primary instead of
secondary so that's a personal opinion
but that's that's my fear yeah there are
but not everybody in the world can
attack a precinct election you have to
actually physically be there okay you
have to actually touch the ballots or
touch the voting machine or at least
such a memory card okay you can't sit in
Bulgaria and attack a precinct election
and of course I'm worried a lot about
about electronic voting elections as
well but internet voting to me is is a
thousand times more difficult because
the attack space is tax surface is just
a
times greater that's my concern other
questions yes sir well people so he
asked what what if voters were issued
some kind of hardware device or widget
maybe for authentication well I mean
well it certainly doesn't it does
nothing to protect you from some of
these kinds of attacks does nothing to
predict to protect the election from a
denial of service attack for example all
right well you say that but that
actually is of course the easiest attack
to happen and it's a documented attack
that actually did occur in a Canadian
preventional election in night in 2004 I
think and and it's easier every year to
produce such attacks and and it's not to
and I don't mean just I want to add a
selective denial of service attacks if
you know for example that a given region
is rich in votes of the people you don't
like you can attack routers or whatever
along the path from them to to the
county and and cause their votes to be
to be dropped or delayed so this is this
that's very dangerous and a lot of their
land and they don't protect anybody from
penetration attacks they don't protect
from attacks on the vendor or the
Builder of the of the widget that you're
talking about so what I'm concerned
about is the entire system security and
you might provide you might come up with
a hardware widget that aids in in strong
authentication or strong encryption of
ballots and I just argued that that's
you know too
of 20 major security issues that's
that's my concern not to mention the
issue about the distribution of the
hardware devices to voters do they are
they one-time devices that they discard
each election in which case if you they
have to get another one for every
election or do that are they issued at
registration time what if the protocol
world changes you know or all those
device who pays for them can't charge
the voter that's a poll tax
what so there I I do not see a way of
enlarging that to a full system solution
I guess it's what I'm saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
