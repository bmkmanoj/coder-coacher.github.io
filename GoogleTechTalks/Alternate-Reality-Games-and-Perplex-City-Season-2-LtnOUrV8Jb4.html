County and mine Kenny are the mangers of
perfection which moving closer at least
criminal and he's going to talk a little
about Ohio you started its these artists
what about season one so if you don't
mind it work a few
this one free stuff feel free to help
yourself and so season one has just
ended adrian is going to talk a little
bit about how they developed and ran
season one and what they're going to be
doing different and they believe better
in the season two so Adrian Hong thank
you got this so um yeah what I'm going
to do is I'll give a brief introduction
about what alternate reality games are I
presume a lot of you guys have heard
about it but in case you haven't I'll
introduce them then what I want to do is
talk about the making of season one of
perfect City what for thought vs went
into you know the planning of season one
and how it panned out and what worked
and what didn't work and then I want to
talk about what we're doing in the
future with perfect city in season two
so I'm a good place to start is asking
why our alternate reality games
interesting more interesting than other
types of games I think it's basically
because of the interface of a RGS so on
if you look at sort of the history of
video games you can see that controllers
or joysticks or gamepads so to get
progressively more and more complicated
you know you start out with a you know a
pong you basically got a paddle and dial
and then you've got the nares controller
than the Super Nintendo then the
GameCubes and the playstation 2
controller and now the playstation 3
controllers got 15 buttons and two
joysticks you've grown up with video
games it's perfectly obvious how you
play these games but if you haven't then
it just looks like a piece of alien
technology and you know you don't know
how to use it and so lately obviously
with there being games which are sort of
going in the other direction so some
that some of the best games recently use
use different sorts of controls so this
is singstar here and basically you know
you have a microphone that's a
controller and in the game you you play
karaoke basically and I mean guitar hero
you basically play along using a toy
guitar and the interesting thing with
these games is that
you don't really have to learn how to
use these controls you really know how
to use how to sing into microphone and
how to how you're supposed to play
guitar at least it's a very natural
control scheme and alternate reality
games when you boil them down there
basically adventure games played out on
the fabric of the internet and they also
use tools that we already know how to
use so what you do basically in an
alternate reality game is say so you
have a detective mystery if you want to
go and email a suspect then you just
find a hotmail war or google mail and
everyone knows how to use hotmail if you
want to search about a company or about
individual you don't have to use a
specialized interface you just go to
google and you type in the company name
and you'll find a website and that's
that's how you find out and if you want
to speak to a character you just fire up
skype or or use your mobile phone and
just call them using these tools and
using these services that you already
know how to use because you use them
every day and this sort of tends to be
true of all alternate reality games and
that's why a lot of people find them
very interesting it's it's not that you
pretend the entire story is real it's
just that it feels very real because he
using the interfaces and the services
that you use everyday so alternate
reality games start at about six years
ago and traditionally their cost is
about an order of magnitude less than
traditional console or PC games so
instead of being a few million dollars
to make it's a few hundred thousand
dollars to make and that's many because
of things like distribution and contact
creation the fact that you don't need
expensive 3d graphics or AI or stuff
like that but it's still not really that
cheap and lately you know the big
question is how do you actually pay for
alternate reality games you know as
designers you know we love making these
games but how do we keep on making them
and it's an important question because
how you pay for them really influences
the design of the game and that's the
honest the first question
came up when we started making perfect
City and their kind of three big ways
you can do it firstly their sponsorship
and this is how most alternate reality
games get their funding and what they do
is they get sponsored by people like
Coke or Microsoft or movie companies to
produce games that are marketing for the
movies or like like AI or like minority
report or TV shows like lost or heroes
or video games like Halo and these have
been pretty popular you know marketing
and sponsorship works has worked pretty
well so far because alternative reality
games have always generated a really big
buzz in the media they get a lot of
column inches they get a lot of people
talking about them and they also reach
people who don't normally get reached by
traditional advertising through TV or
magazines or things like that a lot of
people who play alternate reality games
they don't you know they download
everything using BitTorrent and I don't
watch TV anymore and so alternate
reality games can really reach them and
also on one of the other reasons why why
sponsorship is is quite good as because
alternate reality games allow
advertisers to get people to interact
with their products directly so say you
had a mobile phone company that wanted
to make an arg you could as part of the
game have people learn about your
product or even use you know GPS on the
mobile phone or whatever but the form of
us was that we didn't actually just want
to make ads in project city we wanted to
control our own IP and we wanted to tell
an ongoing story and hopefully make more
money than you can get just using
sponsorship so we decided not not to go
down that route then the second boot is
subscription and basically what these
games are done most notably majestic is
that you pay something like ten dollars
or fifteen dollars like World of
Warcraft and you get certain amount of
content every month and
this really was disastrous for majestic
Electronic Arts made majestic they put
10 million dollars behind it and they
lost most of their money and a lot of
reasons why that happened I think partly
because of the game design partly
because of the sponsorship probably
because it was an idea before its time
but but it didn't seem like people
wanted to pay to play an alternate
reality game it just didn't seem like
the right time and it might work later
but and we might try this ourselves but
we don't know this this is not if we
wanted to go but it seemed very risky so
this third view is basically it's kind
of a modification of sponsorship it's
basically marketing your own
intellectual property and this is what
we did what I mean by this is making an
alternate reality game that ties in to a
product that you sell yourself so in our
case which I'm going to talk about in a
second we we sold these puzzle cards at
retail and the alternate reality game
tied into the puzzle cards so that's
kind of how we funded it and another
company 42 has released a book like a
team teenagers book called the Cathy's
book and that ties into an alternate
reality game and they it's not that the
book funds the alternate reality game
it's that they're quite sort of tightly
entwined so that's that's another model
and that's what we wanted to do so we we
make money in the moment by selling
these puzzle cards and you can buy them
in packs of 6 and they cost about four
dollars each and each card has a unique
puzzle on them and they range from very
very easy like vittles or su doku or
things like that to extremely hot these
are the extremely hard puzzles here and
and we could have rode the wave of you
know puzzle mania in the UK and in us so
it's a good time for us to launch and we
sell these at places like Amazon and
borders and so on and
on the back of these cards is is a map
of perfect city so this is kind of this
is how we sort of introduced the world
of perfect city we didn't want to just
make positive cars we wanted to make you
know this new world and so if you sort
of piece together all these cards you
get a big big map of purbeck city so I
want to sort of go into a bit more
detail about about these um cards so
each card has a card number there 256
cards so you've got number there then
below the card number versus unique ID
so you kind of scratch off this the
silver panel here at the top and then
you get an ID that is unique to this
particular card and what what this means
is that when you go to when you figured
out the answer to the puzzle then you go
to a website you type in the number and
that tells us you've actually bought the
card instead of just you know scatter
downloaded it from the internet or
something like that you've also got the
difficulty I've represented by the color
of the border which a lot of a lot of
players actually really like knowing how
long the puzzle is supposed to take to
solve so you know we've got the red
puzzles which are very easy the supposed
to be solved in in minutes the silver
puzzles you know you know they're
supposed to take hours or days or even
years in some cases and finally a lot of
cards of these things called rabbit
holes so in the case of this this puzzle
it's an easy one basically you have to
figure out someones phone number based
on a puzzle and a lot of people when
they get the answer they just type it
into a website they get the points and
they leave it at that but if you call
the phone number well it's a real phone
number and you get a message and the
message tells you well I can't answer
the phone at the moment but if you want
to find out more about me you can go to
my weblog at quirk acuity calm and then
so you go to her weblog which also
exists and you can find out more more
her and and her web blog links to other
sites and it also gets updated in real
time so if you come back in a week's
time will have changed and you can
e-mail this person you can email all the
other people on these different websites
it's sort of like a living world and a
lot of people kind of fall down these
rabbit holes just like Alice and you
know enter the world the perplexity and
the point of this world is in season one
was a treasure hunt if you boil it down
really basically the world of perfect
city had a big a great treasure stolen
from them and so I put it somewhere on
earth and if you found it you would win
two hundred thousand dollars and someone
found it about a month ago so so that
was the end of season one but anyway
these positive lead into the deeper
world of perplexity and over the over
the year two years that we round we had
about well over 30 different websites we
do all completely free to access
actually you didn't have to UM by any of
these cards to play the alternate
reality game it's kind of marketing for
us and the websites range from our
weblog these are good ways for us to
tell stories because of you know the the
way they update quite often newspapers
so this is a public to be sent at all
and we updated this twice a week and I
had you know a news of things that
happened in perplexity and you know
through these websites we and these
cards we created the idea of a world a
place that is obsessed with puzzles and
ciphers what perfect City values most is
intelligence and the creation of solving
your puzzles and we then did this for
two reasons one is that this is kind of
like a higher goal of perfect City we
wanted to make being smart cool and we
wanted to make puzzles cool and this is
something that we you know we really
like to achieve but another reason why
we did it is because we wanted an excuse
to put a lot of puzzles in the game and
and it doesn't really make a lot of
sense from from both stories to have a
lot of puzzles but if you've got a world
that's obsessed with puzzles and what
you can put them in anywhere so so that
worked out well for us
and we have a lot of them have a lot of
fake websites I guess you call them and
this is this is one of the websites
called cognitive and this is for a
fictional drug companies that make smart
drugs so they you know you take a pill
and it makes you your memories you know
better or makes your reaction times fast
or makes in a year IQ go up by ten
percent or whatever and they make these
smart drugs in a pill form called
ceratin and we try make these sites as
realistic as possible because a lot of
players like the feeling of authenticity
they like it that it feels real but
sometimes it actually has its downsides
making it very realistic a couple of
weeks ago we're planning a big party to
celebrate the end of season one and the
fact that song they found the cube and
we decided we're going to do this fun
thing we're going to buy some eminence
and print ceratin on one side of the one
side of the pit on one side of the M&amp;amp;M
and you can just go to eminem's website
you can type in you know whatever you
want and they'll they'll make them in a
few days but obviously there's a
screening filter on their website
because you can't just type in swear
words or trademarked words they won't
let you do that but we didn't anticipate
any problems anyway uh the next day we
got a phone call from a man saying well
you know we did a search for ceratin and
there's a website that sells these pills
you know you can't you can't make these
pills because their trademarks so sorry
guys you can't do it so then we had to
explain in about 10 minutes this is not
a real company you know we made this up
this is just fictional you don't really
believe they have these these smart
drugs so so that was not a lot of fun
basically and and it does happen
occasionally we also set up a fictional
book store and we had people publishers
trying to order books from it so we get
a good laugh out of that anyway so
anyway this is that that's basically you
know that's a look at season one and
what I'm going to talk now about now is
how how did we make season one the
project city well anyway
mikandi basically was set up in in early
two thousand four mid-2004 so about that
some of 2004 and we spent about nine
months so from from here to there
planning you know creating all the
puzzle cards creating half of the puzzle
cards and planning the story and the
first thing to say is that the whole
game took over twice as long as we
expected because the cards were very
difficult to print these are non
standard size you know magic cards and
pokemon cards obviously a lot smaller
these are these a six these course
problems for our printers also the fact
that we had on the unique IDs basically
hardly any cards have unique IDs no one
needs but but we did so these things
really added a lot of time to UM the
development process so anyway what
happened was a week we plan for a story
there would be nine months long and
ended up being 21 months which is a big
big increase but anyway when we started
we did have an outline story we had a
series of milestones that we knew had to
happen in the story um for things to
make sense and for us to tell you know
the story we wanted to and despite the
fact that it was you know a year longer
than we expected we're here to the story
pretty well but we had to create a huge
number of side plots and filler material
and if you watch lost you know that
wheatley oh we did even more than that
but but but we try very hard to make it
all consistent unlike unlike those guys
so
so this brings us the question things
also the question of how do we actually
plan the story in detail you know beyond
just these milestones so basically the
story was was planned around the series
of arcs and this is this is kind of an
internal term we use and arcs are
basically analogous to chapters in a
novel so novel is one continuous story
and while you can't read different
chapters in isolation like in episodes
in a TV show they do delineate specific
in particular phases in the story so
that's that's how we did it and over the
over the two years we had 13 different
arcs that lasted anywhere from about one
to four months and the way we we plan
these arcs is that we wanted we
basically resource of what we wanted to
achieve in this particular in this
particular time thing what did we want
the characters to learn what did we want
to reveal what did we want how did we
want the characters to change and at the
same time we also thought in this
particular lock what sort of characters
and story that we want to emphasize was
this going to be a kind of a detective
arc is it going to be a mystery arc is
it going to be a like if you know trying
to find a fugitive that sort of thing
and some arts also varied in terms of
gameplay one of them mace it was all
about live events outside all about sort
of running around at the helicopters or
looking for posters or that sort of
thing other ones of all very you know
puzzle heavy and the way we did it was
using a lot of flowcharts basically we
all map these out in advance using
omnigraffle on a Mac and in the
beginning these arcs were were sort of
kind of complicated and they were
designed to have multiple plot strands
and multiple requirements to move
forward you know you'd have to solve
three different puzzles and you know in
a particular order to go to go forward
but and this was one of the early early
on but as we went along they became a
lot more sort of linear a lot more
straightforward
because well basically you know we
learned a lot we found with these these
are ended up being a lot easier to play
so normally you know when we were
designing these arcs we knew that what
we had to have a certain number of new
websites to reveal because people like
seeing your websites in new content we
had to have some sort of live events
because people you know we have about
50,000 people playing at these live
event to be some focus the attention of
all the players on to one specific
moment and where we can all interact
with the characters and that's that's a
lot of fun for them that is a lot of
work for us so we have to sort of space
them out but much of the story anyway
was was told by websites and web logs
you can kind of see here that there is
no branching arm in the story there's a
lot of kind of talk about user-generated
content and use generators stories and
stuff like that but basically we don't
really believe in it at my candy um we
don't believe in giving there's the
we don't know make a choose your own
adventure novel basically where you can
tell someone should I go of Chad or or
you know or John you know we don't want
to do that sort of thing we think we're
good storytellers and basically we map
out the story and we involve the tears
in that struggle but having said that we
do sort of respond to what the players
do sometimes the players one that when
they're sort of going through the story
they spot holes in it or they like
particular characters a lot more than we
expected and then we'll sort of respond
to that and we'll go in Chains of story
according to that so it's not so much
Claire directed as player influence
story oh it's gone in hello anyway so
yes it is there is sometimes or chamber
story anyway there were no bricks
between the different arcs different
chapters in the story and we're
basically introduction continuously for
two years and that meant that the
websites and the writing and the web and
flash minigames had to go from spec to
live in a matter of a few weeks and this
is kind of very seasoned the pants and
that we didn't do any testing whatsoever
and this caused some problems for us
basically I'm writing of course was also
done in the sponsor player feedback and
this will have to go from spec to live
in a matter of days or hours and
coordinating this with multiple fighters
was really tricky because writers most
writers good writers are not used to
turning around the story that quickly
while also maintaining quality you know
this sort of thing takes time and their
son are not used to it and as a result
you know what we've learned is that
alternate reality game is required very
kind of different skill sets to other
games you know the programmers need to
be able to move a lot faster be able to
mock up things lot fastened prototype
things a lot faster and the writers have
to also do the same so it's more like
working in something like working on
something like Saturday Night Live or a
soap opera
you have to you always have to generate
new stuff that's a constant deadline one
of the things are writers really did
enjoy however was um basically
improvisation or writing when we have
these live events there is no script for
the actors or for anyone like that we
kind of have to invite embed the story
on the fly and there is really no are no
comfortable you know form of fiction
where you were right of write something
and seconds later they can see the
result or seconds later you can see
thousands of people saying wow that was
amazing in it's like crap became
basically for these voices they can't
get nothing it's addictive and they want
to do it all the time and you know it's
just we try and stop them but it's a bit
it's a bit like playing an RPG even if
any of you guys done that it's a bit
like having Dungeon Master all that sort
of thing where you having to react to
the players and invent you storyline or
plot line and it's interesting actually
because we had we have three writers um
being the voice of one person and we use
this thing called subby theatre on a mac
where you can sort of right you have
three people's writing at the same time
on the same document I was watching them
do this and one person be writing
acceptance the other person would be
editing the sentence as it was being
written so connecting all the tigers and
other person be so going over suggesting
edits and it's just I've never seen
anyone like a story like that before and
this sort of the epitome of this was
something called um vakidis revenge
which is a live-action text adventure
the idea behind this was this is
basically a bit of a joke really um we
we wanted to have a bit of fun and we
sort of came up with ideas but in
perfect City they're so smart they
figured out how to do artificial
intelligence and their text adventures
are wrong by artificial intelligences so
unlike in Zork or hitchhikers got the
galaxy where you type you know put spot
on head and all say I don't understand
that this will understand what you do
and of course the way it was powered in
reality was basically odd Vytas
I'm writing the sponsors in real time
and and the players didn't realize this
until a few minutes in and they just
they loved it and you know so the
players would take take turns at the
steering wheel and they've walked the
other players and it was sort of great
to watch you know as well as play mainly
because of the writing and there's a
real fan favorite and we upgraded it for
the sequel but first the first version
was just text we've raided it so that
there's basically a shared whiteboard so
people could you know could draw on it
and you need some of the challenges was
you know going to a house or that sort
of thing and at the end we had a boss
battle well the players had to go and
you know do quickfire drawing and stuff
like that so very severe anyway most of
stuff I've thought about so far as on
the web and that's a good reason for
that it's cheaper and it's a lot quicker
to do when you start throwing in text
messages and phone calls and real life
events the cost really begins to add up
especially with 50,000 players or more
than that around the world of course so
far alternate reality games do not
directly generate revenue so it's hard
to justify spending all that money but
it's still great to do on occasion to do
these elements of the game really good
be on the web and appear in newspapers
or on Billboard's or you know we've
antum fixed cinema trailers in Toronto
so things that really surprise you and
those are kind of it bit easier to
justify because more people will see
them the other thing about live events
and and you know mobile phone calls and
things like that is it even though only
a few hundred people might go to a life
event we did one in San Francisco a few
months ago they provide a lot of blood
carries pleasure for the people who
weren't there because of this particular
event we had a couple of helicopters
buzzing the players and you know when
people heard about that they thought
that's just that sounds a lot of fun
even though they want that so so that's
another kind of reason why we did that
then this other stuff that we we realize
that we could do for free when you have
a project that's very interesting like
perfect city a lot of people approaches
us to to make stuff for them that they
would distribute so so what I mean by
this is it a couple of British
newspapers heard about perplexity and
they said can you make us some puzzles
for our newspaper we'll give you a
couple of pages and you can put whatever
you want in them so we will put some
puzzles and there they get three puzzles
we get free advertising basically one of
the more interesting things that we did
was um when a the UK's biggest
independent radio network contacted us
and they wanted to go and interview one
of our counters live on air so it's like
they could interview and Harry Potter
from Hogwarts I'm so we we got to get we
got an actor one of our writers and they
spoke to to the interviewer and a few
million people around the UK and I hear
that I hear that people really enjoyed
that show although they they didn't
really understand what was going on but
but they did enjoy it we didn't really
push the multi-platform stuff in in
season one as much as we wanted to
mainly because it was expensive and and
it was also technically quite difficult
to do and hard hardened story terms
alternate reality games are very rarely
personalized you know they treat their
entire play bass as if it was just one
person and and you kind of have to do
that the story purposes because if you
only have one story then you can't have
a 50,000 people making different
decisions and trying to pull the string
in different directions you have to
treat them as one big blob but an
interesting byproduct of the lack of
personalization in imperfect city in in
other alternate reality games as it you
produce a very strong community and
they're all watching the same you know
story at the same time and they're all
helping out together
you know it's it's far stronger than us
so popular that sort of thing you know
because we we actually force people in
perfect City to work together and
there's some puzzles and some challenges
that cannot be solved by one person they
require dozens or hundreds or even
thousands of people working together and
that really pulls pulls the community
together so I'm going to give a few sort
of she slides about about some of the
things the community did and one of the
things as a wiki now this is is not as
Noble as it used to be but um on the
wiki they're about they made in
encyclopedia about the game with every
sort of piece of information in the
story so it's good and editors who knows
it's a reasonably big with you for
something like this but the interesting
thing is they put up content so fast and
they put it up in so much detail the
better than our own internal resources
you know if the wiki goes down we're in
trouble because we can't remember what
do we actually did so I'm certain seeds
so they save us a lot of time making
this thing also they did a Google Maps
mashup of all the maps they scanned in
the back of the cards and they put them
together and they labeled them so it's
got all these different sort of
searchable points on it and again this
is better than anything we have
internally so so we use this as well
except it's kind of slow so it gets kind
of frustrating and it's fully searchable
600 locations it's really nice really
nice thing that they did this is an
example of one of the really hard
puzzles that we made for them we we made
a card called the 30 flavor and it's
basically an RC 5 encrypted message and
and when they got the card they thought
oh you know what's us about I'll be
really supposed to practice because if
so this would take ages taking of
thousands of years for one committee to
do it and after a little while they
realized well this is how we're supposed
to do it so they went and distributed
computing client and about several
thousand people got together to well
over thousand people got together to try
and crack this possible and they're
still working in it
so far six hundred clients it's probably
four million hours now actually they
made a mistake when they did it the
first time round so they have to do it
again now but they're still going strong
so that's really cool and there's also I
talked a bit about user-generated
content before and the fact that you
know in most cases we don't like it but
sometimes it works out really well
there's a particular part in the story
where you had we had a character and she
had to get inside and lively to retrieve
a rare manuscript and she could only get
in a library if she was a published
author or she was a proper researcher so
a lot of the players got together me
they were thinking well how are we going
to get in are we going to hack in are we
going to try and do some social
engineering how we going to convince you
know these people to let her in and a
group of players thought well if all it
takes to get her in is for her to become
a published author what are we just go
invite a book for her publish it and put
it on her neck so I space of about two
weeks i won't wrote a book and published
it on Lulu and you can buy it it's are
the voting reads like it was done in two
weeks but it's got a really nice cover
and and and they had a lot of fun doing
it and if at the entire community have a
lot of fun you know being involved in it
and that that was a real moment to the
community when they realize they could
actually do something like that and that
this was part of the game writing a book
is part of a game and that's how you can
solve a challenge and then there are the
sort of cases where we where we
incorporate user-generated content like
people can write into our newspaper and
that sort of thing but this is one of
the most interesting things so the way
the demographics for I'm going to go
into a bunch of statistics now on the
average age is 26 it's quite broad
there's a big peak here because
technically you're not allowed to play
unless you were 13 so
but but you know it is actually a family
friendly game we don't really do a lot
of swearing and there's a fifty-fifty
gender split as far as we can tell which
is unusual for this sort of thing for
online games of the video games and a
lot of theories about this you know I
think it's because of the story and I
think it's because of the way you
interact of the game it's not a twitch
based game because a lot of thought and
speculation and you know a lot of social
interaction on demographics geographical
split this has changed a bit actually I
think they're probably more players in
the United States and in the UK at the
moment but basically we're talking about
the english-speaking world thus the
usual suspects like Germany of fats and
Japan on the global niche of the game is
difficult for us because we're based in
the UK and if we're going to do online
live events we have to make sure that
pretty much everyone's awake which means
that we have to do the games quite late
in the evening so that so that the west
coast eight hours behind is is still up
and we've also had to hold them live
events around the world so we've done
them in New York and London and San
Francisco but it's it's tough for us to
do because we're not go about 20 people
in the company 25 people in the company
and in the about six of those really
work on the arg full time you're doing
the writing it so it's a real strain
56-55 thousand registered users 850,000
cards all blah blah blah um some of the
more interesting things about half a
million words of story could be
investing over the two years it's about
well over five books fifteen thousand
emails sent into ingame characters by
the plants which is quite quite fun
anyway that's season one and that took
about two years to go from the start to
finish and we had a lot of fun doing it
I think a lot of people enjoyed playing
it but it was towards the end it was a
bit of a frustrating experience for us
because we kind of just wanted it to
finish um because we're a bit tired but
also because um we couldn't finish the
game until the treasure got found and
that was kind of we could you can't
really force that and towards the end
we're realizing there's some there's
some real problems with the design of
the game and we wanted to fix them but
we couldn't do it halfway see season one
so now that season one is over we've
started thinking a lot about what we
want to change so here's his kind of a
list of things we wanted to change
firstly um it is hidden basically of the
thoughts that people had at the end of
season one the players thought is very
it was hard to understand the concept of
alternate reality games how do you play
an alternate reality game and what are
the cards got to do it you know do i
need to buy these cards are there you
know i like lose on these causes are
strewing these cards how does it work
there's also hard to start playing and
continue playing because the story was
live that lasted for two years unless
you began thing at the start of the game
we spend a lot of time reading up on
what happened before is really quite it
was quite difficult to actually join
halfway through I know what was going on
and be able to contribute a lot we tried
a lot to make it easy for people to join
using things like story so far and
walkthroughs and stuff but there's only
so much you can do and it's a bit like
trying to join lost now without being
able to watch the previous episodes it's
basically very difficult to do I mean
you can watch individual episodes and
you know you might get a bit of
entertainment out of it but it's hard to
see what's going on and it's also hard
to continue playing now so you take a
whole day for two months or a month or a
few weeks or whatever you come back you
know it's difficult to catch up so so
those are the things we want to the
ground
from from our point of view as
developers making a game for two years
continuously it's very difficult we
don't I do that again because you know
people have nervous breakdowns and stuff
of that that's that's expensive um doing
one continuous long story for two years
means you can't get a good variety um
you you know it's hard to sort of change
the mode gameplay it's hard to change
you know the stories that you can tell
and also we didn't really use the
multi-platform features of a ID as much
as we wanted to we want to do more phone
calls more text messages more things
that bring you out from you know in
front of your computer and basically
that there were three solutions that we
came up with firstly we wanted to make
the game episodic so this is what so
this is what we do a season two sorry
we're going to make the game episodic so
instead of having one long two-year
story we're having episodes that will
last for you know about two weeks to two
months but more more like to two weeks
to four weeks or so on and that's a lot
easier for players to follow allows us
to plan a lot better you know around
sort of discrete chunks of story it
allows us to I'm very the gameplay and
various stories law for the second thing
we want to do is season two is make it a
lot more personalized we want to try and
tell the things awards individual this
obviously doesn't work in live episodes
of the reason I mentioned before because
you can't have fifty thousand stories
going on at the same time so what we're
doing with the third feature of season
two is making it making many of the
episodes be playable so basically that
this is a real innovation of season two
and beyond beyond episodic and
personalization and it requires sort of
killing off one of the sacred cows of
alternate reality games and that is the
game should always be as real as
possible and if you make a V playable
game and admit that it's a game then
obviously it's not as real as it used to
be but personally I think that's kind of
a bit overrated
making this sort of very convincing hoax
is not the reason why people play the
game people pay because of because they
enjoy the story and a good arm a good
example is lonely go so lonely girl when
it first launched has got millions and
millions of views mainly because I think
a lot of people wondering is this real
is it really a girl in California
wherever whose parents are Satanists and
you know is this real we want to go find
out you know who she is and who's making
this thing so that was kind of
entertaining as a game but if you look
at it now lonely girl is still actually
running on bever and most episodes of
the video that we put out and get about
10,000 or 20,000 views which is really
not a lot actually and and the reason
for that is because the most important
thing about making these games is having
a good story and making it realistic is
not not really the most important thing
so now that's why we go we terrible
another reason is because by doing a
live game that you can't be played
you're wasting huge amounts of content
you know that 50,000 was five hundred
thousand words that we we've listened
it's basically it's kind of almost gone
can't be deflated it again and that's as
a real shame for us so I'm people have
actually tried doing the player ball
games before a majestic was kind of V
terrible and so was a game by the BBC
called Jamie cane and and they didn't
really work that well actually um and
this we studied them quite thirsty to
figure out why why these replayable
alternate reality games didn't work very
well and became over two reasons firstly
it was too hard to stop playing these
games it's hard to start playing perfect
city but was also quite difficult to
stop playing these games you had to
click through about seven pages of
explanation and sign up to actually stop
think and by that time you kind of given
up
and we've decided with perfect City when
you stop thing you're going to have
you're only going to spend 10 seconds
signing up and only one click and then
you're going to start playing the game
so we don't spend a lot of time
explaining to people what an alternate
reality game is we just want to get the
plane the second reason which is really
weird is a replayable alternate reality
games have always limited the amount of
time you can actually play per day so if
you play majestic or played this BBC
game you only allowed to play 30 minutes
a day if you if you you know you
couldn't go beyond that so if you happen
to have like an evening free and you
want to go through the entire story you
could it just stopped you on that day
which is just really with you know if
you're really into story you don't need
to stop you don't care if it's not
realistic you just want to keep on
playing and I think people you know
needs of it you know that they're not
use this sort of behavior they won't
content now and they want to keep on
playing it even if it's not realistic so
in our game we've decided even though
the game story might take place over
four days we're going to play those four
days in the space of you know four hours
or four months whatever way you want so
on so that's basically you know those
four things so season two is something
that we've been thinking about for the
last six months and what what we think
is that it will solve the problem that
we have a season one where a lot of
people would come up to us and say
public city that sounds really cool but
it was too difficult to get into and
it's too difficult to stop playing and I
don't have enough time you know people
say this about a lot of games I don't
have time to play water Warcraft that's
what I think what we want to do is
create a new type of story they can
really affect people and really
really reach them in different ways so
instead of just being on a printed page
or on the screen it's something that
that you can interact above using all
the tools that use every day now people
growing up the day they don't just read
books or you know watch TV or go on the
internet in isolation they do all these
things at the same time there Dyl i am
i'm sure that this is the case with all
of you actually you know you're doing I
am you've got your laptop up and you
know you've got the TV on you've got the
radio on all these different things what
you want to do is make a game that binds
together all these different media and
uses each each platform strength as part
of the game and I think we've season two
well we've got some good ideas it's
going to launch in April this is the
first time we've actually talked in
detail about about what we're doing a
season two we're basically going to the
first episode is going to launch in
April and well we're going to see what
happens I don't know how but it's
basically going to be exciting see so
thank you and if you want to learn any
more than I'm going to be here happy to
take questions and there are more
resources available online and we also
have a bunch of stuff to give away and
we've got those M&amp;amp;MS that have the
certain on so you can eat these
trademark things
season one ended which mention it is
these people still trying to crack that
code is that just for personal
satisfaction or virus the lab I've not
just the personal satisfaction it didn't
even have anything to do the story all
you get some points that don't get you
anything I think you know you set up
these challenges and people just enjoy
doing that less there's another there to
other cards so really difficult but
haven't been solved one is a violent
hypothesis which we put on a card as a
joke because we could say there's a 1
million dollar prize the other card was
this thing called I'm billion to one and
basically had this this guy's face on it
and I had some Japanese writing down the
side and it said find me so that's all
you have and and this is one person six
billion people and the point of the card
is to go find this person so it's kind
of a practical you know experiment in
six degrees of separation and they've
been going at it for two years they know
it's got nothing to do the struggling we
told them this it's just it's just a
game and they've been on ABC News they
being on all these different places try
you know holding up this guy's photo you
know we took a photo of him actually um
in this place in France and it basically
he he's Japanese but he was in this
place in France and within about few
months they look at the space in France
and I can believe it it's just as
nondescript you know location and they
sort of compared these different photos
and they found it so I don't know
whether they find this guy you know
maybe he's going to grow old and they
weren't you know be able to
you down or something but but when they
do I think that's going to be it's going
to be a lot of fun you learned about
your players are they like hard for
their ball games are two different these
dummies to play console games games no
other games then we'll mix basically
most of the ballplayers had not played
alternate reality games before because
they would gone into it through the
puzzle pants a lot of the people who
played the first alternate reality games
like the beasts and like I love bees a
lot of them did didn't stop playing
perfect city because firstly was made in
the UK and and we weren't able to
supplicate its new us Orleans as they
were used to and also we were one of the
first games offer big prize in to sell
stuff and I think a lot of people didn't
like that now most people that don't
really care about it now and it's fine
but um but the hardcore aig audience is
very demanding I think and that's good
because you know they demanded you know
you make good games but um the people
who we have thing you know they range
from you know surfing near old people
who love the puzzles to you know six
year old grandmother's who you know who
love the fact that you know they can
interact the story and you know they've
learned a lot how to use these um you
know they can play other kids when I
when we do the event in San Francisco a
few months ago there's vide fascinating
because i saw this family three
generations the kids the parents and the
grandparents all working together and
you know i don't know many games where
people really do that maybe the nintendo
wii maybe you know when you got to watch
a sports game but other than that i'm
not so sure so that's a real really
interesting thing for us
expected runtime interact with your
business bottle the high barrier to
entry it seems that serve you into
revenue around the set of cards and meet
lines of running
you're going what's one set of car
stopped getting money that we're getting
a new players
yeah didn't work out so what no but we
got a lot of funding that's good it it
was an experiment I think and the main
reason the sort of two main reasons was
because the car took so long to train
and and they're difficult to make and
also that we underestimated the
difficulty making the content on the
cards you know making making 256 really
good puzzles and doing the artwork for
them that's not easy and making them
tied together and also the tech back end
you know you have them to coordinate all
these different things together so
anyway we're season two actually we have
a code we're separating the cards and
the alternate reality game before
they're very closely entwined and sort
of new parts of the alternate reality
game would start when a new wave of cars
was released and we're not doing that
anymore the cards our own entity and
they kind of fund themselves the
alternate reality game on what we are
looking at is a sponsorship of different
episodes so we're kind of coming back to
that now but it's within the world of
perfect City and we're also looking at
well you know I think if we get the
numbers up something like paper play
half life 2 is selling episodes of
content I'm sorry max is having episodes
of content you know people are getting
used to the idea of buying episodes of
stuff off the internet you know like
movies and that TV shows I i did i'd
love to see the numbers on those things
so i don't know what are they making any
money or not but but i think that would
be kind of the purest way of funding it
for me I've always thought that you know
things I buff in and Firefly it's a real
shame they got cancelled because of you
know the evil Fox but on but you know if
you can get people
paint them directly them that could be
interesting but as a sponsorship thing
that's that's really interesting for
brands people always want perfect City
to to feature coca-cola war or not gear
or whatever so if we can get their money
that's that's nice cool well thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
