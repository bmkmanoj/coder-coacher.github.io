welcome the Google thank you all for
coming my name is Peter Norvig on
director of research at Google and I'm
going to start off by giving a little
introduction to sort of state of the art
of AI at Google and maybe a little bit
in the world at large then we're going
to have five very short talks from
specific technologies from these fine
researchers in the front row and then
we're going to get back to the important
stuff of talking and drinking so let's
just get started right away
our leaders survived been supportive of
AI from the beginning Sergei said in the
future search engine should be as useful
as hell movie 2001 Space Odyssey but
hopefully they won't kill something
because driving forever since Larry is
the serious rather than funny one then
he said the ultimate search engine will
understand everything in the world so
that's our small goal we can be composed
that down into other goals but first
let's talk about what's at stake and so
this is a summary that I've made of a
talk by al barian or chief economist
where he talked about the value of
Google through the world's economy and
you can break it down to there's a value
to advertisers we take in about 30
billion dollars a year and we've
computed that the average advertised
would get about seven times that value
there's a values to the searchers which
is really hard to figure out sometimes
it's really important to do that search
that you figure out what symptoms you
have and you save your life and
sometimes it's cute kitten pictures and
what's the value of that but it's some
number of billions with large error bars
and then there's the value to websites
who use our ads and get some money and
some value through that and and get
traffic to us from for free and so the
bottom line is that the activity that's
mediated by Google and we don't want to
claim all of this because we're taking
credit here for when we connect you to a
website and you get some value from that
we're counting that in this in this
calculation and of course that's not all
us a lot of that is because the website
is out there but somewhere around a
percent
if you were generous to maybe two
percent of the gdp or come to the world
so it's a big responsibility and if we
can do a little bit better than
improving that it has a big impact on
the book a lot of what we do to make
this improvement is done through AI
technology so that's what's at stake now
is now a particularly advantageous time
to be addressing a guy I get asked this
a lot and you know there are people out
there that want to make predictions as
to the exact decade in which we have
intelligent machines that are going to
take over the world and so I try to
figure out is that going to happen now
and about three signs that now or the
next 10 20 30 years or whatever is the
right time and so the research I did is
I went on to google scholar I restricted
to computer science and I search for the
term artificial intelligence and for the
term unlike previous and then i looked
at the following phrases that I want to
see over time what's the new technology
that's unlike previous technology that
means that right now is the time where
you know in the old day hand know what
we're doing but now we've got the answer
and this is what I've come up with for
various publication dates and i gotta
say that that's not leading me to any
conclusions I can't say that oh you know
back in the team that I need to be the
member doing but now we've got the
answer it just doesn't look that way and
you see learning from example shows up
sort of every decade or so unlike three
video systems we now learn from examples
but I guess we didn't learn enough from
examples because beginning so my
conclusion is we're making steady
progress but I can't predict when the AI
takeover is going to occur from this
data okay and what about at Google no
you can read that but this is a random
blackboard and Joel suppose he reported
that he was talking to a new googler who
said yeah the difference is that unlike
there are from her employer who will use
a bayesian filtering the way they use
the ax statement this is a random
blackboard with a formula here and up on
the right it says all your base are
belong to us and you don't have to look
hard I didn't have to search all over
the campus to find a blackboard that was
covered with these kinds of simple so
they're everywhere so so that part I
think it's true and AI technology at
least to the extent of understanding
probability theory and understanding how
to maximize and understanding of what
basis of rule is and is everywhere
throughout the company a while ago we
introduced a new internal code search
mechanisms right so everybody's got grep
over their code base but we're google so
we do things on steroids and one of our
engineers came up with a cool note tool
to search over our code base and I
search for the term naive Bayes and I
forget the number of hits but it was
somewhere up in the hundred so scattered
throughout the code it was fun looking
in the comments because you'd see things
like well I'm throwing in this naive
Bayes now but I got
come back and fix that up with something
better later would be from 2006 okay and
I think what that says is that when you
have enough data sometimes you don't
have to be too clever about coming up
with the best algorithm but it is
awareness that there is this capability
to learn from data and there's this
capability to at least think about other
algorithms I read throughout the company
what is it that makes Google unique and
a word that makes us have this
capability to think about these problems
and I'm going to touch on three things
so the first is we got a lot of data
here's an example of some of the data we
publish the Ngram corpus is available
through them and was dictated to them so
we went through a trillion words of
English published all the statistics on
it so so you can use it and we do
complicated things like empirically
based bayesian maximum-likelihood
discriminant optimization models yeah I
don't know what that means you can fall
back on everything I needed to know
elaborate Sesame Street basically while
we doing this all right reserved a lot
of data i counted and yeah you have to
have some model to do smoothing and then
when the count get 20 but basically
we're just counting stop looking it up
ok so that was no number one is a data
and sesame street number two is working
at scale and I wanted to define the term
internet scale and my colleague Luis
Barroso as a way of talking about this
which he says that the data center scale
is when you get a bill for a hundred
thousand dollars to buy petabyte of
storage and you say I am man that's a
big investment but then Google is
operating at the warehouse scale and
there you see our warehouse in the
dalles oregon filled with us and we're
how scale means that you get a page in
the middle of the night that says
warning emergency there's only a
petabyte of free space class
so that's what Louisa in this
presentation I talked to some of the sre
engineers and they said he never run
down to only a petabyte that could never
happen then the third opportunity is the
opportunity to do control and here we
see Norbert Wiener that is desk and MIT
and I think that this is the difference
that are really just distinguishes that
it's not just that there's data out
there that we're observing is that we
contain Iraq with the world we get to do
experiments and say if we take this
intervention how is that going to change
and so we can do things like
experimentation and these are slides
stolen from Ronnie kabhi who talks about
this ability to do experimentation me to
decide what's working and his point is
though is that no matter how clever you
think you are you're usually wrong and
you can do an experiment instead so we
can be contest that here's to dialog
boxes to for a find a house website and
the idea is which one's going to get
more clicks so raise your right hand may
is going to get more clicks than the
left hand if you think these and don't
raise your hand if you think they're
about the same work you try and answer
okay and the answer is a was
eight-point-five percent better much
about the same or not next one here's to
sign up boxes for buying office online
right hand if you think a is better that
for be people aren't sure okay and turns
out eight with such great friends and so
the point is that you can't trust your
intuition so you got to go out and do
those experiments and the point is that
it's easy to do those experiments that
they're only a click away and we can set
these up but we're going to gather real
deep and we can change the world what
else can you do to do with this data to
interact the world will we have a big
effort in data analytics and sort of
visualization of this data presented
information in a way that your customers
who maybe are not experts in may I of
statistics and make sense of his efforts
in communication enjoyed a fruity stock
so I through getting up there in the
upper left working on Watson we have
re-park question answering company we
deal with filtering emails and spam and
so
and handling information overload and
then all these efforts far-field so
speech recognition that you'll you'll
hear about how to build these mobile
interfaces how to understand how to
interact with a mobile interface the
self-driving cars the route finding
mechanism you know so the first thing I
learned in my first day I class was ki
search out a star search algorithm we
have to do that kind of thing but we
have to do it much faster than was ever
done before and we do that by figuring
out how to pre cash and so on so lots
about applications throughout another
application the one that I'm currently
thinking about a lot is in terms of
Education and then I also think of it in
terms of motivation now google has
always been an information company we
think about how do we deliver
information to the user I think
motivation is also important how do you
get users excited about wanting to learn
and the education market is under 20
billion dollars in the US elearning his
50 billion dollar market and they've
been many approaches MIT the campus has
10,000 students but unless he the open
courseware initiative has had 70 million
students either courseware Khan Academy
as 35,000 students a day mr. Bastian run
and I put up a course at Stanford and
we're
at just about 50,000 students now signed
up for that class so a lot of different
experiments nobody knows yet what works
and what doesn't opportunity for AI in
terms of the data analytics and in terms
of the understanding of human computer
interaction to do education to use just
some examples of the Khan Academy of our
course the MIT OpenCourseWare the amazon
kindle has been that where you can
highlight passages which is useful to
you as a kindle user for yourself and
you can also elect to share those
passages and that's useful to everybody
because they can see what those arrest
the world think is important and so the
most highlighted passage of all time
it's truth universally acknowledged that
a single man and possession possession
of in one of our case of Jane Austen of
course she gets a big advantage that her
book is out of copyrights and they're
more free so it's a lot easier to
highlight something that's free and also
because she had a good opening line so
you only had to get for the first page
okay so that's all the examples wanted
to go through and now we get to the
morals Albert Einstein says we can make
everything as simple as possible but not
simpler I think that's a good moral and
we see time and time again how we have
opportunities to do complicated
algorithms but we do better by just
gathering the right data and applying
the simplest possible thing you can to
it George box and statistician said all
models are wrong but some are useful
and so we don't worry too much about the
science of choosing something that's
exactly right many more as an
engineering effort and if it works then
go with that and finally land and
streetcars there always depended on the
kindness of strangers so we can't do it
by ourselves and we rely on data that's
out there that's being entered by other
people so authors are writing pages
webmasters are making lengths to
tweeters are tweeting and we gather up
all that information so that we don't
have to do it ourselves okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
