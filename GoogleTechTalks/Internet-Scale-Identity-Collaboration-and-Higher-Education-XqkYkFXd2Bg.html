two individuals were invited by Mike
Jones they're going to talk to us today
about Internet scale identity
collaboration and higher education and
they will be covering some of the their
experiences on this for the next 40
minutes and then afterwards we'll give
some time to you for QA so like to
welcome Bob and kin well all right let's
see just a little bit of background
about two we are who we are and where
we're from well my computer crashes well
let's see we are from an organization
called Internet to that is a consortium
of a whole lot of universities to it in
50 or so essentially all the big
universities in the u.s. membership
organization also has a lot of corporate
and other kind of partner members among
which are is google so too does a whole
lot of different things the main thing
that it does is that it's known for is
high speed networking and research in
advance uses of high speed networking so
it's running you know multi-gigabit
SuperDuper you know lambda division blah
blah blah networks all around the
country peering with with things around
the world can and I are not from that
part of internet too we are from
something called the internet to
middleware initiative which is working
on promoting identity and access
management best practices and new
approaches and research and cool stuff
for all those universities and lots of
partners around the world so that has
focused on a number of different things
we've had a pki and they should do like
everybody has had to have a website on
don't want to work with sam'l we'll be
talking a lot about that in Federation
directories all kinds of stuff so where
we are
here again at Mike's invitation we got
involved with with Mike Jones sorry
around the use of sam'l and they are
shibboleths software for federated
access to Google Apps for Education
which is obviously a big interest for
those of us in higher ed that led among
other things to Google being a sponsor
financial sponsor of the Shibboleth
software project that's our main
internet to middleware software project
and so we're appreciative of that so
Mike to suggested that we might come
here and talk about this stuff because
people are interested in authentication
authorization where it's going certainly
were extremely interested in in
following up and having conversations or
even you know joint projects or whatever
that might turn into that's what we're
supposed to do it internet2 is promote
that kind of thing so with no further
ado a bunch of things Federation has
been a big deal for us for a long time
so a lot of what we're talking about is
where we're at with actual reasonably
high security Federation among a lot of
parties in this country and around the
world and how our ship stuff fits into
that a bit about user centric stuff
because you know it's it's all the rage
and even though somebody said it should
be banned from from use and banned from
talks here it is I'll be offering you
know inflammatory opinions on things
like info card and open ID will be
talking some about how that how that
relates to what we do at higher ed and
then shifting slightly some work that
we're doing on support of collaboration
and how that's done how we envision that
to be done and what the requirements are
for supporting access control for
collaborations across a huge spectrum of
stuff that we do in high red and how
that relates to group and privilege
management in particular so in an ad
identity I think I'm told that that
people here are pretty savvy with this
stuff
who can name all seven of Kim Cameron's
laws of identity nobody oh come on so
perhaps people have been exposed to that
I think this this stuff is is pretty
common across a lot of people looking at
at this you know people want to want to
sign on lass you know no fewer usernames
and passwords across all those darn
websites you know across all those blogs
that you want to leave comments on it's
the hot thing these days privacy is a
big deal for us and we think in in the
world in general you know just because
you want to be able to sign on to lots
of things doesn't mean that you that all
those things should be able to to
correlate all your activities and track
everything about you all the time and so
we want to build an infrastructure that
supports people's interest in in that
kind of disconnection there's a as we as
we institutionally in a lot of a lot of
what what we do and we're talking about
here is from an institutional
perspective we're representing the
interests of our you know 200 top end
universities and more broadly higher
education and research in general these
are you know substantial enterprises
with enterprise interests but also
interest in supporting collaboration in
the world so to do that stuff we can't
just have a one-size-fits-all identity
scheme when we have we know if we're
dealing with alumni and you know we
support a hundred thousand alumni at my
university there there you know the ways
of dealing with them and their
identities is going to be different than
our financial officers or our medical
researchers or anything else so we need
a range ease of ease of deployment ease
of use stuff has to be able to get out
there in order to be useful so a
entirely too simplistic slide about
about dividing the world into federated
and user centric sort of based on you
know what's what's actually happening
out there in the world today like you
say we'll be talking a lot about what we
mean by by the federated space yeah yeah
in broad terms Federation typically
means taking advantage of some sort of
large organizational identity management
system and being able to extend it out
to work with partners outside the
enterprise the often that just means the
ability to sign on we've put a lot of
effort into going beyond that to
actually send user attributes we have
all kinds of important elements and
business processes that can be enabled
by that and we'll be talking more about
that again you know if you're talking
about it organization dealing off and
contractually with another organization
then you know off often this will be
associated with the contract or or some
other kind of arrangement and you want
to make sure that you're doing the right
thing with your institutional policies
so this stuff can be difficult to get
arranged there's a whole user centric
world people are no doubt familiar with
you know open ID is kind of the hot
topic these days you know just set it up
beamer be promiscuous uh you know it's
you know what we want is is for people
to insert their own their own identities
not necessarily beat up tied to
organization so those cases are things
will be going into more and they're both
growing right even though you know you
know some people would like to say that
that sandal is dead and other things
that you know what we see and in our
environment for our purposes and the
communities we serve that stuff is
growing big time so and I will and I
will zoom through here again making the
point that the Federation's now change
changes meeting slightly the word
Federation here Federation's as we have
come to use them in research and higher
ed are not sort of bilateral as they as
they almost always are in the corporate
world where you set up a range
arrangement with some kind of outsourced
supplier and that's it we are are
forming and growing multilateral
Federation
we'll be giving more information about
that in a bit that serve a whole
community right creating a community
around not just the identity providers
as we are acting as big universities but
also the service providers that are out
there that are consuming that stuff are
also part of our community we're forming
that stuff together and developing the
arrangements which again are often you
know or obliged to be contractual you
know fying the responsibilities of the
parties in order to build those those
things alright so a bit about ship
software project that has been going on
for six or seven years now just released
2 point 0 beta today after a entirely
too long gestation period widely
deployed we are you know mumbling about
maybe a thousand sites or more at this
point around the world using using ship
open sam'l is the library component
there that implements animal has been
adopted we believe you know under under
the apache license by a lot of other
open source and commercial products for
doing sam'l stuff she we have been
focusing on getting to the same old to
play no specification the main the main
Shibboleth the architect Scott Cantor
was also the main author of the sam'l to
point out at knows it very well so we we
believe will be delivering a a pretty
good implementation and again there are
lots of ways to do sam'l any particular
implementation might support some and we
think that ours will do a lot of those
and be able to provide a lot of glue for
a lot of people one bullet point there
is that that we are seeing the
beginnings of support service business
because enough people are deploying it
that they are prepared to pay money to
folks to to make it happen so that's a
good thing happy to do more that so
Federation's as I was describing are
happening
it's a fascinating thing that they have
that while we've been pretty successful
at growing stuff here in the US
internationally they have been have been
growing even more and see let me mostly
skip over this one Federation's when we
are trying to build more multilateral
Federation's a technical level have to
agree on all these things so part of
what we do as as the in common
federation and let me just skip to that
right now I'm going to show Internet to
DD you is the organization i was
describing using common federation page
this is again serving it's a operated by
internet to on behalf of higher
education in the US and our partners so
has a whole lot of participants again
you know there are three thousand height
institutions in the US and our market is
all of them so 44 is better than one
percent but we think we've got the many
of the most important ones big schools
to carry a lot of weight with with their
peers and with vendors so these are all
places that have done all the legal work
and setup work to technical setup work
to participate in the Federation any of
them is able to to sign on without
further ado to any of these resources
out here again developing more of those
all the time and if you care about our
policies and practices there they are
etc okay Oh me change that now so the
Federation then part of what we do there
is make sure all that stuff happens
basically solving that for
the entire community once it rather than
each of them having to do that
separately with each of the each of the
places that they want to federated
policies are a big deal in this stuff a
few as people you should know if you've
ever got into this you know the tech
copart takes a while and then you hand
it to the policy people and they take a
really long time so a lot of what we do
is to try and create a framework for for
what the policy should be among
organizations a lot of that is knowing
what not to set policy on what to leave
to to contractual arrangements that
might be arranged between between
members separately from the Federation
itself building on it some of this
involves standardizing attributes we had
done a lot of work prior to farming in
common on a standard vocabulary to cover
basic elements of what we thought would
be interesting about people entries
between inter-organizational E and
higher ed and that was able to be
applied directly once we were able to
use Samuel to do that and then it's
called AG person so that's been widely
adopted both in the in the US and and
internationally levels of assurance is
another big deal again I mentioned the
notion that that one level one you know
sort of level of risk management and and
cost applied to the assurance applied to
users doesn't cut it so we in particular
have been driven to do stuff in that
area by our work with the US federal
government which cares a lot about
levels of assurance and defined for
standard levels that have become widely
used across the it is a you know from
some points of view they carry it care a
lot more about it and is good for them
but they are the government so they tend
to care so that is another emerging
element of what's going on
our Federation agreements okay so here
is a a slide of showing growth and
adoption in a particular National
Federation hi red Federation in
Switzerland run by the national Swiss
research and education network support
organization switch essentially showing
from 2004 to 2006 more or less complete
coverage in the higher education space
there this is something that is has been
pretty straight forward for the european
national research and education support
organizations to accomplish because of
their you know their their national
support structure for those activities
it's much easier for them to say we're
going to do this and and get that
contact level of coverage we don't have
that kind of national level of support
here in the US for better for worse so
we are invited to to gloat to grow by
persuasion rather than by by a
government mandate but I there are
deployments in in all those countries
listed there and they take different
shapes they're all they're not all using
the same kind of software the Norwegian
one for example using the the Sun
product in a centralized deployment not
doing it in a sort of her campus
distributed federated fashion like we
are here in the US but they're able to
participate internationally with a
number of providers and what do we what
are we doing with that stuff a lot of
different things one of the focuses
initially was access to two licensed
library content so big providers like
elsevier and their science direct comm
site that essentially everybody licenses
there's a lot of access problems around
that stuff that aren't met by the the IP
address method that is typically used
today Federation offers a good way to do
that those providers have been pretty
good about jumping on the
still a ways to go with that stuff but
the big the biggest international use
cases for or federated access have been
those those providers but there's a lot
of others too you know the music
services that have come and maybe gone
now a Napster etc serving campuses have
been a big big use case other just
service providers in the high red sector
homework handling plagiarism checking
service career references all kinds of
things that are serving our market that
we're Federation applies google apps for
education in fact is one of those and we
have been working on matt coming on
enjoying the Federation for a while now
and i think we are we are nearing
completion on that one one of these one
of these weeks here soon okay so i
showed the in common sight here's a
little bit more about it again just
serving the US we've found it useful to
to have these Federation's be nationally
based again a lot of the things with
just you know dealing with with policies
privacy policies in particular and and
making contracts are much easier if
you're if you're dealing with it
nationally although of course there are
lots of lots of international use cases
even with the u.s. university there is
you know governing body it's a
reel-to-reel activity with lots of
administrative help and lawyers and all
those things to keep it going sports
staff etc again we are estimating coming
near two million users counting everyone
available from all those all those
universities again all able to do strong
at the reasonably strong authentication
across the system to all those providers
a significant one that is coming on soon
also is the National Institute of Health
with a number of different applications
that national library of medicine etc
that are important to higher ed again
that involve dealing with quite a bit of
federal government policy in order to
get on h2 to sign up but they're very
excited and are leading the way in fact
with with a number of other agencies
that were interested in so we're excited
about that another another member that
will be joining soon as our good friends
at Microsoft who have a an application
in software distribution that we think
will be pretty popular so it's a it's
it's definitely getting their shelter
wiki the wiki okay it just might be the
time to show the wiki our sort of most
visible a highly federated application
is our instance of confluence wiki which
has been Federation enabled at internet
too so again just just another just
another confluence but when i go to
login if all works well if the demo gods
are on my side then i am presented with
you know the the bane of Federation
which is selecting my identity provider
where I'm from so note that this
particular application is a member of a
bunch of different Federation's in the
US UK Australia Sweden etc so if I just
want the ones in the US
and there's the list and I happen to be
from University of Washington so I'll
select
and now I'm presented with my my friend
familiar University of Washington
sign-on page at least I hope it is i
hope i'm not being fished i'm sure i
wouldn't be so i won't well what the
hell let me as well so
back and I'm signed on notable that this
site has about four hundred users again
I'll federated about forty percent of
them are actually from and identity
provider that is a really interesting
thing here it is called protect network
that is an open identity provider
anybody can sign up get an ID there so
it's really useful as we collaborate if
we say if you're from a federation
member that's great if you're not go and
get one here right it's open no problem
it's about forty percent of users are in
fact from this one they had sixty
percent from from a real federation
member again about about two-thirds of
those I think in the US and the other
third international from all over the
place go back if you go back to the
dashboard for a second i noticed that
Jeff Hodges had been using his a Jeff
was at verisign actually at Neustadt new
start yeah I don't know anybody know
Jeff Hodges he's a he there must have
been a interested in our chef
announcement okay so I think in the
interests of I'm well maybe just to
mention the I've talked about some of
the guy seizing the LA thing levels if
you're is a big deal in said in the
Federation space now how do you you know
given that that a participating site
might be you know any kind of site you
know we have a bunch of universities and
maybe universities are all pretty good
and we all do regularly the same kind of
things but there's protect network what
kind of place is a you know my at my
university we have we have all kinds of
ID's we have my ID that's you know
pretty well secure
and we know that there really is about
Morgan and that really is his ID and he
really is a staff member etc we also had
lots of ideas that are handed out
randomly for wireless access or whatever
around the campus you know so it's
important to us as running I identity
management in our inside our site to be
able to distinguish those somehow for
application consumption purposes the
Federation aspect of this has helped to
structure that partly because of the our
good friends at the federal government
providing this number dello a structure
so in common it will be defining those
terms for itself shortly and having some
kind of certification program and I
quite your help for sites to to become
accredited at one of those levels for
particular elements of their community
and we we think that will enable a lot
of applications that care about higher
insurance medical records in particular
is a big is a big thing and things going
on at the federal government grant
management etc you want to shoot a
couple yeah and just one or two comments
that I accrued along the way when Bob
mumbled about the breadth of deployment
we don't honestly know because it's open
source and people download and deploy
when you google on ship one of the
interesting things that comes up is
there's evidently an extremely large
deployment between the department of
homeland security in the Department of
Justice and a couple of years ago in DC
I was giving stick and these two guys
from DHS and DOJ walked up at the end
and said we're really interested in your
software and I went I hope not and then
and they said why and I go while from
Berkeley I'm you know and I came out in
the 60th oh this is privacy-preserving
and they went no this is secrecy
preserving we are now under federal
mandate to share lots and lots of
information between DHS and DOJ and we
want to do that but it's not like we
want to reveal our operatives to each
other we definitely don't what we want
to reveal is that we have a user who is
authenticated an extremely strong level
of authentication who has the
authorization to act
this the content on the other agency
site so you know you're onto something
when you saw when you're trying to solve
privacy and you get a side effect of
solving another problem that's important
to people so that was an interesting
aspect another thing about was
mentioning edgy person as part of our
long and ultimately painful interactions
with the federal government maybe that's
redundant the one of the things that we
worked on was developing a u.s. person
object class and all of you a good CS
folks so you know the the famous saw
from the cs community about there's only
three numbers that matter in CS 12 and
many and its metadata correlation 12 and
schema so schema have emerged as really
really important in this space and so we
developed a u.s. person schema that i
had among other things had very little
in it we're very parsimonious in our
object classes but one of the things
that it did have in there was a full
disability class which turned out to be
very important for the federal
government who has an obligation to
present information to all of the
citizens regardless of their handicaps
and challenges and the fact that we had
attributes that would allow still
preserving privacy to be able to display
things to Braille readers or two of two
vocal leaders or to compensate for your
color blindness or your learning
disabilities was a very important tool
so think schemer as i'm sure you guys do
third thing to note from protect network
etc is that the the transfer of this
from enterprise to enterprise services
to citizen to enterprise or citizen to
government is a very important step in
all this process and we had found hopes
that ultimately banks would be identity
providers because they happen to have a
trust relationship happened to have
auditors you happen to have a trust
relationship with them where you give
them a lot of money and they give you a
piece of paper in bed in return that
said the banks have not fully stepped up
to this book business partially because
some of them are still waiting for the
gods of pki to arrive
partially because they're busy doing
other stuff but certainly some banks
like Wells Fargo are deeply involved in
this in helping to foster a citizen
solution lastly as we get into the
Federation space looking at your door
the University of California system has
formed a federation you see trust all
the schools are in that but there are
also members of in common and so we're
starting to handle some of these issues
of Federation peering etc and for those
of you who came from the tcp/ip land
we're back to bgp one more time with
autonomous systems up a level of the
protocol stack the cal state system is
about to enjoy join as 22 universities
with or 20 yeah i guess the universities
and they have a very important
initiative called the california digital
marketplace which may reach this out to
a lot broader community so with that
we're we're now diving into
relationships among federations we have
a meeting in prague those three days
okay yeah so when we talk about okay the
median prod was a 15 to 20 are any
federations five continents now all
doing pretty much the same stuff some
anchors out there are these federal
guidelines miss hundred missed 863 on
identity proofing in acts of
authentication that gives us some common
ground edger person gives us some common
ground international privacy issues EU
privacy directives etc gives us some
dissimilar ground and we have to work
through those issues so we got together
in prague lots and lots of alignment it
was really a pretty a remarkable meeting
Liberty was there you can see the topics
we recovered privacy policies which are
right now distilling down to consent
agreements but ultimately as we were
chatting back there we have to worry
about distributed denial of privacy
attacks by having service providers
correlate information about a particular
identity that's come through the door
shibboleth is pretty distinctive in its
ability to oscillate those identifiers
so that you can't make those kinds of
attacks but that's an important aspect
of this a dispute resolution if we have
international peering where the hell do
we resolve the disagreements do we go to
the Hague um we want to go to ACM
actually
is where we want to go but we'll talk
about that afterwards on the next steps
in this process of UK drafting an
analysis of the international peering
agreements and we're all moving as Bob
indicated we had a long and ultimately
fruitless relationship with the federal
government I'm about to space but the
relics that we constructed along the way
are very important so the saml 2.0 file
for interoperability is moving into the
e gov cig the attribute schema is moving
into the ego sigit liberty and we'll see
if there any better at it than the
federal government we're holding
judgment but we're participating
strongly will participate with anybody
in this space and one you want to
isolate this back for a second so we go
up we actually we don't many do you want
go before that yeah just when the
question really is how heavyweight you
get this stuff along the way well we'll
get into the open ID space in a second
very lightweight almost vaporware wait
lots and lots of good uses for that lots
and lots of instances we need audit we
need the ability to track information so
the answer at the end of the day is
going to be lots of different kinds of
identity hopefully presented on under a
common veneer maybe an info card card
space kind of veneer or some other kind
of veneer but we see these a very
complimentary and we'll talk a little
bit about how you can integrate open ID
and federated identity there was now a
lot of work done where you can come in
with a federated identity and go out
with a you a URL of your choice so with
that maybe I should turn it back Bob
okay okay a user-centric I think people
here probably have some idea of what
what people say that stuff means I I
don't want to so much get into
especially since our time is short get
into details obviously there's a lot
going on and in you know to activities
and representing universities we
certainly are are interested I've been
you know file attending all the IAW is
from the beginning
etc following that so let me let me just
make a couple of points on this slide
here you know what what are the what are
the important things that people mean
about user centric from my point of view
there there really are two that are key
one is that that you have a notion of
owning whatever it is your identity is
as opposed to having it be tied to a
particular app or web site like Facebook
or even even when you've you know
externalize the authentication and you
know I'm able to use our Morgan at
Washington at2 you to sign on to lots of
things like that wiki or you know
various other externalized websites from
the u-dub lots of zillion places that
you dub but you know RL Morgan at
Washington a video is still the property
of the University of Washington you know
as it turns out I I can most likely keep
it for life but that's the current
policy and it's you dubbed it sets the
policy on that so you know there is you
know as as has been well expressed at
this point in many venues a strong in
terms of people to have it be their own
thing not it be and had it not be
Google's thing or or or Washington that
Ed news thing or the government's thing
or anything me know the identity that
expressed is mine somehow maybe that's
you know the domain name that I feel
like I own even though it's probably
really ultimately the property if I can
but you know have it be mine and you
know yeah that's really technology
independent I would say but is is a real
strong team and that stuff the other is
control of how information flows so its
user centric if the information that's
passed between the parties that I'm
dealing with goes through me as opposed
to being done in some back-channel
exchange between those places that I
don't really have any of you into where
control over right so those are those
are both important things i think you
know really technology independent i
think a lot of technologies that we're
doing our are capable of supporting that
stuff a lot of it has more to do with
with policies of entities that are that
are involved in the the technology than
the technology per se that said speaking
for in a to mid where and the Shibboleth
project we are bullish on info card you
know the the the idea that you can have
really good internet identity with
everything happening via a dumb browser
just only takes you so far you know
having the ability to have actual smart
software in your browser that knows how
to sign on to things on your on your
platform than those how to sign on to
things really makes all the difference
so we have been even though you know
some of the technical details and in
info card and the identity meta system
and all that stuff are not necessarily
what we would have chosen the the
overall system seems like the best bet
for actually moving things forward so we
are intending to support that in the
Shibboleth product where again not
define exactly what that would mean but
ultimately of being able to replace or
supplement a the current a redirection
based browser based flow that i showed
earlier with an info card base flow
retaining the same ability to send
attributes and and relying on the same
infrastructure federated infrastructure
to support it that we enjoy now so
that's our that's our goal with that
stuff
open ID sure they're big how many how
many people here have an open ID
everybody's how many people a little
used it this week okay if you not me so
you know open ID it gets a lot of buzz
certainly certainly you know fine for
for many great use cases for which it
has been applied you know don't really
have time to get into its its details
now from my point of view having you
know looked at it a fair amount you know
for the kinds of use cases that we that
that that we are talking about
traditionally talking about in
university space the kinds of things
we've been doing is federation you know
is it securable to do those things
probably but then it would essentially
lose most of its appeal because you know
the user would start having to manage
their own https website etc so you know
just open a Z 2 point 0 supposed to
solve many of these things will it
actually take off and see adoption will
the non URL use cases which are some of
the interesting things in 2 point 0
actually see the light of day you'd be
deployed by people in the world maybe
we'll see I have my doubts from from my
point of view from the looking at at
what we're doing in higher ed it's
really the the use case is here that
rather than this exact technology people
want promiscuous interaction right
here's a sight it's never been in touch
with or knows nothing about an identity
provider and they're able to interact
and do something useful right well you
know to some extent that's a you know a
something for nothing proposition right
you know if you really know absolutely
nothing about them then you can't tell
the difference between a really good one
that's supplying you really good stable
users and one that's providing you with
all the spam so well if you knew some if
you have to know something about them
then you know what do you do well people
are certainly are already as people are
here probably aware working on
reputation system to support the that
kind of discrimination you know and I
think in many ways that is what we are
trying to build a portion of by building
something for the higher education
community is to say okay here's a whole
bunch of places that can participate in
a an open identity system that our
universities you know you won't you you
know you may not like universities in
general but they are institutions in
society and they do represent a certain
kind of reputation that is already out
there that can be leveraged as opposed
to having to build it up from scratch so
but are those promiscuous use cases ones
that that are important in research and
education they absolutely are right what
do we do in research and education we
connect up researchers educators all
around the world based on their you know
their interest in in all kinds of
obscure subjects bring them together and
it's really important that that be able
to be done in in a very loose you know
collegial you know non you know doesn't
require contract set up kind of fashion
right it has been done that way for you
know a couple of thousand years already
I think but it's important that that
continue in the online world so those
cases are not really being met very well
by these more elaborate Federation's
that we've set up to do the high value
things now so if we want to be able to
play in that space and I think it's
important that we do we need to find
some way to bridge that gap the other
hand you know the kind of stuff that we
do you know even if it's a loose loose
collaboration among researchers you know
it's an it's real stuff your reputation
as a researcher is you know it's it's
your career right if your if your
research is is trashed by somebody who
stole your ID because they did a you
know a DNS poisoning attack then you
know that's a big problem right so or if
they get access to that expensive you
know resource that you got from the NSF
so you know we can't say that all of
those are low value cases eportfolio let
me just touch on very quickly the notion
of the student stuff should be you know
that's what students want to be able to
do is collect all their stuff throughout
their academic career
someplace and say here's my stuff here's
my academic stuff this is a very big
deal and in the education space these
days people are trying to design system
to support this where is that stuff
going to live what's the gonna be the
identity of of that place of you of you
when you are when it's your stuff at
that place is it going to be the last
university you attended is it going to
be the identity you started with in
elementary school that carries on all
the way through dodo these are very
significant questions um in running
short time want to get to our next topic
but all this stuff can be can be hooked
together in fascinating ways I did a
demo at a meeting over the summer where
I went to an open ID enabled web site
was redirected to an open ID provider
that was info card enabled signed on to
that with an info card that was a
managed card so ultimately I went back
and signed on at my university using
basic auth right so you know we can
change these things together in really
cool ways and we have absolutely no idea
what's happening by the end of that
right and people young people want to do
that it's really enabling to be able to
do these things but what if you got you
know and when when you're when you're
done with that you know user support you
no assurance all that stuff so you know
we have many miam the nice thing now is
that we have many many many identity
tools are in our hands and the
interesting thing is what are they going
to be useful ways to put them together
ok so just our final thing here about
collaboration and all the different
things so this is a big area of work for
us now we observed that higher I
collaborate ins tend to involve several
different kinds of tools at once that
wiki i showed you know for example you
know mailing lists a chat video
conference etc etc all these things have
to be managed independently for many
collaborative activities virtual
organizations that are supporting these
things that's a huge burden and it
becomes an impossibility to to support a
large collaborative distributed
federated activity using
that stuff's that we're trying to make a
change in that a lot of our view
organizations supporting research and
education around the world are working
on the same kind of stuff we just write
to this we have a project called
co-manage which is bringing together
some group and privilege management
tools that we had been targeting for
more enterprise space before Federation
enabling them applying them to the this
suite of collaboration tools hoping to
do some demos and show how this stuff
can actually improve management of
access to resources make it an enabled
for real virtual organization show some
of that stuff happening at internet too
and obviously as we look at things like
like google apps for education and how
universities federate into into those
spaces and think about about real
federated cases there where I'm not just
going to you know the University of
Washington instance of google apps for
education but somebody from from some
other university Federation to look at
my calendar or share an email inbox or
whatever those are the kind of things
that that we really want to know we're
excited about about you know enabling
with the kind of applications that you
guys are developing and trying to take
advantage of the interest the identity
infrastructure that we're building so
again you know showing examples of doing
that kind of thing with with tools of
we're building so I think that's a it's
probably about it and we wanted to leave
a little time for questions so we have a
few minutes yeah limitation that was a
that was a fire hose of stuff I want to
expand a little bit on this last point
about when you plumb an application for
collaboration and end Federation
University of Missouri has a civilized
sharepoint and sharepoint is certainly a
widely used collaboration tool and it's
wonderful that you can use your
federated identity from you enterprise
to get into the sharepoint server and
all life is all good unto you want
use one aspect of sharepoint which is
revving up a desktop application and
that desktop application has got to
understand the federated space and in
the case of Microsoft's products no so
understand that there were layers here
that we're going to go through we're
going to get quickly to have you be able
to access content on a shared server but
then to exploit the applications under
needs to use that is a different trick
and I I appeal to you guys as really
smart people who do applications to make
sure that your applications can
understand life in a federated space and
it's more than just federated identity
it's it's it's living in that almost DCE
type world that's out there but case of
death AFS type world out there how about
AFS yeah if s is cool well who else was
there must be some people out there hi
there um I'm wondering if you could
compare what in common is doing to some
other commercial identity federation
services if there are any your comment
on that commercial identity federation
services are you asking if there are any
or are you do you have some in mind well
I know there are identity vendors like
ping identity so yeah but yeah let me in
fact I had I had coffee with Andre
Durand a couple of weeks ago about this
space and he reported yo I think he's a
CEO actually of pink federate and ping
ID they have a lot of installations out
there 125 and fortune 500s every single
one of those installations is bilateral
every single one of those is we've
outsourced travel without source payroll
whatever and he knows that that's not a
real path forward do you know what you
mean by bilateral it's you know this
company makes an arrangement that
company they share keys you know set up
so there's no the next one you set up
another server that you know do the next
one you set up another server but and so
you can count on a contractual basis
already because yet you you've done that
partnership you can count on the fact
that you don't have to worry about what
attributes they're permitted to deliver
because that's part of the contractual
nature whereas when you move to a
multilateral spell
then you have to really question is that
Enterprise really able to assert that
somebody is a member of some other
enterprise for example or and the
enterprise viewpoint is why should I
give those attributes out to these
people so a lot of stuff creeps in when
you hit multilateral everybody I think
now in the commercial space is
understanding that the long-term path is
multilateral that's why Liberty glommed
on to us so so passionately is because
we're doing the multilateral
Federation's and that's where we're the
end of the story will be so what we know
about our large numbers are bilateral
commercial identity providers as it were
we don't know of with the exception of
protect network and ping said of eight
will probably join in common as an IDP
where in fact you might use your open ID
to get to ping federate and then get out
with a federated ID from ping ping
federated of your identity provider
which leads to interesting questions
about how can I add an o Loa to an open
ID because I came in with a strong
active assent occation perhaps to ping
federate how can I convey that
information so we don't know of any real
use cases right now among the
Federation's that are being constructed
perhaps the broadest is in the UK where
they intend to account in compass all of
high read all of continuing it all of
k-12 and now they're talking to the
National Health Service so that's going
to be a very broadly scoped Federation
at that point and we'll see how it
tracks I think we're keeping a more
focused view on our Federation with the
idea that pairing is the answer between
Federation's and we have to nail that
down right there I guess the one
instance I know about of commercial
identity providers actually was is in
service of the US government is an
occasion Federation where the whole
point was to push any management out
from the government applications out to
you know the usual ring of government
contractors and so there are some
they're serving that particular set but
to my knowledge not serving any other
it's it's a difficult space to be in I
think you know as a as a business
proposition you know liabilities unknown
you know but we'll see now we want to be
pretty blatant about our our appeal here
it's you guys have always been leaders
you jumped onto federated identity
really early on and that's wonderful now
we're talking about a richer identity
management space where groups and
privileges etc can be exchanged across
these the this fabric and you know our
appeal to you is externalized as much as
you can of identity management within
your application space so that it can
function in a federated world
this smirks back there yeah what is one
thing that strikes me is you're talking
about managing I think tiff or
universities and it seems to me that
Facebook has been doing that for you
they've been going around using emails
identities for university students and
built that out so is that competition
for you or is that parallel is that not
relevant at all well let's see is
facebook competition for us with
identity management I don't think so I
haven't heard of any universities that
are saying you know you can now sign
into your course website with your
facebook com ID well but are those are
those services are our academic
activities definitely moving out into
the Internet services absolutely you
know moving it so it's not not so much
identity as the actual you know that
stuff itself you know how many how many
courses are doing stuff via google
groups right I'm Gillian I'm sure right
is that concern of universities
absolutely you know the you know what
you know you know do we alright is there
a level of control that we think we we
need to have over that stuff well in the
ordinary course maybe not the one that's
dealing with I don't know possibly
medical information because it's a
medical course well yeah you know so you
know I mean obviously you know people
moving serious work into Google Apps is
a is a big deal and that's you know
people are working on contracts around
that you know yeah that was sort of the
point I was trying to make
in the middle there about about you know
if we don't you know play and the
broader internet sort of you know
application space and then and you know
via identity then then you know that
stuff will just start to happen out
there and you know university identities
will be good for you know you know
looking at your paycheck and looking at
your grades and that'll be about it
right and I think that would be lose I
think yeah cuz cuz you know I really
think that that when it comes to
academics and you know that reputation
point that i made you know being out
there with the fact that you are a
professor at a university I think should
make a difference in all kinds of online
activities right what kind of difference
well you know if we're building up
reputation based on you know who likes
your blog comments you know and that is
determining your expertise about you
know the history of Azerbaijan well you
know how about actually being a
professor of Azerbaijani history at some
University wouldn't that help establish
reputation than that in that you know
sort of sort of context I think it would
how do we how do we get there you know
we don't have any ways of digitally
expressing that kind of thing today in a
consumable fashion but we're getting
there you know we could say is faculty
now in a standardized fashion you know
so you that that's the kind of if we're
going to serve our societal role here
that's what we need to do another aspect
of the facebook situation kevin is is
whether it's authoritative on any
attributes so one of the big businesses
right now with an in common is the
assertion of student pneus that's huge
Facebook can assert that you're
currently enrolled student and so and so
what we're seeing now is a vast market
place from one of the companies in in
common is student only services and they
give you eurail passes that one of the
reasons we like them is there LOL zero
comfort level LOL where but they really
want to know that you're an active
student university spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars today to service
those requests via fax bio
email via telephone imagine if you can
have a dynamic still sending nine track
tapes to some place I suspect so and
wouldn't it be nice if we can give a
real-time assertion that you're a
student and preserve privacy in that
prospect and a lot of other things and
that's turning out to be huge and again
so it's not only universities as
identity providers but universities as
definitive sources of authority for
certain pieces of information that's
very important so you know if Facebook
really was obliged by a legislation to
assure that people were students well
for vae the distinction between alumni
or something inaccuracies and understand
especially as Bob talked about some of
the melamine search argument the medical
applications that there really is a
regulatory life out there we don't like
it but hipper gramm-leach-bliley
sarbanes-oxley all of this stuff is real
lots of economics associated with it
we'd like to have an infrastructure that
supports that but could be diluted down
to be flexible for the social networking
environments etc but it seems very
difficult to start at an open ID level
and ratchet up
in defense of open idea a little and the
thing about Facebook an existing
identity things have been built on email
and the problem with email is it so
you're overloading message sending
mechanism the nice thing about opening
ideas you're overloading a URL which
means you can once you've verified the
URL you can use that as a source for
further information because it has a
page that so that means it can it can
point into the rest of the system so
that that's it seems like a subtle
difference but actually it's quite an
important one and obviously like your
l's at Google because we go on and
indexing them but I think it's valuable
for other people as well to say okay
that URL is on you know the University
domain it has a path there and that
points to the other services it can be
fetched from it and if you can hear you
can attach those to it and there's some
value there I think yeah you know I mean
I mean the notion of you know URLs being
associated with with identities as as
one portion of a set of identifiers
absolutely you know I like URLs you know
makes a lot of sense although you know
again you know what about what about you
know privacy aspects right if if I have
to have one of those that savage says
everything about me in order to play
certain kinds of games you know to in
order to participate in certain kinds of
activities if I don't I choose not to
have one you know my cut off you know
what what what sorts of things you know
what was the expectation of everybody
being open about everything you know due
to people's legitimate interest in
privacy you know we need to bear that in
mind
the other question says final question
filing a fine fine question yes
certainly we have a lot of a venturi
ought there on in common and Internet to
our our best university oriented place
for discussing identity management lated
stuff is oops there's my screensaver
nice period in most really it is yeah
talk to the race is actually there's an
identity management list that's right
out of the edge cause a larger
organization that but good venues to
talk about about about all this stuff
are needed actually so and and it's
important to note that you're not an
average company we would give the
average company answer of you know join
the email list etcetera your google and
that's really important to us so if you
want continued engagement it's it's kjk
at internet to edu how about that to cut
through and we'll find something because
you're you are consequential and we make
you know it's also remarkable to us into
the rest of the world that we have a
project at Google and Microsoft are
cooperating on we want to keep that
going well thanks falling again thank
you
