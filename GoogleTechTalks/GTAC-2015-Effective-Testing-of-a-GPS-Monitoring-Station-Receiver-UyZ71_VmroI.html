of Lockheed Martin about testing GPS
systems hello everyone my name is Andrew
connote I'm a software engineer at
lockheed martin and wanted to talk to
you today about a gps monitoring station
receiver that we've been developing as a
software-defined radio and how we tested
it before we get started on that i want
to give a little bit of a system
background on gps there's three major
segments of GPS user segments based
segments and control segment so the user
segment is the one that we all all of us
know and use that is the equipment that
actually forms our position velocity and
time solutions that we use every day in
our phones and you know standalone
devices there are I think it estimated
four billion GPS devices currently in
use today so it's it's a ubiquitous
system as everybody knows some of the
portions that you may not most people
don't think about are probably the space
segment and the control segment the
space segment is kind of what it sounds
like it's these are the satellites that
transmit the GPS signals that the user
segment uses to form the solutions the
control segment is probably the least
familiar aspect of GPS to most people
this is really the this is the part that
is closing the loop between the user
segments in the space of space segment
to make sure that the system provides
the level of service and quality that
we're all accustomed to so it really
makes sure the system is performing well
and commands the satellites to tell them
what to do a little bit more about the
control segment so there are 31
satellites currently operational there's
a couple spares but they control segment
communicates all the time with with
these satellites they are in charge of
monitoring the health and status of
all the subsystems on the satellites and
to make sure that any kind of anything
that goes wrong that they will you know
basically protect the users from
experiencing bad solutions and try to
get them back online as fast as possible
another very significant part about the
control segment is they are the entity
responsible for the orbit and clock
estimation of all the satellites the
orbit and clock estimation parameters
are what makes our what makes satellite
navigation possible and and gives us the
actor is complete completely determine
determines the accuracy of our solutions
on the ground so just a little context
about where the control segment operates
just quick background it you can see it
has a worldwide presence there are a
number of functions that it performs
like I said controlling the satellites
commanding them telling them what to do
but for the purpose of this discussion
we'll just be looking at the where the
locations of the blue circles are which
are Hawaii Colorado Cape Canaveral a
couple rocks in the middle of the ocean
ascension island diego garcia and quad
lean so what exactly is a monitoring
station receiver anyway it's a it's a
specialized GPS receiver that's
dedicated to making measurements as
accurately as possible to each satellite
from from a monitoring station so this
is really the foundation for all the
orbit and clock estimation that's
performed by the control segment so the
more accurate the measurements the
better accuracy of the orbit and clock
estimation and the better solutions on
the ground more accurate solutions for
everybody who has a GPS receiver one of
the unique things about a monitoring
station receiver that's different than a
normal perceiver that's in a phone is
that it needs to be able to track and
follow satellites even when they're
unhealthy so if there is a problem the
control segment can command the
satellite to go into
to mark itself is unhealthy so it
doesn't basically poison the navigation
solution for everybody on earth or
anyone who's in view of that satellite
at that point so they can mark it on
healthy or they can actually push it to
reserved or special signals that
wouldn't even get picked up by your your
GPS device and that's one of the
critical responsibilities of the control
segment so a couple things a few more
differences and then we'll get into how
we tested this but the way I like to
think about the differences between a
normal receiver and a monitoring station
receiver is that in a normal receiver
you don't know where you are and you
have no idea what time it is so that's
the goal of a normal receivers to figure
that out it can only get that
information from you need at least four
satellites and view to extract that
information and of the timing of the
signals in the and the satellites are
broadcasting those orbital and clock
correction parameters to the user to to
compensate for for any errors on the on
the vehicle in a monitoring station
receiver it's it's quite different
they're still using the same still using
the same exact signals to track but in
this case we know exactly where we are
because we've been surveyed so that
information is known and the clock is
actually known as well it's a common
time reference that all the monitoring
station receivers are slaved to and all
end uses an atomic clock for stability
so a little bit about the the project
that we we were lucky enough to get
involved with the existing monitoring
station receivers that have incredible
performance great performance but
they're becoming difficult and expensive
to maintain that were designed over 20
years ago it's difficult to get parts or
it's a long turnaround time to fix them
basically the the government asked us to
look into a an alternative it could we
do this with a non-proprietary set of
hardware something that could be
upgraded over time easily
so they wouldn't be tied into a fixed
solution that you know would have run
into these obsolescence issues so they
were wondering could you do this with a
software-defined radio and that's where
we got involved and we've been working
the past year to to prove the accuracy
of this and it's still a work in
progress but I'm pleased to report that
the solutions that are the measurement
accuracy that we're getting is
comparable or exceeds the existing
legacy receivers just a couple words
about the implementation it custom-built
software-defined radio we build it in
with C++ standard template library and
boost we've run on a couple different
flavors of Linux and one of the things i
think that separates us from some of the
other software defined radio
architectures although i know there are
others that are doing this but we use
NVIDIA GPUs for our acceleration of our
signal processing so to do a lot of the
heavy lifting so that's in CUDA we also
have a plug-in based architecture and
the point of that is really to you know
we focus on well-defined interfaces
which helps promote testability but we
also this really allows for the
separation of our friend and equipment
from for RF processing from the rest of
our software so as an example we have a
plug-in that provides digital samples
that that's the interface well those
digital samples could come from a file
they could come over a socket or they
could actually communicate with a
hardware board that is doing signal
acquisition analog to digital converter
and so if a company that manufactured
one of these boards went out of business
we could write another it's sort of
analogous to a device driver so we can
we can switch things very rapidly which
also helps for for testing so a couple
things about testing what kind of
methods we have so we of course have
lots of unit and focused integration
small integration tests and continuous
integration we every engineer can kick
off all the unit tests and when on push
to a
repository of a commit it's basically
going to recompile everything and you
know run all the unit tests for
regression and then it's going to notify
everybody on the project whether you
know what was pushed and whether it
succeeded or failed and public shaming
can begin if there is failure so while
this is great I mean this is really
mandatory it doesn't capture the entire
the complexity of the system how do we
know that these you know individually
tested signal processing algorithms are
really going to play well together and
give us the accuracy of the measurements
that we're looking for so a couple
things we could do well okay we could we
could just stick an antenna outside and
start collecting GPS signals that's one
way to do it but how do you know there's
some significant problems with this
approach but just by itself how do we
test these sort of infrequent events
like when a satellite is unhealthy
unfortunately that is a fairly
infrequent event from a testing
perspective it might be nice if it was
more frequent but the and if we do see
something that's unexpected how do we
know what caused the the error was it
you know was it a temperature
fluctuation was it something in our
antenna was it actually our algorithms
themselves some breaking change that we
introduced or was it an actual
real-world effect like the it's cloudy
one day and sunny the next and that
affects the troposphere which affects
the or that's part of the troposphere
which affects delays so and even if we
did uncover some kind of boundary
condition we couldn't reproduce it so
well we could just record all these and
play them back okay if we play back at
RF it's going to be not entirely
deterministic because every time you
play back at our effort going to
introduce some thermal noise and noise
is always going to look a little
different every time so we could instead
maybe playback at baseband so if we do
that then we we achieve our determinism
but we still have the issue of capturing
these sort of infrequent events in the
first place and it's also not very
practical for a local system this isn't
designed to go into a cloud
this is really for a small you know
isolated network so if we want to
deliver a test capability along with the
system we have to capture we'd have to
have hundreds of six our satellite
passes and that the sample rates we've
run at each pass is about four terabytes
and you're going to start getting into
the petabyte regime which it's it's
achievable but it for local systems just
not very practical or cost-effective we
could purchase a commercial GPS
simulator that's not bad but again it's
there they're expensive so if we wanted
every developer to have one that really
adds to the cost they can be difficult
to script your various scenarios that
you want to do and it's hard to recreate
these some of these special very few
offer the ability to do these
non-standard satellite performance
things so why not create our own
simulator we should already have all the
parts that we need we've been unit
testing all of our algorithms on the
receiver side so we should be able to
know a lot of the things that stimulate
it we should be if we understand how to
build the signal or receive the signal
we should know how to to build it so the
test code can really serve as a good
foundation for the for the complementary
side and well this is great because now
we can do our own RF testing and have
our own source of truth we can also do
baseband testing and so why is baseband
testing so effective well it really
allows you the critical things is it
allows you to separate RF effects from
your algorithm performance so you can
run a baseband get a baseline and
understand what you know measurement
noise you have and then when you add
your RF hardware and you can isolate
that error and you can trade between
different pieces of hardware to see what
effects that it has you don't need the
the large disk storage you can basically
just deterministically make the samples
on the fly to stimulate your receiver
it's it's deterministic because again
we're at baseband so if you did have
some boundary condition you uncovered it
gives you the chance to find it and
reproduce it so it's always joyous when
we are
able to find a problem at baseband
because it makes it easier to fix and
it's a it's easily distributable so
every engineer can have at their desk a
way to to run these complex scenarios
they may have differences in capacity
the number of channels that they can do
simultaneously but still there are it's
a pretty powerful tool so a couple words
about what we found to be effective
testing scenarios for ourselves and this
may apply for other software defined
radio efforts not sure but the we have
some single satellite tests so we have
zero and constant Doppler tests that
basically it's not representative of
actual satellite dynamics but it can be
very useful for testing boundary
conditions or just getting your own kind
of baseline non dynamic performance so
this is where the satellites staying put
or it's moving at a constant rate we
also have normal satellite motion cases
which is basically what one would
experience over the course of a six-hour
pass and we can turn on unhealthy data
to simulate that or we can switch to
these non-standard spreading codes
signal spreading codes we have the full
satellite constellation test where we
basically are doing the same thing as
normal except we have all that you would
normally see in view which could be
depending on where you are and how high
up you are you'll you make it you know
up to 14 simultaneous tracking
satellites so it's good for trying to
characterize the whole representative
system performance under load and we
have some Monte Carlo simulations where
we can vary the really to try to
characterize our probability of
acquisition and and false acquisition
under different conditions like SNR
doppler and elevation angles so in the
future some things that we want to do
next now faster than real time testing
is really I think the next thing we want
to do that can speed over test
dramatically and we basically we'll run
our simulators fast as possible and have
the receiver process also as fast as
possible and that's a good way to also
find where performance bottlenecks are
so it gives us another chance
to uncover some some things that we
wouldn't normally see at real time since
we're going that we're only running at
real time instead of faster than real
time we also want to we should be able
to do continuous and distributed Monte
Carlo testing we should be able to vary
these parameters and definitely
destroyed distribute them out and if
we're running faster in real time we can
really start getting a lot of a lot of
cases covered and a little bit better
automated analysis could we currently
have reports that we generate which
makes it actually pretty quick but it's
manual review if we're doing a lot more
tests and we're doing a lot faster if
we're going to need a better way so
maybe a scoreboard kind of thing so
couple takeaways my last slide here you
really need a combination of unit
baseband NRF testing to feel good about
any SDR system in my in my opinion if
you're not doing all these things you're
probably going to need more tests you're
probably missing some things and it
really helps you nail down the you know
the line between hardware and software
which is can drive you crazy sometimes
so this really helps a lot having
baseband and RF there and the other take
away is if build your own simulator that
will enable baseband testing it really
gives you it starts pulling back some of
the is if you're just doing RF testing
you don't have that exact determinism
you can get that determinism back by
doing a baseband and it gives you
complete control over your testing
scenarios and you don't have to depend
on any third-party device and that's it
for me thanks
thank you Andrew and if anyone has
questions for Andrew please follow up
with him in person because we don't
actually have time from the no matter
