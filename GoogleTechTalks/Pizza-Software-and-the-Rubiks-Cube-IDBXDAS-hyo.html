24 points six seven seconds and then
wrote a book titled conquer the cube
that detailed his method he then worked
as a software engineer and moved to
Atlanta but as a Bronx native he was so
unsatisfied with the local pizza that he
decided to fix it this meant hosting
pizza tastings at his home publishing
what's known as the Internet's number
one pizza recipe and finally opening
Verrazano spits area earlier this year
please welcome Jeff Arizona hey how you
doing guys thanks for having me first of
all I haven't given a PowerPoint
presentation a long time so you're gonna
have to bear with me a little bit yeah
so I just wanted to you know when it
when I had the opportunity with my
called and asked me to speak here you
know I recently was going to talk just
about the food and i'll just give you a
little bit of background on the pizzeria
but then I didn't want to tie it in to
some of the other things that I've done
and just kind of show how they all
relate to one another when I moved I
moved down to Atlanta I guess early 98
so about 11 years ago and like a lot of
people that are from the Northeast I was
suffering from some serious pizza
withdrawal and just withdrawal of a lot
of food in general I think that the
pastries the cannolis even the hot dogs
even though the pike in hot dogs the
bagels and I just started to make these
things and my home or at least the pizza
I started to make it home and I I guess
I carried it to a little bit more of an
extreme than I then I intended to i
started to go to all the top New York
pizzerias every time I was back in New
York I hit Patsy's and Lombardi's and
all these old-school pizzerias and I
noticed that they all baked their pizzas
very very hot and so I i started to
tinker with my oven and eventually kind
of jerry-rigged a little bit so I could
run on the cleaning cycle in the
cleaning cycle a lot of people don't
know your oven will hit a thousand
degrees so you have a little you have a
cleaning cycle you have the makings of a
pretty good coal-fired pizza oven right
in your house if you're willing to void
the warranty and risk burning your house
down and but I just started to
experiment at first first I was just
using the basic generic recipes and then
I started to experiment with all
different kinds of flour and all
different kinds of cheeses and all
different kinds of saw
and gradually my pizza got better and
better and as it did I started to notice
that there were a lot of similarities
between learning how to do the pizza and
the software projects that i was working
on and even the rubik's cube so I'm
really learning anything so that's
really the topic that I'm gonna I'm
gonna I'm going to talk about today
eventually I put up a website on how to
make pizza really just at the request of
one person somebody said you know what's
your recipe and I just threw up this
website in just one day and it it it
became a little cult website where
people who were really into pizza around
the internet knew about it and then
about a year later it just went viral
can one of these things that just got
passed around the internet and you know
slam my servers and brought my servers
down because of the traffic home is one
day I picked up my unseen at as a news
story an event and calm and Boing Boing
dotnet is when it's just little strange
stories of floats around and then I
started having people say you know you
should open up a pizzeria or you should
help me open up my pizza I probably had
about 40 people ask me if I could help
them open their pizzaria one of my
favorite emails of all time I've had
about 2,400 people write me letters from
the website and my favorite letter of
all time is you come China make pizza
for profit so I so that's when I knew
that it might be a good time to open up
my own pizzeria and that's what I did we
just opened up a few months ago we were
just voted best pizzeria in Atlanta by
Jezebel magazine and a lot of people
that come and say it's the best pizza
they've ever had so hopefully some of
you guys will get a chance to try at
some point but let me get back on the
topic here so what does learning about
pizza software at rubik's cube have in
common well actually mastering any skill
shares a lot in common so it doesn't
really matter what you're trying to
master if you're trying to master golf
if you're trying to master the trumpet
if you're trying to master improv comedy
of the Rubik's Cube pizzas software
there are a lot of things that that that
are in common to to learning any sort of
the skill just threw a book or two of
this picture competes over here I one
thing is that it takes a long time to
master anything and it's not a simple
process it's not something where you
just get
and insight one day and then you can and
then you can you know have some sort of
massive improvement what you see instead
is you see this sort of a sort of a
jumpstart cycle so in this and the first
step you you you take what you already
know and you begin to improve on a
little bit and then you hit a point of
diminishing returns i call this stress
but one way to think about it is you hit
a point of diminishing returns and at
that point of diminishing returns you
realize you you have to really maybe
even back up and challenge your own
assumptions about where you are and at
that point if you're lucky you'll have
some sort of a breakthrough where you
see a new way of doing things and you'll
jump up but you won't stay up there
you'll realize that there's that the new
thing the new trick that you learned may
not be compatible with you may have
improved one technique but it may not be
compatible with all the other techniques
in an example that I give is you know we
were all on horse and buggy for a while
and then we realize you know that wasn't
going to that wasn't going to work so
now we discover the car and we have a
big jump up but now we realize we don't
really have the infrastructure for that
we don't have gasoline stations every
mile we have we have feed stations every
mile so this kind of a retrenchment
while the while you reorganize either
yourself personally or whether the
culture has to reorganize around the new
way of thinking and there's a little bit
of a retrenchment and then you begin
again until that kind of wears out until
you can make more and more improvements
until whatever whatever that
breakthrough is hits its point of
diminishing returns almost anything that
you do has some sort of a diminishing
returns I used to notice when I did
software that customers would want all
these different features and a lot of
programmers would just pile on feature
after featured programmed a lot of
verticals so counting systems in what
you know inventory that sort of stuff
and and people would just add more
features we need this report and that
report and you know this other this
other tool but what would happen is the
program's themselves would just kind of
sort of die of their own weight so as
the features increased for a while there
would be an improvement but then after a
while we'd hit a point of diminishing
returns and no one could even find the
report bad anymore buried among all the
other features of ten reports that were
designed for one person who doesn't even
work here anymore and it
cluttered the whole system and people
end up consolidating around a small
number of things that they actually do
use and the whole system is actually
functioning at a fraction of its of it
of its potential so pretty much anything
you do is going to is going to hit a
point of diminishing returns and at that
point you have to reorganize yourself
okay I want to talk a little business of
the main thing that I want to talk about
I want to talk about the stages of
mastery so in addition to having kind of
a time sequence to it there are there's
a certain look there are certain stages
that mastering anything goes through and
the first stage is what I call randomly
connected so what do I mean by that it
means you just kind of start where you
are so let's say that I wanted to learn
how to how to play golf so you know I
just you know I don't really know how to
play golf so I just put the ball down
and I just kind of sort of you know I
just hack away at it and however my
swing is is probably randomly connected
to something else that I learned so
maybe I learned baseball when I was a
kid and that's kind of the random a bit
of learning that I take into this take
into this process at this point in time
I don't necessarily even know all of all
the different parts or aspects of golf I
don't understand and I'm going to learn
at the next step when I begin to
separate out all the different
techniques I'm going to learn well
there's a certain way you hold the ball
there's just the appropriate way you
hold the club rather this certain way
you hold your arms in a certain way that
your hip swings and you begin to learn
all these different techniques and the
majority of your time learning a skill
is spent essentially in this stage here
which is technique building where you're
separating out the task that you're
learning into finer and finer and finer
subtasks the problem is at this stage if
if you don't get help if you don't see
the next stage and some people don't I
compare this to almost every area of
your life you can see this you can see
people on the Jerry Springer Show where
they don't understand their finances for
example and and their finances are you
kind of sort of random randomly
connected to you know they're doing
their books the way there their mother
did their books which you know has
nothing to do with with getting them the
financial success and so they feel
hopeless and they're poor and so you can
you can almost see it you could almost
see it in any stage and so what you want
to do with that
first thing say okay well you have your
credit card you have you text you have
your ins you have your income you have
your budget you you begin to separate
and divide things out and this is the
first stage at which you have any sort
of power where this is kind of it has
you and at this stage you begin to kind
of have it the problem at this stage and
you spend a long time at this stage is
that it's frustrating because what works
one day what seems to work one day
doesn't work the next and the anyone
who's ever played golf it's a great
example you you learn a new technique so
now you've got this new stand that the
guy taught you you know and so now you
go out there and you hit it you have a
great day I got this and then the next
day you go out and you're terrible again
and it's because you don't really have
control over it and so it's very very
technique based and nothing looks smooth
and nothing is smooth and the next stage
things are reconnected so you have all
the different tools that you've learned
and now you begin to to reconnect them
so maybe if you're doing improv maybe if
you want to be a comedian at this stage
you're learning different voices at this
stage you're learning different
inflections you're learning different
accents you're learning timing and at
this stage where you can is where you
can combine them all and it is that this
stage that you exceed people begin to be
able to improvise something I saw this
amazing video that I highly recommend
anybody looking up it was Robin Williams
on inside the actors studio he did this
little improv number and it's on YouTube
this'll improv number with a woman in
the audience and she had a scarf so he
just picked up the scarf and he did like
a true teens with the scarf you know he
put it around his waist and he was
little Japanese accent that he was Iron
Chef you know he put it around his head
and he was like you know he was you know
he was a Muslim woman and he had that
the thing had these little fringes and
he went through it like he was the car
wash I mean he just have all this stuff
like right at his fingertips like boom
boom boom boom boom and he was changing
his voice tone he was changing the
accent and the characters that he was in
and it was just one thing after another
and really an exhibition of mastering he
makes it look easy and that's what you
see at this stage things look easy
because you can pull from whatever is
coming after you you have the ability
not only to have the techniques but to
control them and to constantly correct
yourself so if Tiger Woods for example
is swinging a golf club you know if I'm
swinging the golf club and I was taught
how to bring the club down if I make a
mistake at that point you know at the
beginning point in time well it's pretty
much over for me you know it that's it
it's going to it's going to slice it but
if when Tiger swings he probably in his
mind has that just the beginning part of
that that swing divided into ten stages
in his hair and if he makes a mistake at
the first stage you know he then think
since is well I'm going to make this
change and then he'll make this change
and he has he might have five
opportunities to make and make an
adjustment and you know who she goes and
it looks like a perfect shot we don't
have the ability to do that you know
when you see Jordan going to the hoop
you don't see him like counting steps i
think it just everybody makes it look
easy once they've reached that stage
because they can take all these
disparate parts and connect them back
together does that make sense okay so we
see this all over we see this and I
given the examples of performance I want
to talk a little bit i'm going to relate
it largely to to programming so i'm
going to give some slides in a minute
where i talk about the difference
between code that's randomly connected i
used to do a lot of vertical
applications data applications and a lot
of these were programmed in them in the
80s and 90s and they were trying to
improve them and a lot of the code was
just pretty random code that was just
coded by lots of different people who
weren't even necessary using the same
tools and they were trying to glue all
these things back together and i'm going
to show a diagram in a minute to talk
about the Frankenstein mile and then we
evolved those into toolkits and then I'm
going to talk about framing so I'm going
to come back to that and you can kind of
sort of just see and this might be a
chart to kind of I don't want to go over
the whole thing but you can you know
maybe look at this at a later time on
the video and you can just see how
different things in life all fit into
the same pattern it can be a simple
thing as you know I want to clean my
room so the first thing is I just divide
everything into piles I just separate
them in thought then I have to decide
you know where they are they going to
connect you know the stapler should sit
right next to the to the copier just
organizing things
this sort of has this sort of
characteristic you see the same thing um
if any of you have ever read Stephen
Covey's the 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People he talks about this he says the
first stage of getting control of your
life is you start off your dependent
your dependent on all of your history in
the past and all the assumptions you
made as a child and your upbringing so
the next stage is to become independent
of all of that is to take control of
your your mental state but then the next
stage I think surprised a lot of people
because a lot of people thought he was
going to say that the last stage is you
know now you're totally independent now
you've you've extricated yourself and
you're totally in control of what of
what you have of who you are but
actually he talked about becoming
interdependent was was the final in
seventh habit so you can see it's very
much the same thing of what I of what
I'm talking about let me give a concrete
example okay oh actually let me go over
this little chart a so how does knowing
any of this help how does knowing any of
this hell well for starters you know
what to expect okay first of all it
takes a long time to master anything a
lot of people think oh if I just learned
this one thing then I will I will I will
be able to achieve something and it's
almost never like that someone just
wrote a book that says it takes you know
10,000 hours to to get good at something
that's funny I found it very funny
because I've always been saying that it
takes two thousand hours to start and
then a lifetime to and life's time to
really master or anything that you want
to get good at so no matter hi it
doesn't really matter what it is if you
want to shoot free throws you know stay
there for two thousand hours and shoot
free throws and eventually you know
you'll be you'll be as good as anywhere
in your high school at shooting free
throws now if you want to be you know
Michael Jordan might be good enough to
be shocked but if you want to be mugged
you hurtin you might have to be 10,000
hours or more with it so a lot of times
this helps because sometimes you're
presented with an opportunity and you
have to make a realistic assessment of
whether you're going to go forward and I
know I make a decision if I'm really
gonna commit to it or not so someone
recently said to me new Jeff I want to
teach you how to be a pilot he was all
gung-ho zqu would make a great partner
so I don't know if I have 2000 hours to
vote to that right now so I you know I
really don't want to start because I
I'm not going to finish it the next
thing you know is that you know that
there is a cycle to it so you kind of
can see what stage you're in you know
you you you can be on the lookout for
breakthrough you can be on the lookout
for separating things into different
techniques and you can be on you can be
looking for how to make finer and finer
distinctions you know I talked to 22
people in the pizza business all the
time most of them you know they just
have a very simple recipe so you know
they they some people put oregano in
their sauce well I've sampled 28
oreganos in the last in the last three
months because I had breaking that down
to finer and finer distinctions and and
I know to do that because of these
principles somebody analyzed patents
somebody went to the Patent Office and
got a thousand patents and just kind of
read through them all and what he
noticed was that almost all the patents
have to do with taking something and
breaking it into parts so it could be
that you have a tire and attire has one
big air hole in it so of course if it
gets 111 cuttin it the whole thing
collapses but if you divide it into
thousands of air holes if you make it
into a foam for example on the inside
then it can withstand a puncture so so
pretty much whether it's whether it's a
logical breaking things down two parts
or physical breaking things down part
you see that same thing over and over
again most things are broken into pieces
the next thing is it can help you
because you can look for breakthrough by
examining the stress points so I'll talk
about this a little bit more when I talk
about the software okay you can get a
glimpse of what the final stage is like
and this make help you get there faster
so definitely going to talk about this
as I go through I'll definitely talk
about this is that i go through the
software when when i first started to
deal with these vertical systems there's
a natural tendency to want to break the
thing into into parts and you would find
it there are all these different tool
kits that help you do a task but very
early on I realized that unless those
are all recombined so that separation is
not the end it's really the middle stage
and unless there's a way to recombine
those into something more powerful into
some sort of a framework that that can't
possibly be the answer that can't
possibly be the final stage
and we're definitely going to talk about
this the other thing that's interesting
is let me just go back a second here and
I didn't really I didn't really talk
about this I didn't get this on a bullet
point here for God but natural is in any
skill there are people who are just born
naturals for whatever reason and that I
don't really have a theory as to why
that so but people just have certain
natural gifts and the difference between
a natural and someone who's taking on a
skill for which they're not unnatural is
that naturals do this task backwards so
a natural starts off with the
connections and then learns the
techniques so someone like a Robin
Williams probably was born a natural he
probably started at a very very almost
you know you know almost as a kid you
know noticing the connection between one
thing and another he may not have had
the ability to do a German voice in a
Japanese voice in a and a south and
south african voiced or anything that he
might need he might have learned those
later but i'm pretty sure that he got
that you know he got the timing and how
things connect probably from the very
very very beginning and what's
interesting about that is that even
though we're we may not be a natural at
something that we want to to master we
can we can to cue from that and we can
take a peek at the end we can take a
peek at the end and say okay what are
the naturals doing that's different than
what i'm doing at least I have a vision
for what it's supposed to look like and
when when i was doing software i started
looking at frameworks and even even even
as i was looking here and as soon as i
started here i was i was looking they're
starting a million in a way from there
and I'm gonna make that obvious in a
second so let's jump forward okay all
right let's give an example here so as
he mentioned I held the world record for
the Rubik's Cube back in back in the day
as they say 1981 when it was that one it
was the hot puzzle I'm the problem with
the Rubik's Cube and the reason that
people are so perplexed by it is because
the parts are so dependent on one
another so if you look at the different
stages of mastery and you talk about how
things are randomly connected nothing is
more randomly connected than ever
scrambled Rubik's Cube so I don't know
this is going to fly on the camera here
is that the camera right there so I'm
going to try and do this OH people to
say i'm going to show you just one move
on the rubik's cube okay just so you can
get a sense of what I'm talking about so
the problem with the puzzle so let's
take an example let's say I have this
red piece right here okay so if i take
this red piece out so this red piece is
sitting over here if I want to pick this
red piece and I want to complete this
art so I want to move this piece over
here you know obviously I can turn the
piece here and then move it up that
would be the shortest path to getting it
up here the problem is is that by moving
this piece up I've scrambled I've moved
these pieces out of the way so turning
just what is there's eight corners on
the cube turning just one side turns
half of all of the corners on the cube
and obviously turning one side is kind
of trivial it's not going to get me
anywhere to do pretty much much of
anything I have to turn at least one
side and at least one other so I'm
moving six of the eight corners before I
can do anything useful so pretty much
everything is in motion all the time and
that's why people struggle with it so
let me give you an example of how we can
separate the pieces out so that instead
of being totally dependent on one
another we can perform some limited
actions where the piece is act
completely independently so if you think
about it the Rubik's Cube most people
like to think in terms of sides but
that's actually a mistake it's better to
think in terms of the pieces so there's
corner pieces and there's edge pieces
the centerpieces never move a lot of
people don't realize that but the
centerpieces really never move but I
won't get into I won't get into explain
that's assumed let's just assume that
okay and really if I had just these four
moves where I have the exes I could
solve the whole puzzle if I could move
any corner wherever I wanted it to be if
I could move any edge wherever I wanted
it to be and then once they're in places
I might need to rotate them and orient
them or flip them around if I could flip
any corner or flipping the edge then
then boom I could solve the whole puzzle
the problem is it's very difficult to do
any of these moves without pretty much
scrambling all the pieces on the cube so
let me give you an example
ample of a move ok let's look at this
state a second okay in this state
everything from here down is totally
solved okay we're going to work on this
one just because it's the easiest one to
do okay it's the easiest one to to
visualize okay we're going to work on
flipping an edge okay so everything from
here down is perfectly solved and I have
to flip this piece around this is pieces
in the right position it's the red and
white edge I just have to take it out
and turn it around okay same with this
yellow one I have to be able to take
this one out and turn it around how can
I do that without scrambling if I could
perform these moves independently if I
could for example just switch two
corners or just flipped some edges then
I could move the pieces into position
kind of one at a time does that make
sense I wouldn't have to i'm just trying
to remove the dependence on so what's
this a second okay just follow this red
piece first thing I'm going to do is I'm
just going to take this from going to
separate this red from the red edge from
the red corners by moving it out here
okay then I'm going to take these red
and move them around to the back and
then this red can slide from front to
back so that's the way I'm going to
reconnect these pieces okay not a very
long move you don't necessarily have to
get the move but just understand that
I've just done this very short simple
move to just take this piece at and
reconnect it the problem is that in
doing so I've pretty much scrambled the
entire puzzle and that's where people
get stuck so in an attempt to do what
I'm talking about here which is to make
the pieces independent of one another we
have to be able to overcome that so how
can I then solve how can i restore the
bottom of the cube is anybody let's take
a take a guess at it I'll give you a
clue I was just there a second ago this
was just the bottom of the puzzle was
just perfect just a second ago no okay
good well if I reverse every single
thing I just did then the bottom would
be restored now on the surface that
seems trivial because of course then
that would end up unlimited all this
work to flip but the move I just
performed had no effect on the top side
other than on this one piece therefore
if I would have turned this piece into
this position and there's no collateral
damage over here i just switched which
pieces
going to get the unflavored so I move
this to the back and remove the piece
out to the front all this is the reverse
of the move I just did then boom the
bottom is restored and then the top to
sob I just move this piece back so boom
I've just done this one piece instead of
you know really instead of having the
pieces be dependent on one another I've
essentially created a way to do just a
very small action with it without a lot
of collateral damage does that make
sense and I could just easily walk
through all four of these moves the
corner is essentially the exact flipping
the corner is exactly the same except
one goes clockwise and the other
counterclockwise which makes total sense
and believe it or not moving the pieces
is even a shorter move but it's actually
just part of the move we just saw so
it's even shorter but I won't walk
through them because I don't think it
makes good TV here but but you get the
point if you could do these four things
if you could separate your your overall
randomness into just in just these four
components all of which by the way based
on that same principle which is I'm
doing something forward and doing
something reverse so essentially one
single concept one single move really
can solve the whole puzzle so how does
this help me in the pizza business how
does all this separation help me in the
pizza business well I'll just give one
little simple example um when I moved
from my home kitchen into the commercial
kitchen I changed the way that I store
my dough so most people if you're going
to p3 is they'll have these trays
they'll have a tray and then the tray
they'll be spot for six or eight
different dough balls and the trays will
stack up and they'll have a couple of
hundred dough balls in there and as
they're making pizza they take a tray
out and they scooped up one dough ball
and that's the one they're making the
problem is is that if I take the lid off
of thick a lid off of a tray to pull out
dough ball number one and then I don't
have to make another pizza for another
five or ten minutes well then dough
balls two through six are drying out so
that they're one pizza it becomes
dependent on the next so I made the
decision very early on to put all the
dough balls into separate containers
just so that they would have their own
individual life cycle and as soon as I
as soon as I thought of that
um you know it immediately you know it
immediately just fit it fits into this
saying mentally for me I was I was sure
I was like oh is this going to be the
right move for me because it would seem
like a lot of extra work and it is a
little bit of extra but of course I knew
it was the right thing because anything
like that is this any type of a
separation is in advance over I mean how
random is it we talk about everything's
being randomly connected people to one
is now randomly connected to be 26 which
could come at any time depends on when
some random person comes through the
door you can see how these things
collide with one another and by
separating things out I I make I go a
long way to preventing that similarly we
have one big pizza oven right now and
with one big pizza oven every pie you
put in affects the PI right next to it
so if i put in a pizza pie on once one
slot then the next pie that goes in
right after that the stone that it's
sitting on is cooler because the pipe I
number one took all the heat off of that
stone so again similar sort of a
situation okay all right let me talk now
now I'm going to go into the software
aspect of this and I'm going to try and
relate all this so um like I said I
started doing I start dealing with
databases a lot of different vertical
applications and I immediately noticed
that a lot of these these legacy systems
that I came upon them even systems that
were being developed new well being
programmed in a semi-random way to be
honest with you so just give an example
here so let's say that I have a sales
screen so I've got a little water
processing screen where someone can you
know I've got a warehouse full of stuff
and I gotta you know person on the phone
taking call some customers and they get
a call and they're going to punch in you
know and the water products X and it's
going to come out of the warehouse it's
going to go it's going to go to my
customer and so let's say behind the
screen there are ten pages of code to do
all the management behind the screen
well very quickly we'd realize well we
don't just have that one task we're not
just selling things we also are doing
repairs so repairs are a little
different we're pulling items back from
customers and they're going into a
different location there's still part of
our inventory and I can't lift things
get stolen still got to know where they
are but they're going to a diff
sort of a pot blah blah blah blah blah
some things are the same some things are
different so for example sales might
have sales tax whereas repairs don't
have sales tax both have a shipping
address so some of them things are
similar and some things are not so
similar so we see that there's
variations on that theme and in addition
to repairs i might do service orders
which don't have physical goods but may
be judged by the hour i'm doing contract
work with fixed prices whatever so i
have a variety different task and i
immediately notice that a lot of the way
these things were programmed in the real
world where people would take the 10
pages of code and found it difficult to
figure out how to get all those to
co-exist without these big branching
case statements so instead they would
really just separate the screen so they
end up with the sales screen and a
separate screen for repairs and step for
service and contract next up I noticed
that there were different audiences
looking looking at that water so the
customer service rep is looking at the
order then the salesman may want to go
online and look at the order the guy in
the fact we may be looking at inventory
aspects of the of that order and then
the customers themselves was going to
get some is going to get a copy of the
water either in an email or print out or
something but each of these might be
seeing something slightly different for
example the customer service rep on his
screen he might see a credit score come
up for that customer or credit limit or
something like that well the salesman
might see that but the guy in the
factory probably shouldn't see that and
the guy in the factory might see
inventory information as you don't
necessarily want your sales guys to be
privy to so so each person is looking at
a slight variation on this on this order
and they're doing it not just for the
sale but for all of these and then in
addition to that we have different
outputs so some people are seeing things
to the screen others to the printer you
know the guys in accounting when
everything dumped able to excel you
might have an HTML version so you end up
with a lot of versions and in the real
world what I saw was code exploding I've
seen companies that had pretty like a
simple company that saw that had had a
they styled like packaging like the
plastic that you can't cut on when you
buy when you buy a tool they sold that
sort of packaging and they had 135,000
pages of code eight million lines of
code running their order processing and
inventory systems and this is one okay
and so of course that's just the sales
module then you have all these other
modules you have distribution receiving
and you have finance and you have the
customers themselves in HR and
manufacturing Purchasing using tor you
have always different modules many of
which oftentimes are coded by separate
people um what will happen is you'll get
a get a you know one of these big firms
and accounting firm want to name any
names but who'll come to you and they'll
say oh you want inventory we have
inventory and they'll show you an
inventory module that was coded by
somebody doesn't work there anymore and
you want purchasing we do we have a
purchase imagine you say this of the
module they don't mention the fact that
they're coated totally separately and
all we have a lot of thing you need
always do is reconnective of course it's
in the reconnecting of them that you end
up with this with this mess that I call
the Frankenstein model which is really
my example in this in this in this
presentation of things that are really
truly randomly connected ok so what was
the solution to this so what was what
what solutions were proposed well I saw
a lot of people gravitating toward these
toolkits so toolkit like something like
a power bill this is early on let's take
something like a power bill so
powerbuilder you know in if you just
were to use a rough tool like just C++
or something like that then you really
would have you have no tools available
you'd be just doing everything from
scratch so people coated these toolkits
something like a power building where
they took all these data management
tools and try to encapsulate them into
into different little tool boxes that
you could use so for example there would
be SQL query tools there would be a tool
for drawing tables there would be
reporting tools but you know they didn't
get it all and so what ended up
happening was that you know as as as
these things were coded as individual
modules with code to do with a lot that
wasn't wasn't up here and so you'd end
up seeing a lot of code down here so for
example if you're if you're typing in
the name of a customer you can look up
that customer to make sure that would
you know you might just type you know
you typing in Google's mite geoo and you
hope that it's going to find Google so
you have to do a lookup so is that done
on your individual screen well a lot of
times it was and then the guy in the
inventory might need to do the same
thing for a product and the guy over
here might need to do the same thing for
something else so you would see
that there's a lot of duplication of
effort down here but then over time you
know people would take the best of these
would be put into a separate little tool
kit that be sold in separate product and
eventually a lot of these end up getting
rolled into the product itself but would
you still have at this point in time is
a bunch of separate tools that do not
interconnect in a powerful way okay okay
so I I knew instinctively at this point
observing this over and over and over
again in multi-million dollar projects
that there were just that this wasn't
the answer that there was another level
or another phase okay let's look at this
screen for a second I'm going to begin
to break it down so this is a very very
typical you know data view screen so
this is a screen of order art so we've
got a whole bunch of people order a
bunch of stuff and so you know here I
have order number one in the air voter
I'm instead order number two and order
order number three and these are the
individual line items within that so we
see the name of the customer the order
item the product codes product
description sizes prices you see all
these different things okay and this
would be coded back in the old days this
would be coated one off by a developer
so if you wanted the screen look at this
you had to have a developer that would
actually code something like this so he
would get a search tool so built into
these toolkits you can see it search
tool so at least he's not you know
connecting creating his own connections
to the database he's got a tool to do
that but he's got to ride a lot of code
so he calls his search tool and he puts
in his query and then he initiate some
sort of a grid tool and then he goes
through all the day to all the different
rows and takes individual pieces of data
out of his query and pushes pushes them
into the grid and at the end he goes
column by column and he he specifies
what formatting so for example the
currency is going to be formatted he
gives he gives he gives the formatting
that he wants to see this blade for that
for the currency and so this is what you
would see kind of at this at this at
this middle level of how how data would
be would be displayed Pam but i knew
when i was looking at this situation
that this left a lot of room to be
desired because once the data was pushed
into this table there wasn't a whole lot
you
do with it other than nipple eight the
data that was actually here so for
example let's say that I have a product
code over here well my actual join to
this product table is not through a code
or through the description but it's
through some sort of a secret you know
hidden key number well that's not wasn't
put on this screen because we'd it
wasn't part of the display so
essentially you couldn't do a join from
here you there was no interface for
example for user to do a join from this
point of time you would even have
problems at this point doing well okay
so anyway I noticed that there were that
that they were all and even though this
has a certain degree of complexity I
noticed that there was a lot more
complexity and a lot of things in
computers that were hating him a lot
better so if computers really all about
handling variations if you think about
it so I have different image formats
JPEGs gifts p and you I have different
video formats I have different types of
data foreign keys money dates images
barcodes you know I have different GUI
controls I have checkboxes and radio
buttons and sliders and scroll boxes in
combobox menus pull downs and pop ups
that's always different so it computers
one way to think about peers is it's
just taking vast amount of variations
and and getting them all to work
together well there's a formula for
making these things work together that
really is what makes them into plug in
place so plug and play itself has a
formula and what you see is that these
end up getting these variations end up
getting bundled together and being dealt
with via the construction of frameworks
and that frameworks have very very
specific a very very specific
architecture and that's what I'm going
to talk I'm gonna talk about a very
specific architecture that I call a
mature framework a lot of times what
you'll see is a mature framework will
start off as an immature framework so
that powerbuilder like what i was
talking about where where you would
start with a tool you would start with a
tool damned believes and then they would
work their way up to the core eventually
that's really the beginnings of a
framework but it's really not a mature
framework by time you get in
handling this the way the operating
system does it ends up having a very
very specific structure and so what I
wanted to do is I wanted to take the
elements of data the different output
methods those different tasks with
different audiences these were the three
I saw in the Rubik's Cube and and and
then many others and I wanted to roll
them into a framework and I knew that
the framework if it was properly
structured would reconnect these and
that that reconnection is what creates
that level of mastery it's creating you
so that they powerfully interconnect so
let's talk about this for a second okay
so what is the difference between the
doing things in a framework versus doing
things with tools so let's say for
example the operating system something
for which probably almost familiar so
the operating system deals with a lot of
different things but I think the two
primary it could be argued the two
primary things that deals with our
threads and windows so it has a lot of
other things like fonts and and all
different kinds of hardware stuff but
the primary thing you could make a case
is it deals with H wins it feels with
Windows and it deals with with threads
and I want to talk for example about
Windows is it good as a good example so
you don't own your own windows all the
windows are just data that is registered
with the operating system so you might
have a rapper if you're coding in C++
you might have a sea wind or something
you might have a wrapper around rage but
basically all that is is is a pointer or
handle to the operating systems version
of your of your H wind so the benefit of
that is that nothing happens to that H
wind outside of you know that the
operating system doesn't know about you
don't have access to the h win to change
a variable that might be contained in
the h 0 instructor you can't move it to
a new position there's an API call that
somebody else wrote that that the same
person that's responsible for the
outbreak system wrote and they'll move
it for you so you can you can make a
request to move it but and then they
will change their own data and then do
all the house housekeeping associated
with that and that's how things happen
and that's why you can for example log
on to a sheen and change your fiends
even though you have like 10 /
Graham's running you can change the
theme of the bars on the windows because
the operating system really owns all the
windows doesn't matter what program is
running okay so what you end up with
then is an API you end up with the
operating system holding these tables of
registered I optics and you end up with
a bunch of API is that you can call that
will will modify these and then if
you're operating at this level would you
get instead of holding your data is you
get event pump down so the events are
pumped down to you if you want to
respond to events you have to make an
API call which then affects the data and
then the API call does whatever cleanup
is necessary to run at this stage okay
let me blow this out in a in a in a
different way actually we do this slide
okay so here's here's the kind of a blow
out of one of those layers okay okay so
this is a this is a framework later so
this is my lair and I now own all the
data so instead of for example creating
a tool for you to search on data and
then a little tool for you display your
data like we were doing in that in that
in that list of order items instead I'm
going to create a framework where the
framework is going to own all the data
so you can make a request to create a
data can list container for example a
table container and then you can pass a
query or Select Clause to that container
and then you can make changes to the
container by by having an API call that
would that would make a change to the
sides of the number of rows or anything
in that container but basically the
level above you really owns the
container the framework owns of the
container and everything you do is
really at its permission okay so over
here you have an API managed list of
data so this could be H wins if you're a
not bring system it could be database
tables it could be pointers to records
on the database if we're at the level
that I was talking about then over here
we have all the toolkits that you can
call to change the day that's being held
by the container and we can modify these
in some white several ways so here for
example we have a we have sweet number
sweet a and what I can do is I can
a little bit I can I can make an
addendum on to that so it may be maybe
that maybe when a message comes down
here the ninety-nine percent of time I
let the default handler handle it full
and they're called back this sweet well
maybe I meant to make one little
addition to it so I can change this
layer and I can either do it down here I
can make my code to change down here
directly or possibly i can go over here
and change the handler and make an
addendum to the tool itself so that it
can handle it for all the layers that
you're created down here so for example
if I'm wanted to do lookups a certain
way that was maybe a slight modification
on the way that the framework did
lookups I could go over here and create
a generic lookup manager that would
apply to all the screens as I've created
and that would get its caught that would
get its call as the default handler and
then would pass the bulk of the work
down to the handler below it or I could
completely substitute a tool if I wanted
to we see this in the operating systems
is what started up things are all about
you have always different different you
know if you think of these as different
components of the operating system when
you start up you you add on to certain
components you change you change or swap
out certain components um let's see go
back a layer okay so in addition to
having the operating system or having
your framework layer handle the data it
also handles lists of functions and is
there a whiteboard in here or it's not
okay um I noticed a long time ago that a
lot of people want to code things in
hierarchies and hierarchies were
essentially you have hierarchies of if
you look at an object oriented you have
data and function if that's the essence
of each object is you have a bundle of
data and then you have the functions
that go with it the problem is is a lot
of times you really want mult some sort
of multiple inheritance where you know I
might have a data object here and then
it might have two children and then I
want to have a data object here that
pulls both from this and from this
especially a lot of times the
functionality so what ends up happening
is you into taking that functionality
off and you end up putting it on lists
and that's really what this is this this
is a dinette function let me give you an
example let's say that I right mouse
click on a file
on my desktop well a menu pops up where
I can do I can surf it's a folder I can
search on it but maybe i've added
functions that didn't exist in the
operating system so maybe i have a
backup function i'm using Carbonite or
something so i can set the Carbonite
settings where i'm using svn tortoise or
one of these are one of these sorts of
things that will sync my files with
something else when is that code where
is where is that code you know when I
right mouse click how does it know that
Carbonite can affect that file well
essentially the operating system has
lists of functions that can apply when
you right mouse click on something and
you can add your list it might start off
you start you off with a list and then
you can add your own items to the list
and you don't just provide the code
oftentimes there's a whole table of
parameters that goes with that that's
telling the epogen when and where that
code can be used so that a lot of it
gets managed without having to be any
any interaction with the code itself um
let's see let me go back a slide locked
in this locked in this little thing here
must be one of these okay all right so
let's see what that would look like for
our screen okay so let's see what that
looks like for the screen so before the
screen there was a whole bunch of code
okay and that code was it was
semi-random in the sense that the guy
who wrote that code might not even be
here anymore as i said as i keep giving
that as an example and in order to
modify that code we'd have to actually
go into the code crack the code read the
code compile the code etc here's another
way of constructing the screen really
without a whole lot of code instead the
screen is going to be created by the
framework which interconnects all the
parts so over here for example we have a
column registry so here for example we
have an order item sku ID so that's
that's the name of a vest name of a
column and we can see that that's a
foreign key that that points to the sku
to our product and this is the specific
column this is the name of the column
this is order item that sku ID and this
is the column of the points to which is
skewed rd okay then over here we have
another order we have an order item that
has a unit price and that unit prices is
going to be handled by a code bye-bye
owed by an object called currency and
then I have an order item called total
price and this is also managed by
currency but unlike either price this
one is summable so if I had a list of
unit prices I wouldn't want to see them
some but here listo prices I might so
basically the framework sets out what
it's willing to handle and what its will
and when it's not one hand so it creates
a standard by which all the people that
come next all the users of the framework
know what information is needed then
over here I have a table registry so
here I've defined my product my skew and
I said it's ID column is ID the code
handler is the default one for handling
tables and then over here just as give
an example of a column that I might have
on this table is that I'm saying that
the default join anytime someone joins
over to this column table they probably
really want to see see not just not just
not just the ID but they probably want
to see the style code the style name and
the size so if you see over here and it
is color coded but you probably can't
see in the screen that these three
columns the product code the style name
and this and the size well all exist
here and they're all kinds of colored
together
probably can't see that but then over
here I have a registry for the view so
that's what actually creates this so
I've registered this view it's tables
order item it's just given a name given
a default handler and then I have a
Select Clause but within the Select
Clause oops-a-daisy okay all right so
anyway so the currency obviously is
going to be applied to the unit price in
the Select Clause and then this default
joint is going to be applied over here
so that all I'm saying is I want to
default and then it will build this it
will build and construct this view for
me so there's no coding involved
everything is handled in an
interconnected way through a series of
framework code which can loop through
these lists of information if you
compare this for example to the code
that had to be written before to create
the exact same screen just here
somewhere you can see this was an awful
lot of uneditable code whereas the other
thing was was whereas with the framework
everything is totally generic and yet
you have the same functionality but now
you can go beyond this functionality let
me give you an example where you're
going to go beyond the functionality so
I always talk about how in the in the
last stage of mastery where things are
powerfully connected you have the
ability to improvise so I talked about
Robin Williams improvising or Tiger
Woods improvising let's look at how this
can create help help you improvise so
let's see what do I have okay so because
this screen now this is the same screen
because this screen is not owned by the
person that programmed it but rather is
simply something that's registered with
a framework the framework can now
manipulate it in a powerful way in fact
i could write i could have written this
whole function and i'm about to do after
the guy that wrote the screen doesn't
even work here anymore i can add
functionality to a thousand back I can
make it backwards compatible with a
thousand old screams because I have it
I'm not really asking for much new
information I'm certainly not asking for
anything new code to be written so as
part of this little demo thing what I
did was I created a new table called a
reward program so
he's got our customers and we want to
divide them until you know gold you know
gold platinum or silver rewards
something like that so just prior to
this screen running this table was
created so it didn't even exist the
table the rewards table didn't exist 10
minutes before this demo and nor did the
field called company dot rewards program
so there's another tear this is the
table the table that we're looking at
here is the company table and then the
reward program is a point where probably
idea is a pointer on to yet another
table so essentially where if we were
starting on the order item table where
two joins away from seeing the word gold
or plat it makes sense but what I've
done here is now is provided a
completely generic interface to bring up
a table like this that will let me drill
in to to to these things that have a
relation to these columns of have a
relation and now we're going to select
the reward program and in fact we've
selected two columns you just like the
de roared program and we've selected
that we also want to compare the reward
program versus the type of the product
so we originally had the product code
style and main but we really weren't
seeing the type of the part whether it's
an earring or whether it's a necklace or
anything like that so I've specified
that I want to see both the reward
program and the type and then I hit this
little button over here called the pen
columns and I can go back through this
data table that it owns it's owned by
the framework and it can go back find
all the hidden data that's behind you
that it managed because it's the one
that does the queries in the first place
which moes make sure that the data needs
is available and stored and then it goes
back and pulls up those additional
columns that didn't exist a minute ago
now we can actually run you get another
function on this which is we can
actually run a summary so there were
hundreds of rows they were two hundred
and seven rows behind me so nine of
those were silver pins and then a
subtotal then you have a subtotals of
all the different items that all
different columns that specify
themselves having the summer bowl
characteristic that makes sense and then
you can continue on to hit a button
called show detail where you could then
actually highlight the columns that
you're interested in and then it would
it would then pull the detail up from
the summary so to actually have coded
this on an individual screen which was
being done before when you had a tool
kit
was basically impossible no one was
going to coat all this functionality
into into it using raw toolbox tools but
as a framework where things are managed
at a higher level that's what that that
this is the kind of sort of thing that
becomes part this making sense so the
interesting thing about this though from
each room for what I'm trying to project
is that when I was dealing with the
dilute the individual tools to construct
things like this I was very cognizant
because of the mastery principles that I
had an idea of what it would look like
before and I could compare it I could I
could find I could find things that I
had done or things that I were posing
and then compared them and say is this
going to create a way for people to
generically edit this at the end have we
handled all the exceptions that we need
to handle how we handled all the rules
that we need to handle you know is that
our boundaries or the layers between the
way things connect properly structured
and if you can answer yes to those that
you're going in the right direction if
you can't and you're still kind of
building tools and you something you
just know you're not at the right stage
and you don't want to code yourself into
a corner which I've seen a lot of people
a lot of times it's happen that makes
sense so anyway so that's the point
that's basically what I want to talk
about today just to give a little flavor
and now we enter the picture of pizza
and that's it so if there's any
questions more than you thought you were
getting out of pizza
yeah I'll give an example so um when
when you were when you're doing
something that's not when you're at the
early stages and you make a mistake
early you can't self-correct just really
you don't have the school tools or
skills to do that and my peach is really
good when I make it myself at home in a
very controlled situation opening the
restaurant is a whole nother level
that's a whole nother ball of wax we've
got a lot of people touching the dough
the dough goes through you know a two
day cycle and there's a lot of you know
no one works two days straight so those
different people working on every little
aspect of this and so while we while we
try to get things right the first time
of course there's that understanding
that that's not real if that's not
really possible at the stage that we're
at right now you know and they may never
be possible so we have to be at you have
to be more flexible so that we can
correct situations later a lot of
pizzerias they don't really care they
fix this problem because they don't
really care what the dough case like so
they just they make the dough and then
two hours later they can use it as a
down we age the dough for a long period
of time which creates all these
different potential problems so so you
know we've had a variety of breakdowns
and sometimes what I've done is I've
simulated breakdown so that people can
learn how to recover from certain
situations so we had a situation for
example where the dough was over proofed
and it was just warmed too long and was
kept in a warm see the air conditioning
didn't work properly or was kept in a
warm spot or whatever and so now we need
to learn how to stretch though that
wasn't that wasn't ideal and that could
be a train wreck you have customers
coming if you have customers in the
coming in the door so some of the things
that we've done is we've actually
simulated that in advance so that we
could look for processes at every stage
of the game saying okay how can we
correct horrible dar was just something
we can do a horrible dough and it turns
out that if you you know it becomes very
hard to stretch and it gets holes in it
but if you
though if you microwave every single
dough for example then it becomes a lot
easier to stretch if you pre examine if
you take the dough and kind of triage
the dough and look underneath it you can
see the beginnings of holes forming and
you can get rid of those early in the
day before you know customers start
arriving in mass so there's a variety of
just kind of sort of pushing yourself
pushing yourself to the next level
things because you know that you're
going to experience this and then and in
some days honestly it's not helpful but
it's just comforting to know that that
this is part of the process but part of
the process is it works one day and it
doesn't work the nest and it doesn't
matter whether it's software it doesn't
matter whether it's golf it doesn't
matter whether whether it's pizza it's
just that's the process that you're
going through and that there's a lot of
time involved you know I mean another
thing that it helps with really is is
just going deeper I think that most
people will into the ingredients of the
example I gave you know we're just
continually testing there's a lot of
people to get a they get a they get a
tomato from a supplier and then that
sick we know that every bachelor comes
in might be a little different and every
season of tomatoes is a little different
than the season before that we have to
that we have to look at the batch codes
and notice these these these sorts of
things breaking things into finer and
finer distinctions
right
you
yes
no no definitely not oh absolutely I may
have only been added for a few months
and you know and and nasty mastery is a
process though so let me let me talk a
little bit about this just for a second
because a lot of people say oh you don't
Jeff you're a perfectionist but it's
actually perfectionism and master you're
almost opposite if you think about it
perfectionist both look the same because
they might be trying to get to a
specific point but a perfectionist is
really someone who's kind of emotionally
attached to things being one way am a
perfectionist never looks like he's in
control he's always stressed out because
things are not the way they're supposed
to be it's almost the opposite of a
master who looks cool and collected you
know even when things are changing
around him that makes sense so like the
example I always give is a you know you
know James Barnes you know he's we were
fascinated by looking at masters because
it's the more you because they can do
anything and because the more even in
odd situations and the more you look at
it the more depth you see in it so you
know James Bond you know is an alligator
coming at him he looks around you know
he he can kill it with a bobby pin and a
razor yeah sometimes he can like figure
out how to make that how to make that
make make it work he's not trying to
pre-plan everything he's just walking
through the situation and taking what
comes you see this with me with Louis
Armstrong if you listen to louis
armstrong play the trumpet which i
highly recommend you know a true master
you know of the 20th century and you
listen to it you can listed 100 tons
she's like have you do that exactly
right how did he know that that exact
time you know when frank sinatra waits a
little extra second to sing that note
and is off timing it sounds perfect we
knew and I do it just sounds like look
crap so so so how does that how does
that how does that happen you know
they're not trying to sit there make it
work right one particular way instead
they have this power to to to to
improvise based on everything that's
happening lu mu should just let guys in
the band jazz riff and then he would
just riff off of that you know just like
Robin Williams does with the audience
and in a way that's the whole point
really of of this exercise is that this
summary this sort of summary data is an
improvised thing
and um you know which is it possible you
know trying to get everything just right
this is why in a way you know one of the
things I had on the little fill chart
was I talked about the at the very first
chart worked where I talked about the
different stages that is I had the
economy you know planned economy you
know is perfectionism as utopianism is
trying to get everything just right you
can't get everything just right you know
as if we're as a free market is is
self-correcting and because there's
thousands of people looking at
individual prices you know all the time
the price becomes the interconnecting
part that connects all the different
aspects of the economy almost any time
there for you engage in price fixing to
distort prices in some way which is what
you do in a planned economy is just a
series of one type of price fix after
another you know things never really
work out and even something looks like
it's a cap is it's a free market
capitalist if it's if it's heavily
regulated or heavily heavily price fixed
then you know then it won't be flexible
you know sure
yeah yeah yes
well we're learning haha that's all i
could say what's that well you know we
know we have you know we have our
processes like any business does you
know when i make site i'm gonna make a
change i write it down i have us have a
list of all the employees they have to
you know they i decided this is that the
specification on a way to cheese is
going from hundred thirty grams 150 then
you know I I literally have every person
in the kitchen have to sign off on that
so because we did have problems really
out what people like well I didn't you
told a this person but not this person
so we do these you know with these
simple things not everything works every
shift so it's hard to communicate so we
just do written written sort of
processes but you know I'd be lying if I
said that you know we are at stage 3 we
are we are not at stage 3 we are
absolutely positively at stage 2 and
even when you're at stage for your
continued station evident really end but
but but there is some sort of a shift at
some point where you can see that you've
hit stage 3 I mean this sort of
programming is clearly you know at a
different level than just building than
just building a screen would be and just
hoping you know I mean I look at this
all the time I was on my time on my bank
screen all time i reconcile my bank book
every day and you know all my check
registers on the bank you know as well
an HTML you can even copy it into a
spreadsheet without the tabs going on
you know well the kind of things
wrapping and all this stuff so you know
clearly you know there's a there's a
there's a there's a dearth of thinking
about how that can be usable in improv
situation in multiple situations you
know there's the tools haven't been
constructed or haven't been utilized
properly to to laugh and we're a long
way from being able to highlight three
checks and and comparing them to the
month of checks and the same vendors
another time like that would be a
feature I would love you know click a
check and then it would know you know
everybody everybody else you know that i
sent that check to you know sub totaled
and maybe not just even one but maybe
multiple checks i could see things in a
group if i highlight all my cheese
vendors that i pay through through the
computer actually are paid on the bank's
website like i lied you know three
checks and say I want to see all the
checks that match the vendor on this
check yeah they don't have that then I
yeah this is this
this that's easy you know that's it's
easy it's easy to say for example that I
want to highlight you know this necklace
and then I want a right mouse-click and
have it highlight all the other
necklaces you know that that's a
function that could be built generically
but it can't be built generically if if
what you've displayed doesn't contain
all information all you the information
has been put into display and there's
nothing behind it in some sort of a
framework that make sense yeah anybody
well you guys got to come and taste the
pizza that's the bottom line so what's
that yeah I think I think Mike was
talking about that so I would be great
we're gonna do a little pizza and beer
things don't allow these tastings and
and that's interesting thing too because
you know we did tasting for example with
with a beer vendor and they had like 40
people come and I had six beers and had
his pair of the reason they said it was
like the best one they'd ever done like
we just opened we shouldn't be the best
one they've done in years you know as
well as other restaurant but one thing
that we have that a la Villa guys don't
have is we just taste everything so it's
just a sensitizes are powered so like
just the fact that we've tasted 28
oreganos and over 50 tomatoes and you
know and over 50 kinds of cheese and
over almost 100 types of olive oil gives
us a little bit of a different power and
we have an ability to mix and match
things in a way and even to create we
actually created a couple pizzas that
didn't matter did match any of things we
had in the menu we're able to create mix
and match certain things between Heather
and I because we have have built up
those techniques and have that more
defined of a power and definition is all
about separation what's that she's got a
good beer belly maybe hahaha anything
else guys sure absolutely
