dear friend tom oliver is an inspiring
example that a person in ordinary
circumstances with the right intention
can accomplish extraordinary things a
few years ago while tom was vacationing
in berlin he passed by brandenburg gate
and he told himself i am going to create
the largest well peace festival in the
world right here and remember that back
then tom was not rich nor famous he was
just an ordinary guy with a big dream
who was creating greater good in the
world and we fast forward to today tom
is on the verge of organizing the
largest war peace festival in history he
has founded the Lopez partnership and he
has also gathered an impressive list of
big names behind him including the
United Nations at Bishop Desmond Tutu
and Richard Branson tom is an amazing
human being and I'm delighted and
humbled to have a deal friend like him
and my friends I give you Tom Oliver
wow that was quite an introduction what
thank you so much me um it's true a few
years back I came to this place in
Berlin and I don't know how many of you
have been in Berlin there is this place
where the wall used to be and you come
to this place which is full of history
and and and magic at the same time and
you see where a city formerly divided
has become one and it's a good symbol
for what we're talking about today
because I wouldn't be standing here
talking to you right now if I didn't
believe that will peace is actually
possible so before I give you my take on
our take on world peace and Silicon
Valley's stake in the game which is the
topic for today let's talk a minute or
two about conflict and war in the world
I brought you some statistics which kind
of set the stage for the talk today um
more conflicts are now ended by
settlements and negotiations than by
military victory I just to give you some
some numbers it was 40 22 23 and 9 in
the 1990s and now it's 17 24 between two
thousand and two thousand five but
military expenditure has increased forty
five percent over the last ten years um
if we're looking at the opportunity
costs of war this is absolutely
staggering so if we're just looking at
the conflict in the Middle East the
opportunity costs are put at roughly
thirteen billion we're also working with
something called the Institute for
economics and peace and they are the
worldwide leaders when it comes to facts
about violent conflict and war and I got
the latest stats from them about the
opportunity cost of violence in the
world it's now estimated to be over 8.12
trillion in 2010 so it's just get this
from
it's 8.12 trillion if the world became
twenty-five percent more peaceful in
2010 we would have seen the global
economy have a boost of over 2 trillion
u.s. dollars just in 2010 and just think
about what we could do with that money
so we could um avoid actually the worst
effects of global climate change we
could reach the UN MDGs and we could
actually at one stroke we could
eliminate the public debt of Greece
Portugal and Ireland so that's kind of
the stage for what we're talking about
today however if you look at peace
agreements and negotiations about forty
percent of them fail over time and a
good question is why and one of the
reasons is that um peace is seen as
something quite passive and weak and
peace is seen as something that we talk
or think about when we have violent
conflict so people then they sit down
and they try to reach settlements but
the problem is the real causes of
violence and of war and never really
addressed so we kind of try to cure the
the symptoms what we're not not really
getting at the the roots and the sources
of conflict in the world today so i
would like to start with asking you the
audience at random what you think what
what peace is to you really because one
of the funny things i've seen over the
years is that everybody defines peace
very differently and I'm asked a lot of
time so what's peace to you so let's
start right here what's what is what is
peace to you okay it's very good very
good we go
okay oh absolutely I absolutely right so
for you it's more about inner peace and
for you it's more about ending violent
conflict on the outside okay very good
someone else what do you what's peace to
you peaceful minds very good okay here
we go what's it to you physical safety
and respect respect is a good one
actually comes up very rarely very good
what about you any ideas on what what it
is to you know many okay here we go some
personal happiness very good point um I
met representative from the UM from
Bhutan recently I don't know if you're
aware they have a gross national product
of happiness they define which is I
think quite a nice nice take on it so I
think happiness is an important point M
une what what it means to you
forgiveness that's a good one very good
very good how would forgiveness relate
to peace in your um in your opinion
mm-hmm very good absence of conflict
very good very good point forgiveness i
think is a is rarely comes up at very
very good point um please having the
power to choose okay could you elaborate
on that just just a second
to determine one's destiny versus being
controlled and having very confined
options very good could you bring that
up when i was talking about berlin i was
i was born in germany so I was raised
with that kind of conflict of those two
countries and I think if you look at um
former East Germany having um having the
freedom to choose is something that was
quite critical there because it really
wasn't available that much the options
were very confined it's a very good
point some more contributions may be
from back there what peace means to you
sorry justice how would you define
justice ok we just this as a Napster
good very good ok very good point um do
you have a suggestion
be able to move about without fear is an
important point yeah I think that's
that's very important um I was a surfing
at Mavericks yesterday half moon bay and
I had the strong fear of sharks actually
because it's the great white shark kind
of triangle so fear is something that I
think fear has many different forms I
think there is a natural fear we have
which is justified and there is
something else that you know we all know
the kind of a mind game of fear we're
playing and and that's very very real as
well and is influencing a lot of our
choices and then obviously fear is very
real when you're in a conflict zone and
experiencing violent conflict so very
good point good so um before I start
with my take on world peace and I'm
sorry I'm engaging the audience so much
but I really think it's so much fun and
I always talk about the brilliant minds
at Google wherever I go so i think i
have to engage a little bit of that here
um i would like to have some initial
feedback of what you think what what we
would need to create world peace just
some kind of in a sentence or two what
do you think it starts i mean if we talk
about inner peace then this would be
methods to achieve in a piece right if
we talk about conflict is there
something that's lacking in the world
today what you think we should have that
too um create peace would there be
something where you think
people not talking to each other very
good point so in terms of connectivity
would then be something that could that
could help very very good point other
ideas just kind of terms of a brainstorm
education very good point
read your daily newspaper mm-hmm very
very good point could you repeat that so
I can give it to the camp ok very good
okay now you reach your daily newspaper
because um educated people people panic
more intelligently very good point yeah
very very nice that's a nice one i'll
make a mental note of that very very
good other suggestions basic needs being
met ok right
mm-hmm I think opportunity goes a little
bit more towards what you were saying
about having the freedom to choose and
the options available and then there are
basic needs as well which have to be met
because if they're not mad where it's
very difficult very good very good any
other suggestions for may be lighter
recent events we've seen around the
world where people start their own
revolutions one of the reasons yeah
please less corruption good point that's
corruption okay very good point your
voice matters
okay okay so not necessarily democracy
but having your voice heard okay very
good point very good point okay any
other suggestions for now okay good very
good um if we look at the the peace
movement in the last 20 30 years I think
what we need is what I was called a
rebranding of peace because if you look
at kind of the woodstock area and and we
know usually when people think about
peace it's something that's quite
passive all right we think about pieces
kind of is a week you know it's passive
is is not doing a lot its kind of the
gun just smoking mario hana kind of yo
easy woodstock it kind of feeling and i
think that's something we need to change
so i think there needs to be a whole
rebranding of peace and also of the
peace movement because peace can be um
something very very powerful and very
strong and i think this is in the minds
of the people that's one of the steps we
have to take on one of my favorite
quotes is that wars start in the minds
of the people before they're ever fought
on the battlefield so this is what
change needs to begin and i think that's
very crucial so when we talk about peace
it's not just having the basic needs
Matt it's not about you know ending
violent conflict it's not about its
about all these things but it's also
about eradicated some of the myths that
have surrounded piece for so long one of
the myths I was talking about in the
beginning namely the opportunity costs
of conflict because if we look at the
last 100 years in the world um we have
been taught that wars actually build
prosperous economies which is not not
true so there are a lot of myths
surrounding peace same as that peace is
you know week and to be you know violent
kind of you know gung-ho out there get
kind of forcefully aggressively getting
things done is very strong and so I
think we when we talk about peace it's
really talking about the inner and the
outer at the same time
and it's also talking about eradicated
those myths rebranding peace but also
educating people so they know what
actually peace means to them and how you
can achieve peace so I think the peace
movement needs the peace movement and
peace as a brand needs kind of a
rebranding so when we talk about how to
create world peace something very
interesting has been happening over the
last 15 20 years when we talk about the
environment and we're in California you
know that's where the environmental
movement really started um so in the
environment in the beginning it was
something that was um supported by a
minority of people it was kind of a
movement the whole green movement
started slowly corporations didn't
really care about you know most of them
about the environment about that
movement um and now it's become so
widespread and now so much support it
through the different layers of society
that corporations now they have to think
about the environment when designing new
products about how to integrate that
into anything to do with a consumer and
so and so on peace is a little bit
unfortunately where the environmental
movement was in the beginning of those
days now we see in the environment we
regularly see leaders from all different
areas come together and address what
holistic solutions should look like for
the environment um it doesn't mean that
the problem has been solved but we do
have these regular meetings of different
leaders from all the different areas we
do not have that for peace so the UN
usually talks I'm generalizing here but
the UN talks to other people in the UN
military talks basically among
themselves well artists are you know
pro-peace anyway but there is no real
interaction then you have governments
corporates don't really pick up on peace
it's not a big topic with corporate so
we're we've been very fortunate in what
we are doing with the world peace
festival in the world peace partnership
to attract some corporates who feel that
they should put that on their flag but
it's really rare
and thanks and it's really rare so
corporations in general do not really
pick up on peace it's it's something
that a little bit where the
environmental movement used to be so
what we need to as a first step to
create peace we need to have gatherings
of different leaders from all those
different areas I'm talking military un
I'm talking artists I'm talking
visionary corporate CEOs I'm talking
grassroots I'm talking to peaceful is
from around the planet to talk about
what holistic sustainable peace building
agendas should look like in the world
today so this is something we don't have
and this is something we absolutely need
um something like the World Economic
Forum comes to my mind but for peace the
only problem is that is that the World
Economic Forum has become a cigar club
for you know a select group of people
who regularly get together but there's
no real um connection with the outside
world so there's no link to the general
public and the masses so to speak I was
first introduced by the UN to UM to
other partners at the United Nations
because we're working with the UN as
well as um with the funny phrase this is
Tommy's doing something like a cross
between life 8 in the World Economic
Forum but what that kind of means is
that we need to have the masses together
with those you know that gathering of
leaders and then it needs to be a
two-way street so that's something we
definitely need unfortunately when we
are talking about big big events like
for instance live 8 live earth but also
other things like you know stones live
in Rio for instance they got over two
million people for a concert together in
Rio and then everybody walked off and
everybody went home and Mick Jagger said
afterwards you know shed hmm we could
have done so much with those two million
people but there's just you know that
there's no interaction there's no that
will continued um activity that caters
to that group of people so it's very
important um life eight for instance it
was more meant as as a message
for two to the outside world to say you
know listen there's something wrong in
Africa you know we need to we need to
look to what's Africa and they need our
help what we need in peace is different
we need to create a piece machine that
really gets things done around the
planet so we need to have those
gatherings of leaders we need to have
the connection to the general public it
needs to be a two-way street this needs
to be regular and this really needs to
involve all different layers of society
so that's something that's very very
crucial and unfortunately was forgotten
with a lot of the major events around
the planet so when we talk about a um a
peace building agenda this has to be
coordinated between all those different
players it has to be something that's
holistic which means it has to really
address all the different sources of
conflict everything you said before is
very very important because everything
you said pertains to peace and so when
we talk about a holistic peacebuilding
agenda it has to involve all those
different areas it has to involve inner
peace but it also has to involve global
connectivity it has to involve conflict
between individuals but also between
nations and it also has to involve the
environment as well as you know the
corporate leaders the military the UN
and so on otherwise we're lacking a
holistic and sustainable agenda and this
will simply not result in peace over
time and will be at the end we'll just
kind of cure the symptoms but not really
address the causes of conflict and any
feedback to this so far any kind of
other ideas you might have or maybe
you're not on the same opinion or
something that like to make this more of
a kind of engaging talk than just kind
of talking at you yeah
financial resources okay so um this goes
a little bit back to the basic needs but
also to the financial resources right so
it's basically about eradicated poverty
which i think is a very very crucial
point in what I'm doing we're working
also with the something called the
global poverty project which the founder
of that was also the founder of the make
poverty history one of the founders of
the Make Poverty History campaign which
resulted in love aight i think that is a
very crucial point and you t need to
engage that in in your strategy which
means eradicated poverty providing basic
needs and also tie into the UNM dgc
millennium development goals of the UN i
think is a very very important point and
need not be forgotten so peace has to be
defined as you're saying as something
more broad and holistic than just
pertaining to you know just inner peace
or just peace on a superficial level
good point you hadn't yeah please uh-huh
okay um yes of course um connection
between peace and the environment um
well first off I think that when we talk
about peace um you can't call yourself
peaceful when you're destroying the
environment at the same time I think we
have to look at peace also in the sense
of a larger context and see that we're
embedded in a environment where life is
based on cooperation not only in society
but also with our planet so first on an
autumn on a broader level I think peace
should pertain to peace within yourself
peace with others but also peace with
the environment at the same time they'll
environment um when we talk about the
environment also has to do with scarce
resources which is something you brought
up before so the fight over scared
resources fights over scarce resources
will unless we resolve the problem the
energy problems and also the problem of
scarce resources and the allocation of
resources around the planet
we'll obviously you know can result in
violent conflict so that's a very very
important point this is all I would see
the environment yeah does that answer
your question very good um yes
very good point so how can we make it
easier for people to engage in the peace
movement right and you were comparing it
to websites and and and engagement of
users ease of engagement yeah exactly
very good
very good very good because you said
you're not a world leader this is what
the barriers of entry is a very act this
is I think one of the myths we're
talking about people generally think
that you know I'm not a president you
know I'm not a billionaire so I can't
really do anything about peace well I'm
I've met billionaires who thought they
couldn't do anything about what P so I
think one of the myths we're talking
about is that people think well they
either think they can't do anything
because they're not a world leader or
they really don't know what to do which
brings us to a very very important topic
namely the kind of call to action what's
the call to action right and I think to
create well peace we need two types of
those calls to action we need a personal
call to action and we need a collective
call to action so what can I do on an
individual level what can I do you know
together with others and this needs to
be as you said um with peace it's true
we need to kind of take people's hands
and show them the way a little bit
because it's not really clear and what
you're saying actually hits the nail on
the head because we don't you know the
majority we don't really know what to do
when it comes to peace you know how can
I help right and which brings us also
back to the theme of the talk today you
know what can Silicon Valley actually do
to to help so answering the first
question um as individuals there's to be
a personal call to action and a
collective call to action so what could
a personal call to action be well the
way I would define it is is that piece
starts with me so it doesn't start with
the others it really has to start with
ourselves one of the fundamental beliefs
we're following in what we're doing is
that will peace really starts with the
individual so that means first it's
about tools it's about how can I be how
can I be more peace with myself so I
would really start at the top with kind
of inner peace right without sounding
too esoteric but how can I be more at
peace with myself and others what do I
do if I'm you know in a situation where
I just want to get a you know hit my
boss or whatever you know we we've all
known the situations where we kind of
you know and um so how can i attain
actually a genuine state of peace
so one thing that we need to do is we
need to create those tools for
individuals and they're already out
there but we need to kind of collect
them and make them available to
individuals to tell them listen this is
what you can do about peace the the next
step would be we have to take this one
step further how can you actually um
resolve conflict between you and others
and also for this show um you know
several steps and very practical
solutions one thing we're doing for
instance we're publishing educational
materials about this what we show
different steps to individual piece but
also steps for conflict resolution so
you know what can you do if you're
actually in a violent conflict what can
you do to resolve conflict in general
and then also obviously how can you
attain more kind of an inner state of
inner peace which is very critical as a
collective call to action um this is
something where we're lacking in the
peace movement kind of a coordinated
global agenda so what we've done we have
worked together with grassroots to
governments to military to the United
Nations and the kind of famous and
non-famous peace builders from around
the world and have asked what would a
holistic global peace building agenda
look like we've come up with a solution
of seven long-term programs which range
from you know kind of that inner peace
and education materials to educating the
next generation of peaceful as meaning
the younger generations to empowering
women around the world to be in
positions to be to have more leading
positions when it comes to peace to
working um towards the UN peace treaty
Convention actually in 2015 to also
something that I will elaborate a bit
more about later which is something we
call a global tax on the arms trade
because we're actually campaigning to
impose a tax on the arms trade and
reduce redistribute money from those
profits which are outrageous to help
achieve the Millennium Development Goals
and eradicate poverty what you again
come full circle so
individual personal call to action and
collective call to action um so what you
were saying before is a myth that is at
quite widespread but it's also pointing
towards the real problems in the peace
movement meaning what can I actually do
what is it that I can do I can't do
anything because I'm not empower and
then when you look towards a lot of
people in power well they're not doing
very much either so then the question is
there who's who's doing what then in the
end so we need to all of us need to
engage so about the person call to
action inner peace it's between me and
others and then there's also the
collective call to action where right
now we see that actually each individual
counts because we're at a very very
crucial point in history where
technology empowers individuals around
the planet because of global
connectivity which is basically one one
of the areas i wanted to talk about
today what can Silicon Valley do when it
comes to world peace so one thing you
were saying before the more I am
connected to others the less need for
conflict there is why is that well first
global connectivity means that
information travels instantly across the
planet um this has several side effects
number one the more I understand about
the lives of people at other places on
the planet the the more I actually
identify with them you know the more I
know about this guy in Somalia or in a
conflict zone the more I can identify
with them the more i connect and the
more information I'll have the less I'm
actually prone to engage in conflict and
the more I'm also bound to actually help
those people who are in need but for
this I need information now we we have
actually seen a revolution in technology
over the last 10 to 20 years and now
individual to I'm powered more than ever
before around the world but what's
happening is that individuals are using
certain tools and certain technology to
free themselves as we've seen in recent
months but this is done
um out of you know sheehan need but it's
not that Silicon Valley actually sat
down and said listen what can we
actually do how can we take what we have
take this one step further and really
empower individuals even more to bring
about peace so what I'm saying is that
people have been using those tools
basically as a result of the of the need
and the situations there in but there
hasn't been um a conscious effort here
to actually sit down and think about
okay let's look at what we have let's
look at what's been working and how can
we put that together take it one step
further and but maybe even just
combining what we have in a new way or
in a better way to really help those
people around the planet start their own
kind of bedroom revolutions which then
become nationwide revolutions please
sure um let me try to actually give you
give me the mic just so can you tell us
what has been working and what kind of
impact it has so far okay um from a
broad point of view anything that
enables connectivity helps so we were
just talking about this actually before
you came in about cell phones and
connectivity and and and solutions that
work even when the internet goes down
and so and so on there's um something in
Africa is called the OSHA ed engine has
been working wonderfully which is
basically a something where people can
connect with each other using something
called the OSHA et engine to UM and not
only help it well it started as a kind
of civilian movement and it started to
quell violence in Kenya I can give you
the example now I say this was in 2008
that was an internet platform allowing
data to be gathered by a text or email
to be visualized on a map or timeline
and this in the end enabled a faster or
more accurate response than ever in
history when it came to where the where
the hurts of conflict were so when it's
been using in Haiti Gaza and many other
areas afterwards so when Kofi Annan
actually came to Kenya afterwards um a
lot of the fires had been put out so
when we talk about what works number one
is that kind of global connectivity
empowering people to be connected to
share information and it's really a lot
of times that's simple so it's really
like how can we make information
available faster um more exact and
better than before so it's all out there
but again there hasn't been a conscious
effort to really sit down and think okay
let's look at what people actually do
need in those situations and what we can
provide if you look at what what what
generally works um
of the big big big big platforms out
right now in the general public and i'm
not talking about vine conflict we see
things like Google obviously definitely
working Twitter Facebook that's like the
giants that are working and how people
connect with each other learning from
those experience we could take it one
step further and see okay how can we
combine some of the methods and the
tools to really help it to really help
people know what's going on make
information available um faster and
better than before also what's missing
worldwide is a network connecting people
interested in peace projects and
initiatives so meaning the best thing
could happen actually like two blocks
from you but you would not know that
it's going on that's completely missing
in the world today also what's missing
is that there is no transfer of
knowledge so for instance um a guy
working with inner-city kids and Detroit
doesn't really talk to the guy working
with child soldiers in Somalia but the
funny thing is that the tools and what's
working is actually that's transferable
um but but there's no real exchange of
information why because peace has not
been given priority as as simple as that
so you could do so much more if if you
brought about or you enable those
networks and that exchange of knowledge
which again it happens at a very very
very small level but it's really minimal
um then again there are a lot of
initiatives around the planet no one
knows about I was talking about this
kind of what happens two blocks from you
but it also goes farther than that we
work with someone in Somalia who for
five dollars purchases purchases of a
goat and takes the goat on this kind of
little motorbike and goes out and
exchanges won gold for a you know
against one child soldier it works with
a malicious so for one so 45 euros he
can actually free one child which is
amazing and I think if more people knew
about initiatives like this around the
planet
people would know more what to do which
comes back to what you said before maybe
I can give time and resources maybe
someone in you know Detroit who works
with inner-city kids needs a new website
and I could help him pull that up but
maybe I can give you know fifteen twenty
thirty dollars to someone who frees
child soldiers in Somalia but again you
don't know about it so again it's about
make getting that information out there
and helping people to make wise choices
descent what's here is it feedback
journalistic gorilla yeah sorry let me
give you the Mike yeah it's actually
good right I was saying we might need a
new type of journalistic gorilla because
in my opinion mainstream media they
don't cover the necessary sort of angles
or views and it was really it was really
you had a big impact on me when I a
couple of days ago on al-jazeera I I
just saw this footage of a guy Inbar way
and I think crying because his son had
died now that's not normally the type of
pictures you see on CNN etc and in that
in seeing that footage it made me feel
more connected with the people on the
ground
and it brought the problem kind of
closer to home exactly exactly exactly
which again goes back to global
connectivity what can we do to share
those stories well because you know when
you've been that sad so it's exactly it
very very good point right is enabled to
empathy exactly and then also altruistic
action so you think what can I actually
do to help him exactly yeah exactly it
so what are we talking about and we're
talking about exchange that's let's cut
let's collect some of some of you ideas
so we're talking about exchange of
information right so we need more so
what do we need we need more information
correct we need more sharing we need
more empowerment we need networks that
enable people to connect with each other
right we need um tools that work locally
so we need people in conflict zones to
be able to connect with each other and
this that the data that's then gathered
ideally would be fed into a system that
would um show um you know areas of
violent conflict that would also provide
other information which people could
then use to actually resolve conflict
right right
the problem is censorship mm-hmm the
this is also something we were talking
about actually actually earlier before
the whole speech started we talking
about what could a different solution be
that would enable people to connect for
instance using cell phones when Internet
networks are shut down right and I think
also the cell phone obviously we're at
Google but the cell phone providers have
not really understood the power of what
they could do as well that really hasn't
they haven't caught up to that in terms
of global connectivity that really
hasn't also because it hasn't been on
their agenda um and and there could
really be an enormous revolution there
when it comes to peacebuilding if they
address this from a more conscious point
of view but it really hasn't happened so
that's a very very good question what
could we do to enable networks locally
even if there is censorship another
thing you were saying is that obviously
the whole idea of how we approach
journalism has to change and the news we
report on I know an initiative in
Hollywood that actually it tries to set
up a network for good news as opposed to
kind of bad news right because we know
how much good news is actually favored
in Africa we working with someone called
a 24 media which is the largest
independent news network in Africa what
they are doing is they're providing a
platform for journalists to share news
that also a lot of times could be
censored because there is a lot of
censorship still going on in a lot of
these areas so what we're talking about
is also different approach is very good
point to journalism meaning also you
know reporting on on good news and what
works as well as on basically being free
of censorship or finding ways that
people can still make their voices heard
even though there is censorship which
for instance this guy Salim amino
working with in Africa has done it's
called a 24 media and as I said is the
largest independent news network in
Africa
so that's that's exactly very very good
point um so to sum up a little bit we
said we need to give individual tools so
we need to know what tools are out there
to enable me to be more peace with
myself than others we need to also
understand about global connectivity and
I think also we need to have some role
models also I think it's very important
we need to showcase people who are doing
um you know fantastic very courageous
things around the planet I need to
showcase those a non famous
peacebuilders you know we all know about
the Dalai Lama's and the decimal tutors
of this wall and so on but there's so
many people around the world who doing
you know very courageous things that
have enormous that are really effective
but you know we don't hear about them so
something that we put on our flag for
instance is to really showcase those
peace builders put them out there and
and report on their stories and make
their voices heard so it can inspire you
and others to do similar things in your
neighborhood or in other areas so I
think that's something very very
important and this also goes back to the
myths we're talking about namely that
peace is actually very strong and can be
really powerful so what you were saying
all those positive stories that are
actually happening out there they're
also not regularly reported on so that's
something we definitely need um
generally the I think we're now at a
tipping point as I said before because
individuals are waking up to their
collective power and technologies have
reached a state where um those two kind
of awakenings could actually merge but I
really think it needs a conscious
responsible approach from everybody
involved and then including as I said
silicon valley to really sit down and
think okay like almost like in a task
force you know and ideally at different
levels in a different areas what could
we actually do what could we do to
empower those people what can we do when
it comes to global connectivity what
could we do to make those
voice is heard its own song I think
that's a very critical point and I think
again it starts with it starts in the
minds of the people it starts that it it
starts with me and it starts with each
one of you feeling that okay um I really
don't want to be a bite Stan bystander I
want to take a conscious effort and I
want to do something about this and what
you were saying about watching this on
TV it made you feel closer so you
identify more and you immediately ask
yourself okay what can I do to alleviate
that situation good um let me tell you a
little bit about what what we're doing
at the world peace partnership on the
World Peace Festival and then I'd like
to conclude we're basically running and
an event that would be the largest piece
event in history what we do exactly what
I said at the beginning we get those
leaders from all these different areas
together whether that's you and whether
that's military generals whether that's
visionary corporate CEOs entrepreneurs
like brands and whether that's people
for music art film and of course the
nobel peace laureates we also get the
famous and non-famous peace builders
there so we can learn from their stories
and also from their wisdom when it comes
to peacebuilding then the idea is that
all those different representatives go
home to their own constituencies and
take the kind of the global coordinated
peacebuilding agenda that we've been
collectively putting together home to
their constituencies also we have a
direct tie-in to the UN because the
outcome of the conference will be
submitted as an official contribution to
the UN General Assembly by UN
ambassadors we also try to enable global
connectivity as much as possible also at
the event having individuals feedback to
the topics right away before during and
after the conference so you don't have
just you know a bunch of fantastic
people sitting in a room but there is no
real tight connection also we're driving
what I was saying before the kind of
coordinated peacebuilding agenda around
the world which is long term we take the
event around the planet but we also have
seven long-term programs which tackle
we hope in cooperation with grassroots
to governments to un all those vital
elements of conflict around the planet
so that we can really make a dent and
achieve peace one of these programs i
was talking about is the global tax on
the arms trade which we're really
excited about and which is getting
fantastic momentum which is that we're
campaigning to impose a tax on the arms
trade and i'm just talking about arms
the profits of the exports i'm not
talking about the security blanket of
the respective countries i'm just
talking about the infuriating profits
that are made in that industry if you
look towards tobacco which is taxed by I
think 20 put an additional twenty
percent in the US and then you look at
the oil industry which is taxed by an
additional twelve percent in countries
like the UK we also have things like the
airline tax and so and so on I often
wonder it well what about the arm
straight then but the profits are
outrageous so we're doing is we're
saying that we're cutting a deal and we
re distributing some of these profits to
help arms victims around the world and
to reach the UN Millennium Development
Goals and eradicate poverty which to us
as we believe provides you know a real
basis for peace so it's one of the you
know one of the many approaches we're
taking to kind of make make a dent on
our end so um maybe I you know I could
conclude with a statement that all of
you here today I'm gonna give you your
comment certainly have a very strong
interest in in peace and are quite
passionate about it and you feel that
you are connected to this um and to UM
you feel that you as individuals have a
stake in this and I think that um if we
could address this more consciously um
with a lot more brilliant minds in
Silicon Valley and get this on the
agenda in light of recent events around
the planet we could actually empower
those people in conflict zones a lot
more and also empower individuals here
and back home to do something about
so that would be it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
