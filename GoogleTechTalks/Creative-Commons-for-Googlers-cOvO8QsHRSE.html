a product council I work on image search
and video and blogger and Wi-Fi and some
other things and I have the pleasure
today I've introducing a Creative
Commons who's down from San Francisco I
worked at Creative Commons for three
years before joining Google a couple
years ago and we're going to hear a
little bit about what Creative Commons
has been up to recently and what their
plans are for the future and what
Googlers can do to help out creative
comments both as part of Google and
maybe outside and we're going to talk
mostly about technical aspects of
Creative Commons and some of the
technical tools they have that help
people who create online media and
different kinds of different works
online to share them under a some rights
reserved copyright under a less
restrictive copyright than the general
default rules of copyright allow just a
quick sense of how many people here
already knew of Creative Commons before
coming to the tech talk or know
something about it okay good so we can
assume we can assume a good level of
knowledge about Creative Commons so
again this talk will be I think mostly
focused on technical stuff and tools
that we're going to have a little movie
that creative comes going to show and
then there'll be time for some Q&amp;amp;A and
we've got a whole the whole creative
commons staff here from lawyers to
designers to business people so if you
have questions during the presentation
at the end they'll be time for that
right now want introduce you to the main
speakers michael links fair is the CTO
of Creative Commons and I had the
pleasure to work with Mike for two and a
half of the years I was a Creative
Commons and he's now the the longest
serving staff member Creative Commons
he's been around since April of 2003 I
think and he's going to tell a little
bit more about what they're doing now in
different ways that that you all can
help out so hand it over to Mike now
thank you am I hello okay that's good so
from bloggers to youtube or from
analytics to zeitgeist I couldn't think
of any relevant Google products that
spanned a to z and adil analytics in
zeitgeist or kind of meta and then
Google of course famous for web search
but really spanning the whole all of the
company's businesses overly restrictive
copyright potentially impacts every
single one of those businesses and
Creative Commons as part of the solution
do you want to work together so purpose
of this talk is Glenn set is mainly
going to be technical and I want to
stimulate God and innovation feedback
and implementations and there are some
technical details i'm just going to be
straight up ask for feedback and opinion
on inspiration would be a helpful happy
coincidence but I'm not promising it
because the inspirer is in Berlin and
this is my terribly cheesy attempt to
imitate his slides because he sometimes
uses the opening closing bracket that's
Lawrence Lessig our founder he spoke
here to a much bigger audience I think
last year and is very well get you
worked up about free culture so do in
order to work together we could get
creative this is our original movie
released in two thousand two that
describe great of common
get a fair amount of detail in the
background of how
these are jacking well that's that's
enough of that it met that cartoon I
highly recommend you watch it and show
it to your friends who don't know
anything about copyright and how
copyright works on the internet or does
it or fails to work we have a new
cartoon that i'm going to show you and
this is the first semi public showing of
it period that's a little more succinct
and a little more fun when you share
your creativity you're enabling people
anywhere to use it learn from it and be
inspired by it take the teacher who
shapes young minds with work and wisdom
from around the globe and the artist who
builds beauty out of bits and pieces she
finds online and the writer whose
stories these ideas and images crafted
by people he's never even met these
people know that when you share your
creative wealth you can accomplish great
things they and millions of other people
all around the planet are working
together to build a richer better more
vibrant culture using Creative Commons
to understand Creative Commons you need
to know a little bit about how copyright
works did you know that when you create
something anything I'm a photograph song
to a drawing to a film to a story you
automatically own an all rights reserved
copyright to that creativity that's true
copyright protects your creativity
against uses you don't consent to but
sometimes full copyright is too
restrictive what about when you want all
those millions and millions of people
out there to use your work without the
hassle of coming to you for permission
what if you want your work to be freely
shared were you
built upon by the rest of the world
luckily there's an answer Creative
Commons we provide free copyright
licenses you can use to tell people
exactly which parts of your copyright
you're happy to give to the public it's
easy it only takes a minute and it's
totally free just come to our website
and answer a few quick questions like
will you allow commercial uses of your
work and will you allow your work to be
modified based on your answers will give
you a license that clearly communicates
what people can and can't do with your
creativity you don't give up your
copyright you refine it so it works
better for you welcome to a new world
where collaboration rules it didn't even
exist just a few years ago but now there
are millions and millions of songs
pictures videos and written works
available to share reuse and remix all
for free you want to work together then
join the comments Creative Commons
so I think I blew the segue maybe but
that video is called want to work
together and there is one joke that I
wanted to sell before sorry the inspirer
it's better have an inspired than a
decider I figure so first I'm going to
just throw out some what I call Chum and
Chum is of course blood and body parts
of fish that's used to feed sharks this
is going to be non-technical which is
some fun things to think about so you
can tell your non-technical friends or
argue with them about something so what
are some ways to think about Creative
Commons well one is the way we usually
frame it is reasonable flexible
copyright another way is lowering
transaction costs you can think of is in
terms of free speech cultural
environmentalism and google any of these
terms you'll find some interesting
papers and then you can also think of it
in terms of free Libre or open-source
software and i'll just say open source
from now on but in case anybody prefers
the other terms you can use those for
this audience i'm going to do a couple
quick illustrations of the relation to
open source so open source you can think
of as being the green circle in the
middle and some creative commons
licenses fit within those principles so
in the kind of recycling like symbol
share alike so that's our version of
copyleft and then Dubai is attribution
you have to give credits
and then there are other things that
fall their other licensed conditions
that fall outside of the scope of what
would be considered open source such as
no derivatives and non non commercial or
commercial use is prohibited and just a
thought maybe media is 20 years behind
software and that's one of the reasons
why we need those options and then
another interesting thing to think about
as well you've got code and media
licenses and maybe there's a tiny bit of
overlap now and there's a bunch of stuff
that's not copyrightable at all and
maybe in the future of the overall app
will get better bigger and in the future
maybe nothing will be on copyright able
because you know everything will be
fixed when you think it so interesting
thing about reuse I think a lot of
programmers when they think about code
and content they think well there's an
obvious pragmatic case for code reuse
but the interesting thing about is it's
only applicable applicable and very
specific cases if you have a Python
library and you're writing you know
program in Java chances are you have to
re-implement you're not going to be able
to directly reuse although maybe with
chai phone that's not the case but
anyway but in arts not invented here
it's not a bad thing so there's not a
pragmatic case for Reese always but on
the other hand any any arts can
conceivably be mixed with a other arts
so content license interoperability is
as important as code license
interoperability even though there are
different use cases so they're a bunch
of different kinds of interoperability
that Creative Commons is it interested
in I have no idea what interoperability
between code and media really means
that's you guys are smart maybe can
daydream about that someday and there's
media licenses there's our licenses and
the license is used by Wikipedia I have
there's no reason there should be
separate silos of contents I don't know
if we have any reason any way to solve
that problem
it's something that's a Larry Lessig and
Evan mob Mogollon of the FSF have talked
about if you're really interested in
this stuff you can listen to their talk
at wiki that was at wiki mania at that
length and then across jurisdictions
this is something that Creative Commons
has been doing from the beginning it's
for real Creative Commons has been
ported to 30 some-odd jurisdictions so
that's the end of the stuff that I have
no idea what I'm talking about and just
thanks for you to talk about with your
non-technical friends almost except this
this is all real so I just want to give
you a quick update on some legal stuff
we're doing or sort of legal stuff
that's the total in front of it we've
got the podcasting legal guide which is
of course a guide to podcasters and what
kind of rules you have to follow both
are incorporating Creative Commons
content and how how to deal with
copyright generally what does
non-commercial mean which is a probably
the biggest controversy because we have
a non-commercial license and it's not
always it's not always cut and dry what
exactly a commercial uses we have a page
of critiques and controversies we're all
about being open and you can check out a
bunch of articles on the wiki page
mention there we've actually had a
couple of cases where Creative Commons
license was involved they're both both
in Europe but they're kind of interest
and you can read all about them at the
URL here kind of interesting because one
was the case of a Creative Commons
license content being misused or outside
of the scope of the license and that was
upheld and another was creative commons
content was being properly used and
someone tried to prevent that use and it
was upheld also then we are working at
version 3 point of our licenses you can
find some information about that at the
link there and then Glenn said you can't
just talk about cool stuff you have to
talk about some really cool stuff that's
being down with Creative Commons so I'm
going to mention a few of those one is I
we have a cycle CC
sir which I'll show you very briefly
there was you've probably all heard
about lonely girl 15 on YouTube some
mixes by a user on on ccmixter were used
in that those videos and got seen by
hundreds of thousands of people and Pat
Shella the artist or remixer has since
signed a commercial deal with that that
operation something cool according to
glines taste I think we originally
recently had a benefit concert in New
York City with diplo Girl Talk and
keeping tongue peeping tom something
cool according to my taste Bob ostertag
a very important electronic composer
released all of his you know 20 years of
audio work under CC license earlier this
year so what about yours well a problem
is you know there's no accounting for
taste and there's a huge amount of stuff
that's creative commons licensed out
there you know much of it very awesome
so that's one reason one of my kind of
peeves or goals I guess is that
discovery is a really important thing
from collaborative filtering to just
conversation and a few other a bunch of
other cool stuff second live concert
with Jonathan Coulton a board game audio
book remix contest remix Museum in
Boston releasing classical music under
CC license brazilian movie released
simultaneously in theaters and online
under CC diggnation and other podcasts
we have salons and San Francisco too
much other cities around the world and
there's just so much more going on as
will come up when I talk about some of
the technical stuff Creative Commons
both the technical and the community
infrastructure is really decentralized
so we don't there's a lot of cool stuff
happening that we don't find out about
until six months later or you know years
later I mean just like in real culture
so now I'm going to segue into the the
technical part of this of this talk so
december 2002 we we launched and one of
the one of the innovations was that we
had three separate representations of
the licenses if you think of a code
license like the GPL there's just the
GPL and you can read it if you want to
but very few people will people have
under people now understand the GPL I
think kind of through osmosis very few
people have actually read it so we have
three or presentations one is human
readable so we have icons that's
describe the conditions associate with
the license of this one v have to give
attribution get used for commercial use
and if you make a derivative work you
have to share alike then we also have
the actual lawyer readable code and then
we have more interestingly here we have
machine readable code which describes
both the work being licensed and the
license itself so you can sew a machine
can discover is this work licensed and
then what conditions are associated with
the license no and we thought or I
hadn't joined till april 2003 but
basically the thought was this is a
really cool feature could be added to a
search engine somebody's going to build
it right well it took a little while in
early 2004 we got tired of waiting i
guess and built a prototype using
postgres t search too which is a
full-text indexer for postgres in python
and boy was it ever slow but it was a
good prototype then the lake 2004 we
built a search engine for CC material
based on a certain source search engine
called much which is as we've seen if
some of your familiar with java
full-text indexing might be familiar
without that code base which was an even
better prototype in somewhat usable
usable and then finally early in 2005
Yahoo Google Yahoo search for cc in
which basically they filter their web
index according to materia
we'll say think our CC licensed and then
in late 2005 you guys did it and I hope
you don't let them beat you at anything
ever again so then this is the interface
we have now if you go to search
creativecommons org so we have a series
of tabs that enable you to access search
engines that are CC enabled in some
fashion and you can get there either by
going to search decorative commas org or
using the firefox surf drop-down which
most people think is just the google
search bar i think but credit to you
guys for that so this is an example
search where i'm searching for clipart
and i'm using the the google CC search
basically so it's only searching the
portion of google index that is thought
to be licensed under Creative Commons
license and you can see the first tip
that comes up is the open clipart
library that's a pretty good pretty good
hit because that's a public domain
that's a library of public man clipart
it doesn't work all that well or some
other terms though so I'm going to
before we get to get to other uses of
search I'm going to dive a little bit
and technically and talk about our meta
data infrastructure that enables this
kind of search so we started out with
rdf XML in HTML comments and what that
means is i'll describe rdf very briefly
later but basically it's a way to put
metadata in a web page such as its
invisible to a user and can be copy and
pasted into that web page that's why it
has to be in comments otherwise it would
show up as random characters in the web
page and i can show you really quick why
that was a requirement for us if you go
to creativecommons org and click publish
and i choose a license let's say I want
to make other people share alike select
a license
and I get this block of HTML which I can
put in my templates or my web page or
any anything that's HTML or even word
processors captain accept it now we had
to had to be super generic because
otherwise in order to use CC license you
had to integrate with every single
software package so that's the copy and
paste requirement but into why use we
could have just made up our own XML
format and still done that but the
Semantic Web seems like the way to go
there's a lot of hype around it however
rdf xml and HTML comments is super ugly
and it may have even been one of the
reasons why it's a google a while to
build a sec search engine they're hidden
to humans which means that the its
amenable to both spamming and also
distilled maintenance if a webmaster
changes their license or changes other
metadata they might forget to change the
the hidden metadata its hit into XML
parser is in a sense because an XML
parser can throw a wild comments rdf XML
is confusing to many people it to be
honest i started i started using it at
another company in two thousand late two
thousand i guess and it literally took
me a year or so to really rock it it's
easy to mess up because it's embedded in
comments CMS might escape it it's more
verbose than needed crude information
were conveying whoops and just show you
if you look in this copy and paste
little area here I think you can see
here's that the beginning of an HTML
comment and it's probably making you
cringe
so another another meta data format
that's new to the same it I I meant to
say something before it started with
metadata this is an area that's really
still developing and there isn't an
ideal solution because Google I think
one of the ideal things were created
problems about google is because you
guys will facilitate publishing but then
also search is kind of the ultimate
consumer so i'll come back to the point
later but so I so I want both I want to
arrive at its standards that Google
wants to implement is a short version of
it so I want honest feedback so
microformats have taken up taking off in
the last year or so they're initially
called semantic XHTML basically just
leveraging semantic class names that CSS
designers already used and rel equals
license is one of the simplest
microformats I'll show you what that
looks like in a second but the benefits
of microformats are basically they're
co-located with human visible mark up
she don't have the the downsides of
hidden metadata they're also very
concise so they're not for grows like
all that XML you saw a second ago they
have a couple problems or the first
problem is a problem with raw license by
itself really it's at the page level so
you can know that a page is licensed but
you can't know if an image inside the
page is licensed without using some kind
of heuristics and then also what about
saying that an mp3 I'm liking to is
licensed what about saying an image in
the page is licensed or video and pages
license etc and there's some scale
building interoperability questions
about microformats it's a centralized
process you don't they use namespaces so
it can't really be decentralized and
that's depending on your perspective
you're coming for our coming from that's
either plus or minus and this is what
they're all licensed rel equals license
my
perform that actually looks like we have
a bit of HTML says this work is licensed
under Creative Commons license and it
links the license we just add a rel
equals license attributes to that HTML
and that indicates that we're not just
linking to the license because it's a
cool link or we're talking about it
we're saying that there's some content
here that's licensed and you can see
that documented on the microformats wiki
that's actually the wrong link wrong
link it is actually microformats org
slash wiki / or a license but anyway
yeah yes yes this is out this this is
out there in a while since 2004 yeah yes
and yeah so what we what we want is a
solution that both can you can both you
can make statements about things whether
it's whether it's at the whole page
level or fragments or a link in that
page or an embedded object get an image
a movie whatever and that has them has
the advantages of microformats it's
co-located with or one of the advantages
of microformats it's co-located with
human visible mark up so again the
problems with hidden metadata its
publisher and consumer-friendly
basically that means that it's low
impact for publishers and can easily be
exposed to consumers or browsers and
then it's flexible and interoperable so
one solution that's some people
associated with Creative Commons and the
w3c I've been working on is called rdfa
I'm going to briefly run through that
what that is it's an rdf serialization
the a stands for attributes it's the
mythical RDF in HTML that many people
wanted for years including Creative
Commons that's how we arrived at the
crummy RDF in HTML solution it was
developed for there there are some
problems
it was developed for XHTML to originally
which nobody uses and nobody probably
ever will it uses the about in property
attributes which are defined for XHTML
too but are invalid index HTML XHTML one
and some people just hate RDF the
solutions are probably going to be a new
revision of XHTML one that's upward
compatible and many of the people Mike
injector conjecture is that many people
hate say they hate RDF actually hate r
EF xml because that's all they've been
exposed to and you can see ongoing
developments about this it already rdfa
info and i'm going to show you a couple
of examples of what that actually looks
like and this is not actually deployed
except experimentally but I'd be keen to
hear feedback on it so we've got it this
is a simple rdfa example it looks
exactly like the microformat example but
it produces in effect it is exactly the
same as a Microsoft microformats example
you can think of it as producing what's
called a triple or a sentence in RDF and
that code at the bottom basically the
the the two square brackets right next
to each other represents the current URL
so the current page and we're saying
that page has a license in the license
is identified by the URI you see there
so what so a bigger i'm not going to
show you a bigger rdfa example that
attacks some of the issues i described
before how you precisely identify things
other than web pages that are licensed
so images here this will be an example
of an image you know also incorporating
other metadata about the image besides
license so the stuff in red as as with
the previous microformat and rdfa
examples are the additional metadata
added to the HTML and here we have a
span and the about to attribute
identifies the subject so this is the
URL we're going to be making statements
about and then the rel and
property attributes are are verbs or
predicates so these are the type of
statements we're going to be making
about that URL and then either the
contents I guess either the contents or
the HR f is the object and so this HTML
produces the following triples of the
following statements so we're going to
this is using an art and easy to read
RDF serialization called n3 but it's I
think it's pretty self-explanatory we
have a we have an image foo jpg and
we're saying the first line says that
it's an image the second says that it's
called foo captured the third says
you're supposed you're supposed to
attributes that's image with a link to
Bob home example org the fourth says
that you should attribute the craters
name as Bob and then finally we say that
the image is licensed under a particular
particular license and within a single
page you could annotate any number of
images or links to mp3's or whatever
with this style of markup so now I
didn't want to try to explore anybody
doesn't know what rdf is I don't want to
explain it kind of cold it's I think
it's easier to understand after you've
seen some examples but a super short
explanation is that you're making
sentences you've got a subject that's
always URL or you are I we've got a
predicate that's also always a URI and
you've got it objects and that's either
a URI or or text so the example of an
object is the license if your if your
predicate is licensed and you can say a
lot of things with those primitives and
you can do a lot of things with what is
said like inferencing the super short
explanation of all ready fa which I
showed you the demo of you've got a
subject denoted by the about attribute
in a deferred if the about is not there
then a defaults to the current document
the predicate is denoted by rel or rev
if you want to flip your subject and
object around and it's uri and the
predicate whoops typo i meant no no it's
not a typo so if if you're if you're
using a rel than the object is a URI if
you're using a property attribute then
the object is a literal or just some
text example of that would be Bob is
just some text so we use the property
attributes in a note that so benedita
the who's on who's the first creative
commons CTO and went on to do a PhD at
MIT and this odd Creative Commons
representative on the w3c has a
briefcase for re FA and if you're
interested I encourage you to go to his
page benedita benedita net /
presentations but he lays out a case
comparing rdfa to microformats xml and a
couple of other meta data technologies
and the benefits in summary our
publisher independence it's the creation
process is decentralized so any
publisher can come up with their own
schema data resends in containments are
related basically one end user feature
you can get with them is copy and paste
because the the metadata isn't in a
separate file and it's co-located with
the human readable HTML schema my schema
modularity and schema evolvability are
really outcomes of decentralization in
parts I the schemas are aren't too rigid
you can you can have statements from
different schemas in the same page for
example and they don't have to know
about you don't have to know about how
to compose them you can be saying that
if you had a schema for describing a
museum work of arts and then you also
had a way to say that it was like
you don't have to worry about how they
they play together because you're just
making statements about URLs then I want
to throw in a fun Semantic Web analogy
early so I think it's fun java applets
are to java as cobol as the Semantic Web
vision and hype in 2001 are two semantic
web technologies now being used to
integrate heterogeneous enterprise data
and if you get that analogy that's great
I hope you'll think it's funny if not oh
well but I think the difference might be
that well Java applets may never come
back on a public web I think semantic
web technology as well so microformats
are worse and I'm kind of laboring this
sort of pseudo comparison because it's
something they really want engineers
feedback on so one of the bad thing one
of the bad things about microformats are
in my view the worst thing is the S
there's no consistent model every
microformats is a new thing and if you
have a parser like the details plugin
for firefox you basically have a bunch
of if then statements and you need to
parse out each individual microformat so
the parsing and knowledge of what
microformat does or is tightly coupled
as opposed to rdfa you've got a model so
you can get all the parser can just
extract all the triples and then other
software is tasks with deciding what to
do with that there's no deep tools or
research I've already talked about
decentralization the details and
research is really that you see in the
Semantic Web layer cake with inference
and roles and trust and stuff like that
none of that applies directly to
microformats however if you haven't seen
sa works is better I strongly suggest
you read it basically elegant solutions
often lose two solutions that do
something good right now and that might
be where microformats is a lot of people
are publishing microformats for calendar
data and contact data for instance and
their tools being written however
however kludgy they are to actually do
interesting stuff with my current and
there's a potential media info
microformats which would be yet another
microformat that you know if you wanted
to have a universal microformat parser
would be you know yet another set of
if-then statements or event handlers or
whatever but it could be very useful to
Creative Commons to be able to describe
chunks of media as opposed to just web
pages using microformats and it doesn't
really exist yet but it's sort of in
discussion stages in there a couple of
URLs there if you want to if you go to
the microformats wiki and search on
media you'll find them this is a cooked
up mediainfo microformat example that
incorporates another microformat as well
but basically how microformats work is
you've got a class which designers are
familiar with and you denote that ok i'm
starting a micro format by using a class
name everybody has agreed on so let's
pretend me the info and the stuff in
purple is completely made up there's no
existing microformat like this and then
you might I did then you've got an image
here the famous food jpg and we're
saying that with class equals media or
I'm imagining this is how it might work
that this is the media that we're
describing within this micro format and
then we're using d card to say that the
Creator the craters name is Bob we can
use outer v card components to give the
URL of the crater and things like that
then with also we're also reusing the
role license microformat to say that the
media is licensed and i just want to
stress this is not there's no spec like
this right now there is a case we made
for microformats and other kind of
non-native rdf metadata to be made
interoperable there's something called
griddle which stands for gleaning
resources resource descriptions from
dialects of language it's basically you
associate some xslt with some
metadata and give a knowledge of that
metadata you can get already have
statements out of it so that way you can
take advantage of all the tools there
semantic web researchers are building
but fundamentally what's Creative
Commons wants is implementation we want
audio image video search etc to be CCNA
CCNA old in the lack of of precise
metadata for objects other than web
pages has been holding that back so
we're very eager whether it's already fa
microformats or something else to see
something adopted and obviously Google
as the key adopter and I'll so you have
people doing CMS and other software
although Google does that as well with
blogger and other properties and as I
just alluded to google has chickens and
eggs you both have publishing tools and
search so can really motivate the
adoption of better metadata so as I've
been saying i want one feedback on this
if you want to jump in and contribute
there's discussions or both microformats
and rdf a the 14 already fa is a little
bit harder to find but if you search for
all ready fa you can find work your way
towards the w3c discussion list and just
start if either of these technologies
you find workable just start
implementing them in products and in
your own software products projects then
I want to very quickly run through some
other technologies of interest to
Creative Commons embedded metadata it
sucks this is the meta de that you put
inside of a file like an mp3 or PDF or
whatever and it almost always sucks
their crappy standards that are not
extensible like I d 3 4 mp3 everybody
who programs against it absolutely hates
it it's almost never exposed in you eyes
except for maybe in an mp3 player you
might see the title the song it's mostly
unused and there's absolutely no reason
to trust it so there's a nun I'll
explain why Creative Commons is
interested
this technology that sucks in a second
but there's a there's a somewhat non
crappie standard being pushed by Adobe
called XMP it's extensible it's
basically constrained rdf that can be
injected into many different file types
including PDF jpeg flash and pretty much
anything that you can bet that have an
area in the file format just to junk in
it's from Adobe being built into their
products line it's kind of becoming a
standard in high-end digital asset
management systems where an ad agency
for example nice attract its assets but
it's being pushed down to the consumer
level Microsoft is using in some of its
Vista applications so we're we're kind
of very interested in seeing web
applications also support that web
applications that deal with with media
that aren't are there aren't web pages
and again search is an obvious driver
for that and then in another reason that
embedded metadata sucks is because
there's no reason to trust it anybody
can take a Madonna mp3 and you know
stick a comment in there it says this is
CC licensed which means nothing because
you have no idea you know you might get
that through email or PHP file sharing
network or whatever you have no reason
to trust it so we say the embedded
license is meaningless by itself it
needs a reference to a web page that has
the same license information for that
media and in that way you can kind of
trust the embedded license as much as
you would as a licensed assertion on a
web page because in fact the license
assertion is on the web page and you
might not trust licensed assertion
published on geo cities so ignore that
you can find a brief write-up of this
with some cartoons actually that's on
our wiki the web statement article so
why so why do we care about my embedded
metadata well fraudulently you says I
just described could harm the brand or
the trust in our licenses and
fundamentally objects or works of art
the sort of stuff that Creative Commons
is interesting for or not always share
the
original URL with you know or webpage
with metadata could be shared by email
p2p file-sharing being from a wireless
device writable DVD I am memory stick
hard drive pretty much anything and none
of these conveyances have facilities
were for metadata unless it's in the
file itself it's also just easier for
software testing the meta data comes
with the object in some cases I've
talked to many developers of media
players for example even though they
realized that I III is terrible they
really they still have have the quixotic
goal of getting people to put incorrect
id3 tags because it it's a hell of a lot
easier for them to deal with in chicken
and egg again is a big problem so we
would like companies like Google to help
drive better embedded metadata and then
beyond we want to do a lot more with
metadata than just licenses there are a
lot of complimentary things attribution
is an obvious one all of the creative
commons licenses require attribution and
links are web gold essentially so you
can require somebody went to your
website when they reuse your creative
commons licensed content I think maybe
not having a standard way to attribute
with metadata and a link may have been a
big has may have been CCS biggest missed
opportunity so far because it's not I
don't think it's part of people's
consciousness consciousness when they
think of creative commons this is a way
i can tell people to link to me or
encourage people to use my contents and
line back to me so commerce and nearby
there bunch of things related to
commerce that we would like people to
specify with Creative Commons licenses
or along with Creative Commons licenses
such as work and I by where can i buy
related media we're going to get a
commercial license we're going to make a
donation work and I get provenance info
and there's some example one of the
strong things with the microformats
process as an aside is that they don't
really want to invent brand-new formats
they do what's called paving the cow
paths they see how people
already publishing information and then
develop and then sort of standardized
that so in the process of looking at
microformats we've started cataloging
examples of people doing all of these
things on the web at this URL you can
see on the screen we want to encourage
decentralized meaning aggregator and
search friendly commerce that's
complementary it's already centralized
public licensing and also just when
people have commercial success stories
and they're using a CCO license that
reflects well on us occasionally I'll
run into somebody comes from the heart
you know comes from the publishing
industry or it just comes from a very
strong protectionist background they
think put a Creative Commons license on
your work that's just a single give it
away it's not true because their
conditions is attached but having having
commerce linkedin in a complementary
fashion reiterates that message a couple
of examples of commerce we've got
magnets in a record label using all CC
licenses and you can see they're
promoting purchase and commercial
licensing jamendo another great curator
of CC licensed music promotes ways to
support the artists all this could be
marked up with benedetta as well
derivatives this I think is an
interesting idea a lot of people care
about to link to them but as everybody
becomes creators and recreate errs in
media besides just webpages really
interested in people aren't only putting
their media in silos they'll want to
know who on the web is remix in the sea
could imagine a query like instead of
when coal and show me a URL instead
source colon meaning show me everybody
who has used my work at this URL as
source material for their remix and we
kind of have that demonstrated within
our own silo site
CC mixer and you can see here here's a
track from patchell to be corolla the
guy who worked with lonely girl 15 uses
samples from a number of tracks and then
has been Reese ample so all of this
could be marked up with metadata to
enable a kind of source search
syndication you can stick CC licenses in
various indication formats and this is
important for aggregators and again
Google is a chicken and the egg your we
have both have a blog reader and a
number of sites that have feeds or allow
people to publish feeds and that's one
aside I wanted to make I'm not really
covering here the technologies to give
people the option to license their
content because they're relatively
simple and straightforward you could add
that to blogger and we want you to add
that to blogger there's no technology
challenges there but when it is added to
blogger an interesting thing would be to
also add the appropriate license
annotations to the feeds produced by
blogger so just do it there are a huge
number of areas that Creative Commons
would like to see Google build Creative
Commons into the product blog searches
and obvious one images is a super
obvious one video web search is already
there bloggers dachshund frets beat Docs
and spreadsheets picasa sketchup youtube
and i'm sure we missed some products
that either involve content creation or
consumption or something in between or
both then very briefly we also want
people to write open source code that
help that enables Creative Commons and
different applications I think Google is
interested in some of these open office
is the key one but also every other
content creation package or simply work
to make free software media tools butter
and you can go to developer decorative
comments at work for this
and then finally in that vein we
participated in summer of code we had
three successful completions just want
to give a big thank you to Chris DiBona
and his and his team which we didn't
participate last year but i think it's
get i think so we're really looking
forward to summer code next year let's
put it that way because i think it's
getting bigger and bigger and we'll have
a ton of influence then finally i want
to end on a note asking for your
supports both not only writing code and
integrating into products we're also
just started our fall founder it fall
fundraiser and you can go to
creativecommons org slash supports and
we you can buy t-shirts there you can
see letters from our founder or larry
lessig and please support us in every
every fashion because as i said i think
creative commons is part of the solution
to the restrictive copyrights landscape
that impacts all most businesses so
thanks and any any questions and answer
or feedback I'd be happy to take thanks
to Mike everybody to my hand and now
it's let's open up to questions and I
just wanna remind you that we're
videotaping this and we're going to be
putting on the web and hopefully under a
Creative Commons license so just kind of
be careful about comp asking questions
that have confidential information etc
on that on that note you probably want
to ask confidential legal questions
because we do have our general counsel
here yeah Andara in our creative
director here so if you have non
technical questions please ask those as
well great and just for later just to
remember there's some free pins and
stickers and buttons over there too if
you want to grab them son and yeah
archive stuff they've got a licensing
scheme that's remarkably like dora they
have their own good evening
are you in general and part of this or
would you yeah sure so Luke is asking
about the BBC creative archive they use
licenses that look sort of like Creative
Commons licenses but they have if i
could quotes other freaky stuff attached
to them yeah so i think that people
associate creative commons i have been
talking to the BBC for a long time today
a BBC is funded by UK taxpayers so i
think one of their requirements that
unfortunately stood in places that the
content could only be free for UK
taxpayers there there are other things
in there but I'm not me and my people
might want to say more that's about it
let me give you this it's a little
easier to hello you think that's a
missed opportunity and what happens if
other organizations start to make your
own zoo of licenses that look very much
like yours this is a concern or
something you'd welcome it is a concern
I mean it's a missed opportunity in a
sense but they can only change their
mind first the BBC's a huge organization
maybe they didn't have very much
flexibility but certainly they text a
little bit about interoperability at the
beginning of the talk certainly a danger
is a bunch you know everybody decides to
come up with their their own licenses
and they're not interoperable and that
reduces the value of rain content up a
lot because if the licenses are not
compatible for some minor reason then
you have these different silos of
context it's bad enough now we have kind
of Wikipedia under the FDL and
everything else under creative commons
licenses but if you have BBC you know
universities try to come up with their
own licenses unfortunately we've been
very successful with like OpenCourseWare
and its fault lines are using CC
licenses so so it's a danger yet
any other questions any anybody wants to
tell me how much they hate rd upper or
love its or anything like that well can
I remind you that this is being
broadcast on ok yes I hate it
alright so thanks once again to Creative
Commons of Mike and the creative commons
folks will be around if you have any
one-on-one questions that you want to
ask off camera or exchange business
cards or anything like that and again
there's free pins and stickers and
flyers the describing creative
accounting stuff sitting here so grab a
handful and thanks again to Mike thanks
