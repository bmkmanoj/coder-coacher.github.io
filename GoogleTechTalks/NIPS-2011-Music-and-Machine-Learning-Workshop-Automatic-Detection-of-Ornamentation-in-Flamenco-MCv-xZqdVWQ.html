Francisco
yeah probably be boys I'm from the
Lincoln University of mérida this is
how you can work with the high-velocity
country Miguel Diaz okay more amiable
minutes and I was go on so this is a
proposal for an automatic the potassium
system forward an addition in flamenco
music I'm going to say a few words about
the Mingo you may not be familiar with
that that music was mostly originated in
Andalusia I got a couple of hundred the
years ago and he's some kind of melting
pot from many influences mainly RF music
use use music by something music you see
music a model among others one of the
main central characteristics of flamenco
is singing really wife is very really
really important and it has a creamy and
roll in the music venkataraman and
nothing is also important but the day
we've all around around boys
traditionally a musical and literature
and apology and so sorry have I studied
flamingo but from a very high point of
view they are very little recent than
from a systematic a musical based on
point okay a few general musical feature
for you on this
was going was great but what was next
first of all improvisation as I miss
Fontaine he play a central role
procession is really important in in
flamingo up to the point that a singer
can seeing the same song twice in a role
in a very different way but underlying
that that crazy for improvisation guys
are very stable organization of music in
terms of meter of harmony etc right solo
is a very structured music on the on the
button on top of which I'm a singer or
dancer improvise freely remedy is mostly
a ternary music right not some binary
music that is like ten percent of
personnel and also is a model music
being the Phrygian mode the most common
one the most graphic speaker one to
Jamal is a mobile i started at eat in
the piano but also you have a minor and
what we concerns us here is this line
it's a very many somatic very very much
malignancy here we can see the influence
all from the arabs in the jewish from
the byzantine music and also from the
lips
so here we are studying Melissa mess
because are really really important we
want to describe Melissa massive
planning come you see that's something
that it hasn't been done by
musicologists because as I said they
have they studied anthropology a
flamenco the history of flamenco but not
really the material description of this
basic structure yes I of course know
exactly what you mean by business may be
defined for everybody else okay up there
are some sort of my life I minimize when
they do have you associate a very
complicated very complicated melodic
line to a single syllable right I'm
going to play examples in 30 seconds
I'll do an establishment for it hassle
we're in this um and also is it
important because Mellie's must I
characteristic of certain singer you can
tell this singer para para pc me from
this one because over of the other
melisma that hasn't been a study either
also some male isthmus are peculiar to
some flamenco style so this subject
management allows you to to study a
stipend estee classification um also the
identification of perezmas facilitates
melodic analogies I'll come back to his
in net second because it is very very
very important
so I'm going to do to play an example
here and we are going to resend these
devices amoco contain right okay you
have an approximate description of what
you are going to do here
Oh
so that was amazing well now i'm going
to play the same some exactly the same
song I another single
well I think this gives us our a measure
of how difficult the problem is actually
right because that previous example from
here to here was a melisma to hear right
I mean this is a score an attrition in
western music in this kind of music
which is a cappella songs you don't have
meter so forget about strong be done
with it duration is not a criteria to
distinguish the milkman at notes because
here we have this trip is here right but
at the end is very slow he'll have these
fifth note figures so all the typical
classical music description of my
mother's not like and again I insist
this piece is the same as these any
flamingo fictional Mussolini's it is the
same the same pizza but for our Western
ears is very difficult to say that they
are the same right so first for example
in a previous what we're doing mahalik
analysis just by looking to do the magic
melody direction and it was really hard
to make that not very other kind of
analysis because we had ponies must have
between so for example here I can say
the melodic skeleton of this piece is a
fall that goes from this eight here and
flat then you go to this G it goes to
this F there is a
ends he goes to lift this F again and
then it goes to this e everything in
between is it is irrelevant from the
melodic point of view in terms of form
Australia's speaking right but in the
media's may thing but running efficient
up things in terms of they discard and
Melissa machine him in their mind the
only thing that they have here is ok
days before right so making a important
program most to identify Melissa right
so we decided to well again there is no
literature on chemical management so we
decided to make a table of ornaments the
most common ones right here you have the
full table this is a lower mold and then
have a Fatone and i love it more than a
list of half dome double over more than
lower trails with the tube belgium's
after morning that's what we reasonably
described at a table of ornaments right
we are also we use someone regatta chant
to describe in the knowledge gained yes
sir released that stuff but also here we
have a 28 table and composed of 28
ornaments so now we do to look for these
ornaments in a water in our corpus we
compile the purpose of a cappella songs
because of
the easiness of use we wanted a
monophonic cigna qualify nagar we are
working on dharna but in this work we
are presenting you just monophonic so
basically we studied free style dev last
martini the one amar Canada to which are
important style singing flamenco music
especially in a cappella music at the
beginning we have many many many pieces
but they were all I know what quality or
they were only that again we come up
with we came up with the 72 counties
songs divided in 16 Devlin's statistic
martini the one I'm 20 Mark Martin ended
up with enough by ability to do all
purpose
so how to look for these melisma I want
you to be aware that here what we have
is a very simple thing I lalala
themselves I can be defied but the
realization could be completely crazy as
if you have got her in the musical
example so we used a tune by Amelia
vomit SNS tool which provided a middle a
representation of all do it was really
hard because first of all we had the
problems with without you me if you paid
close attention to the music he won't
many times you must have to assume the
worst quarter of Tom's sequence of tones
all over the Big Bite Big Brother was
very confusing sometimes because it
wasn't clear he was a tree or an extra
vibrato so first we carry out tuning
frequency estimation then a short note
transcription and then it acknowledged
consolidation and doing t person with a
fine so when do knows we are very short
and they had a personally the same
frequency within certain boundaries we
could consolidate that known as everyone
once we believe that we feed at the
output of this algorithm which is a
heart and said amelie like
representation to leave their s min
Waterman algorithm or local sequence
Hyneman how we have to introduce to
several parameters to control various
aspects of the
young women
so the world this furniture locus
similarity measure to determine from the
water level you accept your results
absolute difference of music and musical
intervals in order to control the
editing programs time duration between
nodes and the real time warp in general
BS time talking between a pattern
underneath a pic instance so here we
have a few a few results when you set a
smelly festival to 40 below this
interval torrents you have these two
parameters well with it on this whole
low lower turn was from twice to market
is 13 x mark is 20 degrees so here we
carry out the isle of those ornaments in
terms of its a regal style so let's see
let's see some results here so this is
the oops this is the pattern that we
find melisma
right it's just a meeting is only three
pitches under the length is just like a
global reference right and then that was
a rotational of this here but there's
lots Big Branch around here would have
that's not Emily's my wife because they
are same lyrics and in LA no as in
unison or our system nothing is not for
the time being able to distinguish that
but this is like the first step towards
a larger system and we want to use
machine learning to defeat the the
system to distinguish between real
mellow gesture I'm gone on real menace
masters you see also the Pendergast
statistics are very very confusing was
using nationality the same thing
sometimes the realization is not I mean
maybe this knot is very short this one
is really very short to land it when
it's very very very long project you
have all kind possibilities yes I
so to conclude as our or even still need
more work on fine-tuning but we are
incorporating through our psychological
facts in order to get better Pawnee
forever parameters the location of the
ultimate most acceptable in general but
it has to be enhanced because it is very
very discrimination with your own
diamonds and metal is still an issue and
we have found several tendencies in the
use of our enemies in certain is also
himeko musicologists are very happy
about that okay thanks art</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
