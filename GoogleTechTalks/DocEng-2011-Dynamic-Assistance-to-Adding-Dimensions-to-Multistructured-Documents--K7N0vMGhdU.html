metadata and we will have two short
papers for the second paper is a
presenter here the unju think no its you
okay fine so you know we have 15 minutes
and including questions okay so pyaar
hai do a party is coming from in
audacity to reno for some event
production you know already him because
he were presenting your paper in danger
0 9 munich and so please good thank you
thank you can you hear me yeah okay so i
will present you a walk about the
construction of documents by aligning
fragments along orthogonal dimensions
and how we can ease this process sorry
okay so first i will present the context
then what is called dimensions then
motivation so the basic idea behind this
walk and well some other things so i'm
working with users mainly historians and
philosophers who are trying to express
knowledge by associating documentary
fragments so first of all i don't really
know what knowledge mean neither do i
know what a document is but i can just
concentrate on the operational thing
which is the association of fragments
that I I can know what it is and I will
illustrate it now so we begin with one
fragment and on the right on the hop
right of the slide I do a zoo
of what we see here so we have a long d
so we map to the X dimension of the
Allegiant space of the screen something
and to the Y dimension of the collision
space of the screen something else so
here we map nothing to the X dimension
into the Y dimension and we see one
fragment then if I map the insert
dimension to the X dimension of the
screen I can see something like that
which means that inside this fragment is
contain this fragment and inside this
fragment we can find this fragment and
inside this fragment can find this
fragment then if I also map to the Y
dimension the same level dimension I can
see that at the same level as this disc
collection we have this collection and
at the same level at this correction
with etc then if I switch I i map two dy
dimension and something called archive
then I I can explode the contents of the
fragment and see all the pages which
makes this fragment and I can play like
that with this dimension operators and
so for example here I map did
transcription dimension 2x and fragment
to why so I can see that the
transcription of this page is this text
and this page is composed of fragments
of polygonal zones which have been
defined by the users and this text is
also made of fragments which has been so
interval of text which have been
extracted by the users ok so now more
formally we have we work with a set of
identified fragments so we just have
seen some
examples of them and then we have the
lists of lists of fragments this is the
basic structure so these lists we call
dimensions and the list inside code
segments so for example on the
transcription dimension we have a first
list with two fragments a page and its
transcription then the second list with
a page and its transcriptions etc Jeter
moreover there must exist a partial
function between fragments and
dimensions so it just means that a
fragment can appear at most once in the
dimension so how question is what's the
rationale by behind the structuring of
the dimensions the users are free to
create all the dimensions they want but
can this process of making dimensions
can we help the user with this process
so the idea we would like to defend is
that we can compute some configurations
or some moments sometimes when it should
be effective to ask the user to
formalize their structural knowledge we
can't ask them that all the time but
there are some some very well precise
times where it can be useful and in
order to introduce this ID I will
introduce a notion of composition of
dimensions so let's say a user said that
a fragment was a first version of
another one
and then later the same user or nother
users say that this fragment you see
which was so this is a first version of
that and this fragment is a draft for
this fragment okay so the first version
dimension and the draft dimensions are
not identical but under some point of
view and under the temporal point of
view they can be made equal but only
it's only extracts a partial meaning of
these two dimensions if we are only
interested by the temporal succession of
fragments then we can say that first
version and draft are equal therefore we
model this situation with a composite
dimension and we say okay for example d
dot entirety is a composition of first
version and draft and once the user eyes
expressed this fact the entirety
dimension will be automatically
populated with fragments and here we see
that so this comes before that which can
be for that and this fragment at the
center comes before this fragment
because it is a draft of this fragment
so now since we said that there is a
partial function which must be preserved
between fragments and dimensions there
cannot be in traditional cycles since
the old fragment can appear at most once
inside a dimension so with normal
interactions users can never make this a
cycle appear inside the dimension but
once we introduce this composition
operation a cycle can appear
theoretically and so let's see why a few
users say that the last fragment so the
fragment in the middle is the draft for
the last fragment then if I a message
can appear which say okay given the
followings configuration which we'll see
in the following slide the draft
dimension can cannot anymore be a sub
dimension of the entire ET dimension and
he is given this view and you can do
something to break this intra
dimensional cycle so there we see that
the cycle we see that this is anterior
to that and this is interior to that but
the last fragment is a draft of the
first fragment so we have a loop inside
the entirety dimension so the loop is
not present now because we didn't do the
automatic creation of the entirety
dimension because we can't allow cycle
inside a dimension but so the user can
can do something maybe it will delete is
the fragment he just added to the draft
dimension or we will do something else
but he will explicitly express his
structural knowledge about the
dimensions so once that has been said we
must had that there is more than one way
for the merging of the composite
dimension
there is not a bijection between the the
composite dimension so dealer draft and
DDOT third version for example and the
entirety there are more than one ways to
build entirety from draft and first
version so the algorithm I implemented
choose one of this way but maybe it's
not the better one from the user point
of view so maybe the user will rearrange
the entirety dimension and what to do
with with his reaction to this
composition for now I do nothing with it
but I think there is something
interesting to do there and finally what
about a graph metaphor for representing
the dimensions because we saw that
strange orthogonal view of dimensions
which is which I I took from Ted Nelson
zigzag structure but why not using a
graph metaphor so I did use a graph
metaphor and we had some difficulty for
some for the synthesis of things and and
it was quite slow to interact with the
graph there with only small and precise
interaction we can do a lot of things we
just changed the X dimension and we see
something completely different so that
can be a good thing or and also maybe a
bad thing I this is a something to to
question so yes I just since we are
speaking about dimensions I made a
reference to flatline if some of you
don't know this dystopia it can be
interesting to give a look at it thank
you
Thank You pol works on time for a few
questions so please
given the difficulty of handling
polygons and merging them and performing
those sort of operations did you
consider using the more two dimensional
data structures like region codes and
stuff like that sorry I didn't so I
couldn't hear you just um polygons are
very difficult to handle yeah they tend
to have a lot of trouble making
algorithms that work with them whereas
there are data structures that work very
well for the sort of two-dimensional
horizontal and vertical layouts yeah
have you looked into any of these so not
the one I think you're referring to but
I looked at something more let's say
procedural I look at the the j
programming language which is meant for
dealing with this kind of dimensions but
this implementation doesn't use that
yeah but you're right the better way of
dealing with these structures one more
question I have one seems to me quite
interesting to imagine a structure for
the for the research space of document
that people working with documents such
as you one you are working with since
also to meet its perhaps a bit abstract
this notion of giving an interpretation
to to the dimension do you think it's
indeed are too abstract for them or dvd
with voting so it's difficult it's much
more difficult that than a graph
metaphor that's for sure so there is a
learning learn the learning curve is is
not the same but once they are used to
it for operation they do often it's very
fast they can do things very very fast
and so they are pleased with it but now
in walking about a conjunction of this
dimensional views with the more
traditional graph metaphor and how we
can make the to interact and because yes
it's not that easy to DJ's took it thank
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
