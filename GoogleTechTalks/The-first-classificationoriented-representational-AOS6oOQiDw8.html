I'm going to suggest to you that we
don't have formalisms for talking about
glasses and we therefore do not
understand very well what glasses are so
this is sort of related things so the
first air of the talk will be about the
sort of formalisms that we have and why
they are inadequate for dealing with
glasses and was there for classification
and the two thirds of the thought will
be about this new formalism that we have
been working for many many years and
this is just hot of the press even
though this is the fifth version but
it's a much more satisfactory version so
let's take a look we have to deal with
very basic issues here first what is a
numeric representation well this mapping
did not really appear for a long time
historically but eventually we began to
represent objects by numbers primitive
tribes are still using knots and so on
so the numbers actually should be
thought of in this way not really as
representations of things that begin
eventually be used as representations
but in any case this is sort of a view
of what is a numeric representation is
notice there's no concept of class here
appears so numbers you know we have
natural numbers there no classes there
and natural numbers is no different fact
even if you go to real numbers so the
this step is is not a big step as far as
the representation of formalism is
concerned what I would like to elide I
want to allow questions during the
not discussions because then we can
proceed it at a reasonable pace
discussions we can do at the end of the
talk so first of all a little bit about
the classes well if you look carefully
sort of at objects in the universe it
turns out there is no single object that
exists outside the environment of its
class so these are tightly linked things
wherever we look at there are always
associated classes there is no object
that exists outside the class sort of
they are coexistent concepts so it's
important to understand that then that
there must be some tight link between
objects and classes and that sort of the
business of induction is the reason
biological information processing is so
effective it sort of realize it's a
built-in mechanism and therefore it must
exist in nature too so it's not our
invention it must exist let me propose
the definition of what means class
oriented representational formalism we
want to have a formalism that does the
mapping of objects but that this mapping
automatically induces the mapping of the
classes so the way we define classes in
the representational formalism should
correspond to those classes so we should
not invent then what the definition of
class is it must come with a
representation of formalism so those two
postulates and I'm going to discuss them
in greater detail in the next slides so
what are the implications the some e I'm
saying non-trivial but it's not a
particularly difficult one we can
discuss later that first of all that the
class must being used by object mapping
so it's not something we should be
sweating a lot about introducing classes
and they should automatically capture
the classes in reality so here is our
representation formalism once a defined
class here it should capture exactly the
corresponding clause
exists in reality and we will discuss
later on by conventional representation
certainly vector space representation do
not satisfy this property and also what
about the general structure of this
concept so we're not going yet into
details but it's something about general
formal structure what we want to have up
we would like to have this situation
that class representation must be
expressed with basic object operations
if we violate this we would violate
other the first basic axiom now I'm just
drawing your attention in this slide
that we don't have the concept of class
representation and this is not really an
accident even though it's quite
unreasonable situation to do
classification without the concept of
class representation but I am saying
that it's not accidental it just
happened so that conventional formalism
do not really support an adequate
concept of class so we kind of have to
edit a post hoc so you can think about
that situation which extend we have the
concept of class representation now
moving on to this sort of structure what
we want to have we want it to be sort of
of inductive generative structure so
what does it mean you know generative
structure is similar to what Chomsky was
talking about grammars we want to be
able to generate every object in the
class and only those objects and it must
be inductive now inductive formal
grammars don't possess that property
inductive it means it must be
effectively reliably recoverable from a
small training set that's that's what
inductive is so this is just I'm
reminding the words syntactic popular
area in 70's 80's in tactic pattern
recognition where they try to adopt
formal grammars to describing classes of
parents but it's sort of fizzled out
because of the problems i will discuss
in a moment
so what is what is it related to the
inadequacies of formal grammars well
Chomsky actually never believed as I
mentioned here he never believed in
induction because first of all on the
one hand he couldn't see connection
between formal grammars and induction
because there is no tight link between
set of strings and the formal grammars
so reform of grammars is sort of kind of
god-given right somehow it appears with
all the rules and productions and so on
and the difficulty of course has to do
with even the underlying string
representation they just don't care
enough information to allow this
recovery of class representation well
here's just a simple example if you take
two strings they because they don't have
formative history embedded in them as a
part of the representation you can't
really distinguish between those two
strings even though if you go to a
little bit more precise representation
this is not tree this capture of the
formative history you will see that
they're different and this is what is
indicated was green and red that you had
a BA and then a CA applied where the
second a was the context while in the
second case the first a was the context
which is very different situation ok
what is I'm going to discuss a little
bit vector space as several minutes well
here is a formal definition just to
remind you of the vector space is you
know this famous state axioms but
basically you have two operations now
what does that mean from applied point
of view where you define vector space in
this way this is sort of standard formal
method definition of this as a structure
well so we must assume that
representational structure is the
algebraic structure there's simply no
other candidate for representational
structure so we must assume that it is
this operations detect an object and
accordingly accordingly here I'm just
disgusting
why this was systematically overlooked
that but accordingly what are we allowed
then if we assume that these are the
operations on the data and that's what
mathematical description of that formal
structure is we must demand that the
class representation is expressible we
are these operations the only candidates
then become a fine subspaces just
shifted this linear subspaces because
they have to be consistent with
underlying structure now from apply
point of view this linear generativity
is obviously is going to capture sorry
why can't you represent the class as a
half space the pitch is a vector space
representing they do not sort of feed
this standard mass you want to have it
you want to have class representation
every element in the class be generative
in other words you the class description
must be of generative type every element
must be expressible with a basic
operations of class representation so
you would not be if I give you a
training set and also here is inductive
the second part comes in you want it to
be recoverable uniquely from a finite
training set so how would you recover so
you want to have this boss thing
generativity in this how would you
define then how if i give you find a
training set and you would say that
class would be half space how would
reach half space with you choose
internet so emergencies let's say the
half space that separates the training
now suppose I give you just one plus
this training set from that class how
would you choose which class
representation would be reasonable for
if I give you what our 20 vectors yeah
how would you define because you want to
have those two properties the
generativity and everything should be
expressive will be a basic operation
this vector addition and multiplication
how would you define plus elements how
would you give me exact but you have to
generate every class element why do you
feel that this ability is necessary for
well because if you think about here is
the real classes and here is your
formalism we want to have the mapping
the object mapping induces class mapping
so if I have certain objects in the
class I want to be able to generate
every object of this class only and only
this object in the class using class
representation I want to have this one
so a one-to-one mapping between real
objects and objects in my formalism one
thing that's been proposed for one class
classification is to find the half space
whose coefficient vector has the
smallest to North
something that satisfies constraints of
the Living force the fact that all
members of your class around one side of
the net space but again if you take
again let's go back to the real object
in this mapping you remember this
mapping from real object into your
formalism you want to assure that after
you do this that all object that you can
generate in your formalism every object
that you can generate in your formalism
correspond to the physical object that
you are dealing with was the class you
are dealing with I mean this mapping is
very important because you're mapping
the actual object into objects in your
formalism so you want to have a very
tight link between the actual object and
the object that you have in the
formalism so once you say it's a class
representation you have to then claim
that every object that fall within this
class has a corresponding object in
reality which is which would not be the
case you want to have it's a strong
restriction it's a very strong
restriction on what you want to have as
a representation of formalism so I guess
depending on what you call a class that
I guess is what we are talking about
over lunch there well no you don't want
to call anything artificial class you
want to define class in such a way that
this mapping is validated that wants you
because representational formalism is
something that you're going to use to
represent the actual objects in whether
it's a web page it doesn't matter you're
going to use that representational
formalism to map object so once you are
in your representation of formalism now
you have to live here but that means you
cannot invent the concept of class that
is not meaningful over here so once you
make the object you are done you're not
allowed you don't have any other means
to change what the class of actual
object over here on the left hand side
because you're dealing with real object
you're just representing them in this
formalism on the right hand side so once
you met them that's it you have no
control so the whole point is that once
you do this mapping realize you want it
to be automatically induced the mapping
of this class on to this class it's a
strong requirement but what I am
suggesting that this is sort of a
necessary requirement because then you
see if you do not satisfy that condition
you will be defining classes here that
has no reality over here and that's
that's that's a problem it just it seems
to me that it's impossible to define
well you will see now other so I'm going
to talking about this is most of little
there
the question might be are there things
that that we would you know like we were
like us I mean are there things that we
would call classes that are not captured
by this tunnel is no but if you define a
class to be things that are captured by
this formalism but you will see no you
will see if the formalism is universally
applicable because this Foreman is an
OLE object can be encoded therefore it's
very easy to check if there are real
classes that that once you have that
mapping and you use this formalism then
if you can find classes here there are
not classes in your formulism then
you're done then you know it's not good
but it is you will see it is not like
that so anyway what I'm suggesting that
to compensate for the above paucity of
at not glasses but these classes
according to that definition and in
violation of sort of wisdom in
mathematics one brings alien plus
representations and therefore alien
classes like you use various so you
bring things like nonlinear functions
and other things to define plus they
have nothing to do with the structure of
this vector space which is algebraic
this is a representation on structure
that's the whole point that if you want
to treat objects this way if you want to
take your representation of formalism
seriously you must take the operations
and objects also seriously so here it is
just this is a typical picture okay
here's here's the thing here is your
class and you have some nonlinear
decision surfaces here now everybody got
used to this so it took me 10 years to
us this kind of question because I also
was used to these things assuming that
that's okay you know this is how things
look like but the question is how
meaningful and informative such class
description if we call this classes what
do we learn when I draw these curves in
the vector space how much did I learn
about anything real mean because this
class is correspond to reality how much
am i learning about reality when I'm
drawing this kind of curves in a vector
space or surfaces what am i learning
well it's
useful to us this question because you
want to be able to say that when you've
gotten class representation that you
learn a lot of things about reality
because that's sort of the purpose of
induction and this is where the hidden
induction this is what sort of
philosophers thought that we should be
able you know when we say we learn
something class we should get wiser I
mean what are we learning about what are
we learning about actual objects will
need to draw this but anyway let me move
one so there is no tight link between
the training set and the class
representation and that's a big problem
because we want to have a much tighter
link so it's things are uniquely sort of
reducible to class representation and
then you know so what are we learning
during the learning process basically so
the problem is not with learning
algorithms that's what I'm saying it is
nothing to do is learning it's a much
deeper underlying problem with the
representational formalism itself
because the structure of this
representational formalism besides that
you cannot do you cannot remedy this
deficiency to begin once you're there so
I'm saying the modern trends in machine
learning is again this distances kernels
and so on they don't change I'm just
listing again that doesn't change the
basic situation that we have been
discussing you still don't have
meaningful class representation and
that's a big problem so we've got to
move as as hard as it appears we've got
to move on and the benefits are
tremendous because once you have that
kind of formalism you are really doing
sort of it's not just important for
information processing classifying web
pages but you also from point of view
biological and I mean when you're doing
when you have this protein data banks
you know you have a good description of
this process to meaningful description
which is would be then very illuminating
to biologists it won't be just something
that
one uses only for some strange ability
purposes and of course as far as the
search engines are concerned well
imagine if you have that formalism you
can show you represent classes and as a
basis you use it as a basis for
organizing search engine and then the
query will be either a glass element or
description of a class two things are
possible so the user be a certain
interface either will specify class
element or will specify description of
glass and he will get as a result of
query the class itself well here I am
discussing in a while the origins of
this world go back to nineteen ninety
it's a long paper published in pattern
recognition this is the website for the
latest version it's a it's a 70 page
paper but it's well illustrated in its
just 70 pages there's hardly any I think
we removed all Emma's and theories just
the basic concept there take 70 page but
there are a lot of illustrations there's
a formal definition here I'm just going
to give it for informal kind of just
intuitive feeling for hope for words
going on so as a scientific view we
would like to view the reality as a
multitude of interacting and enrolling
classes of structural processes that's
all let's say let's view reality as this
in fact that's what it is you know any
portal and your desk this actually is a
process and you will see next if you
think about a chromosome because it has
genes you this is a poor representation
the string is a poor it doesn't
correspond because in reality it's a
dynamic process this is how it was
created and this is how it gets
translated and so on so there is a
process involved and string doesn't
capture this kind of reality so but but
a string captures are more abstract
cancer
because you know a number like different
chromosomes could share the same DNA
sequence well yes but but you remember
what I mentioned about strings earlier
that if I give you from even never mind
the sort of more pragmatic point of view
but just doing learning if i give you
finite set of strings why Cannot you why
there are there are infinitely many
classes of strings currently so
according to the current Kwanzaa book
that contained this fine and so that
that's not a palatable située you don't
want to rebel entity why again because a
string does not carry within itself
sufficient information for doing this
adequate recovery but I think they're
reasonable principles to use to choose
from among the infinitely many concepts
that are consistent with this would be a
lot are they would be somewhat at hawk
principles that would simply have to be
put in in order to deal with that big
problem and there's a trade-off between
between how ahead hawk or principal
solution is and how useful but the whole
point you see of having a good formalism
for classification you don't want to
introduce this kind of assumptions you
want to get into representation and you
want to move on with it and doing easily
the job that you need to do you don't
want to introduce later on all kinds of
ad hoc assumptions no I mean in general
I mean that's a year sore or
representational formalism you know if
you look back at this first two axioms
once you represent the objects you want
your classes to emerge naturally don't
want to do any hocus pocus so you want
them to be sitting there that's what it
depends right I mean if somebody has an
engineering objective to you know build
interface interface to a database where
no scientists put their sequence and it
tells us something about the likely
function let's say
tissue sample or something like that a
representation depends on the DNA I'm
sorry what are the classes here what
would the classes class might be
proteins of the given function of X plus
proteins was a given function right so
that's precisely fit into this concept
of class but a representation that
depends on a DNA coding for the protein
might be a more convenient and effective
way to design an engineer not
necessarily it is known that there are
proteins that have very similar DNA
structure or RNA structure but they have
a different function quite different
functions of those cases don't
necessarily mean that it that it is not
effective engineering tool no it's an
indication that you cannot grasp
effectively class of this the whole
point is you want to have a reliable
grasp of a class that you are dealing
with that is the purpose of pacification
you said yourself you want to be able to
say that this class of proteins have
very similar functions that's the
purpose I assume you told me that that
would be the definition of that class
right so if you want this then you
automatically one if I give you a small
training example 5 10 15 proteins you
want to be able later on reliably say
what whether other protein belongs to
that class or not and more importantly
you won't be able to answer that
question unless your class
representation contain some non-trivial
information related to the function of
this protein in some form like a DNA see
no but DNA sequence yes I'm of your
talent folding right protein the same
sequence can fold in this weighs under
the
other things in assists which is really
ties in his argument or the temporal
process is the folding and they're a lot
about other elements involvement protein
folding besides just became a see the
chromosomes no but this is the
chromosomes are sort of the source code
that the Serai describes the DNA
sequence but you the sequence has to be
executed in the rest of the system that
causes the folding to occur that
eventually produces the behavior of the
protein you know behavior the protein
really just determined by how it is
folded and not just by the sequence
itself but the fact but that fact
doesn't necessarily imply but one must
design induction engines that are going
to reason about classes of proteins
using representations of the proteins
that involve all the details of the
evolutionary history of the protein no
no we are not talking about this yes I
revolutionary Esther it is an individual
process well it's it's a little bit
involved no no we're not we're not
talking yet I think this is what you
edit yourself right now I haven't
suggested that you have to plug in
entire information about I am only
telling you that you're representational
formalism should be reliable enough that
it will capture the class in the right
way with this function and the string
does not have enough information well
you gave me example of a class right so
I'm assuming we're discussing that plus
there are some classes that can be
described very well well I don't know
when classes except for a trivial one
that would be described by DNA sequence
kinase so tiny cells have
of protein sequence the highly conserved
that codes for region and the protein
that attaches to a particular type of
molecule all right but I'm not sure that
I can for example I can give you a very
sequence very close to the ones that you
think belong to that class that will not
be doing this at all but for the
engineering purpose of classifying real
proteins that science is really
encountered not when you say real but
this would be real sequin because I can
manufacture you something that will have
exactly that sequence but will won't
behave in that way the inability of my
system to handle that are officially
created artificially agree this is a
real thing I'm talking I will create a
real I mean that those type of
circumstances will arise and frequently
enough but my engineering to all
nevertheless be useful why are you sure
why sure about this I mean it is being a
tool that type is being used as we speak
no no it is being used because we don't
have other tools it is not being used
because it is superior to the tools are
I want to discuss because these tools
have not been around yet the ones that I
want to discuss I guess what I'm what
I'm arguing for is a possibility that
abstract representations which leave out
some aspects of the items that we wish
to classify can never less be useful
engineering tools that's the only part
yes but this is general enough statement
what I want to discuss is I want to
discuss today is what is important to
have in a representational formalism
that will give you a reliable way to
deal with specification not that is what
is possible to do of course if you are
poor in representational means yes but
why not to if you have a more powerful
representation of means why not to go
for this because you will have a much
more precise picture of everything that
sometimes I abstraction can be powerful
because I can save you unnecessary
effort and sorting through fast but okay
you will see as we go down you will see
why it is true there is a certain
hypothesis you will see coming up I just
beginning to discuss this temporal
process that is very important first I
just want to remind you where funeral
prices even worried in the last 15 years
in the evolutionary developmental
biology if you look at the body plan it
turns out that all animals have roughly
what 500 million years ago there is a
regular regulatory genes that organized
during the development the body plan and
you go from mammals and you go to flies
and they're very similar than of course
there are some modifications so I'll
come back to this I just want you to
keep in mind this order a regular
proteins that organize things so what is
the body plan you can think about each
segment as a class and this class is
being modified evolutionary but think of
each body segment also as a class and
you build larger classes out of the
smaller body segments but we will come
back to this one well what about other
data ok let's look look at web pages web
page you should not be treated as static
so what we are talking about is not
whether you can represent you can always
represent something in a very poor way
you we want to understand what means
a reliable representation for the
purposes of classification what is a
good representation for the purposes of
classification that's what vm disca we
are not discussing whether you can
always go into poor representations for
various reasons but to no classification
that's what we are discussing which kind
of representation so you know the
webpage we are interacting with the web
page so it's not a static object if you
think about it even the way we represent
web page we sort of interacting and here
is the time element so there is a
process involved so I'm preparing you
towards objectives processes view this
will be done so if you're talking about
classes of objects we are talking about
now about classes of processes so each
object kind of will be pro you will see
now I haven't defined this form earlier
just something like that
so what is the basic sort of formal
units here they're called primitives
more fully primitive transformations so
think of this circle now this is an
abstract primitive what it defines is
this each of these figures on the top
correspond to a class of processes that
are coming in then they interact and
something other classes are being
produced sometimes similar so this is
the unit of representation this is sort
of atomic units of representation and
what do they capture they capture a set
of events because everything now
processes so we use events to represent
things event understood as interaction
of classes so this is a concrete
primitive unfortunately the figures are
the same but now you're talking about
concrete process that belongs to the
class so you can think of concrete
object so those c11 and CJ 2 and so on
these are the concrete processes in ours
concrete elements of the class so this
is a concrete primitive and this is a
label if you see that what is the label
label is a way because we are not going
to be writing those processes on the top
so this label be capture the sequence of
processes and well when you observe it
you know sequence of events it just
happened that this process turn into the
terminal process so called for one
primitive became an initial process for
another primitive now primitives events
ok they're just encapsulating you ends
and that you absorb during the
interaction whatever so just some very
life examples ok car collision ok you
have an event right two processes come
in and to process come out two cars were
driving this is the two processes to
object and
this you know sentence take a cent and
John fell in love with Susan okay well
if I tell you that John fall in love
with Susan as far as you're concerned
your representation is just an event to
you the two processes one of the way of
modeling is ok to initials and two
terminals because you change your
perception of those two people so
something happened to them it's not the
same it's not the same John and it's not
the same Susan it's not something was
added this event added something to this
but you continued John is still John but
it's a different slightly different this
is what what is shown so Alice and Bob
had a baby again having a baby to
initial three terminals because you knew
Alison vote now there are three of them
and so you have three process let's go
more scientific example so to speak is
into physics this was inspired by fine
man diagrams but they're more less
precise kind of their capturing this
situation lest we will see now we will
be you'll see several examples related
to this so you have primal processes
this is the process that come in and
come out there called primal processes
you see you don't know at the basic
level you don't know yet the structure
of the process so the structure is
suppressed and you just see lines that's
all what you see
later on you will see that this
structure will become available for
transform sort of once we learn
something so this is the primal
processes and this is the event this is
the basic events now let's take a look
at hydrogen atom well I guess no before
this we still have to take a look at
sort of that view this is just an
encapsulation how to think how to
translate everything into this formalism
in eight years so here you observe state
while you observe something a B ABC then
stay to you observe DNC and what you saw
that a and B merge to form d here is an
event so normally conventionally you
would represent them a sequence of the
state hear what you are representing is
this that's a representation of the of
the situation what time is going this
way so time become a very important
factor time and structural
representation now become interlinked
you cannot Universal you cannot go back
once you hear that's it time is going
down you cannot back so everything going
one way it's irreversible processes so
by the way this is what we will call
formative history and I'm going to be
using often disseminated gradually
hopefully we will get to the meaning of
that so biology gives a very good
example of science to suggest how to
think about objects forth our thing for
our purposes for purposes of classes and
classification so what is the strap in
in this model
well here is a struct sequence of events
some of the events of course you didn't
see they were not temporarily arranged
so that's okay the not temporarily order
this is still representation of the
process of a small segmental process by
the way this is nothing to do with
graphs now because of the temporal thing
how it was inspired of course by natural
numbers because according to pee on
axioms you know this is how the numbers
ability have a successor sort of
operation and numbers are built that way
now with numbers you can collapse them
you don't need this initially primitive
tribes stored actually this sort of
nodes but then we started to write three
so the temporal parts or disappeared but
if you look at this you can see now you
cannot collapse it because each one has
a structure each event now has a
structure and utilities as a part of the
representation so this is the
fundamental distinction because now
because you can ask Allah you cannot
collapse it because each event is
possibly structurally different from the
other and you have a temporal sequence
oh but it was inspired by numbers of
course this representation well here is
a hydrogen atom you have one proton and
one electron and you can see the
sequence of events that correspond this
is sure you can think of it as a
hydrogen process they're going on this
interaction so that's a representation
would be a hydrogen process by the way
this is a structural representation in
quant or us to find my diagrams this was
just drawings this is interpreted as a
formal structure representation because
this events is a formal entities this is
a lithium process you know slightly more
complex and you can see when periodicity
because of course yes
so structure labeling there is a formal
concept of structure labeling so when
you relate all the start is just a
mapping so each strap each class has a
set of labels associated with it so you
can take all the labels of one class and
so you're allowed relating that preserve
class belonging but what will happen it
will reveal you see here are the two
strikes one is obtained simply by
labeling the other one but now you can
see that they share something which you
couldn't see before you see here so
reliably plays an important role even
though it's a it's a simple operation so
what are you classifying it's an entire
right side that's an object now
everything becomes a object that's at a
presentation of an object how do you
separate our objects because we pointed
no no this is a representation would be
of a single object what kind of it says
one giant object that you know something
is one humongous process no no you don't
want to be there's nothing to classify
that but if you take the whole universe
there's nothing to classify you're
talking about now object and mention a
webpage whatever you want to deal with
glasses that would be represented like
this but how do you decide what's part
of one out of it no no you are modeling
that object at this process so you
choose your primitives you choose it and
then you encode it in this format so the
same real life objects could be modeled
differently they could be model
differently but the whole point here is
as example from physics suggests that
you want to choose events that would be
most appropriate for modeling a large
chunk of the domain you want to deal
with it is true initially it would not
be easy to do so you will choose certain
events but eventually you would settle
if you want to model certain class of
webpages reasonably wide you will fix
the set of events which
you which you will find rely and you
will use that set of events this
interaction events in terms of the user
right for example you have like
chemistry in chemistry you deal with a
molecules right right an early course
consists of 8 on Adams how do you decide
the particular situation do you want to
view this as collection of molecules or
collection of atoms we will see in this
formalism it allows the stages of
representation so you will see in fact
in this talk how you when the listen and
hydrogen will interact and for museum
hydride you will see how it can become a
primitive or because so that this is a
nature of no special tricks and s it's
just a part of the representation of
organism now so so structurally
identical stats you notice that the
labels are different here but their
structure is the same so you can think
of it when you strip them of labels this
is this is sort of the real object is
this is abstracts truck you can call it
well there is a struct assembly because
here they depicted separately but if you
you will notice that they share some of
the primitive so will you put them
together this is called strut assembly
what it means that you observe them
separately but of course some primitive
for example this primitive share boys by
this by this track and by that start so
when you just picture them together
that's both struct assembly so in other
words when I am observing a face or a
web page I may have notice only part of
it and i represent it as a part but
later on i looked at another part of the
web page and then i will put picture it
but then eventually have to put things
together because i'm looking at
different a different part i think
someone will come
in a few minutes oh so you probably want
to all right here is the bubble sort
example sorry here is an example of a
modeling how to model bubble sort here
here in model similar you can do both
small architecture architecture static
for the array and you have a data flow
so either are primitives this is just a
simple example because it's it's an
irate very simple but it could be a
little bit it to demonstrate some points
sorry so here is the more though here is
the one comparison how it would be
modeled a single comparison now we will
see the this is a single internal loop
so what you do you bubble for bubble up
to its location this is how the
presentation look look the architecture
doesn't change this is just says this
marks the boundary of sell these events
but you can have a dynamic architecture
it would be more complex than picture so
just a bit slow so here is sorting of
this 4231 this is the so you see here is
the struct corresponding to actual
process so for sorry a 3some one may
come in yeah but if it's very nice post
I also have another talk it's free i
have to go to stop ok q village all
right one more minutes before if
district ok so here is example of two
struts now here is the class description
classes captioning it constrains plus is
defined we are constraints and here is
how you generate elements of the class
you allow environment to make a move so
to speak environment is whatever the
processes that participate but you're
the white ones represent the elements
that you the events that you care of it
becomes glass element so here is the
picture here is your class element
so class representation consists of a
struct plus this generating system that
actually build plus element and it
specified via those constraints so here
is the same example with web pages you
know just here is the simulation this is
constraints for bubble sort and you will
see now simulation of what happens how
do you generate because this is a class
description
so this is sort of description this is
how that struck is being generated and
of course this class description could
be used for construction of any struct
that belongs to so called bubble sort
now it turns out that there are levels
you see if you take a strap and if you
learn some classes the whole thing could
be partitioned then and you have a more
information so you can call it a level
one stroke because it contains this
partitioning based on the classes that
you have learned so there is a formal
description how to build max level
classes because there are constraints
now associated how they interact loss
elements so still the same kind of
language and here is a class element
construction now use larger chunks
because now you're not using single
primitives you're using class elements
to build this level 1 plus alright the
same sort of a picture but you're
building out the larger chunks so this
is just some example how you can build
so here is you this this is a level one
class but it's built out of here in the
description of glasses of previous level
so you can this is one element of a
level 1 plus and just very similar a
year to what you have here now here is
in transformations the here is the
process something happens here now at
this level you can see the processes
before the processes were not visible so
here is this is how you go to the next
level it is compressed now here is an
example with this lithium hydride here
this is what you have seen but you can
shrink it and it becomes primitive and
you can use it for description or other
so that's sort of the last slide this is
the sort of encapsulation of what
picture you you have various level
classes here then you move to the next
stage this is when this transformation
appear when you see this interactions
budget chunks and and so on this is how
this representation so the basic idea is
the
that I don't think we can do
classification without adequate
representation of formalism in spite of
the fact that there are so many people
engage in classification I I think that
it has to do with the right
representational formalism that will
have an important impact a major impact
