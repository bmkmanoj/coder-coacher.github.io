in problem-solving defining theories of
change metrics evaluation in short all
sorts of things that you could almost
call an engineering approach that would
be very comfortable and familiar to us
here at Google and so about 11 years ago
when Hewlett decided that one of the
most strategic things they could do
would be to teach strategic philanthropy
to other people they tapped Christine
sherry to head up the program of what
was called the philanthropy workshop
West and so from its inception eleven
years ago is it 11 years ago or 211
years ago until tpw became an
independent entity last year
Christine was the founding director the
leader and basically the heart of the
philanthropy workshop West so she's here
today to give us a small sampling of the
sort of thing that tpw taught which is
which tpw was an intensive comprehensive
introduction to making chain I'm giving
in a way that would make changes that
you wanted out in the world so I am
pleased and honored to welcome a teacher
friend and mentor Christine sherry I'm
now going to ask for a few seconds to
put in the tape and Victor thank you
thank you it's great to be here and it's
great to have Paulo have invited me he
was part of a year-long class that we
did we traveled all over the world and
he's a really great guy to be sitting on
the back of the bus with when you're
about five hours into a site visit
looking at kind of rural water for
purification projects and you need a
good laugh he asked the best questions
of anybody that incredible Google brain
you see his eyes kind of glaze it would
come up with these amazing questions
that were just the most write on things
and took the absolute best notes of
anybody in the class so that when the
rest of us were a little bit lost and
didn't know the answer to something we
could always turn him and get his
notebook and he was terrific as sharing
it so it's fun to be here and thank you
Jay as well for including me today in
your presentation let me ask a couple
questions how many of you are all here
because you're interested in thinking
about how to pitch a project to the
Google corporate giving Council
okay good and how many of you are here
because you're faced with the dilemma of
how you have to choose between a bunch
of different nonprofits and trying to
get your head around how to make some
good choices cool okay well we're gonna
try to talk a little bit about both of
those things today but I wanted to start
with just literally a minute or two on
the basic principles of strategic
philanthropy so what is strategic
philanthropy well there's a lot of ways
of thinking about philanthropy you could
have faith-based philanthropy you can
have faith-based philanthropy where you
go to a dinner party and you sit next to
somebody and they talk to you about some
great nonprofit that you ought to
support and cuz they're your friend you
go to their fundraiser and they get your
name on the list and pretty soon you're
getting solicitations and pretty soon
you're giving them money and then one
day you wake up and saying hey how did I
get here strategic philanthropy is a
little bit different it is based on
focused analysis it is based on having a
strategy for your work that's clear and
well-defined it's based on being really
smart about how you execute and it's
based on thorough follow up so we've all
made charitable investments where you're
watching something like the Haiti
earthquake scenario you want to act you
text in a donation to somebody and you
know that's a good important in the
moment feel-good effort when we're gonna
be talking about today is really a much
more rigorous in some ways engineering
kind of based thinking that says what's
the outcome that I'm looking for how do
I really think smart about making an
investment that hits that outcome and
move forward so what's a gold standard
well you know the best philanthropist
and I had the pleasure of working with
the hewlett Rockefeller foundations for
about 10 years really clear about what
it is that they're trying to achieve
really clear about a strategy that's
going to get them there they are they
are ruthlessly clear about the proposals
that they want to consider and they're
thoughtful about how they communicate
that to the world because the reality
about philanthropy for those of you who
are facing this is there are literally
millions of organizations and projects
that you can support and you can't
support any of them nobody can even Bill
Gates so you've got to be clear about
what is it that you're going to consider
you need to have
kind of framework of a figure I whether
what you're doing makes any difference
at the end of the day it's great to give
a donation to a group because you feel
good in the moment but what we're really
talking about here today is how you
evaluate whether your dollars are making
any kind of significant impact and
finally knowing something about the
field it's really tough to understand
the complexity of a lot of global
problems it's not necessary for you to
understand all of that but it's under
it's important for you to understand how
to figure out where to go so that's sort
of the gold standard of what we're
talking about about strategic
philanthropy so why should you care well
fundamentally I'd say there are three
reasons first you know what I might
waste your money yours or Google's for
every problem that there is to try to
take on whether its climate change or
global poverty issues there are not
enough bucks to make a significant
difference in private philanthropy and
governments and elsewhere so you don't
want to waste your money particularly
those who of you who have earned it and
who will want to enjoy the possibility
of giving it away in a smart way over
the years you want to get the most bang
for your buck Google wants that you
individually want that so how do you
make a philanthropic choice that's going
to get you the most leverage for the
dollar that you invest and finally
something that people don't talk about a
lot do no harm or in the in the local
vernacular evil this isn't an idea that
frequently would come to people's mind
right out of the gate but there are
actually a lot of reasons why you need
to think really long and hard about how
you're going to do this work in a really
thoughtful way because there could be
unintended consequences of giving money
to projects or programs that are not
well designed I mean the big debate
that's going on the microfinance arena
right now which I'm sure many of you are
familiar with which is whether giving
loans to poor people and what are
potentially you serious interest rates
is actually a good idea if they get into
greater debt than they were before they
got the loan and have no capacity to
repay is a perfect example of how you
know smart philanthropy involves first
and foremost doing no harm but it also
involves doing no harm to those folks
who are seeking your money because if
you spend the
out of time pursuing proposals or
interviewing people or asking people a
million questions when it's unlikely
that you would ever fund them that's
actually an opportunity cost problem for
them so you need to think about how do
you go through this process in a really
smart way so that you're getting the
biggest bang for your philanthropic
dollars and you're doing no harm
okay so what we're gonna we're gonna
talk today about one particular aspect
of strategic philanthropy which is how
do you analyze a proposal so somebody
comes to you with a request for money
you're sitting there you're looking
through this you're trying to figure out
do I bother to move forward with this or
not and how do I think about it we're
gonna talk about the difference between
a good idea and a good proposal we're
gonna talk about the elements of a great
proposal we're gonna talk about how you
do due diligence in a smart efficient
and effective way we're gonna talk about
stuff you shouldn't you should be
looking for as a red flags and then
we're gonna do a little practice sound
good
okay cool okay so I want to talk a
little bit first about the difference
between ideas and proposals which might
seem fairly obvious but I think it's
it's something to give some serious
thought to so a great guy in this field
named Jonah rose who work for the
Kellogg Foundation broke most proposals
into one of these four quadrants you
know a great idea with a great proposal
a good idea with a proposal that was
either just badly written suboptimal
unclear not fully fleshed out and the
bottom two quadrants you know a bad idea
that was wrapped up in a beautiful
proposal something you know like imagine
that you get a great beautifully wrapped
gift and you're all excited because the
wrapping paper is gorgeous and the
ribbons gorgeous and you open it up and
it's you know some one of these white
elephants that's been passed around from
your answer for other people and you
sort of wonder why it is that you had so
much excitement around it and of course
the bottom area which is the bad idea
bad proposal so I think we could pretty
quickly dispense with spending any time
in that quadrant if it's a bad idea too
bad proposal you can walk on in an ideal
world of course you would be funding
great ideas it baked in good proposals
but I think we're gonna learn that those
are sometimes few and far between in the
non
profit sector so most of the action is
in this area of you know a great idea
that may be written in a way where not
everything is fully fleshed out or maybe
if it's from an international nonprofit
it's not written in perfect English
it may not be written in a way that's
completely clear and distinctive but
there's a germ of an idea that is really
important and and the art and
philanthropy and the and the what
separates you know great philanthropists
from okay folks are those who recognize
the brilliance of an idea that may be
presented to them in a way that may not
be obvious conversely you know a bad
idea wrapped in a glitzy proposal to you
is something that sometimes takes some
serious looking at because you can get
seduced by great language and people who
are great at marketing and people who
know how to sell but the fundamental
underlying idea may not be worth doing
so I wanted to just offer those as
something to think about here
it's really pretty straightforward to
reject a bad proposal if we got great
eye proposals in the door every way we
could go in the door every day we could
go home and this would all be really
easy and the world's problems would be
solved
Bill Gates wouldn't have to be employing
hundreds of people to try to figure it
out so the what we're gonna be focusing
on is how do you find great ideas and
weaker proposals what's really strategic
and viable what do you need to learn
what do you need to ask to be smart so
let's talk first about what's a good
idea you know a great philanthropic idea
is like a great idea in business or
anything else it's a it's it starts with
a problem that is thoroughly understood
and clearly identified going out and
saying I'd like to solve the problem of
global warming by having a rock concert
go across the country and present shows
and at the end of it a show every night
I'll have some star that would stand up
and say stop global warming
true true proposal I kid you not maybe
doesn't fully articulate a clear
understanding of the nature of the
challenge that we face in that arena so
what is it you're actually trying to do
pretty simple right is what these guys
are proposing that you fund an effective
and compelling solution to the nature of
the problem so if again using the global
warming arena if you are worried about
the passage of effective legislation in
the Senate and you want to affect how
you know ten major senators are gonna
vote on a cap-and-trade bill or whatever
the next climate bill is gonna be you
know what is the strategy that this
nonprofit organization is presenting to
you that would be an effective and
compelling solution to get those
senators to vote the way you want very
detailed very focused very clear is it
clear that the idea that they're
presenting to you makes it clear what
the outcome is that you want again a lot
of times people come forward with the
lofty idea I'd like to change and solve
global property by holding workshops in
the third world that will talk about why
Americans should give away more money
Fleury
a good idea has to be clear about the
outcome and and this is really the
kicker it will it have real impact
you're gonna be choosing picking and
choosing among a variety of proposals
and the the winning idea is one that's
gonna have real impact so then we get to
the question of proposals is the
proposal itself clear do these guys know
what they're talking about is this an
organization that it's got a track
record and the commitment to the issue
do they have a work plan that makes
sense and critically do they know how to
gauge their effectiveness so it sir well
you can have a proposal that might in
fact be clear about an intended outcome
and even have a plan but the fundamental
strategy that they're intending to
propose may not be the strategy that's
going to make a significant difference
that's really the concept of the
difference between the the proposal and
the idea so those are that's just this
is a quick summary of the issues here
but just to kind of recap when you're
thinking about your philanthropy
segregate is
idea that addresses a pressing thing
that you care about and then is the
proposal itself viable and have
potential for impact okay so I tried to
talk to a number of colleagues and
friends to identify some proposals that
I wanted to share with you today that
hit the gold standard yeah they're uh
one is it this is a is a fifteen page
proposal so I'm going to talk about it
really quickly but I'd love for those of
you who really want to dig into this and
understand what's a gold standard a
proposal take a look at this document on
Google Docs this is an organization that
sought a grant of $30,000 from the flora
Family Foundation which is a Family
Foundation of the family members of the
Hewlett family the project itself was
going to cost $115,000 they'd already
gotten a $40,000 matching grant they
were coming to the Hewlett the flora
Family Foundation saying give us $30,000
okay so that's just the basic facts but
the important piece here is who were
these guys and what were they trying to
do this is an organization that actually
has a us-based connection the woman in
the middle in the blue is a us-based
partner to the Afghan groups but they
work with six organizations of Afghan
women and and those have you been
following the news in Afghanistan know a
couple basic things terribly difficult
country to work in horrible security
problems government is a mess
very few NGOs that are working in
Afghanistan of those fewer headed by
women the government turns to the
nonprofit community to help deliver
basic services so you have a perfect
storm here where you have a place that
needs serious help you have very few
organizations on the ground that the
capacity deliver that help and therefore
it's very difficult for them to get
money this proposal said if we bring a
group of the best women leading NGOs
together and we train them how to do
their work well we teach them about
effectiveness we teach them about
natural management we teach them how to
try to apply for grants we teach them
how to be strategic in their work the
leverage of this over time will be
significant because it it is these women
who were responsible for serving
literally hundreds of men and women and
children throughout the country so the
proposal was thirty thousand dollars to
do trainings for these women to teach
them how to be maximally effective in
their work so why is this a great idea
they have any thoughts yeah okay exactly
and the the the general score the
general temptation is to give to one
group and give them to a project to do
on the ground but this to me is the
ultimate leverage you give money to a
group of people who were selected among
30 different women Afghan NGOs you train
them how to do their job well you you
work with them closely to manage these
NGOs as well as they possibly can and
what you do ultimately is you leave
behind a generation of future leaders
who have the capacity to deliver the
critical work that's there but for that
kind of training these local NGOs on the
ground are never going to be able to get
money from major international
organizations they're going to be caught
in a cycle of never having enough to
move forward so it's a not an obvious or
intuitive project but it's a project
that has high leverage and that has a
you know a capacity to to have a ripple
effect generationally and mostly it will
leave something behind when your money
goes away the other reason why this is
such a great proposal is that woman in
blue who is a complete rockstar she
an NGO in Kabul she's a Rhodes Scholar
she's a Fulbright Scholar she is the
ultimate leader for an organization like
that so something to think about okay
I'm gonna have you guys work through
something here so this is based on a
real pro proposal for somebody locally
now to start a diabetes clinic we're
gonna just to look at one aspect of the
proposal that has to do with the goals
of this organization so here's the goals
in version 8 take a quick look sorry for
the so long but I'd love to just have
you read it and let me know what you
think what kind of questions would you
have coming out of that
okay yes yes right great observations so
it's not clear how the clinic affects
the broader community yes Jay oh sure
so so the the comment was it appears
local and it's not clear how the
education program for the clinic would
connect with the general public
yeah okay not clear what the incidence
of diabetes is and so how you're going
to go about tackling that problem
anybody else yes right so you're trying
to connect the dots between the problems
with the folks that are diagnosed and
the broader community okay all really
good observations okay let's see how
this proposal could be improved to be at
least clearer on what it is that they're
trying to do so let's look at version B
does this make it clear what it is these
folks are about
right this is only a portion of the
proposed the question was it doesn't
talk about expected outcomes but I'm
using this to just talk about one aspect
of the proposal and the point really
simply is this you know a good proposal
is one that is explicit about the work
that the folks are going to do and makes
it very obvious to them and to you the
work that's going to be taken then it's
up to you to question is this the right
kind of idea are these the right folks
is this an important thing is it going
to solve the problems we're about but
the the reason I wanted to show this to
you is the difference between a proposal
that is fairly generic and one that is
very explicit is really critical in
terms of understanding the nature of the
work that's going to be performed so
let's look at another aspect to this
proposal this is on a section of the
same proposal this is real-life proposal
about evaluating the impact to the group
so let's look at the first version of
this
does that give you enough information to
go on okay what's missing sir okay how
they're gonna continue to fund the
organization after this year what else
yes
how many people they're actually serving
great yes whether they're actually gonna
have any impact on the problem that
they're taking on exactly anybody else
what the classes consultations and
website would actually look like okay
let's see the after version of this you
know again there's underlying questions
you need to ask about whether the
strategy is right whether the group is
right whether there's gonna solve the
fundamental problem their opponent but
again I just I'm showing this to you as
an example of the difference between a
generic description of the problem and a
detailed description of the problem and
and good ideas have great strategy and
good proposals are as clear as day about
what the organization is gonna do Monday
morning when they show up for work so
that a year later when they've come back
to you and said here's our report you
two are on the same page you're clear
about what it is that they were trying
to achieve they're clear about what it
is that they were trying to achieve and
you have something to measure about the
effectiveness of this Graham okay so any
questions at this point
everybody good okay now we're going to
talk a little bit about the concept of
due diligence so you know this is not
unlike corporate due diligence or other
due diligence and you do in your life I
would recommend to all of you whether
you're looking at a proposal for the
Google corporate giving Council or your
own giving do a first cut analysis and
see if these the proposal can answer the
fundamental questions is this what I
want to do
I mean interestingly a lot of people get
tripped up because they get something
really interesting in the mailbox it's
not actually in an area that they
particularly want to fund they don't
know a whole lot about it but it sounds
kind of cool or maybe a friend of theirs
said you know this is a great
organization I'd love to have you
support it well if it's not
fundamentally in the arena that you want
to
you know serious question about whether
you should even go to plan B is this a
legitimate group does it have a 501 C 3
there's a lot of things that you can
look at but I mean is this a group that
at least passes the first sniff test is
this a group that understands something
about the the topic and the context a
lot of groups now wanted to get into the
area of climate change a lot of them
don't know a hell of a lot about the
area of climate change so how do you
think about you know the qualifications
of this group to understand the problem
do they have some kind of track record
in the field or if they don't have a
track record is there something in their
background or their BIOS that would lead
you to think yeah they might be a good
organization and then is the proposal
reasonable if you can't get through this
first cut I would say don't waste that
organization's time and don't waste your
own time don't do harm by spending a lot
of time asking a lot of details because
at the end of the day it is unlikely
that they would be the right fit for you
so here's a second cut and again this is
not unlike business
assuming they make it through that first
tier you know how is what they're
proposing that you fund compared to the
other folks who are in that same field
there is no dearth of nonprofit
organizations out there and a mistake I
see a lot of funders make particularly
newer funders as they get a proposal
from one group and they never really
asked the question who else is out there
and what else are they doing and is this
actually the right group and staff for
the job they also may know the group by
reputation or it may be well recommended
to them by a colleague or a friend but
they don't really know a lot about who
else might be doing important or
critical work and whether the idea that
is being presented in this proposal is
crucial complementary duplicative and
even potentially counterproductive and
then you ask the question what's the
work plan look like it's got the right
staff does this have all add up and make
sense and could it be improved looking
back at those questions that we had
under the goals how can I get something
with a little more granularity so I
actually understand more clearly what it
is that they're going to try to do okay
bottom line and
is a theme that just needs to resonate
throughout and this is very much in the
in the guidelines that the coop of the
Google corporate giving Council is that
we're going to have some impact there is
no shortage of organizations to fund so
how are you going to answer for yourself
or for Google is the work and have
measurable impact and how do I know and
what are they telling me when they
propose a request for funds why this
work matters is it innovative you know
the filete philanthropic capital is risk
capital is not intended to supplant what
the government doesn't do it's intended
to use your dollars to fund innovative
scalable important new approaches to
difficult problems so I would say the
innovative lens is a really an important
one is it scalable if this is a big
project like some of the Google
corporate giving Council have supported
you know is this something that's going
to have the potential of impacting not
you know hundreds of lives but thousands
of lives and how would that happen and
critically another thing I don't I think
people don't focus on enough is the risk
worth the reward I'm a big advocate for
taking a lot of risks in your
philanthropy philanthropic capital is
risk capital it is about you making the
smartest bets and the smartest
investments to try to have significant
change in the world so every proposal
carries risks you all asked and raised
some important questions on the diabetes
you know is this thing going to work is
it going to actually affect the
population is it going to change public
opinion every proposal has risks and
your question that I encourage you to
keep friend of mine is is the risk worth
the reward okay other things to think
about and again some of these are ideas
that I know you know from your own
business so let's talk about the
organization and the team critical in
the field of the nonprofit world maybe a
little bit less so in the area of
business is how well do these guys play
with others very few nonprofits are gold
standard if they don't understand how to
partner
others and the there is unfortunately a
plethora of nonprofit organizations that
are not good at partnering and this is
really something that's important for
you to suss out what's their credibility
in the field do they have a network are
these folks that other folks would say
yeah this is really a tremendous
organization what's their reputation
what's their internal capacity to
develop and sustain a project lots of
nonprofits are undercapitalized they're
great groups they do what they do really
well maybe they want to take on another
project and they'd love to have you fund
it but if they don't have the capacity
and the bandwidth to do that you know
you need to take a hard look at whether
that this is something that you want to
go forward how could it they are how
good are they at dealing with challenges
the Afghan project talk about challenges
if you look at the proposal you know
there's a whole page of risks including
the security in the country and whether
people can show up at work and not get
killed and you know similar kinds of
challenges how good is the team and how
good is this organization at actually
taking on and problem solving how are
they doing financially you know we all
know it's tough times in the nonprofit
sector it's tough times for every
nonprofit a stunning statistic that I
learned in my prior work is that most
even though the highly regarded
nonprofits have about five months of
operating capital on the bank so many of
them are teetering on what you know we
would consider to be very challenging
financial grounds but you want to fund a
group that you know is gonna be here a
year later at the end of your grant and
are they clearly committed to the
projects most great nonprofits are known
for what they do are clear about what
they do are clear about what they don't
do and when they come to you with a
proposal you know that they're in that
whether they get your money or somebody
else's other nonprofits sadly chase
dollars of foundations so foundation
puts up something on their website
saying we like this pretend Google you
know we like to support computer
technology centers in Ghana and there's
some great group in Ghana that you know
looks at this and says wow it's Google
and gee wouldn't we love so there
put together some proposal about how
they're gonna help put together
technology centers in Ghana except for
they don't never done that before and
it's not clear if they don't get
Google's money that they do it so you
know this is all kind of stuff that you
need to suss out about the nature of the
organization okay this is a really
really critical issue where's the money
gonna come from how long are you in the
game and will there be enough for them
to do what it is that they need to do
very frequently newer funders look at a
proposal without context to what other
money might be there to help make this
project alright and a lot of people want
to be able to be a first funder in and
own the project and and you know really
liked that idea but it is critical to
understand where the other funding is
going to come from and ideally you will
not be the own during only funder for a
project so going back to that Afghan
example we talked about one of the
reasons why that was such a home run for
the flora Family Foundation is it was a
one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars
total
they were only in for 30k and there were
other people who were picking up so
there was risk sharing in that but you
also knew that if for whatever reason
you know they needed to pull their money
or they wanted to move on to fund other
proposals that the work would go on so
look for whether there are other funding
partners ask really important questions
about what kind of support is needed
think long and hard about how long you
want to be in a game some new funders
say look I'm in it for one year
first year support will hope expected to
continue to fund and ask the question is
whether there's a funding gap in the
aggregate how are you learning
personally enough money didn't make this
things like okay the last God is really
either what do we know from history and
and is relatively they were entrance in
the field very rarely do people ask the
question who else has done this before
and has this idea flopped and if so why
and maybe you know we ought to do a
little bit of due diligence about what
sounds like a cool and really an
interesting idea to you may in fact have
a track record in other organizations or
even in this organization so how do you
do that well you talk to other folks
who've been in the field to get online
and do your research you try to find
other experts who know something about
the strategy going back to the scenario
about microfinance it has been known for
a very long time that not all
microfinance programs are great ideas
but a lot of newer funders coming into
the field you know we're not aware of
that research and so it's really
important to think about how am I going
to piggyback on the work of others and
learn how to identify whether this idea
or ensure grantee has done something
before and had some failures what do
they learn from that you know proposal
that talks about that is really an
incredible and important lesson and
that's why we are evaluating their
impact every grant eight organization
has something in a proposal about how
they're gonna assess for themselves not
just for you how they know whether
they're making a difference of course
they're gonna want to tell you at the
end of the year or whatever period of
time it is yeah we were able to meet
these milestones and yeah we think we
made an impact but the great
organizations are those that are going
to ask themselves the question how do I
know what I'm doing yeah
yeah
okay okay are we good on this any
questions here okay
context matters if your google.org or
even the Google corporate giving Council
and you're giving away grants in the
$500,000 a year or up to $500,000 a year
level the level of due diligence you're
gonna do on that project and that
proposal is obviously going to be
substantially more than if you're an
individual donor who at the end of the
year says you know I really like this
group and I'm just gonna get in and make
an initial grant to them and maybe it's
gonna be a thousand dollars and it's
gonna be kind of my way of getting in
the swimming pool and testing whether
this seems like a good relationship you
know it's seemingly obvious but
sometimes people lose sight of the fact
that you've got to be proportional with
the amount of due diligence you do to
the amount of money that you're going to
give away one of the things I hear a lot
of great nonprofit leaders complain
about his newer funders want to do this
comprehensive due diligence I've been
talking about at the end of the day
they're willing to give them you know
$500 $1,000 the opportunity costs the
cost that that nonprofit went through to
get your money is completely
disproportionate to the value of what
you got so in the do no evil do no harm
school you know it's just a critical
thing to keep in front of mine you are
here as a partner these organizations
your due diligence should be appropriate
you know I'd love to have you all look
at the difference between the Energy
Foundation which is one of the leading
foundations working on climate change
gives away millions and millions of
dollars a year and a very strategic very
disciplined approach to how you reduce
co2 emissions per individual
philanthropic dollar invested brilliant
strategy but loads and loads of money
and they put people through significant
hoops as they should because they're
making big bets with organizations where
they need to know that these
organizations have really analyzed the
problem deeply Flora Family Foundation
that funded the Afghan project we were
talking about
it's a Family Foundation that funds more
local grassroots groups sums at $30,000
a year $20,000 a year $10,000 a year
they go about this in a really different
way
so last rule of thumb if you take
nothing else away from this presentation
today
remember these ideas is the idea
credible is the group and the team
capable is the idea feasible is it
important ok cool red flags we've talked
about some of these already I think the
most critical red flag is that it's not
clear from the proposal what these guys
are gonna do with your money seems
obvious but you would be shocked at the
number of people who fund proposals
based on a very blurry very generic
statement of the scope of work the the
Afghan women proposal is a great example
of an exceedingly detailed proposal of
the scope of work down to literally how
many training sessions and where they're
gonna be
not all of them have to be that good and
frankly that one was that good because
it was written by a group of very
sophisticated funders in New York who
are working with these women in
Afghanistan a lot of proposals you're
gonna get from newer groups smaller
groups grassroots groups international
groups are gonna be fairly generic
perhaps in how they're gonna go about
the execution but if you're gonna give
away a lot of money or you dealing with
a group that's pretty sophisticated you
know it's it's you're it's not only
something that you should demand
I'd say it's ethically critical for you
to ask them to be clear because you're
making a decision to fund them and not
another group and the opportunity cost
to give money to them and not another
group really should be based on a really
careful analysis second one missing or
incomplete financial should be pretty
obvious why that's a red flag you know
some groups are wonderful and they are
in deep economic doo-doo and you know as
much as you'd like to bail them out of
that particular conundrum typically
speaking it's not a great idea to fund a
group that is in serious financial
straits as much as the idea is good
because it is highly unlikely there
to be around in a year and sometimes you
know that can be I suppose described as
a survival of the fittest strategy you
know but I have firmly of the view that
you've got to fund strong organizations
not necessarily those with the biggest
bank accounts but strong organizations
that are at least financially sound so
that they're gonna be here to do the
work third one staff BIOS don't show
that they have the skills to execute
this is where a lot of folks get tripped
up a lot of people are wonderful in
their field they're just not
particularly skilled at doing the
project that they're proposing and I
think it's important to segregate you
know does this person have a luminous CV
from does the team actually have the
capacity to do what they're asking you
to do knowledge of best practice is not
a parent you know do they actually have
they been around the block
do they know whatever other people have
done do they have enough scar tissue to
understand what it is that they're
trying to take on particularly if it's a
very ambitious proposal and the last
thing is really about boards this
doesn't have to be a deal killer but you
know I tend to like to fund nonprofits
that have pretty solid boards and where
the boards on top of things and they
know what's going on and they're in the
game so these are things that I'd
encourage you to keep a look at them
okay any questions we have ten minutes
to practice okay cool questions sir yes
right great great
right right right right so the question
is what we call in the philanthropic
trade a request for general operating
support and the question was it's easy
for us to get money to you know have
somebody give us medical equipment or
things that people feel are gonna
actually go out and be used in the field
but when we come when they ask them for
a request for how do you pay somebody so
you keep the lights on or pay for the
rent people yawn and say boring and they
don't want to do that that is not your
problem it is your problem of course
it's a problem for donors so I'm really
glad you brought that up because you
know we've been talking about proposals
and ideas that tend to be more
project-based work but a lot of times
one organization desperately needs is
operating capital I mean imagine if you
know the initial investors in Google
said you know we would really only like
to fund Pablo and Amin and for other
people we don't care for the building we
don't have to pay all these other
salaries we would just like fun a few
little thingies not coherent right but
in the nonprofit sector we do that all
the time so I've been talking a lot
about proposals for particular work but
a lot of our job in educating you and
other donors about philanthropy is when
you've got a great organization that
does great work and what they really
need is the money to keep the lights on
that is as legitimate or illegitimate
then starting some new proposal which
might sound really sexy and cool but it
doesn't actually allow the organization
to do what it does so a lot of what's
been going on in the world of
philanthropy over the last couple of
years is trying to educate individual
donors and organizations that money for
general operations is actually good
money and important money and you know I
could be happy afterwards the touchy
okay could the VC folks checking it
please mute again we're having some
really cool sounds little distracting
okay any other questions yes right right
so the question is how do you look at
the trade-off between staying with an
organization over a period of time or
maybe going out and finding other newer
organizations or maybe even trying to
raise money to fund other things is that
do I have that right you know this is
again one of the serious conundrums and
there are different schools of thought
and different strategies the flora
Family Foundation is a foundation that
believes in general ongoing long-term
operating support for organizations over
at least a three-year period on the
theory that if you're gonna come in and
give somebody a little bit of money and
then you're gonna be gone the next year
you know that that can be quite
dislocating and what's really tough for
most nonprofits who are operating on the
edge is the money comes in then it goes
and they never know from year to year
who's with them you know I am a strong
proponent of multi-year support when you
find organizations that are great and
you've done enough homework and maybe
you've been with them for you know maybe
a test period and you believe in their
work why not continue to support them in
a serious way and advocate for them as
opposed to saying well you know that was
really fun but I'm a little bored and so
now I'd love to go off and you know find
some other really cool idea it goes back
to what I flagged in the beginning but
we haven't had a chance to talk about
today but I think is really critical
when you go back to the fundamental
question what are my goals what are my
strategy and how do I develop a giving
plan that makes sense the thing I've
been number one complaint about from a
number of nonprofits about newer donors
is people come in give a lot of money to
something you know big to do
the organization bills up all this
expectation and they're gone and they
didn't tell them what was going on or
people ping-pong because it's kind of
fun and cool and a lot of people coming
to you asking you for money so it's just
sort of fun to dabble dabble in does not
yield impact you're gonna go back to the
beginning you know if you were serious
about this work and you want to make a
significant impact the most important
way to do that is to find those
extraordinary grantees who have really
important innovative ideas and stick
with them and be willing to you know
stay the course through the tough times
it doesn't mean you have to fund them
forever but it does mean that you think
long and hard about the direction you're
in and then you're there for a while to
make a significant difference okay um
yeah that would be great okay so we have
two we have one is one that Jay shared
for me which is of an organization
called camp fed Camfed is a really well
regarded international NGO that's been
around since 1993 that supports
educating women and girls I'll just talk
to you about it well Pablo finds it they
proposed to the Google corporate giving
Council that the council fund them to
set up a bunch of ICTs 3ic tees in a
rural part of Ghana the proposal was
based on the fact that they had had
success doing something similar to this
in Zambia and they had been through the
process and they knew what they were
doing and they came to Google and said
you know you're aligned with the
interest in supporting computer
technology in this case it's an effort
to try to teach girls how to become more
computer literate with the goal that
they would you know be able to get jobs
and so this is a five page proposal that
you can look at after today in some
detail that the corporate giving Council
said yeah this is first of all within
our strike zone this is the kind of
stuff that Google would be good at it's
a great group
and it's an idea that they've already
proven and it's an idea that we can
scale and ultimately it's gonna have
leverage because we're gonna fund these
three centers but we're gonna train
girls and over time we're going to have
the opportunity of having these girls
have a much better sense of how to get
jobs in the tech sector so Google
greenlight of this proposal and it was a
great idea my question to you all is oh
so the salient fact is it was a request
to set up the centers and then run them
for two years so that three years excuse
me
so just quick reactions why do you think
the corporate giving Council signed on
to this idea yes in the back right he
said the comment was it had the
snowballing effect of training people
who had the capacity to have broader
impact great great point I don't know
that that's what you thought about but
it seems like it seems like that was in
your in your in your sweet spot what out
what else why is it a good fit for
Google
yes exactly increasing more women in the
technology center that's a corporate
value excellent what else anybody else
Pablo right so we know technology we
could come in and help and in fact the
proposal contemplated that Google folks
would actually come and work on-site
there so you know big win what were the
risks of this be
bingo is it clear that the proposal that
was so successful in Zambia is going to
translate to Ghana are they gonna have
the right team are there something in
the country conditions that may not
apply and how would you know anything
else any other thoughts and I think this
is a fabulous proposal easy yeah
goal
fantastic critical point you know a lot
of what happens in philanthropy is
people come in great idea a lot of
excitement even you know do the right
saying multi-year funding three years
down the road where's the money so the
challenge for this project and proposal
and they explicitly acknowledge this so
you know I think Google made the right
choice but the they explicitly
acknowledge this how do you work with
this grantee since you've made the
commitment over the next three years to
ensure that at the end of the day you've
left something behind and if you want
this project to continue there's
somebody else in the game with you this
is something that most funders don't
think about and I've seen it over and
over an over all around the developing
world organization comes in they're the
only funder funded for three years into
the day they're looking around trying to
find somebody else to keep it going
nobody wants to play so that's a great
example sir Jay you want to speak to
that Jay Jay's know something about that
the question was do you know what was
happening in the first country
yeah great point okay I do we have a few
more minutes and I'm wondering if we can
do what any other questions on this one
it's a great idea I think we've
identified some of the risks I think one
of the and I commend this to you to read
as a sample of a really good proposal
that went to Google as something that
was clear it was obvious that the
organization knew what they were doing
they had a track record they had a
vision the grant was leveraged important
innovative work in a part of the world
that desperately needs this kind of
thing and the multiplier effect of
influencing and educating you know
literally thousands of these kinds of
girls and bringing economic opportunity
really high so Bravo was a great idea
okay this proposal camp fed is a great
organization they're supported by the
Skoll foundation very well-regarded
top-tier you know an organization that's
got plenty of help and support when they
need to write a grant request you know
90% of international organizations do
not fall into this category which is why
I talked in the beginning about the
difference between a really good idea
and a proposal that might not you know
in our Western ways completely pass
standard and I want to talk at the end
and maybe you can help me pull up the
little Ugandan case study
with a real story of two schools that we
went to go see it I really just type
that baby talk to you that it I took a
group of donors in the fourth or fifth
year of the program that I ran to
Kampala Uganda and we were studying
issues around education and we went to
go see two different groups in the
broader come home area the effects are
not complicated
and it's not I'm not actually showing
you the real proposals although I have
them here and I think they would be
instructive for those of you who are
interested in supporting international
organizations because they are a far cry
honestly from the kind of caliber the
proposals we've talked about today but
there the reality for most grassroots
groups so we went to go see two
different organizations one to schools
working with kids in the in the broader
of Kampala region which is the capital
of Uganda what school was called
Mothercare 15-20 years ago a little bit
in the outskirts of the city lots and
lots of kids who were AIDS orphans very
very poor ok this is a this is the case
study and you can take a look at this
after today but fundamentally they
started with three kids in nursery
school and they down groans didn't have
a 350 kids
nobody could pay school fees this place
was desperately
I mean you drive out there's a couple of
old ramshackle buildings most of the
kids can't afford to pay tuition
that's cool nonetheless the teachers
were great and the school had a great
reputation in the broader Kampala
community as a place that educator so
they came to us when they gave us a free
group peace proposal I'd be happy to
share it with you because I think it's a
real eye-opener saying to our group that
was visiting here's all the stuff we
need and you can see for the classrooms
a nursery school a library at school all
centers for me basically they gave us a
laundry list of organizations called the
railway to children's school it was
started in the 40s at the school for the
children of the Ugandan railway workers
corporation basically the same kind of
student body but urban
okay so second school railways
children's school same fundamental
problems you know the needs are
extraordinary and but this school also
had a reputation for great teaching and
they came to us and said we love some
money for a variety of things the
morning reading sessions some workshops
for writing we want to be able to teach
some of these kids how to you know
basically create baskets so that because
they're never gonna go on to secondary
school so we want to actually teach them
some trades so they can you know make a
living and we'd like to have you paid
the tarmac and they presented a budget
so you have these two schools with
roughly the same kind of population and
we as a group you know needed to
evaluate do we want to support them and
how would we figure this out not wanting
to be burdensome to them not wanting
them to jump through lots of Hoops
knowing that these are places that are
living pretty much on the edge so my
questions if we could scroll my
questions are basically would you find
either one what would you need to know
how would you figure that out and and
what would go through your minds as you
think about this real life scenario so
anybody have any thoughts right so the
question is looked at the school
leadership figure out can you trust
these guys would they use their money
well maybe not embezzle it do I trust
the team to I trust the leadership right
what other questions would you ask
yes right so you asked the question is
there a budget one group gave us a
budget the other group did not give us a
budget what would that tell you yeah
right right but would it be a red flag
that they didn't give you a budget Yeah
right okay so the comment was it looks
like poor planning or not sufficient
planning not to at least include a
budget okay anything else
leadership budget anything else about
sort of what they asked for what they
wanted yes
fantastic so the question was you know
how much is of what they're asking for
is really gonna make a difference and
you know is this a kind of place where
they should have a computer center with
20 computers is that even appropriate to
this organization so you know is what
they're asking for the the right thing
for you to be funding or the best thing
for you to be funding and should you
make that decision or should they make
that decision yes yeah actually it was
just there was a muddy field where the
kids had to walk across to go to school
so they just wanted to be able to pave
it over so the kids weren't like walking
around in mud okay but the fundamental
question both of you raised is what were
they going to use the money for and this
is again one of these delicate things
because sometimes organizations come and
they say we really want the money for
this and sometimes that may or may not
make sense the first organization that
asks for the laundry list of everything
humanly possible to me that was a red
flag they were fishing and you know you
cannot fault them a bunch of wealthy
Americans show up potentially with money
in their pockets and there'd wanting to
see what you might be interested in but
the other organization asked for
something that was really critical which
was money to pay for their teachers
because their teachers didn't have
enough salary it was money to train
their teachers and it was money to focus
on the things that they were really
known for which was their writing
program and efforts to go out to to
parents and teach the parents in these
poor tough communities why it was
important for their kids to learn to
read yes
right so the question was how do you
deal with a question of accountability
and how probably in a respectful way do
you ask enough questions to know whether
the money is gonna really be well used
and it should should it be your decision
or should it be their a decision so who
can guess where we gave the medal I'm
gonna wrap up now who can guess where we
gave the money which one number two
railways okay absolutely the fact that
there was a proposal we always had a
stronger a teacher they were asking for
information that was core to what it was
that they were doing there's a
tremendous PostScript to this story
this school has ended up being probably
one of the finest schools in the entire
country of Uganda the woman who runs it
got some books was able to pave over
that muddy field was able to pay her
teachers more and was able to give
scholarships to some of the poorest kids
this is now one of the most
high-performing schools in the district
it is sending kids on to some of the
most elite secondary schools in the
country it is a huge huge credit it was
not a big fancy glitzy proposal most
importantly though the head teacher was
able to instill a program of reading in
the morning that was then adopted by the
Ugandan Ministry of Education so that
has now become public policy for the
entire country so I leave you with that
story because you don't always know and
what you're doing at the end of the day
is making educated bets on who you think
is the best team with the work that you
know can have a meaningful impact over
time
so incredible success story I encourage
all of you to go to Kampala Uganda and
go see this school it's rockstar thank
you very much for your time I appreciate
having had the opportunity to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
