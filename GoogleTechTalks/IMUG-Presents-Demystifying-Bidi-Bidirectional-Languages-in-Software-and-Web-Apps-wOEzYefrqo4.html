februari 2011 we're very glad to be in
this new location at Google and hope you
enjoy the facilities as most of you know
but I'll just go through this for the
closet they don't know I'm ugh is the
original multilingual user computing
user group was founded in nineteen
eighty seven as part of the Stanford
Macintosh users group and spun off as an
independent mug in 1991 since then we've
met almost every month on corporate
campuses around Silicon Valley including
Apple adobe and Google we've grown to
cover all platforms and all topics of
interest to globalization professionals
and multilingual users of all types of
computers smartphones and more and now
just say I'm ugh and maybe the M stands
for multilingual I'd like to thank our
volunteers the imac volunteers Joe cats
who's our market here and general social
networking person who's gotten all of
our social networking going and was able
to bring you all here tonight and ream
our new host ramya's iggy is our new
host at Google she's been very helpful
in setting this all up and we've very
much appreciate her support and parisa
Glazer is our registration person for
tonight thanks thanks go to her as well
like to point out that just so
press enter hmm may be here any of you
people if any of you people are into
twittering here's our hashtag I'm ugh
408 that's the area code for San Jose
basically and please participate if you
if you're into Twitter take a look at
some of the jobs that are available for
internationalization professionals we
have five different jobs at four
different locations and if you want to
take a look at them just check them out
a time ago org slash jobs and we have
some upcoming events for I mark next
month when up we won't be meeting at
Apple or Google will be meeting at world
where the the conference that's
basically for corporate management types
who want to learn more about how to get
localized products out the door and and
the whys and wherefores about that and
then the next month we'll be back here
at Google for a presentation about
mobile app localization as a service
hell laaa s a Google alumnus Brendan
Clavin will be talking about his his new
company Tetris and how he he proposes to
serve the community with localization is
a service on the web and if any of you
have any suggestions for future topics
let us know we're always interested in
suggested speakers or topics send your
send your ideas to me
Roger Sherman it is hard to come one
interesting thing about that next
month's meeting it's going to be
sponsored by 22 companies in the
localization area and lingo pork and
accra links and so basically it's too
short talks and a lot of networking and
food so I hope you will enjoy that
meeting it's going to take place at Tech
Martin in santa clara and as you
probably know we have all of these
social networking sites available to you
courtesy of joe and i hope you take
advantage of them them all tonight
speaker Rouge Bay por nada is a an
expert in localization
internationalization and he's he's from
a company a country that has a
bi-directional language so I'm sure he's
had a lot of experience with the issues
involved in localization of
bi-directional languages um I'll tell
you we've been wanting to get a speaker
to handle this topic for quite some time
several months ago I I contacted him and
found out that he's quite busy so I'm
very glad that he's been able to come to
I'm oak tonight and share his knowledge
about how to create software or websites
that support bidirectional languages so
thank you very much
so yeah hi everybody and first of all
thank you roger and thank you for coping
with all the kind of troubles i created
for you along the way i was pretty hard
to reach for quite a few times quite a
few times so and also thanks a lot for
all the organizers and i may disappoint
you a bit i means of those who have been
in my talks in the unicode conference or
enroll her I've reused most of this
stuff so it's that was the suggestion so
hosts that this is basically the
audience may want to hear those things
and Damien not in there so that's gonna
what's going to happen and some of you
guys are I think pretty very very good
by the experts I see all under and I
mean that I really do not have much to
add but what I'm going to try to cover
here is basically cover the grants and
see really was there so I'm Rousseff
another i lived in Iran until around
three years ago I started my own company
there we did localization for persian
mostly an international team version and
it seemed that I mean then we kind of
really got involved with Unicode and
everything and I've been a contributor
to unicode icing since more than 10
years now yeah more than 10 years now
and some people in this room again like
juicing I've worked on lined with for
again more than 10 years when Mozilla
was sorted or various other open source
projects were start or text factor so
what I do is mostly a high-tech password
via software localization and
internationalisation company and my role
there is a really weird role I call
myself the master of useless information
and that's what they once told me a
client was asking us a question about
differences in Easter in different
european countries and they kind of snap
the answer i mean yeah of course we have
the eastern wester and the west
sorry the Western is around the eastern
Easter and the Armenians and the cops
haven't differently and he kind of
answered wow you guys know is so much
useless information and I mean it was
useful to him but still this is still
useless information if well so these are
the general kind of markets and added
close is increasing I mean what you're
hearing what you're seeing in the list
of languages to do people are not only
into Arabic and Hebrew anymore they're
doing or do Persian maybe for Iran maybe
for Afghanistan patch over Afghanistan
Kurdish for Iraq which is now a official
language of their wigger for China which
is again official regional language
dhivehi for the Maldives and all the
weekend was very interesting some people
some of our clients for example didn't
even know that or do was right to left
they were saying okay we want language
of India and okay we've covered these
and then or do is also one or two
official languages beyond or do too and
they even didn't have pie that even
before Arabic they want to do North
Africa Middle East South Asia Southeast
Asia can able to give an example of by
the language in Southeast Asia joey is a
famous example I mean one of the
languages of Indonesia Malaysia so
although there's not much market for it
yeah so and that's the list I'm putting
down there these are some of the
interesting countries and the name of
the tallest comes up with emerging
markets different organization defined
differently but Saudi Israel India Egypt
Morocco quite Jordan UAE Pakistan
malaysia and china are considered some
of those and with what's happening that
in the Middle East and North Africa
these days it seems that more of those
countries would be open up its we're
meeting at we should take this moments
to also say that they're meeting in a
room called benghazi and velocity is a
city in libya and very probably more
than 10 protesters were killed during
the protester and my home country of
Iran also
kind of their process again him on
monday and then again there were deaths
as they were arrests and it's not very
happy times for me personally ok this is
what i came up to try to explain to some
people who are not exactly sure that we
really need to do by die kind of
convincing that they should just
consider using this as an english
interface let's just assume that you are
asked to use this kind of a UI i'm not
talking about it being in or something
but this general kind of a UI with these
kind of directions and text appearing
like this on a daily basis when you're
just doing english that's the protests
exactly how would it feel for a by the
user for an Arabic or Persian or Hebrew
user to use your left to right you I and
believe me some of our clients again
have insisted that yes we want to do
Arabic but we want it left to right we
don't have the money for right doing by
die so just explaining a few things as
you can see I mean it's pretty hard to
seed things that come first on the right
file usually comes first in a UI and you
really want that on the left side
because that's where you assume things
start because you right left to right or
this is very interesting this five ways
to lead the healthier life that's an
actual example from a very large
software company who has a localized to
Arabic mail service and this is an email
that came from their own marketing this
is the subject of that email five ways
to lead a healthier life and if you
display that email in the Arabic it
wasn't in English that the subject line
and if you display if you switch the UI
to Arabic that's how the site no
the second line is also very interesting
it says I like BBC very much what about
you BBC is what some Arab locales
localized Pepsi the famous drink too and
some others also just keep it in English
so what you would actually see in an
Arabic world is that aisle I could
actually be in Arabic BBC would actually
be in your Latin the script in English
let's say and then the rest would also
be in Arabic but that's also the kind of
feeling they would get when they put
something that's English inside a Arabic
script text that's as easily as you can
read this they would have problems with
that and then there's two plus two
equals four not for recalls to pursue
again you will have you see similar
things there that are just really
problematic honestly I can't really
explain more than this why software
should we be directional eyes when a
client doesn't get it after something
like this I I really can't you to go
much forward we just repeat ourselves
usually so I'm kind of trying to divide
this talking to certain parts and one is
a strategy the first one so famous
clothes I think some of you heard it so
many times that internationalization is
not a feature is the way you design your
software is the way you kind of do
things in a certain way in order for it
to be localizable or be sold to various
markets so what we're calling by the
ocean elysian is just a subset oh I need
to explain that word too so I came up
with that word with my friend and
colleague Michael Everson so not rather
new but just just following the pattern
of localization and internationalization
just like i 18 n is an ongoing process
so what you usually do there the
software companies here mostly do if
they're don't really have enough budget
they left they
we want Arabic or Hebrew or both and
they rush it they get some experts in
they do it and then they assume is gonna
stay there and it doesn't what happens
is that people are just going to add
features and every single feature you
add you really want to make sure it
works fine before by thy people usually
tend to ignore that so they assign a
certain kind of budget for adding by die
and then they don't kind of continue
doing that anymore they assume that it's
going to be there but is not this the
really sad story is that we treated as
feature some some companies they still
treat internationalisation as a feature
too they pay the price but what they do
so again usually there are different
approaches I'm mostly going to talk
about minimizing costs and some people
really want to just really get to the
market as soon as possible and it really
would depend on the strategy on what the
product is and how you want to do that
the exact this as you would would be
very project specific it's hard but it's
it's done and lots of people do that I
think even I mean I've seen quite a few
companies who are now in a rush to
really market there and they're really
trying a lot of money there I'm not
going to talk about really doing a
rushed job it's complex and it needs a
lot of expertise and not everybody can
afford it both can be done at the same
time I've done that a lot but you really
need your experts who have really done
this in if it's yours a large project
have done is for large projects have
done this several times have done it for
various companies they really know what
they're doing so if you really for
example want to achieve both at the same
time do it very fast and rather cheap
talk to me okay again things I'm not
gonna exactly talk about but I'm gonna
touch basically what i'm calling be 18
and four platforms you have a UI toolkit
you have a I dental browser a word
processor or something pretty basic and
you want to do by there for that that's
very hard work and that's gonna usually
take yours
if you want to do it very good so as I
just said I mean grab your experts every
standard that's out there idiot compared
with everything that's out there all the
competing products find exactly what
your platform may do there's still some
platform under you and then again talk
to more experts I mean everybody is
still kind of struggling to get by there
right on several platforms I mean
Microsoft has although they had a very
good lead sort they still kind of
messing a lot of stuff up Apple
interestingly it started very good but
then for some reason when it is necklace
10 they kind of throw everything out in
the garbage can and they drew started
from scratch and there are so far from
being anything good Google and Yahoo are
struggling to have good platforms with
that 0 to 10 didn't see that one okay so
what is doing it for localization when
you have a web app when you have a piece
of desktop software when you have a
let's say an iphone application and you
want to market it and your platform
already does something it's usually a
hard if your platform doesn't because
then you really need to do lots of hacks
that usually do in a platform inside the
application that happens for example for
android i mean when you want to do an
android app in Arabic you really go
through a lot of trouble because it
doesn't exactly support right-to-left
you're either you need a layer in the
middle a library in the middle that we
do that for you or you actually need to
implement lots of stuff yourselves and
it's usually urgent from the projects
I've seen they just say we want to do
Arabic and Hebrew and Hindi and malai
for the next phase and they just have
not even I mean this is a typical client
of ours for example they wouldn't think
that oh I need to do major changes in
the library in the in the platform in
the software in the libraries to be able
to do that for Arabic for
example they just think that it's just
localizable like everything else like
most everything for hindi will also need
to do lots of stuff but wider is pretty
hard so this is what I'm calling simple
bi-directional ization this is like this
very simple recipe and that's worked
interestingly although it looks kind of
too simple first of all if you don't
have unicode don't even think about why
that you can do it people have done it
in the past I mean it's a lot of
headache when you do you Nicole later
it's going to be another huge problem so
don't even think about doing by the eye
unless you have you any third as a
default even any other characters that
you want to support support it as a
filter something that you can import or
export to even then think if you really
want to do that it's a lot of headache
these days and unicode it's almost
everywhere get your requirements and
that's i think is the really the hardest
part of the job create mockups just
every user screen you have just get it
to about your rider experts they would
tell you how to change everything how to
do it differently for the arabic or
hebrew market and then basically
implement this it's not very hard we're
making your mark ups calls there is some
this thing i call the big switch usually
for every platform there is something
like this if your platform doesn't have
this but you're not very lucky you need
to do again do some bi-directional same
platforms which is hard lots of web apps
would not really have need to do much at
the beginning you there is this thing
called dir in HTML that he just set it
to right to left and then you basically
break your web app lots of things look
really weird and lots of things will
still look left to right I mean RS
laughing okay and there's this nice to
let googled it and open source of all
ago is the Python script mostly and call
CSS Janice Janice was that Greek god I
think or goddess i don't know that
looked both sides add two heads that
look both sides so that
I don't know if the people who work on
it or still work light are in this room
it's very useful I highly recommend
using it for your web application you
basically pass all your CSS through it
and it comes up with right-to-left CSSS
it needs a lot of editing post post
editing after that you may even need to
change the tool but it's a pretty pretty
nice and clean tool and I've how can I
say that I've customized for a client
added lots of features and it's not that
hard or if it's that set process default
layout is the windows api key for doing
that you can you can call that function
and set it to right to left and then
things would switch some of them you
won't like something you would like and
then you can go visit by widget and
change them or for genome and pango
that's the duty k we just set default
direction that's the function you can
get the screenshots and get them to your
experts and they'll they usually know
you just look at them oh this disk cause
that way that goes that way there are
explanation for those I mean so for
example there are things that still
remain are left to right numbers is a
famous example some of them don't you're
by the experts would know so a good
example is as I think I mentioned it
before is that the notion of time when
you play something let's say on a media
player a video the thing goes from left
to right and it kind of fills up and
that's usually the region that happens
is the notion of western time because
that's also how do how they write in the
Western world you love right from left
to right and time passes so time kind of
passes from left to right and also
things of more importance appear first
and first is again the way you write on
the left those things usually change
when you go to the Arab or the Hebrew
world or the larger right to left
writing countries and but as lots of you
know it's not 100 percent fix certain
things still remain left to right and
something are controversial so for
example the place symbol it's not very
exactly agreed upon that if you should
mirror the place symbol or not some
people
want to mirror what's on the video VCRs
for example the VCRs when they imported
them to the Middle East they did not
switch the keys I mean it wasn't worth
the trouble to just like make the things
right to left so if you're creating a
notion of something equivalent to the
outside world and the play button that's
on the VCR it looks left to right so or
it may even consider conflicting and you
may want to switch so not everything is
very clear going back to your mock-ups
what you're going to do with your
mock-ups is that after the big switch
you basically want to find lots of
workarounds oh this is in that case the
unicode by the algorithm works in this
certain way so i need to change that in
that way oh I need a library usually
cannot really know those things unless
you start that you're right to love
markers at least having played with the
big switch just switch it and see what
happens and that's really your starting
point and there's a lot of really really
small things that the main problem that
some people get into is that they really
have no idea of how long that laundry
list is so they sort the big switch they
get their mock ups or whatever is there
and they start doing it doing them one
by one and it's the neverending thing so
again this is a place that you really
need to have your experts so but the
hardest thing in all of this is getting
your requirements this is what I've
heard this is what I've seen out there
and by saying global competition or
local competition I meet really mean
companies like let's say global
competition people like Microsoft with a
light Google people like yahoo by local
competition there are lots of small
companies according to us standards
which are pretty large in their kind of
local field I mean one of the I mean ina
was one example Mac tube wasn't an
example that Yahoo was bought by I mean
from the art world and there are other
alternatives in the Hebrew world some
very interesting company
in South Asia some interesting companies
in Iran that are doing these things and
this is a very common approach just so
some people think I don't know if Google
is doing that they're probably good
enough and I've seen it not working at
all because you google has other
priorities for example when they do
their right to life support and when you
want to just match that you usually get
a bit less because then you find that
your budget wasn't enough and so you
won't even be able to compete you the
laughing material usually and yeah the
autobot for example one of the local
competition mac to buy think yahoo
bought that so they kind of thought that
we can do it ourselves or we're not
exactly sure how to do it let's just buy
these people who know how to do it and
let them do for us if funny things
happen then i mean for example usually
what happens with local companies is
that people who buy don't find that they
aren't really understand the market very
good but the local companies don't
really understand internationalization
they know how to localize for their own
market they know how to write software
for their own market but they don't
really know how to work with all
language at the same time have just one
software that does everything at the
same time so what I really like is like
the at the bottom of that list doing
research finding what your users
actually like because sometimes you're
by the experts cannot be trusted either
your binder experts are the people who
kind of like to push the envelope really
want to say that oh that idea nobody
ever implemented it let's actually push
this client to implement that and that's
usually a bit expensive to say the least
but in all of this again one of
something I've always seen is that
companies look at why I and think oh I
don't want to do this this is just like
too much work
it's an opportunity I believe I mean if
you do it right you will have customers
that will never forget you again ready
for the dance disaster I've seen a lot
of these things you get in the
requirement list you get lots of
features and then usually people who are
assigning budgets they kind of not even
in the beginning of the projects say
could you please not do this could you
please not do that and what usually
happens or or the other side I mean this
these are people sometimes you buy the
experts sometimes your developer who
really really likes some feature he
finds that feature very how they say
that interesting to implement and test
and see how users react to it it may be
really a power user feature and I still
have those things and those are really
recipe for disaster I mean if you try to
design your feature list of x divided by
committee or by kind of push and pull
what usually happens at the end is that
some features get done some others don't
and you see a very unbalanced thing I
mean you see some it would look like I
mean your your software was designed by
your developers and that's not very good
idea for the bio market although it may
not look like that to you as a Western
user but to have bacon by the set would
look like that and then there is this
thing I'm calling by their awareness and
that should be part of your facialist
people think is just mirroring the
interface and then not mirroring some
parts and getting to that laundry list
and just fix all the small things the
real but what really happens in the
world is that by the users they don't
only do right to left content they've
worked with also left to right content I
mean they would get in English email
everything would be in English you
remember that email the subject line
with five ways to do something that was
an English email sent to by the user and
the provider user had no way of
displaying that the other way is also
true I commonly use left to right user
interfaces but I really want to be able
to work
content and this is again comes from
personal experience let's actually
mention Google products not if we
realize it gmail has some rather okay by
their support you can write read &amp;amp; write
by the emails do you know how to do that
not many people I've seen so many
friends both in Iran and expatriates who
live in the West who have no idea how to
enable the boiler support under gmail
the reason that happens is that it's in
a really obscure place in their settings
that they actually need to go there
display something put a checkmark next
to something and then they will be able
to type right-to-left properly in an
email for example and they they if they
get there and find that check mark they
would consider themselves second-class
citizens if they don't they would think
ah this is just broken so it's funny
that Google for example paid all that
price but the users do not find that
yeah the and the reason I understand why
the reason for that was there are by the
controls for example there are marks as
they set this paragraph right to left or
set that paragraph left to right and
it's going to be very confusing for some
may be ignorant Western user who doesn't
even know that there are some dry to
love languages he might try to use those
for doing I don't know right alignment
and then things would really go crazy so
those things can happen and the balance
is not a very easy thing to achieve
these are the most famous kind of more
important market languages sorry for
just jumping around the whole idea is
that there's this these things that we
need to cover for by die and they just
not very connected to each other so
under on the left side there's the list
of languages and their most important
market of course I mean every language
is spoken in every country in the world
and Persian for example
you would need to support person for
Afghanistan maybe but for every one of
them there's the main major market I
mean or do it's also important for India
i just mentioned or Kurdish is important
in Iran in the Arabic script for example
everything has a country and that's what
usually people in localization and
internationalisation like people in
marketing also really like that but
Arabic is really weird in that list so
it's like I do not who those in country
is something like that including Israel
not many people know that it's an
official language of Israel too there's
this thing called modern Standard Arabic
that there is some generally agreed-upon
definition of that it's some kind of
Arabic that's more like classical Arabic
it's based somehow on the grammar of the
Quran and most news media and most
international Arabic stuff is written in
that and that's also what most people
learn in school in the arabic-speaking
countries there are some differences of
course and months names are different I
mean the jury is still out but I think
there are at least four or five
different set of months names used in
the arabic-speaking world look at the
Wikipedia article and that if you really
wanted to see the differences I I don't
have sources for some of those but I
think at least there are five sets of
different Muslims for arabic oh of
course the Arabic Wikipedia and there
are preferred digit shapes that are
different in North Africa in the middle
is I'm going to talk about that a bit
later and their transcription systems
there are some letters that you're going
to see in some Arabic letters that
you're going to see in Saudi or Emma
rates that you're not going to see in
Tunisia or in Algeria and vice versa so
for example it's commonly known that the
Arabs do not have a sound for the sign
like in victory and when they try to
write that sound they use a letter they
use a fair for example the three dots
above it in the Middle East but if you
move to North Africa it's the same
letter but the three dots will be under
it or with a give it some song for
example Samsung put the Eurasian
differently in Tunisia and in Emirates
so back to numbers okay the phones are
okay so there are three sets of by their
related numbers in you in the unicode
standard of course there are lots of
other digits s in Unicode but these are
three you're going to be concerned that
the European ones are what you've heard
about and people usually call them
Arabic numbers because the Europeans got
them from the Arabs what happened is
that the Arabs got them from the Indians
so the arabs call them hindi numbers and
there are some revisionists for example
in iran that called them just persian
numbers they just ignore the history so
Unicode just so unicode kind of to try
to avoid that confusion try to come up
with some names that I think you should
also try to use in the i18n world so
European numbers are what Europeans use
and East Asians and most everybody in
the world and then these Arabic indict
digits these are the set that most Arab
countries are going to use and then
there is this extended Arabic
individuals and those are the people who
actually change it a bit through
Persians so in Iran they took the art
forms and they change it a bit and then
Central Asia and South Asia those of
them who write in arabic script like
Pashto in Afghanistan p verse language
of pakistan and india they took it from
the Persians so they took the Persian
forms I get the cash question 23 or 24
this is the same number 0 to 9 in every
system some of them are different if you
look for example the shape of four five
and six are different in the font i'm
using up there yeah the four or five and
six are different in that font but then
again if you get to pakistan the seven
shape would be different from this
although the same digits food
use and it's not also in unicode
standard it's not only the ships that
are different but also there are some
the by the class of that is a bit
different not necessarily by design may
the design may have been a mistake but
there are some differences and but also
that the forms you you want to use and
really oh okay nice to know that oh okay
so but yeah the codes you can also find
them i mean there's a very good section
in the unicode standard talking about
the basics of this so just look at the
ER Luke chapter in the Yukon standard
and explains the differences and the
Lord again the countries that kind of
use each set of the numbers what
happened is that in reality there's a
lot of headache especially on Windows so
when windows was doing Arabic Unicode
wasn't really there so they started
doing Arabic I think that Windows 3.1 or
3.0 and they only had eight bit
character sets so what they did is they
they kind of made the European numbers
rather fancy so what happened is that
you would have just one set of numbers
they didn't have enough space to put an
additional set of numbers in their
character set code page 12 56 so what
they did is they added a feature to
their various products including windows
that you could automatically show the
European numbers as Arabic indic numbers
so you could put a check mark somewhere
in your windows settings and if you put
that check mark which could be there by
default I don't even know in these
products is there by default language
products not the numbers with the
European but they would be displayed as
Arabic Hindi and you could remove the
checkmark and everything would be
European and there was also this
advanced settings that the numbers would
be either European or Arabic indic based
on context of course based on a internal
markers of algorithm that changed in
every product
you couldn't even figure out how it
works so it's a headache to try to
handle that still Microsoft doesn't
properly handle arbic digit numbers
everywhere in Excel for example you type
Arabic and Eric individuals and it may
not parse them as a number it may parse
them as a string or when you use an
arabic keyboard on the latest version of
microsoft windows i sell it again do not
follow the every change but in almost
latest versions i'm quite sure that it
generates european numbers although the
country maybe saudi arabia which they
really insist on arabic indeed not
numbers for display of course the user
is recommended that to just go and check
that thing on and off but you don't
really want to do that or assume that
that feature is on or off what you if
you want to do windows software for
example you actually need to test for
all different settings it also creates
lots of problems for those of us who
work in localization and use formats
like tradus that use microsoft word for
localization also microsoft word has
some very interesting features there
that really breaks everything my
recommendation is when you writing your
code in your software generate the right
unicode code point and if you can
control the system to turn off all these
intelligence do that and control it just
so you would be able to just generate
the writing when you recognize numbers
recognize everything because you can't
really know what ver what the user is
actually seeing so the user may see the
right thing or the user may type using a
very different keyboard layouts so you
really want to recognize all the forms
the sort of carpet I'm talking about
there is what really happens is when
you're localizing or when your
translators are localizing they may see
the European 7 as an Arabic indeed 7 and
so what happens is that they would think
is the right code so your engineers
really on this side need to make sure
that the right codes are used because
you're linked lists cannot be hundred
percent trusted
because they may see they may have that
automatic feature on for different
clients who doesn't care about those
differences so they would think yes I
just follow their soul guide and they
haven't just talking about other non by
the requirements of the same markets
icons and graphics are always dangerous
it would really depend on your
application that plus sign or what you
see right there in the western markets
that's an addition but there are there
are some conservatives in the Middle
East that considered that not very good
symbol so and there are textbooks that
when they teach addition they removed
the lower part of that so if you just
like just you just see the three the top
and the two left and right side you
would not see the lower part and unicode
even has a character for that just for
that purpose because some people would
consider that a symbol of Christianity
you will see the same thing with the
asterisk you just let do it for a
footnote but then again some
conservative Muslims consider data Star
of David so they go for a five pointed
star and again unicode has a character
for that too you learn that naps and
flags are bad for 18 and you hear that
so many times they're worse for the
violent markets people happen to be
generally more aggressive about what
they think and you can't really get the
map of Kashmir right with India and
Pakistan and China all around it and you
can't get the map of Israel and
Palestine right nobody would I mean you
can't get at least two different parties
agreeing on what you want to show maps
to the flag of Israel also for example
is very controversial not even the flag
of Israel I mean the flag of Iran is
controversial it's I mean there are some
egg has traitors who really hate that
just like things just get more complex
when you do these kind of don't do
things and I Tina provider
playing cards chess games are the Islam
Islamic people don't really like those
things again religious symbols which may
just simply sleep in I mean it may be a
patriotic symbol in the US but it could
be considered very religious in the
Middle East place names again Jerusalem
is the most famous example you don't
want to call your time zone necessarily
Jerusalem or necessarily very expose it
or if you do that you really need to
make sure that you also add oats the
Arabic name because that's also very
controversial or something else the
icons are interesting you for example
you when you do that you see the
difference between here right yeah it's
very obvious to me and when you want to
have a back button and you want to do it
back for the Arabic or Hebrew user
interface you just don't mirror it if
you mirror it things would look a bit
off what you do is you keep the light
source at the top left and that's how
these arrows look basically for every
icon that you want to mirror further for
your user you just don't mirror it
graphically the death once the
traditions there too there's not exactly
a why that this happened theoretically
we could just move the light source up
there too right but that's not how it
got done so if this is a tradition and
then you need to make sure that some
icons may need to be localize famous
example is the question mark the Arabic
? is the mirror image of that so your
vital experts who may come from an Arab
world may say oh of course the question
mark icon should be mirrored but not for
Israel because Israel still uses the
same European ? so this is actually a
question of localizing contact this is
something I came up I mean for math you
may want to do something like that
square root of x but that's the Arabic
version for some Arabic countries but
not all some Arabic countries right
there maths right to left and Amir
everything some Arabic countries just
use your PMS and if you're careful you
figure out i think the lighting and this
thing is wrong
multiple calendars the famous example
the gregorian calendar is used
everywhere you have the hebrew calendar
with the lunisolar calendar in Israel
you have the persian calendar in iran
and in afghanistan is a solar calendar
and you have the Islamic calendar in
most of the Islamic world these are
basically sorted on the order of hard to
implement some people have really
struggled the Hebrew calendar you go
further down list things are not even
easily defined you want the Islamic
calendar you don't even exactly know
what country is following which rules
these days and again the default
calendar very different and this is a
famous example of Iran and Afghanistan
we don't use the gregorian calendar by
default we have it our calendars but
it's just one after three days views
this is a sample user interface of a
it's done by my friend Beth dot who
these days works at Google Waterloo so
this is how you would like an
application a calendar application for a
Iranian locale look like you see three
numbers in every cell but one at the top
is the persian calendar the one at the
bottom right is the islamic calendar and
the one at the bottom left is the
gregorian calendar and you want all
three and you want them this way for
example in persian digits if you want
you to do that make sure you use
existing code it's rather hard to get it
right if you want to do it yourself even
the best books in the market on the
algorithms do not really cover
everything so place it like I see you
they make sure that the best knowledge
of the industry at the moment is
gathered there but even that is very far
from what's being used in the
underground in the real world so if you
have higher standards talk to me I've
done that for example for Iran advise
clients for the Arabic market but the
real key is don't do it worse than the
others just just use what everybody's
using just use I see you you're gonna be
okay nobody was going to blame you that
you're bad
and the other thing in calendar is
interesting you have 13 months years for
example for the Hebrew calendar you need
to be ready for those things did you
even have something like I'm calling
rushing months you have moving month you
moving holidays in the US for example
the Easter is and the holidays around
that are moving and I mean Martin Luther
King Day is moving for example the first
monday of somethings other things fixed
date those are considered moving Callan
moving the holidays but then again in
the Islamic world you have a moving
holiday the first of Ramadan for example
the holy month of fasting that moves but
then it may shake yesterday it's in the
evening and then the authorities say
that oh yes we've seen the moon we've
seen the question of the moon so instead
of the day after tomorrow tomorrow is
the holiday I in my personal life in
Iran that happened that it wasn't it was
in the morning of a day when I left home
we were going for some hiking then I
left home in the morning it was
considered the last day of the Holly
Massa fasting when I got back home
around noon my mom said oh yeah it was
announced that today is the aid so we
can eat so so even on the same day the
day it may change of today so that's
what I'm calling rushing holiday and
that's that that day this V she
wasn't a holiday became a holiday on
that that day's morning and they're also
non regular occurrences if you have an
anniversary or a birthday don't assume
that person celebrates its on the
gregorian calendar i was i happen to be
born on april first but that day is not
always my birthday I celebrate my
birthday on the persian calendar so it
moves around more or less
ah doesn't work I tried so it is there
any question about the calendars I still
something about something okay Vickers
are different too true two weekends are
different too and again depend on the
country some countries take it on
thursday and friday some countries are
doing it on fridays and saturdays some
are just doing western they're doing
friday they're doing sirens sunday yes
just friday yeah just yes so you said
everybody for rushing holidays and what
could you possibly do in software or
these changing what today is a very
interesting question let's talk about it
after the talk III did even influenced
off those things yes yes know that the
persian can dress fixed so the person
either is pre computed the islamic
calendar changes so so the dates so on
each page you see them the main persian
date very large and then the gregorian
date which is again fixed in smaller
font and then the islamic date the
islamic date that the printer scanner
may go wrong when they move the month so
you just know that oh yeah this is the
month of Ramadan but moved a day forward
or moved a backward people who just know
that but the printed calendars would
have problems on a software you just
when you find out you would need to
update your software or if the web
service you didn't update your data I
have some ideas again let's continue
that into the Q&amp;amp;A I can tell you what so
regarding your implementation my higher
my high recommendation is don't reinvent
the ville there's lots of stuff already
done in our ICU for example which
everybody again has a way to use it
these days a loss of the work has been
done the free software stack
it pango does a lot free but 3bd does a
lot gtk+ does a lot and lots of people
use those things and they've debugged
them don't go and implement the Unicode
by the algorithm again since Jane is a
very good example of what Google has
done and contributed to the world and
why you a treat this is the yahoo for
javascript the Yahoo you I like library
in JavaScript that those three small
rather small things that I have done
personally when I was helping yahoo and
they agreed to open source those pieces
for a text input box because HTML does
not support things you would want to do
things for text for a larger i would say
that HTML editor inside a web app you
may want something and lots of those
software available as open source
software for free and it will save you a
lot of debugging time but again there
are bugs and your client your customers
may want different things than what's
available so really make sure you test
them heavily use open source offer as
much as possible or suffer you can
completely control you want to change
things and you're going to find very
much near the end of the project that
there is this basic bug in the library
that's causing all of this you want to
be able to fix that instead of
implementing you're really crazy work
ran out no your platform are limitations
web is the famous example and some
people in this room are really working
very very hard and really appreciate
that to try to fix that for a future
versions of the web platform which are I
don't know they're going to probably be
widely available everywhere 10 years
from now fortunately because we can't
even get rid of ie6 so just know how web
is different regarding by I for example
when you when you do web software you
don't really have any automatic
detection every single piece of text you
need to specify if you have that info
and if it's different its direction so
on a page you need to say these pages
left to right or right to left otherwise
things
would be assumed left to right or they
would assume the direction of their
parent elements generally speaking so
basically you would need to just go
everywhere and if you have let's say a
right-to-left interface that shows let's
say emails in gmail for example in
Arabic and then you want to display a
left-to-right email you need to find out
that email is left to right and in your
software in your web application set the
direction of that piece of the screen
that shows that email to left to right
you really need to control everything
there and you can't really trust the
platform to know anything and that's
created lots of problems for example
that that's one of the reasons those
JavaScript libraries I told you about
order flash is still going really crazy
different versions do really crazy
things talk to other people I haven't
really touched it with a black hole on
mobile that the real headache is still
that android doesn't really support by
there properly you want to do your own
library or your own really cooked up
version of iodine and the desktop you
can trust mark yourself doing its work
well enough also on a goon on platform
you can have it fine mac is the bits not
very obvious what it's doing go for
standards that's other thing we've seen
any time you decide to instead of a
standard go for supporting a certain way
a certain libraries doing something that
library in a later version two years
from now is gonna change and implement
the actual standard then your software
gets broken so what usually should do is
actually assume that things worked
according to the standard and do it that
way and then implement workarounds only
for the blogs in the platform that
you're using yes and yet the platform is
kind of still shaky and different
versions do different things the body
features are not exactly kind of clean
they don't still even behave according
to unicode standard for the body
in the text editor and stuff like that
for example it has its own version of Pi
and it still needs a bit of time to
converge with Mac os10 basically they
broke all of my eye so and they haven't
really caught back to where they were
before excuse me iOS is much better I
was much better than mac OS with my eye
excuse me no I haven't ok so again
something I've seen a lot with each
client's is that the world of
performance and already Unicode and
internationalisation make your
application slower and larger for
various different reasons and viable
just add to it and you gonna have a
fight if you work and by that with your
performance people they don't really
like your if surrender there are lots
you're gonna have lots of ifs here and
there and they would think well I mean
how many people are actually using
Arabic or Hebrew in your software could
we just do this for them come up with a
localized Arabic version that has these
magic features and let's just forget it
for the English speakers and guess what
happens that doesn't get tested and
really breaks things apart from that all
of your restaurant Direction users are
it would simply be restricted only to
read left to right stuff this you can
actually have them have wider for them
somehow for free it's a real headache
usually to only enable vie for your body
languages and you usually pay the price
during the Q a phase the other thing is
some people kind of try to see our this
is a problem maybe I can do it faster
that's not only a headache for you later
when you try to import or export some
content or text from something that also
becomes a problem for everybody who's
working for your software you copy and
paste text from this to that and it
doesn't work Microsoft is still doing
that unfortunately people who are the
Unicode conference saw that they have a
specialized version of the model
algorithm in Excel and they have a
specialized version of the Unicode
algorithm for localizing Microsoft
software and of course they're kind of
exposing some of that to the people in
the industry saying that this is how we
changed it but then again you can't even
properly cut and paste between markers
of products you copy and paste something
from Excel to marks of notepad and
things will break not not that much
notre is actually much better than excel
in my opinion regarding boy died sorry
I'm not doing my math in notepad okay
yes here oh oh something happened
something happened okay if something
happens okay yeah yeah yeah Wow okay yet
there was there was also a numbering
issue there was something that I called
both of them but number one if you
remember I mean so it's all the thing
conversion between PowerPoint and
openoffice and all that just everything
is something like it happens sorry be
there but very good catch yeah Oh texted
okay text you I think text has heard
this for the third time or something
that's early he's not paying attention
okay okay
okay now's a good time to actually talk
about this thing that we kind of
introduced again here in the in the
Western market we've been using that in
the Middle East for quite a while but
interestingly there is this thing you're
calling in inside my company Heydrich
passwords we're calling by the
localization engineering and I just want
to kind of mention that i find it is
really weird that people here are rarely
doing this and it's it's very obvious to
me what usually happens is that you pass
certain strings to your localization
company or your inside linguist or
something to translate to Arabic and
Hebrew and they have all these
placeholders percent as four strings or
these days you would say brace brace one
brace brace something like that and they
would localize those things and they
really have no idea that would just keep
the placeholder where it is and they
would have no idea what that placeholder
is going to be replaced with that
placeholder could be a number could be a
number with a person sign could be a
number with a currency symbol could be
user ID which would be in English for
example could be something that could be
either English or Arabic could be a file
path could be anything and your linguist
does not know the Unicode by the
algorithm what it looks to them it looks
okay to them and that's what they
usually translate to and what happens is
that that strings comes your developer
gets inside your build and during your
QA when it gets to your local QA you're
going to see that string really gobbled
up and you really have no idea what to
do about that you wonder is it a
translation issue you got it back to
linguist the linguist checks now I did
it right so you get back to your
developer developer looks it looks okay
to me then you find you by the experts
your body extra Dukes oh that's because
you need to insert this Unicode control
character here that's usually what
happened it's very very expensive be
recently doing some project for paypal
and they introduced pay
power for Israel a paypal a hebrew
version paypal and Ebert their
localization partner in high-tech
password so at the beginning we really
insisted not only to save their costs
but to save our own costs that we do
this by the localization enduring for
you so what happens is that after the
strings go to linguist we actually have
engineers that receive those strings and
know the Unicode by the algorithm by
heart and all these details and they
actually go where the strings before
passing the client insert those unicode
controls and would know what's up and
what what to do about to fix about that
as a result paypal was very very happy I
think very few strings came back cher we
work on that I mean maybe from thousands
of strings ten strings came back yeah
yeah and that's kind of income
incomparable to to something like if you
hadn't for example done that process you
would have seen at least ten percent of
strings in some problems so i'm not
saying come to us for this I'm saying do
this if you don't come to somebody who
does this add a process after
localization to inserting those controls
I think I'm it to close on already six
slides over my 24 slice so what you want
to do is you don't want to simplify
standards already talked about this it
will bite you at the worst time ever and
I Microsoft will gonna have that
headache with what they did for Excel
for years I'm quite sure and the users
are going to really hate it go with what
some other people are doing and that's
innovation on top of standards or
improving these standards so just assume
that unique wat by die for example is
there you can fix it you can change it
just make something on top of it or if
you want to change certain teens go talk
to the other players they know things
there are some reason that those things
are there don't just break it for your
own product you're going to have a
health
maintain it for the rest of your life
markers are for example every software
they do they want to be able to open old
world files or old excel files and so
they need to have it three different
ways in the latest version of the
software or somebody's going to nag the
other thing is please do not make us
second-class citizens that happens so
many times and that's another reason
that lots of people in the Middle East
in North Africa in South Asia hate
Western a software they may use it
because they don't have any other
alternative but they still hated you
tend to hide your features for right to
left you tend to require the users to
actually really go and find something
you actually require them to work
counter-intuitively and that's a really
high price you already pay a huge price
for the value of work go a bit more do
it the right way and again don't assume
that all your users are in the Middle
East or want to use the Arabic interface
even in the Arab world there are people
who work with Arabic content and they
actually use the left to right user
interface they're used to it they just
want to handle Arabic content just make
sure your left where I software support
by thy your right to life support
software supports left to right and
there again people like me who live in
here in the West and believe me there
are quite a few of those and those are
very important customers of your
software so open to questions I excuse
me I don't know how much I'm over ok so
the English to Arabic and then they have
a variable name you know what you so if
you take example of a medieval era
contigo
i'm saying that i have tested your lap
name is desert in brackets 2.1 and i
will continue typing arabic we don't
want to even need that to you right so
I'm a regular universe it's my mama i'm
not i don't know how are we interesting
question look at look at how markers of
words for example does it i mean i bash
microsoft but they also do something
thumbs up very good so when your hand in
plain text for example with plain text
in context like notepad you're very
restricted about what you can do and you
can't do you really need to follow the
unicode algorithm but when you advance a
bit too richard text and in those places
for example in composing email more and
more these days it's just HTML you can
actually be more intelligent and know
from some context that that certain
parentheses was actually a right to left
or left to right francis's and then
insert the appropriate either markup or
unicode control characters for
biocontrol in the places you need so it
become more intuitive all you know my
recommendation is look at how microsoft
word does it and sort with trying to
mimic that that's a very good start
that's much more intuitive than just
like throwing the default unicode by the
algorithm in somebody's lap yes for
machine translation i generally don't
recommend any much in translation for
any language
I understand that I just I just I'm too
much of a nitpicker unfortunately I mean
I'm not the best person to ask for this
III hate it when when one word is wrong
I mean let alone when whole sentences
are just like totally different yes yet
it's kind of had more complex story
there of how you you couldn't know about
how you handle testing generally for ya
yes you have but it's again you you
would for example you would want to make
sure certain strings always displeased
displays okay let's say as I as I said
you have this place holders think that
something person as something and then
you really want to make sure that any
string that's out there you really want
to split correctly so what you actually
do I mean if you do buy their
localization engineering there are some
marks there and then you want you maybe
you want to generate random strings that
could be there and then pass it through
a bind I a rendering layer like three BD
that I just talked about is open source
and in C and see what comes out and
always make sure that those parts stay
up left and right and things don't break
so there are these things that you can
try to automate but then again lots of
these things are not even documented how
a certain software is supposed to work
in a right-to-left context even the
experts may disagree so some of this
stuff can never be done until you
actually look at the code and see ah ok
so sorry I'm sorry code at the output
and you say audit but or otherwise oh
this looks really wrong and your binder
experts may not even know notice that
that's going to happen early in the
project only when everything is done
they may look oh this but this looks
very wrong
that's what I'm saying you're by the
experts as assumably is already a native
speaker anyway see many obviously states
like some same world was when one place
translated including me in other ways
was just the kinetics wedding vendor for
the same yet it's pretty complex and
something else i would recommend is that
and now that brings me to other i forgot
to mention in during the world war
conference i'm also going to have a talk
which is gonna be more towards the
managerial people in in i 18 n and we
also be covered we're gonna cover
testing a bit and my colleague here
cornelio arizona cornelio is going to
also share some of his experience
regarding our paypal project if you're
going to be joined by paypal people
explaining from both side of the table
of what happened how and we're gonna
talk a bit more about testing there and
also regarding what to do when I mean
it's a bit complex for example testing
for example you do localization testing
and what happens is that if you buy the
localization your buyer support is not
complete you can't really test your
Arabic strings because they may be this
way left to right for example and vice a
versa if you haven't done your
localization you can't really test you
by the interface because it's going to
be English and things are gonna look
weird so there are some problems there
so you may want to do some pseudo
localization further by their work and
then do the actual localization and then
test them everything near varies done so
there are some issues like that we're
going to talk about that into into the
world or talk yes
when you do buy die oh yeah so so so
apparently started that thread so so
sorry what I would recommend is during
your body enabling as soon as possible
start some pseudo localization for
example just replace every English
letter with some corresponding Arabic
letter and pass those strings and do
some other edits to and and use that as
a basis of your bio support so that's as
the software is being developed it needs
to be tested the bar that features needs
to be done tested near that time frame
so you would have better communication
with your developer development team and
it's going to go on and then later you
want to have when you get somewhere
you're going to have your actual
localization to arabic or hebrew and
then that's also need to be tested by
those linguists or somebody who knows
those languages very much near the
actual localization process so they
could give feedback and fix things and
that's also a very good place to do a
second phase of by I testing because the
the actual arabic or hebrew translations
would going to bring out more by that
box I don't even answer you Oren let it
not be a hard question okay who did that
I never heard about it oh wow okay great
great so you release it by Oh sugar
thanks a lot i didn't know about that
thanks a lot
yes so here's very interested in a part
of your talk where you discuss all the
different subtleties of the different
forms of Arabic in the different you
have digits and months and all that and
he probably made it people you talk to
and so those items were like wow we'll
never get completely right so I'm
curious about sort of the idea of the
perfect nanny if it good or if there's a
way to get something that is good enough
to leap appease most people and so let
me understand like have you walked that
line between gate something that
perfectly localized and something days
yeah what I would say here is that you
can truly achieve perfectly localized
unless you actually really live there
have been brought up there I mean I
tried that in Iran for example and I
could achieve some of that for one
single market I mean we did that
localized version of known for example
for persian deeply localized and certain
applications will remove move the date
system was totally made different
certain things were highly customized
and all of that and we did a few other
things during my first eight times that
was yeah until three years ago and but
you can't really go there because you
need to really understand the psyche of
that nation which is different for every
nation or every even its Nissa t that
you want to target I mean different
languages of Pakistan would require
different things use of Afghanistan
Afghanistan would would have different
requirements than users in Iran because
they look at things very differently so
you can't go perfect what you want to do
I mean assuming that some natives could
go perfect what you want to do is
getting somewhere that people are
comfortable using your software and what
I talked about is trying to balance that
those stories really knowing why are you
doing a certain feature
not simply because somebody really asks
for it too loudly just exactly know what
is this feature why do I need to do this
is this because I'm gonna sell more or
is this because the users are not going
to hate me so that's what I kind of
originally talked about in that I mean
are not very well I didn't really talk
very well but the idea I kind of try to
get there is always have a reason for
every feature and stick to those things
unless proven otherwise don't make your
developers add or remove things or you
by the experts because they just like it
it's hard it's very hard yes something
are there in the InDesign frameworks
more and more every day that's my short
answer so the CLD our project for
example that the ICU is based on that
the unicode sealer project which
collects some of these information for
various locales so that's it for example
a very good standard to a good place to
look at for revert to sort from they
kind of collect the information on that
the basic information on let's say
numbering system the basic information
on calendar they days of the week and
all that stuff so as you find an ICU for
example is trying to support that
because loss of the developers artist of
the standard and if i see you share are
the same people so they in each version
you see more and more so but then again
it really depends on a platform as i
said android unfortunately it still
doesn't support by that if the very very
basic things and then again marks are
people still don't support different
numbers well i'll see you does very
different to question for everything the
other thing i want to mention here is
that I just touch the surface what I the
features other features of by the
markets I talked about are just things
that are well known in the industry
there are lots of things that are not
well known and it just like let's fix
this first and we'll get there
but just like everything else I mean
famous example and if you really want to
do typesetting which adobe for example
is very interested i know i don't know
how many abdo people are here if you
want to do time setting for some of the
Arabic Loki Arabic script locales you
want to use different phone sizes for
right to left and left to right text
your 14-point arabic font would be
equivalent usually usually too intent
english font so if you're doing for
example an application that you want it
to display a piece of plain text from
the web in a nice way you actually want
to go and analyze and find chunks that
are in Latin and find sharks that are in
Arabic and set them to different font
sizes to get them right I mean there are
so many of these small things here and
there and use you you've gone first fix
these and then talk to me about the rest
yes that's just one of the approaches I
it's the Islamic calendar is very
complex so there are at least 24 did
there around 24 around 24 countries with
Arabic as one other official languages
and there are lots of other countries
with Arabic script used I mean Iran
Afghanistan Pakistan India or just some
examples that Arabic script is used also
some countries Africa and then when you
go to actual Muslims not only there also
in Southeast Asia and other places
they're also all run the world the
expatriate communities so and they all
use different versions of the Islamic
calendar there's this thing they call
the Islamic civil calendar which they
try to calculate using an using an
arithmetic rule likely Gregorian
calendar there is this thing called the
astronomical calendar that people try to
predict the phases of the Moon and how
it would look so and they would
basically publish calendars based under
their math they're astronomical math
there are things in between for
example in Iran are us around as an
example again again because that's where
I live and this is the actual facts on
the ground in Iran we used a mix of
astronomical and moving calendar so what
happened is that they published
calendars for the Islamic calendar for
example and they pre computed it for the
next year but except for two months the
month of Ramadan and a show while those
two months have a kind of special status
in the Islamic culture so what happens
for those two months they said we do not
trust the published calendar we actually
go and observe the moon but not for the
other mods for the other months if the
observation was different they would
keep the calendar in in Afghanistan
insert in Pakistan and India in some of
the states different states may actually
start ramazan on different months
because they have different local
councils that have different rules or
different observation rules sorry I
think I said exactly text um everything
you're saying is true but you're
painting a picture of impossible
complexity really complexity there are
no standards that you can point out that
say no no role models you can point out
say this software I did let me know and
all the platforms are not quite right
and the message here is is very similar
to if you go back to even before
European languages were not well
standardized the i18n guys would get up
in front of an audience and say there's
a great opportunity and by the way here
are these details of sorting and
character capitalization it's all a mess
and nothing nothing works and I think
what we ought to do is give us a little
bit of context because everything you're
saying is true and we know the
difficulties but the the general case
business application right if you're
doing some basic business
transactions you're getting names and
addresses storing in a database and
displaying it and doing a few other
things this becomes a problem is
solvable you're not going to get into
all of that what and that's the way to
do it you want to get to a point where
you're as good as the platform that
you're running on if you've got a
Windows application it's okay to
leverage windows and its mistakes
because everyone else has the same
mistakes and then you can deliver
something to the market that will be
successful from a business perspective
it won't necessarily be as good
certainly not with life and maybe not as
the market with a daily life but you can
then do business in those markets and to
the extent that these also suggested
don't do more than you need and if you
simplify and that makes sense because
all these things are high pause because
unfortunately although i 18 n is an
architecture not a feature there is no
bye-bye architecture yet there's no one
who's saying here's what you do to get
one application that does by Diane
internationalisation across the world so
that's not there that's why this is very
high cost but so go into it knowing that
there's some costs you have to be clear
on the opportunity minimize what you do
but recognized it makes sense for some
applications if you're doing business
it's fine if you're doing gaming
software something that's very
particular if you're trying to do
something that requires a lot of high
touch with the user well then you're up
for all those those issues but most of
us and then are not don't need all okay
if you're just doing something that's
you're selling on a website you've got
some simple transactions going on you
can get the display work it'll be a
little bit more costly than you'd like
you left some code variations but it's
doable and it's so everything you said
is right but and I think I even said
that
only way to do this is to hire you no no
no no not at all text sex your oh no no
no no no I actually text I I have very
limited bandwidth number one I
understand that no no yes sorry sorry
for me not making some of those things
clear but what text is saying is correct
and I actually thought I in parts of my
presentation I've been trying to pass
that message to that's for example when
this slides came I mean I really I
really think that this is doable
especially for your small application
and also for the bidirectional by the
racialization architecture I mean we
have I mean I have I mean there are some
people who really I mean not me some
people are really doing a lot of work to
try to make that happen I mean a
harrowing the famous example of that
he's one of my heroes yeah so he's
really trying to get not only one
platform but the standard fixed so every
platform would actually implement that
and he has a list of bonds that her
everything is public and trying to get
every way to agree on a certain fixed
platform so your future web application
would have much easier time are on back
there so for example he's the lead in
trying to get the bite I fixed for HTML
and that's the future and us as exactly
as you said i 18 n took a while to get
here and now everybody knows about
unicode unicode was one of those I mean
I'm yes I look like a clown circus
trying to just show you all these
different things and I attending over
where that ten years ago of course yes
unico we all experience the political
side of things or by through ha
education
drama can you comment on what kind of
politics are going on I die unification
or getting some compromise because some
countries will have to come from it will
have to compromise yeah the war is these
days Devore is mostly with Grandpa and
Tamil people in the Unicode world
funnily enough yeah the war is in the
indic world so so the Pakistan is kind
of resigned there were some politics
involved quite a few years ago they
wanted to change the whole Arabic model
and encode just composing dots for all
the Arabic letters so the pocket yet
Tommy wanted to just rewrite everything
and just like burn the book and then I
mean kill all the authors and all that
so that's does more emotional complex
but for arabic and the Pakistanis try
something the Iranians are trying to do
something I kind of try to stop them d I
mean lots of countries always come late
and then try to fix something and
sometimes they get new characters and
get things fixed if they try to follow
the model but some of them come with
this idea of for example again sorry for
using Tamil as an example because that
but that's the issue of the day a famous
saying in the Unicode world from the
time of people is that Tamil is the only
scientific script in the world that's
very judgmental first of all and I mean
of course the Koreans are going to fight
with them over who's more scientific but
if you can't beat honestly Korean is a
very nice script the Hangul script yes
and it's very bad it's very the best but
the best scientific writing systems got
really screwed up in unica but oh really
i didn't know that so
every every culture is gonna stand up
yeah i think that's that's really it's
here the thing is one of and you brought
this question of why some people pill no
no no what is it yeah that's what its
gonna try to talk about the feature
requirements so the idea is that try to
exactly no every why every feature is
there that's the thing it really depends
on let me not bring your slides but it
really depends on your your customers
what you actually want to sell who you
actually want to salt it it's not this
grand scheme of want to have the perfect
software it not gonna work make sure
every feature has a reason thank you
