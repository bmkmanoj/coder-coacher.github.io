an any bot and turn the time over to him
hello everybody I'm John buys and I'd
like to tell you about my new
weight-loss plan I dropped from 180
pounds to just 35 pounds in 1 minute
when I switched to this stainless steel
body here but actually I'd like to thank
Trevor Blackwell and Mike's day for
helping me get set up and like to tell
you about some thoughts about energy the
environment and what we can do about it
I I've just been thinking about this for
the last couple of years it's a huge
issue so I'll just dive in so we get
more and more energy from burning fossil
fuels mainly that all other forms of
energy are almost negligible at present
although people are trying to change
that and so what that means is that in
2010 the average person on this planet
put 1.3 tons of carbon into the air in
the form of carbon dioxide mainly from
burning fuels but also the some extent
from manufacturer of cement that's
actually the second biggest cause of it
so the average American was considerably
more than that we put out about almost
five tons of carbon diet into the
atmosphere every year and so that total
it up the average that means the humans
put 9.1 gigatonnes billion tons of
carbon into the air
in that year and it's been going up to
ever since so to understand just how
much we've done look at this graph here
this shows carbon dioxide over the last
four hundred thousand years and you'll
notice that
ocellated clean about 200 parts per
million the grab the language that
you're probably looking at now is this
graph of carbon dioxide slowly going up
as measured in Hawaii going up from
about 310 parts per million 1962 about
390 parts per million now you'll see
that these red Wiggles are a kind of
annual cycle but the blue average is
what counts the most and of course the
main thing is that it's increased by
about thirty percent in a fairly short
time so then if you go on to this next
graph here you'll see that in its proper
perspective namely that there have been
ice age cycles for the last four hundred
thousand years or actually more this is
how far back we can go from a certain I
score at Vostok which is a base in
Antarctica and the warmer it is the more
carbon dioxide there is and also the
more carbon dioxide it is the warmer
there is there's a kind of feedback
mechanism involved which takes us
between 200 parts per million and about
300 parts per million as we go in and
out of ice ages but the far right of
this graph shows a proximately vertical
line and that's us the effect of humans
most of that since 1800 putting a lot of
carbon dioxide out into the air so what
we're doing is an unprecedented
experiment in rapidly warming up the
planet the planet has been warmer than
it is now at other parts of its history
but as far as we can tell there's never
been an episode where the temperature
well they carbon dioxide concentration
in this graph but therefore the
temperature has shot up so quickly so
it's the speed as well as the magnitude
of this that is what makes it all so
scary and important so if you look at
the temperature as you'd expect from the
greenhouse effect it's been going up
it's gone up about point eight degrees
in the last century or since eighteen
eighty and beginning of the Industrial
Revolution you'll see there are
considerable Wiggles there we've got a
annual plot on black that have five year
running average in red and because of
this wiggly pneus it's always possible
to take a small portion of this graph
and say that climate change is stopped
or warming is stopped and it's getting
cooler and so every so often you'll hear
a news report saying that saying just
that but that's just an effect of
looking at small portions of this bigger
trend which shows no sign of stopping
actually so what are the effects of this
well on the next slide here you'll see
that for example the Arctic sea ice is
melting quite rapidly this is quite it
surprising graph to me when I first saw
it this is the volume of Arctic sea ice
as estimated by this p.m. mass
experiment and it's dropped by about a
factor of four since 1979 so this is not
one of these fake graphs where the zero
of the graph is actually way below the
horizontal axis one of these fake graphs
that people use to try to make things
look more dramatic than they really are
this is a real graph so we're really
heading towards know arctic sea ice this
is the minimum Arctic sea ice that is
the minimum that happens each year round
September we're heading towards know
arctic sea ice in September fairly soon
people are taking bets on when certainly
some some people are taking bets that by
2030 the sea ice will be all gone
although if you just did a linear
extrapolation from this graph you'd
probably say well have been even sooner
so that's the kind of thing we are
seeing and as the Arctic sea ice is
melting permafrost in Siberia is melting
up along with that and so we are getting
releases of methane from from the
permafrost melting and that's an
amplifying factor that people are fairly
concerned about recently a Russian ship
doing explorations directly north of
Siberia and the Arctic sea have seen
human job the methane bubbling up from
permafrost at the sea bottom which is
melting and releasing methane and no one
knows if these huge bubble bubbly
regions in the ocean that he's
discovered our new or whether they've
been there for a long time so it's
different people with different views
have different ideas about how serious
that problem is but it's the kind of
change you'd expect when you
dramatically change the climate system
so so far I haven't been making any
projection talking about any projections
or climate models a lot of people like
to argue about I'm fit models so I think
it's nice to look at stuff about what's
already happened and not not worried
right away about the climate models but
still of course it's important to say
what would he expect and it's hard to
know what to expect mainly because it's
hard to predict what people will do so
the in da united nations international
panel on climate change has a range of
projections given by these different
curves in different colors in the graph
here so the co2 concentration started
around 290 parts per million now it's
around 390 but depending on what happens
by 2100 we could see as much as a
thousand parts per million or maybe less
depending on what
we decide to do basically so the top
curve there is a kind of business as
usual full speed ahead type model and
the other the other scenarios involve
various amounts of trying to reduce
deliberately reduce our carbon emissions
so far the what people have been doing
is been tracking along the very top of
those different projections so then
what's the effect of all this well there
are lots of different arguments that say
that each time you double carbon dioxide
concentration in the atmosphere it will
increase the average temperature on the
earth by approximately a constant factor
that's just a rough rule of thumb but
there is this kind of logarithmic a
dependency here and so it's argued that
it will go somewhere up between two and
four and a half degrees Celsius Wow if
you're American and you're used to
Fahrenheit you have to multiply those by
1.8 get the visceral sense for what that
means somewhere between there so that's
a big range that's a huge amount of
uncertainty and that's why it's
difficult to figure out exactly how
nervous to be uh but even to degree
usually has considerable effects as I
will show you so so as I said at the
high end of the different scenarios the
atmosphere could contain about 950 parts
per million of carbon dioxide by the end
of this century and so if you just feed
that into this rough formula you get
temperature rises somewhere between two
and a half and six and a half degrees by
the Celsius by the end of the century so
that upper limit their 6.4 that's quite
quite a lot so going on to what that
will cause
well with just three degrees of warming
the US National Academy of Sciences has
various predictions so they predicted 9
out of 10 summers in the northern
hemisphere will be exceptionally warm
meaning warmer than then 1 out of 10 in
recent past a lot more land will be
burned by wildfires in parts of
Australia Eurasia and North America I
believe we're already seeing that we're
seeing wildfires you can argue about
there because we expect extreme
precipitation events meaning floods and
various sorts to increase by somewhere
between nine and thirty percent we can
expect rainfall in some dry regions to
drop by fifteen to thirty percent so in
other words there's a lot of more
variability in the climate floods and
droughts as the temperature rises and
this in addition to affecting people has
a big effect on on other species species
have already been measured to be moving
six kilometers closer to the poles every
decade which is quite a remarkable rate
of change especially if you realize that
that means the that trees are going to
have quite a bit of trouble keeping up
you don't usually see trees moving that
fast please actually do move around very
slowly not individuals but as a
collective so every time the Ice Age and
I say jens oaks and first pines and then
oaks and then other species move north
but that's a process that usually takes
centuries to millennia not and we're
basically pushing it to the limit and so
what that means is that the rate of
extinction of animal life will increase
as we've in fact been seeing no one
quite knows what
it's going to end up there quite hard to
predict the predictions go between
something like twenty percent and thirty
percent of species could die off by 2100
if we if we keep keep at it and keep
doing what we're doing now so that's
significant to me um so the question
then is what can we do about this so I
could continue trying to convince you
that this is really that these are
really problems but I think the debate
about climate change is unfortunately
sort of stuck in trying to convince the
everybody in the world that these
problems are real and that is keeping us
from moving on to the next stage which
is a big public debate about what are
what are the solutions so I'd like to
just move right on to the solutions so
on this next slide I I here's what we
can do just is a perfect little uh sort
of broad outline of what we can do the
first key thing to realize is that
slowing the rate of carbon burning is
not enough because most carbon dioxide
stays in the air for a long time over a
century individual molecules come and go
they get absorbed by plants but then
they get REME itted and so for carbon
dioxide to really go away to really get
sequestered out of the atmosphere take
takes much longer to long basically for
us to worry about in this issue of
trying to stop climate change or slow
climate change so the saying that people
give that summarizes that which I hope
you all tell your friends is carbon is
forever you've heard the saying diamonds
are forever well carbon dioxide is
unfortunately approximately forever as
far as our as the problem we're dealing
with unless we go out of our way to do
something about it so there seems to be
basically four options that we could do
some mixture of we could just leave
fossil fuels unburnt
so I'm saying that slowing the amount of
which we burn them is it just slows the
rate of the problem but leaving them on
burnt wood it would actually stop the
problem we could live with a hotter
climate we will certainly be doing
plenty of that I think because we're not
slowing things down enough to avoid that
needing to do that if we could sequester
carbon that is actively put it
underground or underwater there are a
variety of schemes for doing that the
Chinese are currently the leaders in
building coal-fired power plants that
sequester the carbon dioxide by pumping
it underground there aren't lots of
these plants but they do have plants
that work to demonstrate the principle
or and or we could actively cool the
earth this usually goes by the name of
geoengineering although all forms of
geoengineering amount to cooling the
earth but there are different ideas that
have been proposed to reduce the amount
of sunlight hitting the earth and other
other things that's the main one though
to cool things down of course
geoengineering is something that people
find very scary but it is certainly a
logical possibility and we need to
really examine this all in a logical way
so in my next slide here this is a
useful way of organizing our thoughts
about the magnitude of the problem so in
2004 these two guys at Princeton pakala
and so cool oh they looked for ways to
hold carbon emissions constant for the
next 50 years from them so that would
not be a solution again that would just
be a start see the problem so the idea
is we hold it constant for 50 years we
suffer a certain extent but then rotor
may be in a better position to really
lower it so they said it would require
seven wedges these green wedges here so
each one of those is a way to reduce
carbon emissions more and more editing
up by reducing it one jigga tonne per
year by 2050 for so that instead of
going up to the projected amount of
carbon emissions
14 gigatonnes it would stay constant at
seven gigatonnes that was their idea at
the time they they were optimistic that
that could even be possible because it's
already gone above seven but it's still
useful thing to think about so here are
some examples of wedges which they
propose they were trying to use wedges
that would use existing technology so
one would be wind power so we can reduce
sorry replace 700 gigawatts of
coal-fired power plants by wind power to
accomplish one wedge so that would mean
that starting now in 2011 we'd need to
multiply the existing amount of wind
power by a factor of 12.5 by 2050 for
that sounds like a lot and it is a lot
it's a major task the good news is that
if you just look at the percentage
growth of wind power right now we if we
could keep up that percentage growth
rate we'd be on track to doing that and
getting one wedge of course percentage
growth rates are get harder to keep up
when you've got more wind power already
in place so the next wedge is I'd like
to talk about its solar power so you can
replace the same amount of coal power by
solar power and that would accomplish a
wedge doubt but however require
multiplying existing solar power by a
factor of 80 there's a lot less solar
power in in operation now and so in
terms of percentage oh yeah so we're in
terms I I don't have the percentage
growth rate here but but in fact the
percentage growth rate of solar power in
the last five or so years has been so
high that we are on track to do that if
we can manage to keep it up nuke leader
is the next item we could replace the
same amount of coal power by by nuclear
power of course lots of people hate
nuclear power but there is a lot of it
compared to these other forms of power
so that would only require doubling the
world's existing supply of nuclear power
so those are different ways of
generating more energy and you can see
that even if we did all three of those
that would just be less than half way
towards solving the problem so another
line of attack is through conservation
so suppose you the number of cars
quadruples in by 2050 for going from 500
million to four times that amount that's
a
fairly reasonable estimate them so then
you could accomplish a wedge by somehow
making everyone in the world drive half
as much that's tough another another /
one would be making cars twice as
efficient but without making people
letting people drive or somehow coaxing
them not to drive more so you may have
heard of the Jevons paradox which is as
you make something more efficient
becomes cheaper and under some extreme
conditions that can even make them use
more of it that that's actually not
usually what happens usually what
happens is that they is that that that
effective partially counteracts the
increases in efficiency but doesn't
completely counteract it and so any
efficiency measure faces that risk but
but it's not it doesn't make it doesn't
make those commencement measures
worthless so the next one is I want to
talk about is conservation and
efficiency for buildings so you can cut
carbon emissions by 25 5 percent in
buildings and appliances to accomplish
one wedge in other words increase the
efficiency of of heating my insulation
mainly by twenty five percent that's why
fewest wedge of it of any that I I've
seen this is something that could really
be done without heroic measures and so
people should just definitely do that so
those are different wedges so I hope you
see that each wedge is a big job and
indeed this way of slicing the problem
into Gigaton sized wedges makes it seem
pretty pretty difficult in in particular
because the number of wedges has has
gone up
pakala zocalo wrote their paper by now
we'd actually need 9 to get down to to
to the to the seven billion tons of
carbon emission per year that they had
when they wrote their paper and you have
to again I just can't emphasize this
enough remember that keeping carbon
emissions constant just means that
warming will continue at about the same
rate that it's that it's going on now
it's just a stopgap tour a kind of
stopgap before we do gets really serious
and reduce emissions so how much would
we have to reduce the emissions to get
out of trouble well there are lots of
estimates of that there's a pretty good
paper by mines housing and some
co-authors that estimate that cutting
current emissions in half by 2050 still
leaves a twelve to twenty five percent
chance of a 2 degrees Celsius or more
rise so a lot of people argue that we
need to cut carbon emissions in half by
2050 some UN recommendations we're
trying to be more safe so to speak
eighty percent cut in carbon emissions
by 2050 but as you can see that these
massive cuts go way beyond what pakala
and tsoukalos suggested and so would
require even more heroic measures on the
part of humanity so we need to take
dramatic action on many different fronts
it's clear from this wedge analysis that
no one thing will be the magic solution
to to carbon emissions sorry I just got
myself into an interesting mode here
that was fun it's so fun being a robot
i'll explain why i'm doing this silly
thing of giving the talk in the form of
a robot pretty soon it's clearly not
yet optimized but it's fun so moving on
to the next slide here so what what what
do we need to do well most of all I
think everybody who cares about global
warming knows that we need to put a
price on carbon in some form that
reflects its true cost including the
damage that it causes ah right now you
can make money by burning stuff and
pumping the waste into the into the air
it's very easy to make money if you
don't have to clean up after your mess
and that's that's the problem of course
the objections to this idea of a price
on carbon is that it would hurt economic
growth and that's certainly true to some
extent one can ask however though
whether a economic growth that winds up
severely damaging the planet and the
people on it really counts as growth
there's also I think just a basic point
that I wish people would everyone would
recognize which is that nothing can grow
forever in a finite system no one
quantity can grow exponentially in a
finite system maybe we can switch over
towards being happy in different kinds
of ways by being smarter and things but
no one particular way of doing things
can grow exponentially forever so so
it's towing when you're talking about
economic growth if you're talking about
growth of any particular measure of the
economy it's got this low at some point
and so the question is not should it
slow but how will it slow and how should
it slow sudden gently or with a crash
right now we're basically taking the
accelerate our car into a brick wall
approach of this going full speed ahead
until we're forced
stop so businesses and government need
to eventually learn to switch away from
wanting the GNP for example to grow
exponentially part of that is
understanding that exponential growth is
it only at best a temporary situation
but part of it is using better economic
indicators for example their various
various people have developed things
called a genuine progress indicator
which may be bit too optimistic a term
for it but the idea of gen this genuine
progress indicator is that you are taken
to account cost as well as benefit so
for example if you decide to cut down
all the trees in the United States to
make paper one year well the GNP will
shoot up but that doesn't actually mean
that things have gotten much better
because you haven't taken into account
the cost you should take into account
the cost so in short what we need is an
intelligent economic system there's
there's economics as practiced by
economists and then there's economics as
practiced by governments which are
slightly different the end bankers the
the there that's an interlocking set of
ideas about economics ranging from the
theoretical to the practical to the real
world that all needs to change that's
not going to change suddenly it's got an
immense internal momentum but
nonetheless it has to change in it I can
just assert that it will change simply
because no quantity will grow forever so
the question is how to change it how
will it change so here's something a
little more concrete on the next slide
here we see McKinsey &amp;amp; Company is a
management consulting company they've
done a nice report in which they argue
that the world could cut carbon
emissions by 10 Jake
tons per year that's all of parkland
tsoukalos wedges by 2030 in fact at no
at roughly no net cost so I know it's
hard to see the details of this funny
looking graph here but the idea is that
the vertical axis is how much it costs
in I guess euros per ton of carbon
dioxide to to cut carbon emissions in
various ways and and so it starts out
being negative below the horizontal axis
on the left so there you seem different
measures tons of them and fine print
that's sort of hard to see until you
download a copy of my talking's stare at
it what so at the left or cost-saving
measures that get us up to a about
roughly without 15 that's jigga tons of
carbon dioxide knock of carbon per per
year you have to divide by three point
six to get the carbon and then over
towards sorry that's over at the left
and then over at the right you see
measures that have a positive cost and
and so what they're trying to point out
is that we can get a substantial way
towards our our goal by various
cognitive efficiency measures lots of
them which will it actually save money
in the long run these these costs are up
till 2030 still a lot of these
efficiency measures require upfront
investments and that's what why people
aren't already doing them so if you like
me took a while to buy compact
fluorescent light bulbs to replace
incandescent light bulbs then you know
how an expensive initial purchase can
deter you from doing something even it
will save you money in the long run and
all these efficiency measures have that
have that character of course so ah you
could hope that governments would
provide different methods to ease people
into into doing these cost-saving
measures which
they are in fact in some cases the fact
that it's a no net cost for doing all
these measures is uh of course poses a
big problem because if you have some
people saving money by doing some of
these measures that's not going to make
necessarily make other people want to
spend money to do other measures or even
want to make the same people spend the
money they've saved on other measures so
this no net cost model only works only
only happens if you have some way of
transferring the money from one to the
other I of course the traditional way of
doing that is with governments and
that's where government I think may have
to come in unless people get other
bright ideas for for making people do
good things so one other thing here is
that in 2010 the we meaning governments
worldwide that's what I would be by we
here is spent about four hundred nine
billion dollars subsidizing the use and
production of fossil fuels so that's the
kind of thing that it's pretty easy to
see is a good idea to stop betting
actually increases the use of fossil
fuels while simultaneously wasting money
stopping it is of course incredibly
difficult because of the interlocking
nature of big businesses that that
produced the fossil fuels with the
government's that are regulating them
and that of course that's the big
problem for all of these ideas moving on
to some other ideas I think we need lots
of ideas so it's possible that we need
nuclear fuel this is a heresy in certain
circles but that's why I need to talk
about it so if you go to download the
versions of these slides you can click
on any claim I make and and get taken to
a link that gives evidence for that
so I say there are calculations arguing
that without nuclear we're stuck in
solving global warming you could click
on that and see a paper that it crunches
the numbers and attempts to demonstrate
that you really need numbers to make
these arguments you can't just hand wave
of course right now I don't have any
hand so I can't hand wave but but i but
i also don't feel like going through all
these numbers but but they're in crucial
and so you have to click on the link to
get into an argument with these peoples
so there's another paper that argues
that if you add nuclear power into the
mix then we actually have a chance it
remember it's it's a problem that needs
to be solved by a rough deadline it's
not it's I mean there's no specific
deadline but it's not a problem that we
can take forever to solve and that and
that's why it may be necessary to the
throne nuclear into the mix instead of
just waiting for the the nice renewable
energy supplies to grow to the point
where they're where they do the job so I
would love someone who disagrees with
this and thinks that nuclear is not
necessary to actually write a paper that
it crunches the numbers and plausibly
gives a different conclusion of course
nuclear power has plenty of problems
safety of the reactors themselves is one
issue what do you wouldn't need to get a
lot better at building reactors that
turn off not continue to heat up when
something breaks when the power goes out
so at Fukushima for example the idea of
storing nuclear waste in pools of water
that that are on the second floor of a
building and leak out on a disaster
happens and then the waste melt that's
in retrospect not the best way to do
things and hopefully people can actually
learn from these mistakes and embrace
Wow what's called your safety whereas if
you pull out the plug and make
everything break the
the nuclear plant is at least very
likely to turn off however it's worth
noting that some calculations which you
can see if you click here show that coal
burning coal causes at least about 1,000
times as many deaths per kilowatt hour
as nuclear power you see with nuclear
power although people are concerned
about accidents and wastes and Chernobyl
definitely did kill a lot of people in
general people don't take spent nuclear
fuel and shoot it up into the atmosphere
on purpose whereas with coal that's just
exactly what what happens we burn it and
it goes up into the air and it causes
very large numbers of deaths to know
lung disease early in China where the
regulations are lousy and so I think
that some of our worries about nuclear
power come from a sort of mistaken
perceptions of what counts is risky and
what counts is not risky of course there
really are things that are worse about a
whole bunch of people dying it or
getting scared at once then few people
Chinese poor people dying every day but
uh but still I think Cole should be the
villain not nuclear so India and China
are busy building nuclear reactors and
these are the big countries that
actually really matter for a lot of
these problems so in some sense you
could say it doesn't really matter too
much what Germany or Japan or even the
United States does about this what it
really matters is what these other
countries do anyway that's just a
thought to throw out there so moving
upon what can other kinds of people can
do most people are quite poor and they
can't build nuclear power plants or do
much of anything like that a lot of
people are subsistence farmers so what
can pour subsistence farmers do about
global warming well what they can do is
called biochar it's
fancy name for making low-grade bad
charcoal when burying it so if you burn
agricultural waste in a low oxygen
environment you cover it up with some
some stuff so it can't did not too much
of it turns into carbon dioxide you make
charcoal and if you bury that it makes
the soil better and if you dig into the
Amazon jungle you'll see layers and
layers of soil that's been enriched by
biochar in the early civilizations there
knew about this that the jungle soil is
really infertile on its own but it's
improved that way by biochar and the
great thing about biochar is that it's
sequester's carbon for hundreds or
thousands of years and it harnesses the
power of plants to do carbon
sequestration it's hard to do carbon
sequestration at a large enough scale
but that's one way to do it what can
high-tech dreamers like fancy ideas do
well one thing they can do is get
serious about studying geoengineering
not just with pencil and paper
calculations but actually doing some
experiments so for example the science
fiction and writer and physicist Gregory
Benford down at UC Irvine he's done at
written a paper estimating that cooling
the Arctic would only cost 300 million
years three hundred million dollars a
year if we use these big military
refueling aircraft to spray sulfur
dioxide into this stratosphere of the
Arctic it makes cirrus clouds which
reflect light and that would be a good
thing to test out on a small scale it's
the kind of thing that you could you
could test a little patch of air for a
while and see what happens there will of
course be unexpected side effects that's
why we can't jump into doing anything
like this without running a big risk
it's possible that anything we do along
these lines runs a big risk but you have
to also realize that doing the not
solving the
global warming problem runs a big risk
so it's a matter of weighing risks and
what I'm worried about is that the
people will think the geoengineering is
a terrible idea and not even think about
it until global warming become such a
bad problem that people become desperate
and are willing to grasp at straws and
just try anything and then if we haven't
studied geoengineering we'll find
ourselves trouble so I think studying it
at the very least is a great idea and
finally well what can you and I do well
some of you actually are high-tech
dreamers so I you should you already I
already gave you guys some suggestions
but what can a poor little old
mathematician like me do well one thing
I can do is fly less wood which is well
in fact what I'm doing right now not
flying over there instead parking
through this robot so for the average
person of our income bracket the easiest
way to take a big chunk off of our
carbon emissions it's to take one less
long flight on fewer long flight so one
round-trip flight from Singapore to San
Francisco the flight that I didn't take
burns 0.9 tons of carbon so that's
seventy percent of an average humans
yearly amount of carbon right there in
one in 14 or twenty percent of the
average American since Americans that
love to burn carbon in large amounts so
what this means is that by using
telepresence methods for example this
robot here we can save a lot of carbon
emissions of course this robot that i'm
using here is not at all optimized for
giving a conference talks and we didn't
even ran into a bit of jam and had some
trouble getting
definitely set up so this talk is a
little bit creaky more of a gimmick then
ax than what i really suggest the way
should be the future of conferences for
example but but it but this robot is
good for what it was designed to do
which is basically to have a someone at
a company continued to talk with people
at that company when that when they go
somewhere else it's better for
face-to-face conversation than these
kind of presentations that i'm giving
now and different kinds of robots could
be made that could and and of course
much easier technically easier things
like video conferencing can be done it
means we don't need to zip around the
planet so much to do our business okay
so that's that's why the robot so what
else can we do on the next slide here
the obvious thing that all of us can do
not just university profs like myself
but but really everyone can do is
educate educate in both senses educating
ourselves and then educating our friends
that's really in a sense a large part of
the problem you see right we don't have
enough people who even believe that
global warming is real we've got large
united states for some reason more than
any other country in the world we have
lots of people who think it's all of a
some gigantic hoax perpetrated by
scientists to take over the world or
something so we need clear thinking and
good understanding of the facts now more
than ever you see global warming is
perhaps the first problem that really
needs a global response because of its a
prisoner's dilemma equality that if just
some countries cut carbon emissions and
others burn burn more that that's not
going to going to cut it so we need a
global response so we need everybody to
understand and think about what's going
on and of course if you start reading on
the internet about climate change you'll
find a huge diversity of opinion
many of them not backed up by facts so
you really need to be very careful on
both sides of the debate in checking
what's going on and weighing the
evidence so it's uniquely educational
dilemma where you need to learn about
everything from atmospheric physics to
economics and so on so finally this is
the part of the talk where you would
normally expect someone to ask you for
money but I'm not asking you for money
but I'm running this project called the
azimuth project which is a bunch of
mathematicians scientists and engineers
who are trying to do various things to
uh to tackle this problem so we're
trying to study and collect first of all
various known plans of action like this
McKinsey report and the Picasso Colo
report and many others and and make them
a study them make them available all in
one place and compare them on the more
mathematical end because I mean teach at
the University and need to prove
theorems I'm studying with what I call
network theory the study of complex
systems made out of lots of interacting
parts that's that's just something
that's just generally good for all these
problems like ecological and climate
problems and climate cycles I just
happen to be fascinated by the ice ages
these days there's been a lot of work
done on that but the interesting thing
is that no one really knows exactly what
makes the ice ages work the way they do
there are slight changes in the Earth's
orbit which everyone seems to agree are
the causes but if you look at how this
causes the things the the effect seems
radically disproportionate to the cause
so there are must be a lot of amplifying
feedback mechanisms so there's also
something called stochastic residence
where randomness actually manages to
amplify amplify effects under certain
circumstances
so that's an interesting issue just if
you're a scientist and you like to do
interesting work but it's also important
because we're pushing the earth into a
new climate regime now and if we we
don't fully even understand what's been
going on with the ice ages it suggests
that there will be things that we don't
understand about what's going to start
happening now and so understanding ice
ages is at least somewhat helpful for
them okay and next on this next slide
here I list a bunch of things that the
azimuth project is studying or
describing on our wiki so the problem is
not so much developing new information
but collecting information making it
available making it sourced making it
reliable on a large variety of problems
one problem I didn't emphasize enough
was acidification the rise in the
acidity of the ocean due to the carbon
dioxide frozen carbon dioxide stays in
the atmosphere for a while then it goes
into the water and and and so there's a
the both the atmosphere and the ocean
are big reservoirs of carbon dioxide and
and for the water what it means is that
the mollusks coral reefs and so on are
beginning to have trouble surviving and
we'll start actually dissolving past a
certain point and and I'd mentioned this
just because attempts at the
geoengineering which cool the planet but
don't don't do anything else don't
tackle that problem so there is actually
an important extra side to carbon
dioxide besides of global warming ah so
finally you could ask will this work
actually stop global warming the stuff
we're doing on the azimuth project and
the answer is no it won't by itself of
course stop global warming the problem
is is vast and so we shouldn't have any
big ambitions about our illusions about
anyone effort do anything that much but
it's at least something to be
doing to help the problem and I think
you folks at Google are in a position to
do a lot of different things and do a
lot on more are in certain ways than we
are so oh here's a URL for this talk
which lets you click on on anything I
said and let you see see we'll see what
the evidence is for it because you
shouldn't trust what I'm saying blindly
just like for anyone else okay so thank
you for your patience us thanks for
listening to this funny robot talking to
you for an hour and you've got any
questions I'd be glad to try to answer
yes yeah they're they're ours I mean the
second one is much smaller than the than
the first one I forget the exact numbers
right now but but i but I I can't even
remember if pakala and suckle Oh listed
as a wedge in this official wedge but
there's stuff you can do there are
actually new forms of concrete that
people are testing that don't release
carbon dioxide as they as they cure and
Harden and so so yeah there's definitely
stuff that could be done there so that
as usual the question the problem is at
first that those new forms of concrete
cost more than the old forms and so you
need to you know get better at making it
cheaper Coke's people to use it and so
on but yes that's definitely something
that can be done yes claiming analysis
nuclear power saying that whatever you
spend on how you get better bang for
your buck
their claims I haven't so no I haven't
looked at that I mean the funny thing
about that is that probably efficiency
trumps all other measures in terms of
costs so so so that could be true but
still not the reason that nuclear power
is worse than other things but i'll have
to look at that just to see what what
exactly well exactly
really love salt look at that so thanks
but I really would love to see some some
some well that worked out plans for how
how much power were expecting people to
want you to use you can try to cut that
back by efficiency measures and then how
we could generate it by renewable means
to the other than nuclear for people who
want to avoid nuclear but but anyway
thanks yeah that'll be good to look at
anything else okeydoke thanks a lot for
for bearing with me here in this funny
form i'm actually much nicer and more
entertaining normally i just stick you
late i danced around i do all sorts of
great stuff but but anyway great thanks
very much and thank Trevor blackwell
here for helping make it possible and
also thank like stay for for doing a lot
of the work in setting this up ok I
could get us I will just stand here
since I can't really go anywhere and
i'll be glad are not really fast anyway
I won't try to like make my escape down
the hallways of Google although that
would be sort of amusing so if anyone
wants to come up and talk to me I'll be
glad to talk I guess you could maybe
have more of a nice conversation which
we get closer hey well let's give dr.
